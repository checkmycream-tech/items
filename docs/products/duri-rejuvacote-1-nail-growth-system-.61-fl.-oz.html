            <li>I have never had nails so beautiful and strong!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve found that the best way to use this is to clean your nails, removing oils, then use a buffing pad and buff horizontally to create microscopic ridges that help to keep the polish on longer.  </li>
            <li>I know it works great for most, but for some of us we have a reaction to something in this.</li>
            <li>I bought it at Amazon.com and am very pleased with the purchase and the timeliness of delivery.</li>

            <li>This stuff is just amazing.</li>
            <li>this product is amazing.</li>
            <li>this has been an amazing transformation for me.</li>
            <li>I cannot even explain how amazing this stuff is</li>
            <li>I have been using this since september 2014 and now my nails look amazing.</li>
            <li>This is truly an amazing product.</li>
            <li>I am blown away by how amazing my nails are now.</li>
            <li>I was thrilled to get it.  </li>
            <li>Now I can do my own manicures and save lots of money.  </li>
            <li>I had given up having nice nails again.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m able to let them grow at a good length as I want them to be.</li>
            <li>I have never had nice nails.  </li>
            <li>No matter how much I wanted my nails to stay perfect</li>
            <li>A couple of years ago I was lamenting that my nails were peeling and splitting and I could never have nice nails.  </li>
            <li>If I liked this odor, I would of stayed in solar nails.</li>
            <li>This product works to protect your nails from splitting and cracking if used as directed besides giving a nice shine to your nails.</li>
            <li>I often use it alone, without color, and it leaves a nice finished-looking shine.</li>
            <li>I have always liked this product and will continue to purchase it as long&lt;</li>
            <li>The brush also keeps its shape nicely and does not clump.</li>
            <li>Nice buy</li>
            <li>I would be happy to buy more for her :)</li>
            <li>Plus we own a plant nursery</li>
            <li>I have used Rejuvacote for 4 hyears and absolutely love it - keeps my nails in good shape.  </li>
            <li>Once you&#x27;re nails have had a change to kind of heal</li>
            <li>I apply it to my own nails nightly.  </li>
            <li>it looks good on its own (can be worn as a neutral nail polish), or as a repeated top coat to maintain a manicure.</li>
            <li>I had given up on ever having nice nails until a friend told me about Rejuvacote.  </li>
            <li>The product goes on nicely</li>
            <li>The price is excellent, the product really strengthens the fingernails.</li>
            <li>One friend said her stylist noticed how nice her nails were looking and asked what she was using.  </li>
            <li>This is the best product I have very used for strengthening  my nails.</li>
            <li>and I noticed how nice her nails looked</li>
            <li>grow nicely.  </li>
            <li>I am thrilled with this product.</li>
            <li>It is not as effective as I thought.  </li>
            <li>I was thrilled to find it on amazon.</li>
            <li>I love this product, they look just as good as when I wore shellac nails, but these are mine</li>
            <li>It also leaves a nice shiny coat.</li>
            <li>Good to use as and undercoat and top coat.</li>
            <li>I have never had nice nails.</li>
            <li>Never, ever in my 28 years on this Earth, have I had nice nails.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend and wonderful customer service!</li>
            <li>I am enjoying this product and since have bought my own gel kit from Amazon and will be doing all my own manicures from now on.</li>
            <li>Great price and was delivered quickly.</li>
            <li>It gives my nails a good shine and keeps them from splitting and breaking as easily.</li>
            <li>Your nails will become very strong to the point that you might even harm yourself if you&#x27;re not used to having them.</li>
            <li>right!!!</li>
            <li>so nice and healthy and all within 2 weeks</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s excellent for my soft nails.</li>
            <li>This is by FAR the best nail strengthener you can buy!!!  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 60+ years old and have beautiful nails again!!</li>
            <li>I am thrilled to finally be able to grow my nails again.  </li>
            <li>Very happy with it so far</li>
            <li>This is the best clear nail strengthener that exists on the market.</li>
            <li>so I never have to do gel or acrylic and rock my own :)</li>
            <li>I use this as a top coat and bottom coat along with a biotin supplement each day and I can&#x27;t believe how nice my nails are now.  </li>
            <li>Hadn&#x27;t seen much in terms of growth yet after two weeks of use, but found my fingertips in INCREDIBLE pain after applying two nights ago.</li>
            <li>It must be applied as a basecoat to be effective and it can be used as a top coat as well.</li>
            <li>Manicurists loved doing my manicures because my nails were always so long and perfect.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so happy right now that I now have this in my possession.  </li>
            <li>It is great, and arrived right away.</li>
            <li>They are longer than they have been in decades, and strong and resilient!  </li>
            <li>My nails have since stopped peeling and are so strong!</li>
            <li>LOVE LOVE LOVE!</li>
            <li>Makes my nails so strong!</li>
            <li>Perfect just to leave clear or as a top coat.</li>
            <li>You put a coat on once a day for 7 day and then take it off, clean your nails really good and start over.</li>
            <li>My nails are very strong and healthy from using this product.</li>
            <li>First time trying this product and already I have seen great results.  </li>
            <li>Great product and fast shipping!</li>
            <li>This stuff has helped my nails tremendously!!  </li>
            <li>Great quality, very little smell, a best of all, gets the job</li>
            <li>I agree with others, it dries quickly and will also serve as a good top coat.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend Rejuvacote for beautiful nails.</li>
            <li>My friends LOVE this...</li>
            <li>I gave it to my friend, who is enjoying it.</li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t say it&#x27;s any better than Sally Hansen&#x27;s nail growth system though</li>
            <li>Truly a fantastic product!  </li>
            <li>i just reordered 2 more bottles.  </li>
            <li>My fiancee and her mother use it and just love the results.</li>
            <li>I tried many others with no luck - which is why I&#x27;m now on my 4th bottle.</li>
            <li>You can&#x27;t find a better price than Amazon since most salons charge about $14.</li>
            <li>I have been using this product for many years</li>
            <li>I also have never paid more than $8.00 per bottle.</li>
            <li>I work with horses on a daily basis and my nails still look awesome.</li>
            <li>it starts to peel after a day i had to apply more then one coat....</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s definitely the best product out there.</li>
            <li>Love the product.  </li>
            <li>I went to the nail salon to get some nail polish, and when I asked for a top coat, she gave me this.</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had acrylic nails for many years.  </li>
            <li>anyone knows of a product that works better then this, PLEASE let me know.</li>
            <li>I will give it more time.</li>
            <li>My wife and many of her friends swear by this product</li>
            <li>I saw no results and it didn&#x27;t go on as smooth as I liked.</li>
            <li>I have tried so many products through the years and never ever worked, so although I was hesitate to believe, I still bought it.</li>
            <li>But make sure that you follow the instructions, and use it every day and after 7 days, remove with nail polish remover and re apply to start the 7 days process again.</li>
            <li>The best local retail price I&#x27;ve found is $10, but often it is $14.95.</li>
            <li>I love this product and have been using it for years.  </li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>I love this polish.</li>
            <li>After I got it I put more than 2 coats on it</li>
            <li>try this. :)</li>
            <li>LOVE LOVE LOVE this nail polish.</li>
            <li>I love this product.  </li>
            <li>I have never been able to grow my nails...</li>
            <li>It helps, but it isn&#x27;t magic.</li>
            <li>It helps my nails stay healthy and holds the polish on.  </li>
            <li>so in 2 weeks i&#x27;ll see the progress and hopefully give it more stars</li>
            <li>Helped OK, I was expecting more</li>
            <li>and also use as a top coat.  </li>

            <li>then was fine.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m fine with it, its been a couple months since I started using it</li>
            <li>I really didn&#x27;t see much point in permanently breaking my habit since I&#x27;d never have beautiful nails anyways.  </li>
            <li>It works fine under layers of nail polish too.</li>
            <li>Not to mention my manicurist (even though she is really sweet) talks too much and takes up a good portion of my day doing my nails.  </li>
            <li>and while I have not seen the harden properties yet, I LOVE how quickly it dries/</li>
            <li>This product shipped quickly and I have enjoyed using it.  </li>

            <li>I do my own nails and when I use this product my nails grow fast and strong.</li>
            <li>Now after 4 months, they have been transformed into strong, beautiful nails which I have to file to keep from growing too long!  </li>
            <li>and my nails were beautiful; strong and long!</li>
            <li>I am very pleased with this product and would highly recommend it to anyone.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t bitten my nails in 2 months, which is a HUGE accomplishment for me.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Huge fan of Rejuvacote.</li>
            <li>You must follow the process as stated and you will see huge improvement in growth and nail quality.</li>
            <li>and this product makes a huge difference.</li>
            <li>The disclaimer on the box is 100% accurate.</li>
            <li>but I didn&#x27;t have any, fortunately.</li>
            <li>I have free edge now when I use to struggle to stop bitting my nails.</li>
            <li>work great after ten days</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a fantastic product that I have passed on to friends.  </li>
            <li>Fantastic strength without the damaging filing and chemicals.</li>
            <li>Wish the formaldehyde free one would be available at this price.</li>
            <li>After reading reviews and seeing how cheap it was I took a leap of faith and ended up falling into a bottomless pit.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s available at online.</li>
            <li>Per WebMD: \\&quot;Elle, a celebrity manicurist who writes a blog for Barielle Cosmetics, suggests her clients use polish that is free of formaldehyde, toluene, and dibutyl</li>
            <li>Her nails looked amazing and mine, not so much.  </li>
            <li>So basically I have been trying this for free.</li>
            <li>I was purchasing it locally for more than it cost on line, so am delighted about that.</li>
            <li>After just two weeks, my nails are perfect and my manicures last much longer.  </li>
            <li>So far, so good.</li>
            <li>And, using Duri Rejuvacote as the directions indicate - my nails are beautiful, long and strong!!!&lt;br /&gt;Love</li>
            <li>I honestly can&#x27;t believe how great they look, and I&#x27;m mot even using it everyday now.  </li>
            <li>The splitting and cracking had stopped and I was on my way to long beautiful nails.</li>
            <li>i&#x27;m on week 3 of using this polish and so far so good.</li>
            <li>Some days, I would put as many as 3 coats on and it would peel right off.  </li>
            <li>My nails have grown so much, no need for tips anymore!!!</li>
            <li>really works!!!</li>
            <li>highly recommend this product!!!!</li>
            <li>I recommend this product absolutely!!!</li>
            <li>Within a short time I am able to file away the damage and my own nails are strong again.  </li>
            <li>It is easy to apply and dries quickly.  </li>
            <li>goes on easily, dries quickly.</li>
            <li>I would highly reccommend this product to anyone who has a nail type like my own, and I do plan on introducing this product to friends when given the chance.  </li>
            <li>My nails are long and strong, love love love it.</li>
            <li>Well worth the price!  </li>
            <li>Mom uses it and says its great to help keep long fingernails from splitting, chipping, breaking, etc.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d get excited if they grew a cm</li>
            <li>I did notice a change in stregnth and growth within a month but dont get overly excited and stop using it</li>
            <li>It was $12 (so buy it here!), but it was worth it!</li>
            <li>I have been using this product for about 2 months, and there is a significant difference in my nails.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Please let me know if anyone has any more info on this as i would love to continue using this product and get the great results everyone else is raving about, but of course without any negative side effects!!&lt;br</li>
            <li>But I think it&#x27;s worth it!</li>
            <li>With this product my nails are healthy looking and much stronger!</li>
            <li>I originally purchased it hoping to speed up the nail growth for a torn nail.</li>
            <li>This product has made a significant difference.</li>
            <li>But as usual Amazon CS was awesome and refunded my money.</li>
            <li>My nails have always been fast to grow, but they were always so incredibly brittle and fragile.</li>
            <li>Let me state right off the top that this product really does work!!</li>
            <li>My nails are so gorgeous, strong, and long that I will never bite them again.  </li>
            <li>which kinda makes my nails not as strong but overall I&#x27;ve been very pleased with this product</li>
            <li>The Rejuvacote bottles arrived in just a couple of days wrapped tight and were an incredible price that I had to purchase two.</li>
            <li>I am hoping that in another month this product will have helped me get back to the strong and healthy nails I have had for most of my life.</li>
            <li>I love this product and will certainly buy it again.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been a nail-biter almost all of my life, but every once in a while I would force myself into quitting for special occassions- like Senior prom-</li>
            <li>I have tried all the products out there including Nail Envy, Nailtiques, special vitamins, gelatin, and nothing</li>
            <li>She was right!</li>
            <li>She was right!  </li>
            <li>I now have absolutely FLAWLESS nails - they don&#x27;t split at the ends, they&#x27;re perfectly smooth, really strong, and I&#x27;ve never seen them this long in my entire life.</li>
            <li>I even tried applying it right after I used nail polish remover to ensure a smooth, clean nail surface.  </li>
            <li>Wow, the growth is amazing.</li>
            <li>I can go back to painting my nails and them looking good.</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t really expecting these to save my nails or anything, I just wanted to see if there was something better than the Sally Hansen stuff I&#x27;ve been getting from the drugstore.</li>
            <li>It really helps -- not 100% but more than anything else I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li>But if my nails are intact and in overall good condition I don&#x27;t feel a thing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It gives my nails a nice clear finish where I don&#x27;t feel like I need to wear nail polish.</li>
            <li>Love this polish -- really works to make nails stronger immediately.</li>
            <li>I bit my nails growing up and have worn gels and acrylics for many years although my nails are not thin now.  </li>
            <li>so I cannot comment too much on it, but I did purchase this item to see if it would work better</li>
            <li>My nails are starting to look good.</li>
            <li>In the end i learned my lesson IF ITS TRIED AND TRUE dont try to find replacements.</li>
            <li>Also, I would recommend applying  one coat every day, and after 7 days, remove the clear coat from all nails and apply some kind of moisturizer a.k.a. oil to your nails.</li>
            <li>I have peely and brittle nails - this product really helps my nails look healthy and grow longer.  </li>
            <li>I love this product and arrived fast.</li>
            <li>you want to have your own nails without any costly, frequent nail shop visits</li>
            <li>This product really helped them to look better.  </li>
            <li>It makes your nails strong and they grow very fast.</li>
            <li>This has made my nails strong and does make them grow very fast.  </li>
            <li>My nails have never been better and I&#x27;ve tried EVERYTHING Super fast shipping.</li>
            <li>I love that it dries super fast</li>
            <li>So easy to use and effective in a short time.</li>
            <li>but now i have strong pretty nails</li>
            <li>I love the fact that I can go get a pretty french manicure with my own nails rather than putting on nail damaging acrylic nails.</li>
            <li>I faithfully apply the treatment every day and clean my nails and start fresh again every 7-10 days.  </li>
            <li>First time i wore it everything was fine.</li>
            <li>The Rejuvacote arrived so quickly and I have been using it ever since.</li>
            <li>I find that I feel the tingle mostly when I place the product on top of a nail that&#x27;s been filed, scratch, or damaged in in such a way.  </li>
            <li>, I just slather on a layer before going to work, it dries quickly, and my nails are protected when I&#x27;m washing my hands a million times in 12 hours.</li>
            <li>Peeling, breaking at the quick.</li>
            <li>I have searched far and wide for the perfect nail strengthener</li>
            <li>i see a tremendous difference in my nails</li>
            <li>After a week or so of using as directed, I have decent looking nails :)</li>
            <li>Peeled off quickly, but then again so does nail polish on my nails.</li>
            <li>Both she and her clients love this product and so for them, I have to rate it highly.</li>
            <li>OK, i just bought Duri Rejuvacote today at Harmon&#x27;s for $9.99 after a friend highly recommended it, and swore that her nails grew faster and stronger while using it.  </li>
            <li>Many thanks to the customer reviews positive comments and recommendations on this product!  </li>
            <li>I have been using this product for several months and am very pleased with the results.  </li>
            <li>Countless manicurists tried their various products and trade secrets to make my nails healthy and attractive, until one mentioned Rejuvacote.</li>
            <li>After using this for just a few weeks my nails were 100% stronger and beautiful.  </li>
            <li>File them, soak the tips in warm water with a squirt of soap, clean under the nails, use cuticle remover and an orange stick to push back the cuticles.</li>
            <li>This product really does work, it makes your nails super strong.</li>
            <li>The product goes on easily and dries super fast.  </li>
            <li>I either use it as a top coat after getting a manicure or a base and top coat when doing my own nails and it works great.</li>
            <li>it is a great product and my wife and friends have used it previously.</li>
            <li>I use this daily...takes less than a minute to apply and am happy to report longer, stronger nails.</li>
            <li>As I got older, they began to get even more brittle and thin and the best \\&quot;over the counter\\&quot; treatments didn&#x27;t help.  </li>
            <li>, makes my nails strong and grows very well.</li>
            <li>My nails grew so fast and got strong.</li>
            <li>My nails were very flimsy and would break easily but not anymore.</li>
            <li>it works well when applied every single day, but peels off a lot in between applications and if you forget a day, it almost doesn&#x27;t seem to do any good at all.  </li>
            <li>I also am giving a bottle to several friends for XMAS and have suggeted this to many of my co-workers!~</li>
            <li>This stuff really works!!</li>
            <li>It really works!!  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Although, when attaining length, my nail eventually cracks on the sides (i have weak nails and now take biotin), but all in all still awesome.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using it for several years and was able to recover my nails!</li>
            <li>and it works even the first time you use it!</li>
            <li>I guess the product would work if it actually stayed on my nails, but no matter how many coats I used, it chipped within hours!</li>
            <li>I use it at night while I am watching TV before bed, dries quickly and goes on clear :)</li>
            <li>If you are looking to just use it to keep your nails strong, the box suggests applying a coat daily and then alternating days as needed when your nails get better.</li>
            <li>The &amp;#34;pinkish&amp;#34; tint is very, very light in fact, it is almost clear.</li>
            <li>Its hard to find, great price and received quickly!</li>
            <li>They are strong and healthy and look really nice – I&#x27;ve even washed the car and washed a lot of dishes by hand lately</li>
            <li>but it was worth the wait.</li>
            <li>I use this with Perfect Formula pink gel coat for extra whitening power.  </li>
            <li>A nice big bottle for nail polish.</li>
            <li>I would have given this product five stars but the polish chips off a lot, especially if you wash your hands frequently like I do for my job, but otherwise a great product.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m on my 4th bottle - and it&#x27;s rare that I rebuy something.  </li>
            <li>and I swear I have found the newest secret to grow nautural beautiful nails!</li>
            <li>Yes, maintaining them is a daily thing, but if you want nice nails then that&#x27;s just something you have to get used to.</li>
            <li>When I took off the acrylic for good, to allow my real nails to breath and hopefully strengthen, they were very fragile and would literally fall away like sand when filed.  </li>
            <li>People have actually noticed and have told me how nice they look.</li>
            <li>This vendor is selling fresh merchandise.  </li>
            <li>lasting cause is very liquid (not as quimica alemana which is good</li>
            <li>Something about that seems to make my fingertips more sensitive.  </li>
            <li>I had been using acrylic nails and finally decided to take them off and try to grow my own</li>
            <li>I have natural nails and use this as a top coat and the polish does not crack.</li>
            <li>Also, keeps my polish looking fresh for about a week.</li>
            <li>they rarely chip or break.</li>
            <li>I am a professional hand model and love this product.  </li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t say enough nice things about this product.  </li>
            <li>I think perhaps some people are more sensitive.</li>
            <li>every day - well worth the price</li>
            <li>I can not buy locally -came very quickly-well packed and good price.</li>
            <li>, don&#x27;t trim my cuticles too far before using....  :)</li>
            <li>I was trying to grow my nails on my own and using generic nail growth products.</li>
            <li>I am addicted, this product is amazing!!!!</li>
            <li>, my nails have never looked better and I am 77 years old</li>
            <li>she is using it regularly and thrilled with it.  </li>
            <li>is so fun.  </li>
            <li>I finally have the healthy beautiful nails that I used to envy on other girls!</li>
            <li>This product is great if you need a top coat for plain nails or over colored polish but as far as anything else, I probably would not recommend it.</li>
            <li>My nails are long, healthy, and strong.  </li>
            <li>It does not make my nails break and it grows it pretty quick.</li>
            <li>It came in the mail pretty quickly</li>
            <li>Although I get lazy sometimes in terms of using it on a regular, it is absolutely the best product for healthy nails.  </li>
            <li>I was surprised by how quickly my nails became strong</li>
            <li>I  put Duri  on right after taking acrylics off with no problems.</li>
            <li>right?</li>
            <li>Shipped right away.</li>
            <li>Got results right away.</li>
            <li>After wearing this product for one day the polish is peeling right off.  </li>
            <li>However, if you decide to put your hands in any kinda of water, it will peel right off your nails.</li>
            <li>Tho&#x27; my nails are not long, strong and luxurious yet, they are not painfully tearing below the quick like before.</li>
            <li>I HAVE USED THIS PRODUCT IN THE PAST WITH GREAT SUCCESS.</li>
            <li>When I was attentive and kept polish on them, I could keep them looking decent.  </li>
            <li>I am meticulous when it comes to my polish chipping or peeling- and with Duri I have been able to leave the same color on for a full week without it chipping or peeling off!!!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>This product keep my nails strong and&lt;br /&gt;is a wonderful base and top</li>
            <li>and I would definitely recommend it to any woman with nails that aren&#x27;t very strong.</li>
            <li>Better than a regular clear coat for sure.</li>
            <li>I originally started using it because I didn&#x27;t want to continue having acrylic nails and wanted to get back to my own natural nails.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll be certain to groom my cuticles a day or so BEFORE re-applying Rejuvacote!  </li>
            <li>As my nails grow out and it&#x27;s time to add more, I remove the polish and repeat the process above with two fresh coats.  </li>
            <li>Then I realized that the reason it&#x27;s easier to bite is because my nails were so soft and easy to nibble on -</li>
            <li>I applied one coat , it dries super fast.</li>
            <li>I purchased it on a whim after reading the excellent reviews because I was desperate to get my nails back to looking/feeling strong and healthy.</li>
            <li>Dries super fast.</li>
            <li>My nails were soft and broke easily.</li>
            <li>This is one of the best products that does actually strengthen nails from the first few uses.</li>
            <li>I use it daily and all 10 nails are long and beautiful for the first time ever.</li>
            <li>/&gt;After just weeks of using it according to the instructions, my nails have grown out as strong as they were before I first went to Nursing school, and the frequent hand-washings that started then.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>they have always been soft and bent easy, this really makes a difference!</li>
            <li>However, it is very fast drying</li>
            <li>I like it very much and use it all the time.  </li>
            <li>I also have gotten all my friends using it and they like it very much.</li>
            <li>An added bonus is the price, it&#x27;s very reasonable.  </li>
            <li>My nails are long and very strong.  </li>
            <li>I have very weak, brittle nails that chip, break and peel even under the best cicumstances.</li>
            <li>My nails look so great now that I hardly need to use nail polish.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll every use any other nail product again as this one not only works but dries quickly and looks great.</li>
            <li>I recently purchased 3 more bottles of Rejuvacote because it truly does stengthen nails.</li>
            <li>I am on my second bottle and love this stuff.</li>
            <li>they woudlnt grow so i would just bite at them and start the whole routine again!</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m sure it coats it and seals it because I had prior peeling on my nails and after about a couple of weeks</li>
            <li>Evidently, it will take me many years to get them back where they need to be.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have used it exactly the way the directions were written on package....</li>
            <li>The first time I used it I thought it didn&#x27;t work</li>
            <li>My nails have really improved!</li>
            <li>At first you put a coat on every day and after a couple of weeks you will start seeing a difference.</li>
            <li>But sure enough it worked.  </li>
            <li>They would still split at first but they would grow - then they stopped splitting and now they are back to the healthy state they used to be</li>
            <li>The best product that I brought that work for me and my nails never been this beauitfull in my life I use to wear fake nail at all time&#x27;s now</li>
            <li>and I will be ordering much more in the future</li>
            <li>I even had someone get it for me when I was hospitalized suddenly and wasn&#x27;t able to take it with me.</li>
            <li>I really recommend this product to anyone!</li>
            <li>After paying quite a bit of money for my first two bottles I decided to try amazon.  </li>
            <li>I just applied my first coat onto my nails about an hour ago and was reading the ingredients and saw that it contains Formaldehyde resin - which if i am correct can be</li>
            <li>This is not the first time I have used this product.....&#x27;started in 2010.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been a nail biter all my life and an avid acrylic nail wearer.</li>
            <li>and I am very hsppy with the results!</li>
            <li>Dries fast, and doesn&#x27;t peel off!  </li>
            <li>I first heard this product on instagram.</li>
            <li>It actually really works!</li>
            <li>;)</li>
            <li>My regular hardener from the department store worked much better.</li>
            <li>When used as directed, this really works!</li>
            <li>I purchased it and it really works well!  </li>
            <li>This does help though, if you&#x27;re willing to treat it like birth control pills and use it every day.</li>
            <li>When I first got it I just fallowed the instructions to the T.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping!</li>
            <li>I rarely got tips, too much upkeep and maintenance.  </li>
            <li>I am getting ready to purchase my 6th bottle!</li>
            <li>When I had my first manicure (without polish) after 6 weeks, she felt she could see a difference in my nails.  </li>
            <li>For the first month or so I applied this product about 2-3 times a week</li>
            <li>, I also invested in Miracote top coat by the same company.</li>
            <li>Well first I should say that I bought this stuff and when it got to my house the bottle had been opened and all the polish spilled out into the box.</li>
            <li>I use two coats under my nail color and my nails seem to be in much better shape now after the last 4 or five months.</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>For the first time ever, my nails are growing and I don&#x27;t have to worry about them peeling.</li>
            <li>It is very slightly pink tinted and provides a nice sheen.  </li>
            <li>At first I thought it wouldn&#x27;t work</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m sure a generic Argan Oil would suffice.</li>
            <li>I really want to use it the way you are supposed to, and check out my results then!</li>
            <li>First, I couldn&#x27;t keep it on.  </li>
            <li>My own nails got harder and i can grow them.</li>
            <li>/&gt; Be aware; The product contains traces of celluloid.</li>
            <li>I love having longer fingernails – so I did some research and this came back as the highest rated.</li>
            <li>- YOU CAN&#x27;T GO WRONG, THIS POLISH IS WONDERFUL!!</li>
            <li>This product really works!</li>
            <li>Thanks Rejuvacote!</li>
            <li>I first tried this product in college when a friend gave it to me from her mom&#x27;s salon.</li>
            <li>By doing this I was able to actually leave it on my nails.</li>
            <li>That just goes to prove that it&#x27;s the many layers that keep the nails from breaking and not that it&#x27;s actually doing something to nourish the nails so that NAILS themselves become stronger.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>The first bottle I bought worked in 3 weeks.</li>
            <li>I have been using this polish daily and my nail are looking better.</li>
            <li>It also makes your nail polish stay on much longer!</li>
            <li>I have battled peeling nails for years (which weakens my nails over time) and this is the first product I&#x27;ve used that I haven&#x27;t had that issue with at all.  </li>
            <li>it really works!</li>
            <li>The ridges in my mom&#x27;s nails improved, and my nails started growing and feel much stronger!</li>
            <li>, I have tried my whole life to find a product that delivers and this one does it for me!</li>
            <li>Love it, I  clipped my nails short and in a week my nails are growing out and thicker.</li>
            <li>But I will definitely be ordering more.</li>
            <li>Just going to give it to my mother since she has pretty nails and does them all the time.</li>
            <li>or they grow so long and strong that I can not do my job!</li>
            <li>Luckily I was able to purchase it on Amazon after the beauty store in my community closed</li>
            <li>used this when my nails were really damaged on my right hand.</li>
            <li>and I have to say after a few close calls of nearly breaking my nail I can say this was great</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s nice and thick (but not globby) and comes on smooth.</li>
            <li>days, I remove the product and let my nails be bare for a few days, and they&#x27;re still beautiful.  </li>
            <li>After about a month of using the Rejuvacote, my nails became much much stronger and were able to actually grow.</li>
            <li>The first week, I used it as a plain clear coat, with nothing on top, and it was fine, although it did chip and peel rather quickly.</li>
            <li>It doen&#x27;t make your nails grow like crazy but makes them beautiful and strong.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s just a cheap nailpolish which starts chipping off within 1 day (even when put on clean dry nails as the directions say!).</li>
            <li>A beautician recommended Duri Rejuvacote after I mentioned that I have never been able to have long nails because they either split or break.</li>
            <li>This is the first nail strenghener I have ever bought that really works</li>
            <li>I hope it works I love to have my nails long and manicured.</li>
            <li>I had pretty much given up on it, until my dear friend raved about Rejuvacote.  </li>
            <li>but they are getting pretty lengthy and its thanks to this product which has made them durable even when submerged under water for extended periods of time.  </li>
            <li>I have NEVER been able to grow long nails.  </li>
            <li>The first week I didn&#x27;t notice much of a difference.  </li>
            <li>They&#x27;ll grow out just enough for me to really feel good about them, then the sides will peel off and I&#x27;m back to square one.  </li>
            <li>For the first 2 weeks, I couldn&#x27;t see much improvement and my nails continued to be fragile and would split easily.  </li>
            <li>Now the only thing that I didnt like is that it starts to peel easily.</li>
            <li>This is to make sure your nails don&#x27;t become too dry.</li>
            <li>Nails definitely improve using this and stay strong.</li>
            <li>When your nails are strong and grown out, you CANNOT stop using this or they will revert back to what they were..</li>
            <li>actually had nails that were strong and not peeling and were growing!&lt;br /&gt;Now</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t recommend this stuff enough if you are wanting nails that are strong and</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll be certain to groom my cuticles a day or so BEFORE re-applying Rejuvacote!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>That should keep the stuff from peeling in large sheets.</li>
            <li>I tell people about it, give it as gifts, and CANNOT live without it!!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s necessary to remove it every week or so because it starts to crackle, but it has really helped my nails get strong again.</li>
            <li>pair this with the Seche Vite fast dry top coat when I do my manicures</li>
            <li>If you use regularly you will see results quickly!</li>
            <li>I decided to buy Rejuvacote off Amazon because all of the reviews looked pretty decent.</li>
            <li>I tried to grow them on my own, as soon as they would grow a little they would split and tear off.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been blessed with very strong long nails since I was 15 years old.  </li>
            <li>After taking off artificial nails many times and coming back to them because I could not grow nice nails, I tried it again, using Rejuvacote, and, now, 1 month after, I can honestly say that my nails are hard and are growing nicely.</li>
            <li>After using this product, after only two weeks I noticed a huge difference.  </li>
            <li>I use a coat on clean dry nails and weekly I remove it and put on a fresh coat.</li>
            <li>This stuff really makes your nails grow</li>
            <li>keep using it as much as you can</li>
            <li>I really recommend it.</li>
            <li>This product REALLY works on strengthening your nails.</li>
            <li>My nails are so much stronger with this on</li>
            <li>and it dries fast.</li>
            <li>About 5 min after applying, my nail beds began to burn with intense discomfort.</li>
            <li>and I needed it FAST.</li>
            <li>The shipping of this product was fast.</li>
            <li>nails are much stronger now.</li>
            <li>Cannot believe how much my nails grow when using this stuff.</li>
            <li>Used this product for a while and found it to really work</li>
            <li>Really strengthens the nail but should be used every day or night.</li>
            <li>Thanks for your promptness in filling my order.</li>
            <li>but it really works.</li>
            <li>Love this stuff but you need to be careful who you buy it from.  </li>
            <li>fast on nails</li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;Couldn&#x27;t be wear alone because it peels fast</li>
            <li>It really helped my nails grow and not peel.</li>

            <li>thank you for making something that really works</li>
            <li>and I see real improvement.  </li>
            <li>, I was in so much pain on my nails and finger tips</li>
            <li>(touch up the very tip of the nails).</li>
            <li>Fast shipping started trying it yesterday</li>
            <li>Yes, if you have a problem with torn cuticles like me, it&#x27;s going to burn like hell, but it really does work.</li>
            <li>Even if it doesn&#x27;t do anything for nails I would rebuy just on the fast drying aspect alone.</li>
            <li>It really makes my manicure stay</li>

            <li>By the time I was ready to leave the house in the morning, it was already peeling and chipping off.  </li>
            <li>Rejuvacoat really works.</li>
            <li>Probably because there is formaldehyde in it, haha.</li>
            <li>I looooove this polish so much.</li>
            <li>Atter three weeks on intense usage and after a month plus of deaming with damaged nails after a week of acrylica</li>

            <li>It really keeps my nails growing</li>
            <li>and sometimes it doesn&#x27;t seem to help much.</li>
            <li>I can really tell a difference in my nails.  </li>
            <li>that are givne a chance to really grow.</li>
            <li>Really strengthens nails.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend this for anyone!</li>
            <li>My nails aren&#x27;t growing as fast as I would like them too, however, they are a lot stronger.  </li>
            <li>Unlike most clear nail polish built for strength, if used as both an undercoat and a final coat over colored polish, it both strengthens your nails and preserves the colored shine from chipping.  </li>
            <li>Wow!!!</li>
            <li>My nails are now all long and strong and have not broken (knock on wood) since mid-May.</li>
            <li>After a couple of weeks my nails are strong and as long as I want them to be.  </li>
            <li>My nails are long and strong after months of using acrylics.</li>
            <li>I had not idea how strong and long my nails would become.  </li>
            <li>I now have long strong nails.</li>
            <li>I cant believe how strong and long they are.</li>
            <li>, my nails are strong and long.</li>
            <li>i apply one coat of rejuvacote a day and my nails are strong and long</li>
            <li>But now my nails are very strong, as long as i consistently keep the product on my nails daily.</li>
            <li>I personally only like one coat of this on my nails because I found when I put the second coat on, it chipped very easily,</li>
            <li>I use it with regular nail polish, and while it doesn&#x27;t last as long as the gel, I am happy with my nail health.  </li>
            <li>It does seem to cause other polish placed on top to peal after a couple days or so</li>
            <li>Now I apply a top coat every other day.</li>
            <li>Great product and timeliness in delivery was also good; however, I was disappointed to find that the price recently increased.</li>
            <li>Plus, it could not be easier to use, and there are no negative side effects!</li>
            <li>But then after an application about three weeks in, like many of the other reviewers, I started to experience pain.</li>
            <li>tried many other nail strengthener products and none work like Duri Rejuvate Cote.  </li>
            <li>Glad I spent the money on this!</li>
            <li>When I followed the directions, my nails grew strong &amp; long!</li>
            <li>Now they are strong and long!</li>
            <li>I have been using this product for two months and my nails are strong and long!  </li>
            <li>My hands are in water constantly since I clean for living</li>
            <li>The only thing I liked about this was the fact that it dried quick.  </li>
            <li>is seriously a miracle worker and yes.. its almost $10 a bottle but its more than worth it!</li>
            <li>But, the next month my nails grew out longer than normal and looked pretty healthy with white tips at the ends.  </li>
            <li>I work a couple nights as a server and my nail polish used to chip from washing my hands so much, now my polish lasts a whole week and still looks new at the end.</li>
            <li>This is the first one that has worked; within 2 weeks of frequent use, my nails were stronger.  </li>
            <li>gives a nice shine so no more polish is needed</li>
            <li>For someone who has much keyboard use, you&#x27;ll find that this prevents the splits and chips that come from the normal wear and tear on nails.  </li>
            <li>finally my dream came true</li>
            <li>My nails would always break at the point where they were long, and finally I have been able to keep them long and strong.</li>
            <li>I picked up a few of these for my fiancee&#x27;s mom, who is a professional beautician and operates her own salon.</li>
            <li>And after 3 they were longer and vibrant.</li>
            <li>After many years of trying various products on my nails, I found the ultimate product!</li>
            <li>and I kept them super short.</li>
            <li>My favorite thing about this is that Duri is a wonderful base coat!  </li>
            <li>Formaldehyde is a main ingredient.</li>
            <li>As long as I don&#x27;t let them grow too long, my nails stay nice.</li>
            <li>and I am positive that it will grow given the improvements I have seen so far .</li>
            <li>I would strongly recommend purchasing it to anyone that has a difficult time with growing long, healthy strong nails.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend</li>
            <li>Highly recommended to anyone with problem nails.</li>

            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>HIGHLY recommended.</li>
            <li>For the first time in my life my nails actually got long and strong.</li>
            <li>but that&#x27;s a small price to pay for long strong healthy nails.</li>
            <li>started using rejuvacote a little over a month ago, and already my nails are longer, stronger and better looking than they have been in years.  </li>
            <li>Also, acrylic nails (which are basically applied with super glue to your own nail) can be extremely damaging and may peel/strip away natural nails when removed - sometimes down to the tender tissue underneath that the nail is protecting -</li>
            <li>It absolutely works to make nails retain their natural strength.</li>
            <li>I really like it so far.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve always had nubs, hence the acrylics but proud to say I no longer need to pay for or add fake nails.  </li>
            <li>My nails were longer and much stronger and the chipping almost completely stopped.</li>
            <li>After far too much $$ getting manicures my nail tech suggested Rejuvacote from Duri cosmetics.</li>
            <li>I switched to Sally Hanson&#x27;s green tea and olive growth and that showed me much better results.</li>
            <li>My friends that recommended love it and they have been using it for a few months and longer.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Im so glad she found this for about 2weeks of using this (one coat everyday for a week</li>
            <li>Your nails will grow at its normal speed as it has always grown.</li>
            <li>I decided to start painting again with rejuvacote, until my nails started breaking off, like normal.  </li>
            <li>For those reviews that said it burns, it probably isnt a good idea to put this polish on after acrylics since acrylics thin out your nails.</li>
            <li>They are long and beautiful and I&#x27;ve even had to file them down a couple of times because they got too long.  </li>
            <li>My nails normally are always very short because they peel and break right away.</li>
            <li>This product has given me such strong nails I have to cut them regularly</li>
            <li>I have never had such strong nails in my entire life.  </li>
            <li>I used to have very strong and healthy nails and was completely unprepared to handle the cracking, splitting, dry and weak nail situation.</li>
            <li>After using only a few times a week I had no reaction and stunning nail growth!</li>
            <li>They are long, smooth, thick and healthy.</li>
            <li>and the salesgirl said, \\&quot;Have you tried this new nail prduct?\\</li>
            <li>Just received my new bottle of Rejuvacote.  </li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t live without it.</li>
            <li>I ran out couldn&#x27;t find in any stores in New England.</li>
            <li>BEWARE TO THE NEW USERS COMING FROM ACRYLIC AND BITTEN NAILS.</li>
            <li>Each day you put a new coat on and after the 7th day you take it off and start again.</li>
            <li>With this I can live my Tomboy lifestyle and still have nails that look like a girl.</li>
            <li>day and add a new coat.</li>
            <li>My nails feel nice and solid when I apply a few coats.</li>
            <li>Although, the speed of the growth is not that much increased, but the overall coloring and healthiness of the nails are much improved.</li>
            <li>Two and a half weeks in and my nails are going strong.</li>
            <li>I did at one point and a couple of nails became very sensitive but that has cleared up.  </li>
            <li>and I am a very busy mom.</li>
            <li>My nails were breaking and very soft.</li>
            <li>After they did get so long, I did get some chips on the ends if my nails, but no splitting, and they were easily filed back to shape.</li>
            <li>My nails are long and strong and would advise that you give it a try for a couple of months if your nails are constantly breaking.</li>
            <li>Duri Rejuvacote is the ONLY thing that has helped me achieve long, strong and non peeling nails.&lt;br</li>
            <li>to address some other users problems, I&#x27;ve only ever had some mild stinging after using this product and to be honest, it was my fault for trimming my cuticles too far down and then applying it.  </li>
            <li>I tried so many other hardening nail products, but  after using Duri Rejuvacote for only a month I started to notice a difference.  </li>
            <li>Add a coat every day for the first couple of weeks, stripping it off and starting over once a week.  </li>
            <li>If you bite your nails or if they are brittle or soft, use Duri once a day and they will grow!  </li>
            <li>I recommend this to everyone who wants a protective coat on bare nails or over polish.</li>
            <li>So the first application I have to do two coats, then the following days one coat.</li>
            <li>much better results than I ordinarily get.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>My manicurist first introduced Duri Rejuvacote to me, but she charged almost double the price.</li>
            <li>She actually bought me my first bottle</li>
            <li>But good in general if you have weak nails.</li>
            <li>I first bought this at my local nail shop.</li>
            <li>Some of those work, initially, but once you start to slack off on application, you can kiss your pretty nails</li>
            <li>The first time I applied this I had a strange burning sensation in the last two fingers on each hand, however subsequent applications were fine.</li>
            <li>I had read some of the reviews about how this would peel easily and it discouraged me a little</li>
            <li>My nails did grow a little but then would split and easy break off.  </li>
            <li>-- I don&#x27;t want to mess up my nice, long nails!</li>
            <li>Every couple days I&#x27;ll put on a new coat, when the old one starts chipping off, and remove it once every two weeks or so.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m back with some positive remarks.</li>
            <li>have recommended it to friends who have had the same positive result.</li>
            <li>After months of dealing with weak nails that shred and peel off in layers, I tried this for 2 weeks and saw an amazing difference.</li>
            <li>Well the base coat was chipping by the end of the first day, and topping it off with a top coat just made it chip more.  </li>
            <li>When I&#x27;m wearing it by itself, people swear that I have a French manicure because it makes my nail tips super white.</li>
            <li>You will truly experience strong and natural nails after just a few weeks.</li>
            <li>I am a fairly young survivor, with a 1 1/2 year old son who&#x27;s energy and demands keep my life (and hands) very busy.</li>
            <li>My nails have never been so strong, and I&#x27;ve tried many nail strengthening products only to have them eventually fail me.  </li>
            <li>my nails are now so long so strong and grow so fast that I find myself having to file them down to keep them to the length that I like.</li>
            <li>Over the years, I have tried every single product on the market to have strong and long nails.</li>
            <li>This product was magical for me when I moved to an extreme climate and my nails were so dry they peeled and broke.</li>
            <li>huge waste of money and time every day.</li>
            <li>i suggest wearing it over clear nails.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I would recommend this product to anyone that wants their nails to look professionally done for a way smaller price tag.</li>
            <li>But this bottle does the same thing as gettin fake tips and you can be proud to show off your hands.  </li>
            <li>Nails are a lot clear and a lot stronger .</li>
            <li>The Duri Rejuvacote fixed them.</li>
            <li>Rejuvacote fixed my nails and in a month I had stronger and longer nails.  </li>
            <li>I swear ive never had my natural nails</li>
            <li>I actually developed nails beds which I never had.  </li>
            <li>This is a product I&#x27;ve used for a couple of years now, and it has worked wonders on my soft, hard-to-grow nails.  </li>
            <li>My nails have always been soft, breaking and splitting.[[ASIN:</li>
            <li>and I am amazed at my natural nails today.</li>
            <li>It does require that you use it frequently.</li>
            <li>my nails turned yellow, became very brittle and did not grow at all.</li>
            <li>there and my nails began to show it, they got soft again.</li>
            <li>I bought from another online vendor and the stuff was old and it did not work.  </li>
            <li>For the first time in my life I have long nails.</li>
            <li>Well, I was pleasantly surprised.  </li>
            <li>I wore acrylics for years because my natural nails were always splitting.  </li>
            <li>I have natural nails</li>
            <li>My wife swares by this product, and was nearly out, so I ordered two for her.</li>
            <li>Completely resurrected my &amp;#34;25-year acrylic addicted&amp;#34</li>
            <li>I am prone to frequent breaking and splitting.</li>
            <li>the sally hansen is much thinner and seems to do the same job</li>
            <li>It explains how the \\&quot;formaldehyde\\&quot; isn&#x27;t really the same product when used as it chemically changes.  </li>
            <li>My nails are soft, split, shred. . .  </li>
            <li>My nails have changed considerably</li>
            <li>I have been using the product for a month and have noticed a marked improvement in the nail growth.</li>
            <li>So far, it has helped strengthen my nails ...</li>
            <li>I have arthritis in my hands, so nails naturally don&#x27;t grow well.</li>
            <li>, this really help bring my nails back to life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and then my nails were so sensitive.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve already gotten compliments on my nails from ladies who thought I went to the salon and were amazed when I told them I did my nails myself and they&#x27;re my natural nails.</li>
            <li>Since 16, I would get acrylics and you can imagine the damage I&#x27;ve done to my natural nails for years.  </li>
            <li>so I can&#x27;t really tell if Rejuvacote is the only thing that&#x27;s stopping my nails from peeling.</li>
            <li>You HAVE TO let the damaged portion of your nails grow out COMPLETELY for this product to work (that is what I did).</li>
            <li>I found this product on Amazon, and I&#x27;d like to say thanks to everyone who reviewed rejuvacote, especially the nurses.</li>
            <li>and I have been for a long time, and I am constantly washing my hands, and because of that, I haven&#x27;t been able to grow my nails long in years.  </li>
            <li>Naturally it took time for the damaged nail to grow out but</li>
            <li>I had this on my nails for 3 days when they started to really hurt and turn blue.  </li>
            <li>Whenever I traveled to higher humidity locales my nails would grow long until I returned to my desert home.  </li>
            <li>It is cheaper for me to use it at home now that my income cannot afford for me to have my nails done professionally anymore.</li>
            <li>I intend to use Rejuvacote from now on and keep my fingernails natural.</li>
            <li>I would recommend this product to anyone wanting natural nails.  </li>
            <li>Not to mention the brown spots that developed under my nails.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never been able to grow long nails and to have them all long at the same time</li>
            <li>I find it protects my nails and gives it the look of a professional manicure.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this stuff for 2 weeks and WOW.</li>
            <li>Rejuvacote hardens my nails within a few days and keeps them healthy until the next application.</li>
            <li>This product was suggested by my dermatologist and gave me spectacular nails when they had been thin and peeling in layers for years.</li>
            <li>Though it took the Rejuvacote a long time to dry, the results were fantastic.</li>
            <li>My nails stopped splitting almost immediately and they&#x27;re becoming stronger, breaking lot less and actually starting to grow.</li>
            <li>am excited to keep using to see my nail grow just a little bit, which I have never had nails.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>/&gt;This was recommended to my by a popular nail polish blogger and it has seriously changed my nails!  </li>
            <li>it makes my nails healthier and stronger and my nails usually break easily.</li>
            <li>I noticed progress within the first few days, mainly because any nail that grew was new nail since I chew, so</li>
            <li>/&gt;SO: Not a good base coat, but an excellent top coat.</li>
            <li>I use this product faithfully, applying a fresh coat every day or every other day depending on my workload.  </li>
            <li>I have also used many other products to make my nails hard and pretty like all my friends had.</li>
            <li>/&gt;You can use polish, but now that the tips are so pretty and white I just use the Rejuvacote and it looks like I had a french tip</li>
            <li>My nails haven&#x27;t been long and healthy looking in quite a few years.  </li>
            <li>a manicure which used to last 2-3 days now goes 11 with dark colors, 13 with light colors.</li>
            <li>I always had very strong nails before acrylic and Couldn t believe how tissue paper thin they had become.</li>
            <li>After getting my nails long because of this amazing product i did experience cuts on my face [ because i wasn&#x27;t careful] and also marks on my palms due to my nails.</li>
            <li>Major mistake!</li>
            <li>Major mistake!</li>
            <li>We followed the directions on the bottle and after three days, both of us noticed a major improvement in our nails!</li>
            <li>This simply cannot be normal and makes one question the safety of Rejuvacote.</li>
            <li>I wear gloves when I wash dishes, but this stuff couldn&#x27;t even make it through a normal daily shower without peeling off.  </li>
            <li>It was only some stinging and didn&#x27;t last for more thatn a few minutes.  </li>
            <li>I have finally kicked the habit and was looking for something to help get my nails into shape to be able to withstand everyday life and not instantly break.</li>
            <li>Strong, long and a lot less ridges.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had peeling flaky nails as long as I can remember my nails are hard and are actually growing I&#x27;ve recommend this to so many of my friends!</li>
            <li>Seals nails and keeps them hard and strong</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the only thing that has strengthened my nails and it completely transforms weak nails into long strong ones!!</li>
            <li>As mentioned in other reviews, you must follow the directions and apply a quick coat daily.  </li>
            <li>Same reaction; about 5 min later intense burning began.</li>
            <li>I bought this product to re-store damage that I received when getting the gel nails at a Nail Spa, it was taken off incorrectly and was not soaked off completely, the place was packed so they did not have time to completely soak all of the polish off, which resulted in them having to get an electric file and get remaining polish off, the process weakened my nails and caused them to break constantly and chip and peel</li>
            <li>MY SECOND BOTTLE, WILL BUY MY THIRD BOTTLE REAL SOON.</li>
            <li>I mostly use it as a base and top coat now.</li>
            <li>They are strong, thick and no longer split.  </li>
            <li>When I stop using the product my nails will stay long strong and healthy for a little while aftwards, but eventually begin to break and split again, but with a few weeks of using rejuvacote, I am back to long grogeous nails again.  </li>
            <li>Can be hard to fine; buy online</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t add any other color to it, just that straight clear coat.  </li>
            <li>Prefer Magic Nails to this as a strengthening tool - however my nails were extremely damaged from having gel nails done a few times, and it does help.</li>
            <li>I have 4 nails that crack right down the middle and are as soft as tissue paper.</li>
            <li>You do have to be careful not to use too much.  </li>
            <li>Since I was younger my nails have been soft, bendable, they broke in layers, and I had a habit of biting them.</li>
            <li>The key is to apply frequently.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve recieved several compliments from friends &amp; complete strangers</li>
            <li>So I just use it bare.</li>
            <li>DURI Rejuvacote really makes by nails harder.  </li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t bare it</li>
            <li>I have to back up, my nails were always soft, breaking and peeling years ago</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had  acrylics for many years but tired of the maintenance.</li>
            <li>Nothing I&#x27;d ever tried before worked, but after reading the reviews I convinced myself that, for a few bucks, it was worth a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>apply a base coat of Duri, 2 coats color, and a top coat of Duri, and reapply top coat Duri about 3 days later.</li>
            <li>After 2 weeks of using this product as a base and top coat, my nails grew long and strong!</li>
            <li>My nails are strong and long, with no more peeling and breaking.</li>
            <li>I have super weak nails and this provided steady growth.</li>
            <li>But once my nails reached a certain size- especially if they were wet to any degree-</li>
            <li>For the first time in 46 years, I have nails that grow so long that they are actually too long</li>
            <li>And all the other remarks about how it really does improve your nails still</li>
            <li>I see some other review where the person has pain, but I am gathering that having years of acrylic tips, it must have damaged the nails so much that anything just painted on now without</li>
            <li>This product strengthens my nails so much that I can grow them to the point of actually having to trim them back because they are too long!  </li>
            <li>which causes the polish to last longer, I guess my nails were growing out soft prior to using this which cause the nail polish to break and peel off faster.  </li>
            <li>I have had thin nails that peel for my entire life and have never been able to grow my nails at all.  </li>
            <li>only downfall of this product is that when I put it as a base coat then put color on then put this product as the top coat it tends to chip really easily.</li>
            <li>Having grown nails all my life (wink) and having continuously colored, doused them with chemicals, painted on acrylics, gels, etc, my poor fingernails have taken a beating low these many years.</li>
            <li>I have tried many nail strengtheners in the past and I was always let down.</li>
            <li>first time in ages my nails haven&#x27;t split down the middle.</li>
            <li>When i first applied it, i did have a little burning sensation in my pinky</li>
            <li>When I first started using Rejuvacote, I had just stopped biting my nails, and they had grown out a little -</li>
            <li>I will never use another clear polish product as long as they keep making this stuff.</li>
            <li>I was really hopeful after reading the other reviews, but now I am just convinced that there is no hope for my nails - especially not this!</li>
            <li>So even when I was trimming my nails to the bare minimum height, they&#x27;d still chip off from the middle.</li>
            <li>I was turned on to this product by a fellow nurse who&#x27;s natural nails were long and strong.&lt;br</li>
            <li>i&#x27;ve been using a few months and for the first time in my life my nails are thicker and longer and can withstand wear and tear.  </li>
            <li>I regularly use Rejuvacote as my standard base coat under nail polish, but if my nails start to break, crack or peel usually due to my own abuse doing gardening or cleaning, I just begin applying an additional top coat daily as instructed.  </li>
            <li>this product and Duri Rejuvacote goes on my clean nails as a base coat and then over my nail polish as a top coat.  </li>
            <li>My hands are always saturated in cleaning products, alcohol, and citrus which is super hard on them</li>
            <li>this product came recommended after i redeemed a groupon for a mani pedi and was complaining about my normally strong nails, which have become weak and splitting recently.</li>
            <li>So far the only drawback is that if I use it as a base coat, the nail polish I put on top peels right off.</li>
            <li>I have been using this product and my nails are much stronger and thicker, the peeling is less.</li>
            <li>i bought this for my mom&#x27;s nails as she has thin nails that tear easily and are just all around unhealthy---even with taking supplements.  </li>
            <li>Its pretty thick and u can&#x27;t use after polish b/c if the polish chips and u want to do a spot touch up, you will see the difference from the old polish (applied 2days ago) and the touch up b/c</li>
            <li>Results are good, not as dramatic as I was expecting, especially after switching to using it a few times a week vs. daily.</li>
            <li>Rejuvacote is really good at repairing the nails and making them stronger, but it stained my nails a hot pink color when used as a base.</li>
            <li>This one will actually change splitting, thin, weak nails into strong smooth nails.</li>
            <li>After getting my nails done several times they become thin and break easily.</li>
            <li>Even when I clean or wash dishes...of course they get soft but once fully dry, they are hard again!</li>
            <li>Having weak, thin nails like I do, this is great stuff.</li>
            <li>I began nail vitamins and saw little real improvement.  </li>
            <li>I have very weak and peeling nails and after 2 months using it every day (almost) they had became lot better.</li>
            <li>It makes my nails super strong and they grow like crazy!</li>
            <li>My nails grow  fast and they no longer split and crack way down on the sides before the nail even grew out!  </li>
    </ol>

            <li> Let&#x27;s see if it is as good as it is supposed to be</li>
            <li> saw this product in Good Housekeeping Magazine.  </li>
            <li> really good for your nails.</li>
            <li> I started to use this product faithfully and my nails are gorgeous now.</li>
            <li> I buy it for my daughter too and my good friend.  </li>

            <li> Really good for keeping nails from breaking and chipping.  </li>
            <li> I have never had nails so beautiful and strong!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve found that the best way to use this is to clean your nails, removing oils, then use a buffing pad and buff horizontally to create microscopic ridges that help to keep the polish on longer.  </li>
            <li> I know it works great for most, but for some of us we have a reaction to something in this.</li>
            <li> I bought it at Amazon.com and am very pleased with the purchase and the timeliness of delivery.</li>
            <li> I have recommended it two many of my friends and they all are using it and think it is great.  </li>

            <li> this product is amazing.</li>
            <li> this has been an amazing transformation for me.</li>
            <li> I cannot even explain how amazing this stuff is</li>
            <li> I have been using this since september 2014 and now my nails look amazing.</li>
            <li> This is truly an amazing product.</li>
            <li> I am blown away by how amazing my nails are now.</li>
            <li> I was thrilled to get it.  </li>
            <li> Now I can do my own manicures and save lots of money.  </li>
            <li> I had given up having nice nails again.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m able to let them grow at a good length as I want them to be.</li>
            <li> I have never had nice nails.  </li>
            <li> No matter how much I wanted my nails to stay perfect</li>
            <li> A couple of years ago I was lamenting that my nails were peeling and splitting and I could never have nice nails.  </li>
            <li> If I liked this odor, I would of stayed in solar nails.</li>
            <li> This product works to protect your nails from splitting and cracking if used as directed besides giving a nice shine to your nails.</li>
            <li> I often use it alone, without color, and it leaves a nice finished-looking shine.</li>
            <li> I have always liked this product and will continue to purchase it as long&lt;</li>
            <li> The brush also keeps its shape nicely and does not clump.</li>
            <li> Nice buy</li>
            <li> I would be happy to buy more for her :)</li>
            <li> Plus we own a plant nursery</li>
            <li> I have used Rejuvacote for 4 hyears and absolutely love it - keeps my nails in good shape.  </li>
            <li> Once you&#x27;re nails have had a change to kind of heal</li>
            <li> I apply it to my own nails nightly.  </li>
            <li> it looks good on its own (can be worn as a neutral nail polish), or as a repeated top coat to maintain a manicure.</li>
            <li> I had given up on ever having nice nails until a friend told me about Rejuvacote.  </li>
            <li> The product goes on nicely</li>
            <li> The price is excellent, the product really strengthens the fingernails.</li>
            <li> One friend said her stylist noticed how nice her nails were looking and asked what she was using.  </li>
            <li> This is the best product I have very used for strengthening  my nails.</li>
            <li> and I noticed how nice her nails looked</li>
            <li> grow nicely.  </li>
            <li> I am thrilled with this product.</li>
            <li> It is not as effective as I thought.  </li>
            <li> I was thrilled to find it on amazon.</li>
            <li> I love this product, they look just as good as when I wore shellac nails, but these are mine</li>
            <li> It also leaves a nice shiny coat.</li>
            <li> Good to use as and undercoat and top coat.</li>
            <li> I have never had nice nails.</li>
            <li> Never, ever in my 28 years on this Earth, have I had nice nails.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend and wonderful customer service!</li>
            <li> I am enjoying this product and since have bought my own gel kit from Amazon and will be doing all my own manicures from now on.</li>
            <li> Great price and was delivered quickly.</li>
            <li> It gives my nails a good shine and keeps them from splitting and breaking as easily.</li>
            <li> Your nails will become very strong to the point that you might even harm yourself if you&#x27;re not used to having them.</li>
            <li> right!!!</li>
            <li> so nice and healthy and all within 2 weeks</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s excellent for my soft nails.</li>
            <li> This is by FAR the best nail strengthener you can buy!!!  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 60+ years old and have beautiful nails again!!</li>
            <li> I am thrilled to finally be able to grow my nails again.  </li>
            <li> Very happy with it so far</li>
            <li> This is the best clear nail strengthener that exists on the market.</li>
            <li> so I never have to do gel or acrylic and rock my own :)</li>
            <li> I use this as a top coat and bottom coat along with a biotin supplement each day and I can&#x27;t believe how nice my nails are now.  </li>
            <li> Hadn&#x27;t seen much in terms of growth yet after two weeks of use, but found my fingertips in INCREDIBLE pain after applying two nights ago.</li>
            <li> It must be applied as a basecoat to be effective and it can be used as a top coat as well.</li>
            <li> Manicurists loved doing my manicures because my nails were always so long and perfect.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so happy right now that I now have this in my possession.  </li>
            <li> It is great, and arrived right away.</li>
            <li> They are longer than they have been in decades, and strong and resilient!  </li>
            <li> My nails have since stopped peeling and are so strong!</li>
            <li> LOVE LOVE LOVE!</li>
            <li> Makes my nails so strong!</li>
            <li> Perfect just to leave clear or as a top coat.</li>
            <li> You put a coat on once a day for 7 day and then take it off, clean your nails really good and start over.</li>
            <li> My nails are very strong and healthy from using this product.</li>
            <li> First time trying this product and already I have seen great results.  </li>
            <li> Great product and fast shipping!</li>
            <li> This stuff has helped my nails tremendously!!  </li>
            <li> Great quality, very little smell, a best of all, gets the job</li>
            <li> I agree with others, it dries quickly and will also serve as a good top coat.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend Rejuvacote for beautiful nails.</li>
            <li> My friends LOVE this...</li>
            <li> I gave it to my friend, who is enjoying it.</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t say it&#x27;s any better than Sally Hansen&#x27;s nail growth system though</li>
            <li> Truly a fantastic product!  </li>
            <li> i just reordered 2 more bottles.  </li>
            <li> My fiancee and her mother use it and just love the results.</li>
            <li> I tried many others with no luck - which is why I&#x27;m now on my 4th bottle.</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t find a better price than Amazon since most salons charge about $14.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for many years</li>
            <li> I also have never paid more than $8.00 per bottle.</li>
            <li> I work with horses on a daily basis and my nails still look awesome.</li>
            <li> it starts to peel after a day i had to apply more then one coat....</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s definitely the best product out there.</li>
            <li> Love the product.  </li>
            <li> I went to the nail salon to get some nail polish, and when I asked for a top coat, she gave me this.</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had acrylic nails for many years.  </li>
            <li> anyone knows of a product that works better then this, PLEASE let me know.</li>
            <li> I will give it more time.</li>
            <li> My wife and many of her friends swear by this product</li>
            <li> I saw no results and it didn&#x27;t go on as smooth as I liked.</li>
            <li> I have tried so many products through the years and never ever worked, so although I was hesitate to believe, I still bought it.</li>
            <li> But make sure that you follow the instructions, and use it every day and after 7 days, remove with nail polish remover and re apply to start the 7 days process again.</li>
            <li> The best local retail price I&#x27;ve found is $10, but often it is $14.95.</li>
            <li> I love this product and have been using it for years.  </li>
            <li> I love this product.</li>
            <li> I love this polish.</li>
            <li> After I got it I put more than 2 coats on it</li>

            <li> Then use the Rejuvacote as a top coat, It makes your nails look shiny and extends the life of your polish while keeping your nails strong and healthy.</li>
            <li> Now, with this product, you need to put it on very clean and manicured nails to start out.</li>

            <li> And they are so strong and healthy now</li>
            <li> It does wonders for your nails and makes them so strong and healthy.</li>
            <li> They were breaking easily and just didn&#x27;t seem healthy.  </li>
            <li> Have been using this for years and my own nails are now long and beautiful.  </li>
            <li> About 1/3 of the way through the bottle, I had long, strong, gorgeous nails, just as the magazine ad had promised!!  </li>
            <li> The Rejuvacote leaves your nails really shiny and has a good strong top coat.</li>
            <li> Took me nearly 50 years to get great nails</li>
            <li> I enjoy showing them now more than I did about a month ago.</li>
            <li> At first, like so many others, I had some kind of reaction to it.</li>
            <li> After having been turned onto it by my nail salon, I&#x27;ve been using Rejuvacote for the last six months and have seen INCREDIBLE results.</li>
            <li> The product is good,  I really like it.</li>
            <li> None has ever worked as well as Duri, so much so that I tell everyone who compliments me on my gorgeous nails that I use this product named Duri.</li>
            <li> Absolute genius product , I literally saw my nails expanding at the cuticle level ,still haven&#x27;t seen it go length wise</li>
            <li> I loved this product so much that I bought it for my friends.  </li>
            <li> Now they are in good shape and very seldom do i break a nail.</li>

            <li> ; nails from &#x27;death to strong life&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li> Now they are strong and all one length.&lt;br</li>
            <li> my nails are strong and growing.</li>
            <li> my nails feel strong and grow faster&lt;</li>
            <li> I hope to find something strong but this works for now.</li>
            <li> My nails have been splitting but are quite strong</li>
            <li> my nails seem as strong as when i used to use acrylics.  </li>
            <li> This product makes your nails so strong ladies that after a week of using this for my nails my palms hurt.</li>
            <li> strong nails.  </li>

            <li> I had never had such beautiful nails</li>
            <li> Not saying they never break, but are strong &amp; very pretty!</li>
            <li> then was fine.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m fine with it, its been a couple months since I started using it</li>
            <li> I really didn&#x27;t see much point in permanently breaking my habit since I&#x27;d never have beautiful nails anyways.  </li>
            <li> It works fine under layers of nail polish too.</li>
            <li> Not to mention my manicurist (even though she is really sweet) talks too much and takes up a good portion of my day doing my nails.  </li>
            <li> and while I have not seen the harden properties yet, I LOVE how quickly it dries/</li>
            <li> This product shipped quickly and I have enjoyed using it.  </li>
            <li> this coating has helped TREMENDOUSLY!  </li>
            <li> I love this product and have used it loyally for years.  </li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t think it was going to work, but after I gave it a week, my nails are really looking better and growing!</li>
            <li> I do my own nails and when I use this product my nails grow fast and strong.</li>
            <li> Now after 4 months, they have been transformed into strong, beautiful nails which I have to file to keep from growing too long!  </li>
            <li> and my nails were beautiful; strong and long!</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with this product and would highly recommend it to anyone.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t bitten my nails in 2 months, which is a HUGE accomplishment for me.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Huge fan of Rejuvacote.</li>
            <li> You must follow the process as stated and you will see huge improvement in growth and nail quality.</li>
            <li> and this product makes a huge difference.</li>
            <li> The disclaimer on the box is 100% accurate.</li>
            <li> but I didn&#x27;t have any, fortunately.</li>
            <li> I have free edge now when I use to struggle to stop bitting my nails.</li>
            <li> work great after ten days</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a fantastic product that I have passed on to friends.  </li>
            <li> Fantastic strength without the damaging filing and chemicals.</li>
            <li> Wish the formaldehyde free one would be available at this price.</li>
            <li> After reading reviews and seeing how cheap it was I took a leap of faith and ended up falling into a bottomless pit.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s available at online.</li>
            <li> Per WebMD: \\&quot;Elle, a celebrity manicurist who writes a blog for Barielle Cosmetics, suggests her clients use polish that is free of formaldehyde, toluene, and dibutyl</li>
            <li> Her nails looked amazing and mine, not so much.  </li>
            <li> So basically I have been trying this for free.</li>
            <li> I was purchasing it locally for more than it cost on line, so am delighted about that.</li>
            <li> After just two weeks, my nails are perfect and my manicures last much longer.  </li>
            <li> So far, so good.</li>
            <li> And, using Duri Rejuvacote as the directions indicate - my nails are beautiful, long and strong!!!&lt;br /&gt;Love</li>
            <li> I honestly can&#x27;t believe how great they look, and I&#x27;m mot even using it everyday now.  </li>
            <li> The splitting and cracking had stopped and I was on my way to long beautiful nails.</li>
            <li> i&#x27;m on week 3 of using this polish and so far so good.</li>
            <li> Some days, I would put as many as 3 coats on and it would peel right off.  </li>
            <li> My nails have grown so much, no need for tips anymore!!!</li>
            <li> really works!!!</li>
            <li> highly recommend this product!!!!</li>
            <li> I recommend this product absolutely!!!</li>
            <li> Within a short time I am able to file away the damage and my own nails are strong again.  </li>
            <li> It is easy to apply and dries quickly.  </li>
            <li> goes on easily, dries quickly.</li>
            <li> I would highly reccommend this product to anyone who has a nail type like my own, and I do plan on introducing this product to friends when given the chance.  </li>
            <li> My nails are long and strong, love love love it.</li>
            <li> Well worth the price!  </li>
            <li> Mom uses it and says its great to help keep long fingernails from splitting, chipping, breaking, etc.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d get excited if they grew a cm</li>
            <li> I did notice a change in stregnth and growth within a month but dont get overly excited and stop using it</li>
            <li> It was $12 (so buy it here!), but it was worth it!</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for about 2 months, and there is a significant difference in my nails.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Please let me know if anyone has any more info on this as i would love to continue using this product and get the great results everyone else is raving about, but of course without any negative side effects!!&lt;br</li>
            <li> But I think it&#x27;s worth it!</li>
            <li> With this product my nails are healthy looking and much stronger!</li>
            <li> I originally purchased it hoping to speed up the nail growth for a torn nail.</li>
            <li> This product has made a significant difference.</li>
            <li> But as usual Amazon CS was awesome and refunded my money.</li>
            <li> My nails have always been fast to grow, but they were always so incredibly brittle and fragile.</li>
            <li> Let me state right off the top that this product really does work!!</li>
            <li> My nails are so gorgeous, strong, and long that I will never bite them again.  </li>
            <li> which kinda makes my nails not as strong but overall I&#x27;ve been very pleased with this product</li>
            <li> The Rejuvacote bottles arrived in just a couple of days wrapped tight and were an incredible price that I had to purchase two.</li>
            <li> I am hoping that in another month this product will have helped me get back to the strong and healthy nails I have had for most of my life.</li>
            <li> I love this product and will certainly buy it again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been a nail-biter almost all of my life, but every once in a while I would force myself into quitting for special occassions- like Senior prom-</li>
            <li> I have tried all the products out there including Nail Envy, Nailtiques, special vitamins, gelatin, and nothing</li>
            <li> She was right!</li>
            <li> She was right!  </li>
            <li> I now have absolutely FLAWLESS nails - they don&#x27;t split at the ends, they&#x27;re perfectly smooth, really strong, and I&#x27;ve never seen them this long in my entire life.</li>
            <li> I even tried applying it right after I used nail polish remover to ensure a smooth, clean nail surface.  </li>
            <li> Wow, the growth is amazing.</li>
            <li> I can go back to painting my nails and them looking good.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t really expecting these to save my nails or anything, I just wanted to see if there was something better than the Sally Hansen stuff I&#x27;ve been getting from the drugstore.</li>
            <li> It really helps -- not 100% but more than anything else I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> But if my nails are intact and in overall good condition I don&#x27;t feel a thing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It gives my nails a nice clear finish where I don&#x27;t feel like I need to wear nail polish.</li>
            <li> Love this polish -- really works to make nails stronger immediately.</li>
            <li> I bit my nails growing up and have worn gels and acrylics for many years although my nails are not thin now.  </li>
            <li> so I cannot comment too much on it, but I did purchase this item to see if it would work better</li>
            <li> My nails are starting to look good.</li>
            <li> In the end i learned my lesson IF ITS TRIED AND TRUE dont try to find replacements.</li>
            <li> Also, I would recommend applying  one coat every day, and after 7 days, remove the clear coat from all nails and apply some kind of moisturizer a.k.a. oil to your nails.</li>
            <li> I have peely and brittle nails - this product really helps my nails look healthy and grow longer.  </li>
            <li> I love this product and arrived fast.</li>
            <li> you want to have your own nails without any costly, frequent nail shop visits</li>
            <li> This product really helped them to look better.  </li>
            <li> It makes your nails strong and they grow very fast.</li>
            <li> This has made my nails strong and does make them grow very fast.  </li>
            <li> My nails have never been better and I&#x27;ve tried EVERYTHING Super fast shipping.</li>
            <li> I love that it dries super fast</li>
            <li> So easy to use and effective in a short time.</li>
            <li> but now i have strong pretty nails</li>
            <li> I love the fact that I can go get a pretty french manicure with my own nails rather than putting on nail damaging acrylic nails.</li>
            <li> I faithfully apply the treatment every day and clean my nails and start fresh again every 7-10 days.  </li>
            <li> First time i wore it everything was fine.</li>
            <li> The Rejuvacote arrived so quickly and I have been using it ever since.</li>
            <li> I find that I feel the tingle mostly when I place the product on top of a nail that&#x27;s been filed, scratch, or damaged in in such a way.  </li>
            <li> , I just slather on a layer before going to work, it dries quickly, and my nails are protected when I&#x27;m washing my hands a million times in 12 hours.</li>
            <li> Peeling, breaking at the quick.</li>
            <li> I have searched far and wide for the perfect nail strengthener</li>
            <li> i see a tremendous difference in my nails</li>
            <li> After a week or so of using as directed, I have decent looking nails :)</li>
            <li> Peeled off quickly, but then again so does nail polish on my nails.</li>
            <li> Both she and her clients love this product and so for them, I have to rate it highly.</li>
            <li> OK, i just bought Duri Rejuvacote today at Harmon&#x27;s for $9.99 after a friend highly recommended it, and swore that her nails grew faster and stronger while using it.  </li>
            <li> Many thanks to the customer reviews positive comments and recommendations on this product!  </li>
            <li> I have been using this product for several months and am very pleased with the results.  </li>
            <li> Countless manicurists tried their various products and trade secrets to make my nails healthy and attractive, until one mentioned Rejuvacote.</li>
            <li> After using this for just a few weeks my nails were 100% stronger and beautiful.  </li>
            <li> File them, soak the tips in warm water with a squirt of soap, clean under the nails, use cuticle remover and an orange stick to push back the cuticles.</li>
            <li> This product really does work, it makes your nails super strong.</li>
            <li> The product goes on easily and dries super fast.  </li>
            <li> I either use it as a top coat after getting a manicure or a base and top coat when doing my own nails and it works great.</li>
            <li> it is a great product and my wife and friends have used it previously.</li>
            <li> I use this daily...takes less than a minute to apply and am happy to report longer, stronger nails.</li>
            <li> As I got older, they began to get even more brittle and thin and the best \\&quot;over the counter\\&quot; treatments didn&#x27;t help.  </li>
            <li> , makes my nails strong and grows very well.</li>
            <li> My nails grew so fast and got strong.</li>
            <li> My nails were very flimsy and would break easily but not anymore.</li>
            <li> it works well when applied every single day, but peels off a lot in between applications and if you forget a day, it almost doesn&#x27;t seem to do any good at all.  </li>
            <li> I also am giving a bottle to several friends for XMAS and have suggeted this to many of my co-workers!~</li>
            <li> This stuff really works!!</li>
            <li> It really works!!  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Although, when attaining length, my nail eventually cracks on the sides (i have weak nails and now take biotin), but all in all still awesome.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for several years and was able to recover my nails!</li>
            <li> and it works even the first time you use it!</li>
            <li> I guess the product would work if it actually stayed on my nails, but no matter how many coats I used, it chipped within hours!</li>
            <li> I use it at night while I am watching TV before bed, dries quickly and goes on clear :)</li>
            <li> If you are looking to just use it to keep your nails strong, the box suggests applying a coat daily and then alternating days as needed when your nails get better.</li>
            <li> The &amp;#34;pinkish&amp;#34; tint is very, very light in fact, it is almost clear.</li>
            <li> Its hard to find, great price and received quickly!</li>
            <li> They are strong and healthy and look really nice – I&#x27;ve even washed the car and washed a lot of dishes by hand lately</li>
            <li> but it was worth the wait.</li>
            <li> I use this with Perfect Formula pink gel coat for extra whitening power.  </li>
            <li> A nice big bottle for nail polish.</li>
            <li> I would have given this product five stars but the polish chips off a lot, especially if you wash your hands frequently like I do for my job, but otherwise a great product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m on my 4th bottle - and it&#x27;s rare that I rebuy something.  </li>
            <li> and I swear I have found the newest secret to grow nautural beautiful nails!</li>
            <li> Yes, maintaining them is a daily thing, but if you want nice nails then that&#x27;s just something you have to get used to.</li>
            <li> When I took off the acrylic for good, to allow my real nails to breath and hopefully strengthen, they were very fragile and would literally fall away like sand when filed.  </li>
            <li> People have actually noticed and have told me how nice they look.</li>
            <li> This vendor is selling fresh merchandise.  </li>
            <li> lasting cause is very liquid (not as quimica alemana which is good</li>
            <li> Something about that seems to make my fingertips more sensitive.  </li>
            <li> I had been using acrylic nails and finally decided to take them off and try to grow my own</li>
            <li> I have natural nails and use this as a top coat and the polish does not crack.</li>
            <li> Also, keeps my polish looking fresh for about a week.</li>
            <li> they rarely chip or break.</li>
            <li> I am a professional hand model and love this product.  </li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say enough nice things about this product.  </li>
            <li> I think perhaps some people are more sensitive.</li>
            <li> every day - well worth the price</li>
            <li> I can not buy locally -came very quickly-well packed and good price.</li>
            <li> , don&#x27;t trim my cuticles too far before using....  :)</li>
            <li> I was trying to grow my nails on my own and using generic nail growth products.</li>
            <li> I am addicted, this product is amazing!!!!</li>
            <li> , my nails have never looked better and I am 77 years old</li>
            <li> she is using it regularly and thrilled with it.  </li>
            <li> is so fun.  </li>
            <li> I finally have the healthy beautiful nails that I used to envy on other girls!</li>
            <li> This product is great if you need a top coat for plain nails or over colored polish but as far as anything else, I probably would not recommend it.</li>
            <li> My nails are long, healthy, and strong.  </li>
            <li> It does not make my nails break and it grows it pretty quick.</li>
            <li> It came in the mail pretty quickly</li>
            <li> Although I get lazy sometimes in terms of using it on a regular, it is absolutely the best product for healthy nails.  </li>
            <li> I was surprised by how quickly my nails became strong</li>
            <li> I  put Duri  on right after taking acrylics off with no problems.</li>
            <li> right?</li>
            <li> Shipped right away.</li>
            <li> Got results right away.</li>
            <li> After wearing this product for one day the polish is peeling right off.  </li>
            <li> However, if you decide to put your hands in any kinda of water, it will peel right off your nails.</li>
            <li> Tho&#x27; my nails are not long, strong and luxurious yet, they are not painfully tearing below the quick like before.</li>
            <li> I HAVE USED THIS PRODUCT IN THE PAST WITH GREAT SUCCESS.</li>
            <li> When I was attentive and kept polish on them, I could keep them looking decent.  </li>
            <li> I am meticulous when it comes to my polish chipping or peeling- and with Duri I have been able to leave the same color on for a full week without it chipping or peeling off!!!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> This product keep my nails strong and&lt;br /&gt;is a wonderful base and top</li>
            <li> and I would definitely recommend it to any woman with nails that aren&#x27;t very strong.</li>
            <li> Better than a regular clear coat for sure.</li>
            <li> I originally started using it because I didn&#x27;t want to continue having acrylic nails and wanted to get back to my own natural nails.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll be certain to groom my cuticles a day or so BEFORE re-applying Rejuvacote!  </li>
            <li> As my nails grow out and it&#x27;s time to add more, I remove the polish and repeat the process above with two fresh coats.  </li>
            <li> Then I realized that the reason it&#x27;s easier to bite is because my nails were so soft and easy to nibble on -</li>
            <li> I applied one coat , it dries super fast.</li>
            <li> I purchased it on a whim after reading the excellent reviews because I was desperate to get my nails back to looking/feeling strong and healthy.</li>
            <li> Dries super fast.</li>
            <li> My nails were soft and broke easily.</li>
            <li> This is one of the best products that does actually strengthen nails from the first few uses.</li>
            <li> I use it daily and all 10 nails are long and beautiful for the first time ever.</li>
            <li> /&gt;After just weeks of using it according to the instructions, my nails have grown out as strong as they were before I first went to Nursing school, and the frequent hand-washings that started then.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> they have always been soft and bent easy, this really makes a difference!</li>
            <li> However, it is very fast drying</li>
            <li> I like it very much and use it all the time.  </li>
            <li> I also have gotten all my friends using it and they like it very much.</li>
            <li> An added bonus is the price, it&#x27;s very reasonable.  </li>
            <li> My nails are long and very strong.  </li>
            <li> I have very weak, brittle nails that chip, break and peel even under the best cicumstances.</li>
            <li> My nails look so great now that I hardly need to use nail polish.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll every use any other nail product again as this one not only works but dries quickly and looks great.</li>
            <li> I recently purchased 3 more bottles of Rejuvacote because it truly does stengthen nails.</li>
            <li> I am on my second bottle and love this stuff.</li>
            <li> they woudlnt grow so i would just bite at them and start the whole routine again!</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m sure it coats it and seals it because I had prior peeling on my nails and after about a couple of weeks</li>
            <li> Evidently, it will take me many years to get them back where they need to be.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have used it exactly the way the directions were written on package....</li>
            <li> The first time I used it I thought it didn&#x27;t work</li>
            <li> My nails have really improved!</li>
            <li> At first you put a coat on every day and after a couple of weeks you will start seeing a difference.</li>
            <li> But sure enough it worked.  </li>
            <li> They would still split at first but they would grow - then they stopped splitting and now they are back to the healthy state they used to be</li>
            <li> The best product that I brought that work for me and my nails never been this beauitfull in my life I use to wear fake nail at all time&#x27;s now</li>
            <li> and I will be ordering much more in the future</li>
            <li> I even had someone get it for me when I was hospitalized suddenly and wasn&#x27;t able to take it with me.</li>
            <li> I really recommend this product to anyone!</li>
            <li> After paying quite a bit of money for my first two bottles I decided to try amazon.  </li>
            <li> I just applied my first coat onto my nails about an hour ago and was reading the ingredients and saw that it contains Formaldehyde resin - which if i am correct can be</li>
            <li> This is not the first time I have used this product.....&#x27;started in 2010.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been a nail biter all my life and an avid acrylic nail wearer.</li>
            <li> and I am very hsppy with the results!</li>
            <li> Dries fast, and doesn&#x27;t peel off!  </li>
            <li> I first heard this product on instagram.</li>
            <li> It actually really works!</li>
            <li> ;)</li>
            <li> My regular hardener from the department store worked much better.</li>
            <li> When used as directed, this really works!</li>
            <li> I purchased it and it really works well!  </li>
            <li> This does help though, if you&#x27;re willing to treat it like birth control pills and use it every day.</li>
            <li> When I first got it I just fallowed the instructions to the T.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping!</li>
            <li> I rarely got tips, too much upkeep and maintenance.  </li>
            <li> I am getting ready to purchase my 6th bottle!</li>
            <li> When I had my first manicure (without polish) after 6 weeks, she felt she could see a difference in my nails.  </li>
            <li> For the first month or so I applied this product about 2-3 times a week</li>
            <li> , I also invested in Miracote top coat by the same company.</li>
            <li> Well first I should say that I bought this stuff and when it got to my house the bottle had been opened and all the polish spilled out into the box.</li>
            <li> I use two coats under my nail color and my nails seem to be in much better shape now after the last 4 or five months.</li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> For the first time ever, my nails are growing and I don&#x27;t have to worry about them peeling.</li>
            <li> It is very slightly pink tinted and provides a nice sheen.  </li>
            <li> At first I thought it wouldn&#x27;t work</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m sure a generic Argan Oil would suffice.</li>
            <li> I really want to use it the way you are supposed to, and check out my results then!</li>
            <li> First, I couldn&#x27;t keep it on.  </li>
            <li> My own nails got harder and i can grow them.</li>
            <li> /&gt; Be aware; The product contains traces of celluloid.</li>
            <li> I love having longer fingernails – so I did some research and this came back as the highest rated.</li>
            <li> - YOU CAN&#x27;T GO WRONG, THIS POLISH IS WONDERFUL!!</li>
            <li> This product really works!</li>
            <li> Thanks Rejuvacote!</li>
            <li> I first tried this product in college when a friend gave it to me from her mom&#x27;s salon.</li>
            <li> By doing this I was able to actually leave it on my nails.</li>
            <li> That just goes to prove that it&#x27;s the many layers that keep the nails from breaking and not that it&#x27;s actually doing something to nourish the nails so that NAILS themselves become stronger.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> The first bottle I bought worked in 3 weeks.</li>
            <li> I have been using this polish daily and my nail are looking better.</li>
            <li> It also makes your nail polish stay on much longer!</li>
            <li> I have battled peeling nails for years (which weakens my nails over time) and this is the first product I&#x27;ve used that I haven&#x27;t had that issue with at all.  </li>
            <li> it really works!</li>
            <li> The ridges in my mom&#x27;s nails improved, and my nails started growing and feel much stronger!</li>
            <li> , I have tried my whole life to find a product that delivers and this one does it for me!</li>
            <li> Love it, I  clipped my nails short and in a week my nails are growing out and thicker.</li>
            <li> But I will definitely be ordering more.</li>
            <li> Just going to give it to my mother since she has pretty nails and does them all the time.</li>
            <li> or they grow so long and strong that I can not do my job!</li>
            <li> Luckily I was able to purchase it on Amazon after the beauty store in my community closed</li>
            <li> used this when my nails were really damaged on my right hand.</li>
            <li> and I have to say after a few close calls of nearly breaking my nail I can say this was great</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s nice and thick (but not globby) and comes on smooth.</li>
            <li> days, I remove the product and let my nails be bare for a few days, and they&#x27;re still beautiful.  </li>
            <li> After about a month of using the Rejuvacote, my nails became much much stronger and were able to actually grow.</li>
            <li> The first week, I used it as a plain clear coat, with nothing on top, and it was fine, although it did chip and peel rather quickly.</li>
            <li> It doen&#x27;t make your nails grow like crazy but makes them beautiful and strong.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just a cheap nailpolish which starts chipping off within 1 day (even when put on clean dry nails as the directions say!).</li>
            <li> A beautician recommended Duri Rejuvacote after I mentioned that I have never been able to have long nails because they either split or break.</li>
            <li> This is the first nail strenghener I have ever bought that really works</li>
            <li> I hope it works I love to have my nails long and manicured.</li>
            <li> I had pretty much given up on it, until my dear friend raved about Rejuvacote.  </li>
            <li> but they are getting pretty lengthy and its thanks to this product which has made them durable even when submerged under water for extended periods of time.  </li>
            <li> I have NEVER been able to grow long nails.  </li>
            <li> The first week I didn&#x27;t notice much of a difference.  </li>
            <li> They&#x27;ll grow out just enough for me to really feel good about them, then the sides will peel off and I&#x27;m back to square one.  </li>
            <li> For the first 2 weeks, I couldn&#x27;t see much improvement and my nails continued to be fragile and would split easily.  </li>
            <li> Now the only thing that I didnt like is that it starts to peel easily.</li>
            <li> This is to make sure your nails don&#x27;t become too dry.</li>
            <li> Nails definitely improve using this and stay strong.</li>
            <li> When your nails are strong and grown out, you CANNOT stop using this or they will revert back to what they were..</li>
            <li> actually had nails that were strong and not peeling and were growing!&lt;br /&gt;Now</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t recommend this stuff enough if you are wanting nails that are strong and</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll be certain to groom my cuticles a day or so BEFORE re-applying Rejuvacote!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> That should keep the stuff from peeling in large sheets.</li>
            <li> I tell people about it, give it as gifts, and CANNOT live without it!!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s necessary to remove it every week or so because it starts to crackle, but it has really helped my nails get strong again.</li>
            <li> pair this with the Seche Vite fast dry top coat when I do my manicures</li>
            <li> If you use regularly you will see results quickly!</li>
            <li> I decided to buy Rejuvacote off Amazon because all of the reviews looked pretty decent.</li>
            <li> I tried to grow them on my own, as soon as they would grow a little they would split and tear off.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been blessed with very strong long nails since I was 15 years old.  </li>
            <li> After taking off artificial nails many times and coming back to them because I could not grow nice nails, I tried it again, using Rejuvacote, and, now, 1 month after, I can honestly say that my nails are hard and are growing nicely.</li>
            <li> After using this product, after only two weeks I noticed a huge difference.  </li>
            <li> I use a coat on clean dry nails and weekly I remove it and put on a fresh coat.</li>
            <li> This stuff really makes your nails grow</li>
            <li> keep using it as much as you can</li>
            <li> I really recommend it.</li>
            <li> This product REALLY works on strengthening your nails.</li>
            <li> My nails are so much stronger with this on</li>
            <li> and it dries fast.</li>
            <li> About 5 min after applying, my nail beds began to burn with intense discomfort.</li>
            <li> and I needed it FAST.</li>
            <li> The shipping of this product was fast.</li>
            <li> nails are much stronger now.</li>
            <li> Cannot believe how much my nails grow when using this stuff.</li>
            <li> Used this product for a while and found it to really work</li>
            <li> Really strengthens the nail but should be used every day or night.</li>
            <li> Thanks for your promptness in filling my order.</li>
            <li> but it really works.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff but you need to be careful who you buy it from.  </li>
            <li> fast on nails</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;Couldn&#x27;t be wear alone because it peels fast</li>
            <li> It really helped my nails grow and not peel.</li>
            <li> and I can REALLY tell the difference.</li>
            <li> It also dries fast.</li>
            <li> This has really helped my nail growth.</li>
            <li> Really works to make your nails stronger.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really follow the directions on the bottle.</li>
            <li> thank you for making something that really works</li>
            <li> and I see real improvement.  </li>
            <li> , I was in so much pain on my nails and finger tips</li>

            <li> and sometimes it doesn&#x27;t seem to help much.</li>

            <li> that are givne a chance to really grow.</li>
            <li> Really strengthens nails.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend this for anyone!</li>
            <li> My nails aren&#x27;t growing as fast as I would like them too, however, they are a lot stronger.  </li>
            <li> Unlike most clear nail polish built for strength, if used as both an undercoat and a final coat over colored polish, it both strengthens your nails and preserves the colored shine from chipping.  </li>
            <li> Wow!!!</li>
            <li> My nails are now all long and strong and have not broken (knock on wood) since mid-May.</li>
            <li> After a couple of weeks my nails are strong and as long as I want them to be.  </li>
            <li> My nails are long and strong after months of using acrylics.</li>
            <li> I had not idea how strong and long my nails would become.  </li>
            <li> I now have long strong nails.</li>
            <li> I cant believe how strong and long they are.</li>
            <li> , my nails are strong and long.</li>
            <li> i apply one coat of rejuvacote a day and my nails are strong and long</li>
            <li> But now my nails are very strong, as long as i consistently keep the product on my nails daily.</li>
            <li> I personally only like one coat of this on my nails because I found when I put the second coat on, it chipped very easily,</li>
            <li> I use it with regular nail polish, and while it doesn&#x27;t last as long as the gel, I am happy with my nail health.  </li>
            <li> It does seem to cause other polish placed on top to peal after a couple days or so</li>
            <li> Now I apply a top coat every other day.</li>
            <li> Great product and timeliness in delivery was also good; however, I was disappointed to find that the price recently increased.</li>
            <li> Plus, it could not be easier to use, and there are no negative side effects!</li>
            <li> But then after an application about three weeks in, like many of the other reviewers, I started to experience pain.</li>
            <li> tried many other nail strengthener products and none work like Duri Rejuvate Cote.  </li>
            <li> Glad I spent the money on this!</li>
            <li> When I followed the directions, my nails grew strong &amp; long!</li>
            <li> Now they are strong and long!</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for two months and my nails are strong and long!  </li>
            <li> My hands are in water constantly since I clean for living</li>
            <li> The only thing I liked about this was the fact that it dried quick.  </li>
            <li> is seriously a miracle worker and yes.. its almost $10 a bottle but its more than worth it!</li>
            <li> But, the next month my nails grew out longer than normal and looked pretty healthy with white tips at the ends.  </li>
            <li> I work a couple nights as a server and my nail polish used to chip from washing my hands so much, now my polish lasts a whole week and still looks new at the end.</li>
            <li> This is the first one that has worked; within 2 weeks of frequent use, my nails were stronger.  </li>
            <li> gives a nice shine so no more polish is needed</li>
            <li> For someone who has much keyboard use, you&#x27;ll find that this prevents the splits and chips that come from the normal wear and tear on nails.  </li>
            <li> finally my dream came true</li>
            <li> My nails would always break at the point where they were long, and finally I have been able to keep them long and strong.</li>
            <li> I picked up a few of these for my fiancee&#x27;s mom, who is a professional beautician and operates her own salon.</li>
            <li> And after 3 they were longer and vibrant.</li>
            <li> After many years of trying various products on my nails, I found the ultimate product!</li>
            <li> and I kept them super short.</li>
            <li> My favorite thing about this is that Duri is a wonderful base coat!  </li>
            <li> Formaldehyde is a main ingredient.</li>
            <li> As long as I don&#x27;t let them grow too long, my nails stay nice.</li>
            <li> and I am positive that it will grow given the improvements I have seen so far .</li>
            <li> I would strongly recommend purchasing it to anyone that has a difficult time with growing long, healthy strong nails.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend</li>
            <li> Highly recommended to anyone with problem nails.</li>

            <li> HIGHLY recommended.</li>
            <li> For the first time in my life my nails actually got long and strong.</li>
            <li> but that&#x27;s a small price to pay for long strong healthy nails.</li>
            <li> started using rejuvacote a little over a month ago, and already my nails are longer, stronger and better looking than they have been in years.  </li>
            <li> Also, acrylic nails (which are basically applied with super glue to your own nail) can be extremely damaging and may peel/strip away natural nails when removed - sometimes down to the tender tissue underneath that the nail is protecting -</li>
            <li> It absolutely works to make nails retain their natural strength.</li>
            <li> I really like it so far.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always had nubs, hence the acrylics but proud to say I no longer need to pay for or add fake nails.  </li>
            <li> My nails were longer and much stronger and the chipping almost completely stopped.</li>
            <li> After far too much $$ getting manicures my nail tech suggested Rejuvacote from Duri cosmetics.</li>
            <li> I switched to Sally Hanson&#x27;s green tea and olive growth and that showed me much better results.</li>
            <li> My friends that recommended love it and they have been using it for a few months and longer.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Im so glad she found this for about 2weeks of using this (one coat everyday for a week</li>
            <li> Your nails will grow at its normal speed as it has always grown.</li>
            <li> I decided to start painting again with rejuvacote, until my nails started breaking off, like normal.  </li>
            <li> For those reviews that said it burns, it probably isnt a good idea to put this polish on after acrylics since acrylics thin out your nails.</li>
            <li> They are long and beautiful and I&#x27;ve even had to file them down a couple of times because they got too long.  </li>
            <li> My nails normally are always very short because they peel and break right away.</li>
            <li> This product has given me such strong nails I have to cut them regularly</li>
            <li> I have never had such strong nails in my entire life.  </li>
            <li> I used to have very strong and healthy nails and was completely unprepared to handle the cracking, splitting, dry and weak nail situation.</li>
            <li> After using only a few times a week I had no reaction and stunning nail growth!</li>
            <li> They are long, smooth, thick and healthy.</li>
            <li> and the salesgirl said, \\&quot;Have you tried this new nail prduct?\\</li>
            <li> Just received my new bottle of Rejuvacote.  </li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t live without it.</li>
            <li> I ran out couldn&#x27;t find in any stores in New England.</li>
            <li> BEWARE TO THE NEW USERS COMING FROM ACRYLIC AND BITTEN NAILS.</li>
            <li> Each day you put a new coat on and after the 7th day you take it off and start again.</li>
            <li> With this I can live my Tomboy lifestyle and still have nails that look like a girl.</li>
            <li> day and add a new coat.</li>
            <li> My nails feel nice and solid when I apply a few coats.</li>
            <li> Although, the speed of the growth is not that much increased, but the overall coloring and healthiness of the nails are much improved.</li>
            <li> Two and a half weeks in and my nails are going strong.</li>
            <li> I did at one point and a couple of nails became very sensitive but that has cleared up.  </li>
            <li> and I am a very busy mom.</li>
            <li> My nails were breaking and very soft.</li>
            <li> After they did get so long, I did get some chips on the ends if my nails, but no splitting, and they were easily filed back to shape.</li>
            <li> My nails are long and strong and would advise that you give it a try for a couple of months if your nails are constantly breaking.</li>
            <li> Duri Rejuvacote is the ONLY thing that has helped me achieve long, strong and non peeling nails.&lt;br</li>
            <li> to address some other users problems, I&#x27;ve only ever had some mild stinging after using this product and to be honest, it was my fault for trimming my cuticles too far down and then applying it.  </li>
            <li> I tried so many other hardening nail products, but  after using Duri Rejuvacote for only a month I started to notice a difference.  </li>
            <li> Add a coat every day for the first couple of weeks, stripping it off and starting over once a week.  </li>
            <li> If you bite your nails or if they are brittle or soft, use Duri once a day and they will grow!  </li>
            <li> I recommend this to everyone who wants a protective coat on bare nails or over polish.</li>
            <li> So the first application I have to do two coats, then the following days one coat.</li>
            <li> much better results than I ordinarily get.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My manicurist first introduced Duri Rejuvacote to me, but she charged almost double the price.</li>
            <li> She actually bought me my first bottle</li>
            <li> But good in general if you have weak nails.</li>
            <li> I first bought this at my local nail shop.</li>
            <li> Some of those work, initially, but once you start to slack off on application, you can kiss your pretty nails</li>
            <li> The first time I applied this I had a strange burning sensation in the last two fingers on each hand, however subsequent applications were fine.</li>
            <li> I had read some of the reviews about how this would peel easily and it discouraged me a little</li>
            <li> My nails did grow a little but then would split and easy break off.  </li>
            <li> -- I don&#x27;t want to mess up my nice, long nails!</li>
            <li> Every couple days I&#x27;ll put on a new coat, when the old one starts chipping off, and remove it once every two weeks or so.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m back with some positive remarks.</li>
            <li> have recommended it to friends who have had the same positive result.</li>
            <li> After months of dealing with weak nails that shred and peel off in layers, I tried this for 2 weeks and saw an amazing difference.</li>
            <li> Well the base coat was chipping by the end of the first day, and topping it off with a top coat just made it chip more.  </li>
            <li> When I&#x27;m wearing it by itself, people swear that I have a French manicure because it makes my nail tips super white.</li>
            <li> You will truly experience strong and natural nails after just a few weeks.</li>
            <li> I am a fairly young survivor, with a 1 1/2 year old son who&#x27;s energy and demands keep my life (and hands) very busy.</li>
            <li> My nails have never been so strong, and I&#x27;ve tried many nail strengthening products only to have them eventually fail me.  </li>
            <li> my nails are now so long so strong and grow so fast that I find myself having to file them down to keep them to the length that I like.</li>
            <li> Over the years, I have tried every single product on the market to have strong and long nails.</li>
            <li> This product was magical for me when I moved to an extreme climate and my nails were so dry they peeled and broke.</li>
            <li> huge waste of money and time every day.</li>
            <li> i suggest wearing it over clear nails.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I would recommend this product to anyone that wants their nails to look professionally done for a way smaller price tag.</li>
            <li> But this bottle does the same thing as gettin fake tips and you can be proud to show off your hands.  </li>
            <li> Nails are a lot clear and a lot stronger .</li>
            <li> The Duri Rejuvacote fixed them.</li>
            <li> Rejuvacote fixed my nails and in a month I had stronger and longer nails.  </li>
            <li> I swear ive never had my natural nails</li>
            <li> I actually developed nails beds which I never had.  </li>
            <li> This is a product I&#x27;ve used for a couple of years now, and it has worked wonders on my soft, hard-to-grow nails.  </li>
            <li> My nails have always been soft, breaking and splitting.[[ASIN:</li>
            <li> and I am amazed at my natural nails today.</li>
            <li> It does require that you use it frequently.</li>
            <li> my nails turned yellow, became very brittle and did not grow at all.</li>
            <li> there and my nails began to show it, they got soft again.</li>
            <li> I bought from another online vendor and the stuff was old and it did not work.  </li>
            <li> For the first time in my life I have long nails.</li>
            <li> Well, I was pleasantly surprised.  </li>
            <li> I wore acrylics for years because my natural nails were always splitting.  </li>
            <li> I have natural nails</li>
            <li> My wife swares by this product, and was nearly out, so I ordered two for her.</li>
            <li> Completely resurrected my &amp;#34;25-year acrylic addicted&amp;#34</li>
            <li> I am prone to frequent breaking and splitting.</li>
            <li> the sally hansen is much thinner and seems to do the same job</li>
            <li> It explains how the \\&quot;formaldehyde\\&quot; isn&#x27;t really the same product when used as it chemically changes.  </li>
            <li> My nails are soft, split, shred. . .  </li>
            <li> My nails have changed considerably</li>
            <li> I have been using the product for a month and have noticed a marked improvement in the nail growth.</li>
            <li> So far, it has helped strengthen my nails ...</li>
            <li> I have arthritis in my hands, so nails naturally don&#x27;t grow well.</li>
            <li> , this really help bring my nails back to life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and then my nails were so sensitive.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve already gotten compliments on my nails from ladies who thought I went to the salon and were amazed when I told them I did my nails myself and they&#x27;re my natural nails.</li>
            <li> Since 16, I would get acrylics and you can imagine the damage I&#x27;ve done to my natural nails for years.  </li>
            <li> so I can&#x27;t really tell if Rejuvacote is the only thing that&#x27;s stopping my nails from peeling.</li>
            <li> You HAVE TO let the damaged portion of your nails grow out COMPLETELY for this product to work (that is what I did).</li>
            <li> I found this product on Amazon, and I&#x27;d like to say thanks to everyone who reviewed rejuvacote, especially the nurses.</li>
            <li> and I have been for a long time, and I am constantly washing my hands, and because of that, I haven&#x27;t been able to grow my nails long in years.  </li>
            <li> Naturally it took time for the damaged nail to grow out but</li>
            <li> I had this on my nails for 3 days when they started to really hurt and turn blue.  </li>
            <li> Whenever I traveled to higher humidity locales my nails would grow long until I returned to my desert home.  </li>
            <li> It is cheaper for me to use it at home now that my income cannot afford for me to have my nails done professionally anymore.</li>
            <li> I intend to use Rejuvacote from now on and keep my fingernails natural.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this product to anyone wanting natural nails.  </li>
            <li> Not to mention the brown spots that developed under my nails.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never been able to grow long nails and to have them all long at the same time</li>
            <li> I find it protects my nails and gives it the look of a professional manicure.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this stuff for 2 weeks and WOW.</li>
            <li> Rejuvacote hardens my nails within a few days and keeps them healthy until the next application.</li>
            <li> This product was suggested by my dermatologist and gave me spectacular nails when they had been thin and peeling in layers for years.</li>
            <li> Though it took the Rejuvacote a long time to dry, the results were fantastic.</li>
            <li> My nails stopped splitting almost immediately and they&#x27;re becoming stronger, breaking lot less and actually starting to grow.</li>
            <li> am excited to keep using to see my nail grow just a little bit, which I have never had nails.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> /&gt;This was recommended to my by a popular nail polish blogger and it has seriously changed my nails!  </li>
            <li> it makes my nails healthier and stronger and my nails usually break easily.</li>
            <li> I noticed progress within the first few days, mainly because any nail that grew was new nail since I chew, so</li>
            <li> /&gt;SO: Not a good base coat, but an excellent top coat.</li>
            <li> I use this product faithfully, applying a fresh coat every day or every other day depending on my workload.  </li>
            <li> I have also used many other products to make my nails hard and pretty like all my friends had.</li>
            <li> /&gt;You can use polish, but now that the tips are so pretty and white I just use the Rejuvacote and it looks like I had a french tip</li>
            <li> My nails haven&#x27;t been long and healthy looking in quite a few years.  </li>
            <li> a manicure which used to last 2-3 days now goes 11 with dark colors, 13 with light colors.</li>
            <li> I always had very strong nails before acrylic and Couldn t believe how tissue paper thin they had become.</li>
            <li> After getting my nails long because of this amazing product i did experience cuts on my face [ because i wasn&#x27;t careful] and also marks on my palms due to my nails.</li>
            <li> Major mistake!</li>
            <li> Major mistake!</li>
            <li> We followed the directions on the bottle and after three days, both of us noticed a major improvement in our nails!</li>
            <li> This simply cannot be normal and makes one question the safety of Rejuvacote.</li>
            <li> I wear gloves when I wash dishes, but this stuff couldn&#x27;t even make it through a normal daily shower without peeling off.  </li>
            <li> It was only some stinging and didn&#x27;t last for more thatn a few minutes.  </li>
            <li> I have finally kicked the habit and was looking for something to help get my nails into shape to be able to withstand everyday life and not instantly break.</li>
            <li> Strong, long and a lot less ridges.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had peeling flaky nails as long as I can remember my nails are hard and are actually growing I&#x27;ve recommend this to so many of my friends!</li>
            <li> Seals nails and keeps them hard and strong</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the only thing that has strengthened my nails and it completely transforms weak nails into long strong ones!!</li>
            <li> As mentioned in other reviews, you must follow the directions and apply a quick coat daily.  </li>
            <li> Same reaction; about 5 min later intense burning began.</li>
            <li> I bought this product to re-store damage that I received when getting the gel nails at a Nail Spa, it was taken off incorrectly and was not soaked off completely, the place was packed so they did not have time to completely soak all of the polish off, which resulted in them having to get an electric file and get remaining polish off, the process weakened my nails and caused them to break constantly and chip and peel</li>
            <li> MY SECOND BOTTLE, WILL BUY MY THIRD BOTTLE REAL SOON.</li>
            <li> I mostly use it as a base and top coat now.</li>
            <li> They are strong, thick and no longer split.  </li>
            <li> When I stop using the product my nails will stay long strong and healthy for a little while aftwards, but eventually begin to break and split again, but with a few weeks of using rejuvacote, I am back to long grogeous nails again.  </li>
            <li> Can be hard to fine; buy online</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t add any other color to it, just that straight clear coat.  </li>
            <li> Prefer Magic Nails to this as a strengthening tool - however my nails were extremely damaged from having gel nails done a few times, and it does help.</li>
            <li> I have 4 nails that crack right down the middle and are as soft as tissue paper.</li>
            <li> You do have to be careful not to use too much.  </li>
            <li> Since I was younger my nails have been soft, bendable, they broke in layers, and I had a habit of biting them.</li>
            <li> The key is to apply frequently.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve recieved several compliments from friends &amp; complete strangers</li>
            <li> So I just use it bare.</li>
            <li> DURI Rejuvacote really makes by nails harder.  </li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t bare it</li>
            <li> I have to back up, my nails were always soft, breaking and peeling years ago</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had  acrylics for many years but tired of the maintenance.</li>
            <li> Nothing I&#x27;d ever tried before worked, but after reading the reviews I convinced myself that, for a few bucks, it was worth a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> apply a base coat of Duri, 2 coats color, and a top coat of Duri, and reapply top coat Duri about 3 days later.</li>
            <li> After 2 weeks of using this product as a base and top coat, my nails grew long and strong!</li>
            <li> My nails are strong and long, with no more peeling and breaking.</li>
            <li> I have super weak nails and this provided steady growth.</li>
            <li> But once my nails reached a certain size- especially if they were wet to any degree-</li>
            <li> For the first time in 46 years, I have nails that grow so long that they are actually too long</li>
            <li> And all the other remarks about how it really does improve your nails still</li>
            <li> I see some other review where the person has pain, but I am gathering that having years of acrylic tips, it must have damaged the nails so much that anything just painted on now without</li>
            <li> This product strengthens my nails so much that I can grow them to the point of actually having to trim them back because they are too long!  </li>
            <li> which causes the polish to last longer, I guess my nails were growing out soft prior to using this which cause the nail polish to break and peel off faster.  </li>
            <li> I have had thin nails that peel for my entire life and have never been able to grow my nails at all.  </li>
            <li> only downfall of this product is that when I put it as a base coat then put color on then put this product as the top coat it tends to chip really easily.</li>
            <li> Having grown nails all my life (wink) and having continuously colored, doused them with chemicals, painted on acrylics, gels, etc, my poor fingernails have taken a beating low these many years.</li>
            <li> I have tried many nail strengtheners in the past and I was always let down.</li>
            <li> first time in ages my nails haven&#x27;t split down the middle.</li>
            <li> When i first applied it, i did have a little burning sensation in my pinky</li>
            <li> When I first started using Rejuvacote, I had just stopped biting my nails, and they had grown out a little -</li>
            <li> I will never use another clear polish product as long as they keep making this stuff.</li>
            <li> I was really hopeful after reading the other reviews, but now I am just convinced that there is no hope for my nails - especially not this!</li>
            <li> So even when I was trimming my nails to the bare minimum height, they&#x27;d still chip off from the middle.</li>
            <li> I was turned on to this product by a fellow nurse who&#x27;s natural nails were long and strong.&lt;br</li>
            <li> i&#x27;ve been using a few months and for the first time in my life my nails are thicker and longer and can withstand wear and tear.  </li>
            <li> I regularly use Rejuvacote as my standard base coat under nail polish, but if my nails start to break, crack or peel usually due to my own abuse doing gardening or cleaning, I just begin applying an additional top coat daily as instructed.  </li>
            <li> this product and Duri Rejuvacote goes on my clean nails as a base coat and then over my nail polish as a top coat.  </li>
            <li> My hands are always saturated in cleaning products, alcohol, and citrus which is super hard on them</li>
            <li> this product came recommended after i redeemed a groupon for a mani pedi and was complaining about my normally strong nails, which have become weak and splitting recently.</li>
            <li> So far the only drawback is that if I use it as a base coat, the nail polish I put on top peels right off.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product and my nails are much stronger and thicker, the peeling is less.</li>
            <li> i bought this for my mom&#x27;s nails as she has thin nails that tear easily and are just all around unhealthy---even with taking supplements.  </li>
            <li> Its pretty thick and u can&#x27;t use after polish b/c if the polish chips and u want to do a spot touch up, you will see the difference from the old polish (applied 2days ago) and the touch up b/c</li>
            <li> Results are good, not as dramatic as I was expecting, especially after switching to using it a few times a week vs. daily.</li>
            <li> Rejuvacote is really good at repairing the nails and making them stronger, but it stained my nails a hot pink color when used as a base.</li>
            <li> This one will actually change splitting, thin, weak nails into strong smooth nails.</li>
            <li> After getting my nails done several times they become thin and break easily.</li>
            <li> Even when I clean or wash dishes...of course they get soft but once fully dry, they are hard again!</li>
            <li> Having weak, thin nails like I do, this is great stuff.</li>
            <li> I began nail vitamins and saw little real improvement.  </li>
            <li> I have very weak and peeling nails and after 2 months using it every day (almost) they had became lot better.</li>
            <li> It makes my nails super strong and they grow like crazy!</li>
            <li> My nails grow  fast and they no longer split and crack way down on the sides before the nail even grew out!  </li>
            <li> Out of countless nail strengthening products I&#x27;ve tried over the last couple of years, this is one of the very few I&#x27;ve gotten positive results with.</li>
            <li> It took me about 2 months, but now all my nails are hard with pretty white tips, including the pinkies!</li>
            <li> Long story short, I got similar results when I started drinking a bottle of water</li>
            <li> I feel like my nails might be a little stronger, but can&#x27;t tell if they are growing any faster than normal.</li>
            <li> After a few weeks I have found that my nails are hard and strong.</li>
            <li> I only had the burning sensation once but other than that, I&#x27;ve had no other side effects.</li>
            <li> I recommend this to anyone who has bad nails and wants to make it strong.</li>
            <li> I used duri rejuacote and within one week I was shocked at how strong and how much my nails grew.</li>
            <li> My nails get very hard and strong due to this polish.</li>
            <li> My nails have never been this long in my entire life to get to this point</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t use it long enough to say whether it did or didn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li> I will update after using long enough to see if it quits the splitting of nails.</li>
            <li> I like the product, but haven&#x27;t used it long enough to see if it will help my nails to grow and get stronger.  </li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t had it long enough to decide.</li>
            <li> and they last amazingly long times.</li>
            <li> I tried to leave it on there for as long as possible but eventually took it of with nail polish remover.</li>
            <li> -i actually have to cut them when they get too long instead of them just breaking all the time.</li>
            <li> I always have the hardest time getting all my nails to grow long enough to paint them.</li>
            <li> My nails generally never grow.</li>
            <li> My natural nails have grown out about half way</li>
            <li> After that you can use it less frequently.</li>
            <li> It goes on clear and provides a nice base coat.</li>
            <li> I was very surprised, to say the least, and went back to amazon reviews to see whether I was the only one having such a problem with this product.</li>
            <li> The other day I even went with bare nails to work</li>
            <li> Makes my nails so strong and I can grow them so long, they look fake.  </li>
            <li> I am weak nail beds, and applying this daily has made my nails grown &amp; become so much stronger!</li>
            <li> My nails weren&#x27;t damaged from acrylics, they are just very thin and tend to peel and break easily.</li>
            <li> The second week I tried it as a base coat under a color, and the nail polish chipped and peeled MUCH more quickly than it usually does.</li>
            <li> My nails no longer split, they are hard and they grow fast.</li>
            <li> and when i put it on over polish every other day, it takes about 5 minutes to dry vs 1 minute on bare nails..</li>
            <li> I had artificial acrylic nails for many years.</li>
            <li> I have very short and stubby wide fingernails.</li>
            <li> I tried every nail hardener under the sun I even went as far as spending 40 bucks on this kit that was supposed to work wonders what a waste of time and money...</li>
            <li> Believe it or not, I now have to clip my nails because they grow so long.</li>
            <li> Lasts a long time.  </li>
            <li> My nails was exfoliating for a long time and I always suffered because of this.</li>
            <li> I cant give it a rave review because I havent been using it that long</li>
            <li> so my hands are constantly getting wet, even with gloves.</li>
            <li> I never had naturally long nails.  </li>
            <li> Never had long nails until I used this.</li>
            <li> My nails are long- about a 1/4 inch long-</li>
            <li> I could never let them grow long.</li>
            <li> My nails look natural and I don&#x27;t have to worry about the harsh treatment of gel nails.</li>
            <li> I have long nails.  </li>
            <li> I have grown my nails to the point that they get too long</li>
            <li> Like I said in the beginning, if you apply this after long term wear of acrylic nails, beware.</li>
            <li> not to mention extraa long.</li>
            <li> long that I had to cut them.</li>
            <li> also as of now there are no peels and my nails are growing longer than I&#x27;ve seen in a long time.</li>
            <li> The product goes on your nails fairly clear, with a slight pink tint...</li>
            <li> but so far my nails do feel much harder and less bendable like before.</li>
            <li> but I got too lazy to go out and buy a new one</li>
            <li> Since my experience, I have read other reviews of others having the same experience.</li>
            <li> I did not experience any pain from the initial application, as some other reviewers indicated.</li>
            <li> I have tried several other from OPI to Nailtiques and this blows them out of the water.  </li>
            <li> My nails havesn&#x27;t been this long in years!</li>
            <li> The biggest problem I now have as a result of the use of Rejuvacote is that I&#x27;m now having to CLIP my nails as they&#x27;re growing too long!</li>
            <li> I read other reviews where people said the same thing.</li>
            <li> I now have nails that look better than any of the fake nails I use to pay for!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried other products over the years but always come back to rejuvacote.</li>
            <li> So far (two weeks), my very weak nails have not broken or peeled.  </li>
            <li> This has helped my nails by adding a hard protective surface, my nails are still fragile, but this gives them some strength they lost after I stopped going to my manicurist for a &amp;#34;fill&amp;#34; three times a month.. and let my natural nails grow out.  </li>
            <li> I have been a nail biter and cuticle picker for a very long time.</li>
            <li> a friend recommended this product to me for dry, splitting nails.  </li>
            <li> - Dry, brittle, splitting and would not grow for over a year</li>
            <li> Let this dry for about five minutes.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for the last few years and it&#x27;s terrific.  </li>
            <li> A few days later I attempted to apply it again, only this time I used a thinner amount on my nails.</li>
            <li> A girlfriend specifically suggested I order Rejuvacote as it made such a difference in her nails, and told me to order through Amazon as it was extremely expensive (but worth it) in the beauty stores.</li>
            <li> Which is very annoying because I used to have long beautiful nails.&lt;br</li>
            <li> My polish has been on for almost a week now without a single chip --</li>
            <li> I was bummed that mine took so long to receive, and when it finally came half the bottle had spilled during shipping.</li>
            <li> My fingers started to hurt, and if you pressed down on the nail bed, it felt as if I had bitten my nails too short.</li>
            <li> in fact I have had to cut them down several times!  </li>
            <li> I was skeptical at first, my nails were very short and extremly brittle.</li>
            <li> but you only get to use half bottle before it gets thick)&lt;br /&gt;Good</li>
            <li> Over the last few years I&#x27;ve tried stopping, but it takes SO long to see the results of my hard-earned efforts.</li>
            <li> Made my cuticles very dry.</li>
            <li> I had acrylic nails for 11 years before my real nails became too weak to withhold the acrylic.  </li>
            <li> have very flimsy and weak nails.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always had very brittle, weak nails.</li>
            <li> This bottle is weak, it did not work, my nails have not grown much at all.</li>
            <li> Lastly, wrap a little cotton around the stick or use a Qtip dipped in alcohol to remove any oils from the nail.</li>
            <li> I saw there was a little left</li>
            <li> Use as directed and you can&#x27;t loose!</li>
            <li> This is the only thing I have found that actually keeps my nails in shape with hardly any breaks</li>
            <li> I experienced horrible burning!</li>
            <li> but after long term use I found it caused small white marks to appear on my nails.  </li>
            <li> After using this for a few weeks I cannot believe something finally worked.</li>
            <li> Do not buy it, it is a waste of money, it doesn&#x27;t work at all, my nail are still fragile!!!!</li>
            <li> I have spent hundreds of dollars on nail products that were supposed</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just that when they come in they will be harder.</li>
            <li> /&gt;After a few weeks of using this progress religiously I couldn&#x27;t be happier.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I expected something of a miracle.  </li>
            <li> I put a coat on when i got home and a few minutes later</li>
            <li> I filed off any rough edges, and am applying as directed.  </li>
            <li> The downside is this (and read it carefully).  </li>
            <li> I found even if I only applied it once and wore it for a few days it still worked.</li>
            <li> so applying everyday is no big deal.</li>
            <li> I spent a lot of money with artifical nails.</li>
            <li> Years ago I had no problem with growing my nails out – but over the last few years they tend to split and peel and just catch on either my hair in the shower or whatever and rip.</li>
            <li> After a friend raved about this product and insisted I tried it by giving me her partially used bottle to try out, I was hooked.</li>
            <li> The box containing the bottle was crushed and upon opening it, I discovered that the bottle had leaked.  </li>
            <li> My nails are harder and now grow out stronger-</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t help with breakage much and made my peeling nails worse.</li>
            <li> Use it as directed either by itself or as a base coat and top coat for regular polish.  </li>
            <li> Use it as base coat, top coat and once daily over polished nails</li>
            <li> I used OPI base coat, two coats of OPI polish, and Rejuvacote as a top coat only.</li>
            <li> My nails are on the thin side, so perhaps that is why I had that reaction, but I assume most people using this product have thin nails.  </li>
            <li> I have been a chronic nail biter for YEARS, and it has completely destroyed my nails to where they are fragile, brittle, and thin.</li>
            <li> They were constantly spliting on the sides and as a former nail biter, I couln&#x27;t leave them alone once I noticed a split, which means I would usually end up ripping them, and that often meant ripping them down to the quick.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I followed the instructions and after putting on the initial base coat, it said to reapply a top coat every other day.  </li>
            <li> nails not only seem to grow a bit quicker, they&#x27;re now stiff as a board.</li>
            <li> I only had a very slight improvement.</li>
            <li> For the last few months, my nails were extremely worn out due to motherhood, lack of sleep, travel...</li>
            <li> It doen&#x27;t hurt unless you have very weak nails which is completely normal, in that case you should only apply it to the tips of the nail for like a week</li>
            <li> A few days later I tried it as just a topcoat over normal polish, thinking my nails were just too thin from acrylic damage.</li>
            <li> My fingernails were very thin, peeled easily, and never grew due to past acrylic nail abuse.  </li>
            <li> I was in bad shape after some bad gel nails &amp; this helped get my nails healthy &amp; strong again.</li>
            <li> It does take longer than I&#x27;m used to to dry, but I&#x27;m noticing less peeling on my nails.</li>
            <li> However as a base coat and top coat remains to be seen if it does job to strengthen nails that always split before they can grow long.</li>
            <li> (That&#x27;s slight exaggeration, but I&#x27;ve yet to see a single one bend, tear, or even give way when I place pressure on the tips.  </li>
            <li> Ladies when you do dishes and/or any other housework where your hands are continually immersed in water.</li>
            <li> i&#x27;m not sure if it was because i used acetone to remove my polish as opposed to regular nail polish remover</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t work like the other I have used.  </li>
            <li> Now I am ordering this product for three other friends who want nails like mine.  </li>
            <li> but I have since quit using the product and the small white marks</li>
            <li> It never happened to me before when I used other products.</li>
            <li> This helps my nails grow unlike any other product I have ever used.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried other mail growth products and no changes.</li>
            <li> There is misinformation about the danger of ingredients in Rejuvacote and other nail hardeners and polishes.  </li>
            <li> Love this product been using it for a couple of years now and hasn&#x27;t disappointed me yet.</li>
            <li> Great product ... using as a help to weak nails and base coat.  </li>
            <li> They&#x27;re growing out longer little by little, and my nails are starting to harden.</li>
            <li> read the instruction on the bottle carefully and follow them!</li>
            <li> When I bring this to my salon the manicurists say they have other customers that bring theirs in too.  </li>
            <li> I tried every type of hardener, strengthener products sold at drug stores, other retails stores, hair salons and nothing seemed to make a difference.</li>
            <li> Use it every other day over your polished nails, and it looks like you just stepped out of the salon.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used other products that promise to strengthen nails and they did not work for me.....</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried lots of products in the past, but this one is the only one that&#x27;s ever worked for me.</li>
            <li> I had always thought it was the norm for my polish to last no more than a week before it had started to chip &amp; peel.  </li>
            <li> Although, I&#x27;ve noticed I have to be very careful when I apply it, because if even the smallest amount gets on my cuticle or skin, it will burn and sting, feeling pretty uncomfortable.</li>
            <li> I am very careful about not having oil on my nails before applying, so</li>
            <li> I purchased this a couple years ago when I was having some trouble during dry winter months with my fingernails.  </li>
            <li> I normally do not write product reviews however, I truly  believe in this product that I will waste 10 minutes of my time writing this review.  </li>
            <li> I feel as though it is helping slightly to strengthen my nails, but was quite disappointed that it peals off, even if it is used as a Top Coat, which it recommends to</li>
            <li> Not worth it to me.</li>
            <li> I used duri as a base and top coat and would apply another coat maybe twice in the week</li>
            <li> Love this base coat and always use it.</li>
            <li> I put it on often and use it as a base and top coat.</li>
            <li> I know they use this as a a base coat at many salons, and now I understand why my salon manicures always chip</li>
            <li> I use it for a base coat and then for a top coat between manicures.</li>
            <li> Use it as a base coat and my nails never looked better.  </li>
            <li> I always use Rejuvacote as my base and top coat when applying nail polish.  </li>
            <li> I use it as my base and top coat all the time now.</li>
            <li> Use it for base and top coat.  </li>
            <li> I get weekly manicures and use Rejuvacote as my base and top coats.  </li>
            <li> I use this as a base coat and a top coat to keep them from peeling.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m skeptical of new polishes, they all usually have the same effect which is nothing.</li>
            <li> about 2 weeks ago it broke down to the nail bed</li>
            <li> /&gt;Before you sit down and polish your nails</li>
            <li> This polish never lets me down.  </li>
            <li> and I cut them down and start over again.  </li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m having to cut them down.</li>
            <li> After using this every other day, or even every 3 days for 2-3 weeks, my nails shoot out like claws!</li>
            <li> and I now have to trim them every other week!  </li>
            <li> I think this does help i dont know if i saw crazy results right away though, but it did help my nails become stronger</li>
            <li> that the other hardener that I purchase from amazon a few months ago.</li>
            <li> i stared using it everyday as directed and now am usingit every other day.  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t want to waste my money on the nail salon and then having to go every other week for refills.</li>
            <li> (and at half the price.)</li>
            <li> /&gt;was half of what I would pay at my salon...</li>
            <li> I then searched Amazon and found it for much less and ordered it.  </li>
            <li> This is seriously the only thing that has worked on them EVER.</li>
            <li> I made the mistake of clipping my cuticles- nicked myself slightly on one finger- then putting the Rejucavote on.</li>
            <li> I made the mistake of clipping my cuticles- nicked myself slightly on one finger- then putting the Rejucavote on.</li>
            <li> I had been using nailtique in formula 2 plus for about a month and a half</li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s possible anything would hurt nails and tissue that is in such poor condition!</li>
            <li> I have seen a lot of growth since using this and a lot less breaks.</li>
            <li> I have been using it for less than 3 months and my nails are quite literally transformed.</li>
            <li> I just recently decided to give my nails a rest from the acrylics and was quite shocked to realize how much damage they did to my nails.  </li>
            <li> I found Rejuvacote on Amazon, paid considerably less than retail, and received it in LESS time than promised.</li>
            <li> I now have long nails that are HARD</li>
            <li> once I decided I no longer wanted them and had them removed my nails of course were a mess.</li>
            <li> I am someone who uses my hands as tools and my nails were a mess.</li>
            <li> I have spent a lot in the past because my nails do not grow and when they do, they break.</li>
            <li> so when i took them off my nails were a mess.</li>
            <li> My nails tend to be a mess, and someone online recommended Duri Rejuvacote.  </li>
            <li> For the past 15+ years, my nails have been soft, weak and peeling.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t like the Sally Hansen crap because it would peel off so easily</li>
            <li> I received this and have used it for a little over a week now and have already noticed that my nails are growning and are even stronger.  </li>
            <li> my nails had little baby holes in it</li>
            <li> and my nails started to grow out a little.  </li>
            <li> If you have even the slightest little cut around your nailbeds I wouldn&#x27;t use this product until it&#x27;s healed.  </li>
            <li> They are not super-thick but they are getting thicker and stronger every day and every little bump and scrape does not break or chip them.  </li>
            <li> If I stop using my nails get weak again and split, but with continuous use it definitely delivers.</li>
            <li> give yourself a little manicure.</li>
            <li> I start to get a little length.  </li>
            <li> My nails had already grown out a little before I got this product, but since I&#x27;ve been using it, I&#x27;ve already seen an improvement in my nails.</li>
            <li> I started using it a little over 2 months ago.  </li>
            <li> This product was supposed to help grow and harden my nails, but three weeks later, my nails are still weak and breakable.</li>
            <li> I know it sounds a little vain, but every day I look at my nails and can&#x27;t help admiring them.  </li>
            <li> I look down at my hands and still can&#x27;t believe those are my nails!</li>
            <li> I tried using it as a base coat for nail polish, as recommended, and within two days the polish was flaking off in huge swaths.</li>
            <li> The BIOTIN is what is really working, my nails are growing like crazy</li>
            <li> I have been waiting for the gels to grow out and have been left with thin, peeling nails...</li>
            <li> So far as I know, difficult to find elsewhere (shops, etc)</li>
            <li> I missed a few days here and</li>
            <li> You must use it everyday and tend to your nails for it to work.  </li>
            <li> just so curious as to why there was no mention of this in any of the reviews, or at least the ones that i had</li>
            <li> highley suggest  this product, to any one that has trouble growing nails.</li>
            <li> I literally have been using it everyday like the instructions</li>
            <li> Helps strengthen my clients nails and provides a smooth base before Polish.</li>
            <li> It took a few weeks to see a difference in my nails</li>
            <li> but I just kept using the rejuvacote everyday.</li>
            <li> I thought the pain would go away in a few minutes</li>
            <li> After a few seconds I realized that my finger was burning.</li>
            <li> I know they say put in on everyday for a week</li>
            <li> I had gels and knew they would destroy my nails when I had the gel removed.  </li>
            <li> nails forever have been short because they do not  grow and when they would they would be so thin</li>
            <li> I do think the product is so heavy it cuts off all circulation and oxygen to the nails.  </li>
            <li> What a waste of money.  </li>
            <li> Works if used everyday according to directions.  </li>
            <li> She always  gets deep ridges and breaks; mine just won&#x27;t grow and are paper thin.</li>
            <li> It looked like under my nails were bleeding and then the blood dried.  </li>
            <li> I had some irritation when used everyday.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it as recommended on the box (use as base coat, then top coat every day) and it was miraculous, to say the least.</li>
            <li> They break almost everyday when I do mundane things like opening a door, or cooking, or taking a shower!  </li>
            <li> I can now grow them to the length of what I previously had my acrylics at!  </li>
            <li> As a loyal G.H. subscriber, I have never been disappointed in any product they review or suggest trying.  </li>
            <li> I am very tough on my nails, due to various household tasks including gardening, cleaning ect.and</li>
            <li> Nails still not strong.  </li>
            <li> It is very subtle and does not diminish a final color.  </li>
            <li> BUT.............at around my 5th week of no acrylics I decided to give it another try and NO BURNING except very slightly on 1 or 2 fingers.</li>
            <li> bought this as a slightly cheaper alternative to OPI Nail Envy, but I think that I will have to switch back to the Nail Envy, especially for use as a base coat under other nail polish.</li>
            <li> They are thin and too flimsy to grow long.  </li>
            <li> can I see it working over these past few weeks</li>
            <li> I was VERY skeptical because my nails are extremely thin, break easily, peel, bend, and they always had these sort of &amp;#34;V&amp;#34; shaped splits that went right to the skin at the base of my nail.</li>
            <li> They were thin, dry and flaky.  </li>
            <li> My nails were a mess to say the least.</li>
            <li> I have absolutely nothing bad to say about this product.</li>
            <li> I began using a product to strengthen them that had worked for me in the past.  </li>
            <li> No more split nails.  </li>
            <li> Not sure how it does,</li>
            <li> I was skeptical as I have never found a nail strenghtener that actually worked.  </li>
            <li> It is unbelievable.  </li>
            <li> They usually don&#x27;t grow longer than the tips of my fingers.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using everyday for a bit over a month and the results are beyond my imagination!</li>
            <li> did read the other reviews about how some people were feeling pain when they applied the polish to weak acryllic nails.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll never go back to fake nails.</li>
            <li> I usually have my nail polish on for 3 weeks.</li>
            <li> Since using it the past 3 months, my nails have never been stronger.</li>
            <li> My nails started to break and split this past weekend</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t get past day 4 before it all started chipping off</li>
            <li> My nails felt stronger.my nails haven&#x27;t been breaking been growing faster then usual.</li>
            <li> I usually just use one coat of color as I find it lasts longer.</li>
            <li> where it hurts-&lt;br /&gt;it seems to happen when I get lazy with applying the product..</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really not sure how to rate this product.  </li>
            <li> I was skeptical when I first started using this product because in the past everything else I have used has failed.</li>
            <li> Ugh, waste of money!</li>
            <li> so i wonder if ill have the same reaction.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m not sure.</li>
            <li> My nails naturally grow slow now due to a bad nail salon experience in February</li>
            <li> I wore acrylics for over ten years and after removing them my nails split horizontally at the tips - very frustrating.</li>
            <li> I want strong, long nails so badly, but now I&#x27;m afraid to try anything else!</li>
            <li> but after awhile I noticed it dried them near the cuticles out badly.</li>
            <li> My fingers went from very hard thumbnails to very weak, soft, and slow growing pinky nails, with each nail getting progressively weaker.</li>
            <li> So weak that when I washed dishes the hot water felt painful and even burned my finger nails.</li>
            <li> I usually fail to keep nails as long as the end of my fingers.</li>
            <li> This is what helped me grow my nails, my nails use to be so weak they would break everyday</li>
            <li> Duri makes them hard and sturdy.</li>
            <li> AND IT WAS HARD TO REMOVE FROM THE CARTON.</li>
            <li> for making my nails stronger, i dont see a difference in this from the sally hansen hard as nails..</li>
            <li> I used nailtiques and it just made my nails hard but also brittle.</li>
            <li> My nails are so hard to grow.</li>
            <li> My nails are hard and longer now.</li>
            <li> They have a hard time growing.</li>
            <li> Stays on for a least a week without peeling.</li>
            <li> and I can imagine it burning quite a bit after having acrylics, so I would not suggest to put it on until you&#x27;ve had acrylics off for a least 1 month.</li>
            <li> Something that seems to be a common problem.  </li>
            <li> I can at least polish my nails now when going out for dinner.  </li>
            <li> I applied one coat late at night.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not a specialist, but it is somewhat common sense.</li>
            <li> well, my manicure stays for at least a week.  </li>
            <li> If I could give negative stars, I would.</li>
            <li> was shocked when i put it on to see that it&#x27;s basically just clear nail polish and not something that penetrates the nail</li>
            <li> My nails were broken and split and really looked bad.</li>
            <li> My nails were in rough shape because of me putting on fake nails/tips.</li>
            <li> THEN I had fake nails put on and took those off, so my nails were in ROUGH shape.</li>
            <li> the rejuvacote is so thick.  </li>
            <li> but I am guessing its a slow process</li>
            <li> Unfortunately the product doesn&#x27;t work like all the other I have used.  </li>
            <li> it was unbelievable!</li>
            <li> No more dishing out $35 per manicure!  </li>
            <li> no breaks or splitting for the past two months!</li>
            <li> By itself Rejuvacote is no better than Sally Hansen products!</li>
            <li> I used this as directed and within 2 weeks I had seriously longer stronger nails.  </li>
            <li> They look ridiculous.  </li>
            <li> It repaired my thin nails due to remove the fake one&#x27;s...</li>
            <li> so I can share this little secret with my sister and mother!</li>
            <li> The leak was bad enough to basically glue the bottle to the inside of the box.  </li>
            <li> Not a good choice for me.</li>
            <li> I have had acrylic nails for years and finally decided to take them off, only to find my nails were brittle, thin, and horribly damaged.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not too thick, it&#x27;s not too thin</li>
            <li> Which is no big deal, but its not a very good base when doing your nails.</li>
            <li> If your nails are painful or sore because of it, it&#x27;s because you did not follow the direction you MUST apply ONE base coat on your nails daily, if you apply more than one base coat you may experience pain or discomfort on your nails.</li>
            <li> After a week, I noticed the difference on my nails and they are hard!</li>
            <li> I tried everything to keep them nice, from acrylics to shellac, the ending result being miserably flimsy and painfully split nails.</li>
            <li> my weak nails feel rock hard!</li>
            <li> My nails are in terrible shape for the first time in 6 years.  </li>
            <li> My nails were weak and splitting.  </li>
            <li> I have struggled all my life with weak, splitting nails.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been struggling with weak brittle nails for some time.  </li>
            <li> She then said my nails looked weak.  </li>
            <li> I have used this product before to help with weak, brittle nails.</li>
            <li> A friend recommended this product to me for my weak, peeling nails.  </li>
            <li> After years of acrylic nail use to cover up my weak, damaged nails (I&#x27;m a nurse)</li>
            <li> So my nails were weak.</li>
            <li> Nails were weak, peeling, and brittle.</li>
            <li> I was doing gel and my already weak nails got weaker.</li>
            <li> If you have weak nails or nails that just don&#x27;t grow, then this product is for you.</li>
            <li> and i was disappointed to see i was running low on nailtiques.</li>
            <li> A friend recommended me to purchase this item as my nails are weak and chip/break all the time.  </li>
            <li> This is because the nail bed is so weak, the product is reaching the nerve of the fingernail.</li>
            <li> Duri Rejuvacote is like a miracle for weak, peeling nails.</li>
            <li> My nails started to become brittle and weak.</li>
            <li> Three years after removing acrylics, my nails were still weak and peeling.</li>
            <li> Since it chips within two days it takes layers off of my nail causing them to become weak all over again.</li>
            <li> When I found this product, I found the solution to my weak, peeling nails.</li>
            <li> My nails have always been weak and years of nail polish and shellac use had made them even worse.</li>
            <li> I have weak thin nails that tend to chip and peel.</li>
            <li> Even when I trim or file them, my nails are very hard and not see through paper thin anymore.  </li>
            <li> My nails were growing very slowly</li>
            <li> No more acrylics!!</li>
            <li> My nails were routinely frayed and peeling at the ends, and failed to grow - leaving me with ugly, short nails.</li>
            <li> They were thin</li>
            <li> I got tired of running around</li>
            <li> My nails were thin after 2 years of gel polish manicures.  </li>
            <li> I have a condition that makes my nails paper thin.</li>
            <li> My nails were in worse condition after using it.  </li>
            <li> The only drawback is that you must switch it out every now and again to avoid yellowing nails if you are using as a base coat.</li>
            <li> I bought this as a recommendation to strengthen my nails and to serve as a simple base coat.</li>
            <li> I have wrestled with thin nails all my life.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if it was that my nails were so thin from the acrylic that the polish seeped through and irratated me under my nails or</li>
            <li> but my nails were still paper thin.  </li>
            <li> Four years ago, without my knowing, I had contacted a heart infection (periocarditis) and my nails became paper thin and bent and broke.  </li>
            <li> I had always either went to a nail salon or used the glue-on nails but got tired of the upkeep of both.</li>
            <li> I am 60+ and my nails have always been thin and brittle.  </li>
            <li> I have not experienced the burning issue</li>
            <li> It works wonders and I learned my lesson to never leave it behind.</li>
            <li> I began wearing acrylics but grew tired of the cost and time it took to maintain them.  </li>
            <li> and I haven&#x27;t broken a  nail in months.</li>
            <li> This may be because my nails were so thin</li>
            <li> To make matters worse, i put acrylics on for over a year</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t had a broken nail is over six months</li>
            <li> I have started using it again as I have a wedding to attend and don&#x27;t want stumpy, thin nails.</li>
            <li> My nails have always been thin and prone to splitting.  </li>
            <li> Now I do not have to pay for false nails.</li>
            <li> Ridiculous!  </li>
            <li> My nails broke if the wind blows seriously!  </li>
            <li> If you use this product every day for two weeks, you will see a dramatic difference.</li>
            <li> No more fake nails/tips for me!</li>
            <li> my nails are very thin and weak, and no suppliments or diet changes have helped.</li>
            <li> I had tried gel polish and after using it my nails had become quite weak!  </li>
            <li> If your nails are badly damaged from wearing acrylic or from some other source this could burn!!!</li>
            <li> but it is a life saver I went from having very weak nails that wouldnt grow</li>
            <li> but my nails were almost non existent and my nail beds were very weak.</li>
            <li> MY NAILS WERE VERY WEAK BEFORE USING THIS</li>
            <li> My nails kept chipping and breaking and we&#x27;re very weak.</li>
            <li> My nails were always very weak and would break as soon as they started growing.  </li>
            <li> My nails were thin, weak, and splitting from almost 2 years of acrylic nails and a bad habit of biting them.  </li>
            <li> What am I doing wrong?????</li>
            <li> My nails would always split and break, but now all my girlfriends ask if my nails are fake.</li>
            <li> I was a bit skeptical because she charged me $14 for the bottte.  </li>
            <li> only ONE base of it didnt hurt at all!</li>
            <li> They&#x27;ve always been short, they split vertically, peel and have had terrible ridges.  </li>
            <li> to touch base on the \\&quot;tingling\\&quot; / \\&quot;burning\\&quot; sensation a few people have mentioned...</li>
            <li> Tried everything from vitamins, wearing gloves doing dishes, expensive lotions and potions</li>
            <li> I use to get fake nails and became allergic to it.</li>
            <li> I believed I had nothing to lose...but was skeptical.</li>
            <li> I thought they crazy and being over dramatic.</li>
            <li> My nails were so very thin, peeled and cracked all the time.  </li>
            <li> I used to have acrylic nails and this made my nails very thin, so I bought Rejuvacote to revive them.  </li>
            <li> but they were very thin and peeling.</li>
            <li> I was very skeptical, after always having peeling, thin nails that break as soon as a</li>
            <li> but I guess I got a little on my finger and OMG!!!!!</li>
            <li> This stuff may work to strengthen/lengthen your nails, but it is NOT good as a base coat.</li>
            <li> I do not want.... or need artificial nails.  </li>
            <li> I have bever used artificial nails.</li>
            <li> I bought this product to help my nails after wearing artificial nails for years.  </li>
            <li> I was going crazy.  </li>
            <li> Afraid to use again.</li>
            <li> If you struggle with weak, ugly nails, you should buy this ASAP!</li>
            <li> This is one instance where I hate to say that the customer reviews on Amazon led me wrong.  </li>
            <li> I was very skeptical, but thought I would give it a try.  </li>
            <li> I had wraps for a while but hated being a slave to my nails plus when I took the wraps off my nails were worse than what I started with.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s impossible to find in stores.  </li>
            <li> I have terrible nails hoping this would help, one month later still terrible</li>
            <li> so i would always have fake acrylic nails and everytime I would take them off and my nails would be so bad!...</li>
            <li> I have always been one of those girls that had \\&quot;bad nails.\\</li>
            <li> a carcinogen??&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Plus, i read some of the reviews and saw that some people were having bad reactions to the Rejuvacote polish and think that this can be attributed to their sensitivity to formaldehyde.  </li>
            <li> so so so bad.</li>
            <li> bad-</li>
            <li> I have always had a bad habit of biting my nails.</li>
            <li> oh YES it was PAINFUL</li>
            <li> Well after the removal of the acrylics, my nails were paper thin and looked awful.</li>
            <li> It is painful and I would not recommend this product.</li>
            <li> It made me so sick at my stomach that I could not use it.</li>
            <li> My color chips within a day when I use this stuff. :(</li>
            <li> As I stated below, when I used this product as a base coat, followed by two coats of OPI polish, the results were disastrous.</li>
            <li> You won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
            <li> You won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
            <li> You will NOT be disappointed.</li>
            <li> Disappointed :(  </li>
            <li> think it makes your polish chip faster when used as base coat</li>
            <li> I use the Duri Rejuvacote as a base.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t worn it as a base since.</li>
            <li> I paint my nails like twice a week, so every time I painted them I used this as my base coat.</li>
            <li> I use essie &amp;#34;grow stronger&amp;#34; base coat and essie &amp;#34;no</li>
            <li> It stung so bad when I had it on my nasty bitten nails.</li>
            <li> but it was bad!</li>
            <li> My nails were in very bad shape, always peeling and chipping.</li>
            <li> I am very disappointed by this product.  </li>
            <li> VERY DISAPPOINTED!</li>
            <li> I bring this bottle to the nail salon also, have the maicurist use it as my base coast, then a color polish (or not!)</li>
            <li> The odor is horrible.</li>
            <li> My experience with this was just horrible!!</li>
            <li> My nails split, were brittle, pealing, awful nails.  </li>
            <li> Which kinda drives me insane when polish chips, seems like I keep having to take off my polish and do it again</li>
            <li> It was awful.</li>
            <li> I have always had terrible nails.</li>
            <li> My nails were splitting terribly and were damaged by using shellac, etc.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> If you ever have a problem with your nails, this is the product to buy.  My nails were so very thin, peeled and cracked all the time.  But now after using Duri, my nails are beautiful.  I have already recommended it to several of my friends.</li>
            <li> Took me nearly 50 years to get great nails but it was worth the wait. This product is amazing. I look down at my hands and still can&#x27;t believe those are my nails!</li>
            <li> It is great.  My nails were splitting from Gel polish.  The Duri Rejuvacote fixed them.</li>
            <li> I used this as directed and did not see any great improvements with my nails.  Plus, you had to apply daily.</li>
            <li> Great Shine, but does nothing for the strength of my nails.</li>
            <li> My friends LOVE this...however I had an allergic reaction to it.  I gave it to my friend, who is enjoying it.</li>
            <li> I used to have acrylic nails and this made my nails very thin, so I bought Rejuvacote to revive them.  I&#x27;ve tried this product twice now and both times ended up using painkillers afterwards, because the pain was simply unbearable.  This is the only product that I can think of that resulted in me being in such pain.  I was very surprised, to say the least, and went back to amazon reviews to see whether I was the only one having such a problem with this product. Turns out, there is quite a number of people who reported the same reaction.  This simply cannot be normal and makes one question the safety of Rejuvacote. There is no mention of pain anywhere on the bottle or packaging. The fact that so many people experience such unintended side effects means there is something wrong with this product.  Perhaps, it should not be used at all, even by those who do no experience any pain.</li>
            <li> Amazing, really helps nails grow and stay chip free! I use this with Perfect Formula pink gel coat for extra whitening power.  My nails have never looked better!</li>
            <li> A nice big bottle for nail polish. It goes on clear and provides a nice base coat. I have super weak nails and this provided steady growth. I wouldn&#x27;t say it&#x27;s any better than Sally Hansen&#x27;s nail growth system though (and at half the price.) Still, it does what it&#x27;s supposed to do. This is a nail treatment though so it won&#x27;t fix your cuticles if you have ragged cuticles. (For that, I recommend Cutemol.)</li>
            <li> Looks great and my nail strength is improving.  The &amp;#34;pinkish&amp;#34; tint is very, very light in fact, it is almost clear.</li>
            <li> I have very short and stubby wide fingernails. I tried to grow them on my own, as soon as they would grow a little they would split and tear off.I put on acrylic nails just to cover them up. After using this for a few weeks I cannot believe something finally worked. EXCELLENT!! Ladies when you do dishes and/or any other housework where your hands are continually immersed in water. USE RUBBER GLOVES!!! And use this Miracle Nail Growth system and you won&#x27;t believe your eyes!!</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t do as promised.</li>
            <li> This stuff really makes your nails grow</li>
            <li> This product really does work, it makes your nails super strong. My nails would always break at the point where they were long, and finally I have been able to keep them long and strong. I would have given this product five stars but the polish chips off a lot, especially if you wash your hands frequently like I do for my job, but otherwise a great product. Hope this helps some of you to decide to get it, because I would recommend you do.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always had nails that tend to split in layers.  They are thin and too flimsy to grow long.  But my mom bought this and I used it.  I am hooked on it now!  I&#x27;ve found that the best way to use this is to clean your nails, removing oils, then use a buffing pad and buff horizontally to create microscopic ridges that help to keep the polish on longer.  Two coats is all you need and it dries almost instantly.  As my nails grow out and it&#x27;s time to add more, I remove the polish and repeat the process above with two fresh coats.  This product strengthens my nails so much that I can grow them to the point of actually having to trim them back because they are too long!  Truly a fantastic product!  You don&#x27;t need synthetic nails with this stuff.  You can grow your own!  Give it a try just once, and I believe you will continue with this product.  Well worth the price!  My daughter loves this too!</li>
            <li> Mom uses it and says its great to help keep long fingernails from splitting, chipping, breaking, etc.</li>
            <li> THIS PRODUCT IS TRULY WONDERFUL!! I had tried gel polish and after using it my nails had become quite weak!  I began using a product to strengthen them that had worked for me in the past.  I was getting nowhere.  My manicurist told me another of her clients was happy with REJUVACOTE.  I ordered it and applied it daily as per the directions. About 1/3 of the way through the bottle, I had long, strong, gorgeous nails, just as the magazine ad had promised!!  This product WORKS!!!  i just reordered 2 more bottles.  I do not want.... or need artificial nails.  [[ASIN:B001375EP0 Duri Rejuvacote]]</li>
            <li> I recently purchased 3 more bottles of Rejuvacote because it truly does stengthen nails. My fiancee and her mother use it and just love the results. I have witnessed the remarkable results too. They both have beautiful nails and they don&#x27;t chip anymore!!!</li>
            <li> I received this and have used it for a little over a week now and have already noticed that my nails are growning and are even stronger.  When i first applied it, i did have a little burning sensation in my pinky but it lasted all of 5-10 minutes then was fine.  i&#x27;m not sure if it was because i used acetone to remove my polish as opposed to regular nail polish remover but it wasn&#x27;t unbearable.  the product does what it says and i would definitely recommend.</li>
            <li> I tried every nail hardener under the sun I even went as far as spending 40 bucks on this kit that was supposed to work wonders what a waste of time and money... I cant remember how I came across Duri but it is a life saver I went from having very weak nails that wouldnt grow I&#x27;d get excited if they grew a cm and then they&#x27;d break... I started using duri along with China glaze nail polish (which has hardeners in them) I used duri as a base and top coat and would apply another coat maybe twice in the week my nails are now so long so strong and grow so fast that I find myself having to file them down to keep them to the length that I like. I even had a nail break about 2 weeks ago it broke down to the nail bed I can already see it over the tip of my finger. My nails have never been this long in my entire life to get to this point didnt happen over nite I did notice a change in stregnth and growth within a month but dont get overly excited and stop using it keep using it as much as you can it&#x27;s been four months for me and I cant begin to tell you how happy I am that I found this product</li>
            <li> I use this as a top coat and my manicure stays intact for over a week! My nails feel nice and solid when I apply a few coats. An added benefit is that this has helped me get rid of my nail biting habit -- I don&#x27;t want to mess up my nice, long nails! I am on my second bottle and love this stuff.</li>
            <li> I love it! My nails are going and I am happy</li>
            <li> I also  am a nurse who washes her hands hundreds of times a day. This product has given me such strong nails I have to cut them regularly or they grow so long and strong that I can not do my job! I LOVE IT! I also am giving a bottle to several friends for XMAS and have suggeted this to many of my co-workers!~</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m on my 4th bottle - and it&#x27;s rare that I rebuy something.  If I notice that the ends are starting peel between manicures, I just apply some and it keeps the nail from peeling or separating further.  I tried many others with no luck - which is why I&#x27;m now on my 4th bottle.</li>
            <li> It is great. I have been using for the last three years. And some of friends started using it as well. I really recommend it.</li>
            <li> My wife purchased this product and she says:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is fantastic!!  My nails were thin, weak, and splitting from almost 2 years of acrylic nails and a bad habit of biting them.  Rejuvacote fixed my nails and in a month I had stronger and longer nails.  My nails have never been so strong, and I&#x27;ve tried many nail strengthening products only to have them eventually fail me.  I&#x27;ve been using Rejuvacote for 3 months and my nails look great!!  You can&#x27;t find a better price than Amazon since most salons charge about $14.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for many years and when I had to order on line from these people I was thrilled to get it.  Unfortunately the product doesn&#x27;t work like all the other I have used.  It doesn&#x27;t work like the other I have used.  My nails are in terrible shape for the first time in 6 years.  I also have never paid more than $8.00 per bottle.</li>
            <li> definitely works!! after two weeks of using this products my nails are definitely stronger, longer, and healthier!!</li>
            <li> I always have bitten nails so i would always have fake acrylic nails and everytime I would take them off and my nails would be so bad!...They were thin they woudlnt grow so i would just bite at them and start the whole routine again! WELL not anymore I thought I would give this product a try seeing that there was excellent reviews...and I swear I have found the newest secret to grow nautural beautiful nails! I swear ive never had my natural nails so nice and healthy and all within 2 weeks or so you start seeing results....Thank you REjuvacote! I just wish they sold this in stores</li>
            <li> This stuff works wonders with nails.I work with horses on a daily basis and my nails still look awesome.Stays on for a least a week without peeling.Never chips!</li>
            <li> For the last few months, my nails were extremely worn out due to motherhood, lack of sleep, travel... So even when I was trimming my nails to the bare minimum height, they&#x27;d still chip off from the middle. Which is very annoying because I used to have long beautiful nails.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I have used the rejuvacote three times already and I have to say it is certainly very effective at hardening and strengthening the nails. I am so happy with the product I can&#x27;t wait to try my new nails with chores around the house. I can go back to painting my nails and them looking good. This is one of the best products that does actually strengthen nails from the first few uses. I def recommend it.</li>
            <li> This is THE BEST nail strengthener around. After years of acrylics and a nail infection my technician suggested I give my nails a &#x27;rest&#x27;. I always had very strong nails before acrylic and Couldn t believe how tissue paper thin they had become. I tried several brands of nail repair to no avail. I finally bought the duri shield from a dermatologist (twice the $). IT WORKS. My nails are strong once again!!!</li>
            <li> a friend recommended this product to me for dry, splitting nails.  it works well when applied every single day, but peels off a lot in between applications and if you forget a day, it almost doesn&#x27;t seem to do any good at all.  if you can commit to applying every day, it&#x27;s a great product.  not so great for those who don&#x27;t have time for the maintenance.</li>
            <li> it starts to peel after a day i had to apply more then one coat....idk whats in this product but it freaking burns....my nails had little baby holes in it so i google some of the things in it and it wasnt good do more researh on this product because it wasnt good for me !!!</li>
            <li> My nails were weak and splitting.  I went to Bed Bath and Beyond and the salesgirl said, \\&quot;Have you tried this new nail prduct?\\&quot;  I bought a bottle and after a month my nails are the envy of all my friends.  This stuff is great!!!  No more acrylics!! No more split nails.  Now I can do my own manicures and save lots of money.  Even my cuticles look great.  Thank you Duri!!!</li>
            <li> This is one instance where I hate to say that the customer reviews on Amazon led me wrong.  This product didn&#x27;t work for me at all simply because it didn&#x27;t stay put; it peeled off in sheets.  I even tried applying it right after I used nail polish remover to ensure a smooth, clean nail surface.  Same problem.  I wear gloves when I wash dishes, but this stuff couldn&#x27;t even make it through a normal daily shower without peeling off.  Ridiculous!  I don&#x27;t know if the product has been reformulated or what, but it just doesn&#x27;t work for me.  I&#x27;ll be switching back to Nail Envy by OPI and returning this stuff a.s.a.p.</li>
            <li> I have always been one of those girls that had \\&quot;bad nails.\\&quot; They never grew and would always split, flake, and break. After 2 weeks of using this product as a base and top coat, my nails grew long and strong! I now have almost perfect nails. I wear this product every day. When I&#x27;m wearing it by itself, people swear that I have a French manicure because it makes my nail tips super white. I recommend this product to everyone who compliments me on my nails. It&#x27;s definitely the best product out there.</li>
            <li> Letting the acrylic \\&quot;grow off\\&quot;.  Nails started to split.  Rejuvacote adding strength.  Love the product.  Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> My nails have always been fast to grow, but they were always so incredibly brittle and fragile. If they grew out, the slightest bump against something would cause them to break. They chipped and peeled like nothing else. I went to the nail salon to get some nail polish, and when I asked for a top coat, she gave me this. It was $12 (so buy it here!), but it was worth it! I followed the instructions to a T, and after about three weeks, I started to notice that my nails were stronger, they didn&#x27;t break, and they didn&#x27;t chip. This product REALLY works on strengthening your nails. Not sure how it does, but I&#x27;m sure it coats it and seals it because I had prior peeling on my nails and after about a couple of weeks, they were still there but they were almost sealed to the rest of my nail so I couldn&#x27;t peel them off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will say it didn&#x27;t make my nails grow, it just strengthened them so that when they did, they didn&#x27;t break off. I love this product and will certainly buy it again. Dries in maximum 60 seconds. Love it!</li>
            <li> I was a nail biter and acrylic nail wearer until a friend told me about this product.  I was very skeptical, but thought I would give it a try.  My nails were totally ruined from acrylics.  I used duri rejuacote and within one week I was shocked at how strong and how much my nails grew. I actually developed nails beds which I never had.  Now I am ordering this product for three other friends who want nails like mine.  Let me also say that I am no longer a nail biter.  [[ASIN:B000G33KEO Duri Cosmetics Rejuvacote 0.61oz]]</li>
            <li> I read all the reviews on these types of products.  I have tried others, but they didn&#x27;t seem to make my nails stronger so tried this.  I feel as though it is helping slightly to strengthen my nails, but was quite disappointed that it peals off, even if it is used as a Top Coat, which it recommends to do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had acrylic nails for many years.  Evidently, it will take me many years to get them back where they need to be.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If anyone knows of a product that works better then this, PLEASE let me know.</li>
            <li> Just received my new bottle of Rejuvacote.  Arrived in a timely fashinon and in good condition.  The price&lt;br /&gt;was half of what I would pay at my salon...</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t really expecting these to save my nails or anything, I just wanted to see if there was something better than the Sally Hansen stuff I&#x27;ve been getting from the drugstore. I didn&#x27;t like the Sally Hansen crap because it would peel off so easily and it just got to be a pain. I had read some of the reviews about how this would peel easily and it discouraged me a little but I figured \\&quot;hey it&#x27;s nail polish, that&#x27;s what happens\\&quot;. This does NOT peel at all it is really great! My nails are so much stronger with this on and I can imagine it burning quite a bit after having acrylics, so I would not suggest to put it on until you&#x27;ve had acrylics off for a least 1 month. Yes, maintaining them is a daily thing, but if you want nice nails then that&#x27;s just something you have to get used to. I&#x27;m fine with it, its been a couple months since I started using it and i put it on every day. It&#x27;s not too thick, it&#x27;s not too thin and it dries fast. Definitely give this a try.</li>
            <li> This is a product I&#x27;ve used for a couple of years now, and it has worked wonders on my soft, hard-to-grow nails.  I was purchasing it locally for more than it cost on line, so am delighted about that.</li>
            <li> I tried this after removing acrylic nails because of the terrific reviews. About 5 min after applying, my nail beds began to burn with intense discomfort. I thought this was just the product working, but the discomfort increased to PAIN and I finally had to remove the polish. Noticed red marks on the nail bed almost like the skin underneath was getting a chemical burn or something. I could not tolerate this product. A few days later I tried it as just a topcoat over normal polish, thinking my nails were just too thin from acrylic damage. Same reaction; about 5 min later intense burning began. Maybe it was because my nails were damaged from the acrylics, but isn&#x27;t that what this is advertised for? Since my experience, I have read other reviews of others having the same experience. I know it works great for most, but for some of us we have a reaction to something in this. I stick with Nail Aid now; no pain and good results.</li>
            <li> It really helps -- not 100% but more than anything else I&#x27;ve used. My nails have always been soft, breaking and splitting.[[ASIN:B000PW7K38 Duri Rejuvacote Nail Growth System .61 Fl.oz]]</li>
            <li> As of now...I still have had no results with this product.  I have used it exactly the way the directions were written on package....still no results....I will give it more time. The nails have not grown at all. What am I doing wrong?????</li>
            <li> Allows nails that never grew before to grow!! This is my second or third order and will continue to order for me, my mom, my sister and my friends!</li>
            <li> My wife and many of her friends swear by this product and it&#x27;s impossible to find in stores.  I bought it at Amazon.com and am very pleased with the purchase and the timeliness of delivery.</li>
            <li> I buy this for myself and friends.  IT WORKS!!</li>
            <li> This is an excellent product!  I started using it and that was the end of peeling, split and cracked nails.</li>
            <li> This product did not work for me. I saw no results and it didn&#x27;t go on as smooth as I liked. I switched to Sally Hanson&#x27;s green tea and olive growth and that showed me much better results. Could just be my nails and what nutrients I needed, doesn&#x27;t work for me, may still work for you.</li>
            <li> If you will be faithful in your daily application of this product, it will strengthen your nails!  Guaranteed!!  You will have the nails you always dreamed of!</li>
            <li> I picked up a few of these for my fiancee&#x27;s mom, who is a professional beautician and operates her own salon. Both she and her clients love this product and so for them, I have to rate it highly.</li>
            <li> Mady nails burn, had to stop use</li>
            <li> The first time I applied this I had a strange burning sensation in the last two fingers on each hand, however subsequent applications were fine. I&#x27;m using the product because I had acrylic nails removed. My natural nails have grown out about half way and they seem to be getting stronger. I would definitely recommend this product.</li>
            <li> So far (two weeks), my very weak nails have not broken or peeled.  However, I have found that I need to apply it every day to keep it that way.  Not a problem, since it dries very quickly.</li>
            <li> I am very disappointed by this product.  It MIGHT strengthen my nails if it were to stay on them!  I followed the instructions and after putting on the initial base coat, it said to reapply a top coat every other day.  Well the base coat was chipping by the end of the first day, and topping it off with a top coat just made it chip more.  VERY DISAPPOINTED! I was really hopeful after reading the other reviews, but now I am just convinced that there is no hope for my nails - especially not this!</li>
            <li> A beautician recommended Duri Rejuvacote after I mentioned that I have never been able to have long nails because they either split or break. I have tried so many products through the years and never ever worked, so although I was hesitate to believe, I still bought it. The product works! But make sure that you follow the instructions, and use it every day and after 7 days, remove with nail polish remover and re apply to start the 7 days process again. The first time I used it I thought it didn&#x27;t work but I was only putting it on once in a while. When I followed the directions, my nails grew strong &amp; long!</li>
            <li> I got talked into putting gels on my nails. What a mistake! I have been waiting for the gels to grow out and have been left with thin, peeling nails...ouch. I needed something to protect them and help them grow out and I needed it FAST. The Rejuvacote arrived so quickly and I have been using it ever since. Great product, great service...on the mend.</li>
            <li> Love this base coat and always use it. Some stores carry it and some don&#x27;t. I got tired of running around so when I found it on Amazon, I was thrilled and ordered it!</li>
            <li> I order this product in August. The shipping of this product was fast. I was skeptical at first, my nails were very short and extremly brittle. I have bever used artificial nails. The first week I had noticed a difference, it&#x27;s already past three weeks and I can&#x27;t believe the growth spurt I am experiencing with my nails. This stuff really works!!</li>
            <li> nails are much stronger now. Will keep on hand always</li>
            <li> does a great job.My nails have really improved!</li>
            <li> My nails were thin after 2 years of gel polish manicures.  I have been using this product for about 2 months, and there is a significant difference in my nails.  I use it with regular nail polish, and while it doesn&#x27;t last as long as the gel, I am happy with my nail health.  I did not experience any pain from the initial application, as some other reviewers indicated.</li>
            <li> I think this does help i dont know if i saw crazy results right away though, but it did help my nails become stronger</li>
            <li> I have struggled all my life with weak, splitting nails. I&#x27;ve had  acrylics for many years but tired of the maintenance. My nail tech introduced me to Rejuvacote about 2 months ago and I am amazed at my natural nails today. They are longer than they have been in decades, and strong and resilient!  \\&quot;This is the best nail strengthener I have ever seen,\\&quot; said my nail tech. She was right!</li>
            <li> Cannot believe how much my nails grow when using this stuff. I have a condition that makes my nails paper thin.</li>
            <li> I could be a spokeswoman for this stuff I swear. I tell people about it, give it as gifts, and CANNOT live without it!! It&#x27;s the only thing that has strengthened my nails and it completely transforms weak nails into long strong ones!! I started using it after I had acrylics taken off and I haven&#x27;t stopped! It does require that you use it frequently. At first you put a coat on every day and after a couple of weeks you will start seeing a difference. After that you can use it less frequently. I put it on often and use it as a base and top coat. It&#x27;s a great shine!</li>
            <li> I have used Rejuvacote for about 7 years and have purchased it as gifts for family and friends because it is so good.  It absolutely works to make nails retain their natural strength. I regularly use Rejuvacote as my standard base coat under nail polish, but if my nails start to break, crack or peel usually due to my own abuse doing gardening or cleaning, I just begin applying an additional top coat daily as instructed.  Within a short time I am able to file away the damage and my own nails are strong again.  This is a good price too.  The best local retail price I&#x27;ve found is $10, but often it is $14.95.</li>
            <li> My nails were in worse condition after using it.  I threw the product away.</li>
            <li> Used this product for a while and found it to really work but after long term use I found it caused small white marks to appear on my nails.  I don&#x27;t know what they are but I have since quit using the product and the small white marks have grown out.</li>
            <li> I had acrylic nails for 11 years before my real nails became too weak to withhold the acrylic.  When I took off the acrylic for good, to allow my real nails to breath and hopefully strengthen, they were very fragile and would literally fall away like sand when filed.  They would not grow back and were always breaking.  Once I started using Duri Rejuvacote they immediately began to \\&quot;shape up\\&quot;.  They&#x27;re now strong and healthy- I can now grow them to the length of what I previously had my acrylics at!  My nail polish stays on longer too; LOVE Rejuvacote!</li>
            <li> This stuff may work to strengthen/lengthen your nails, but it is NOT good as a base coat. The first week, I used it as a plain clear coat, with nothing on top, and it was fine, although it did chip and peel rather quickly. The second week I tried it as a base coat under a color, and the nail polish chipped and peeled MUCH more quickly than it usually does. I am very careful about not having oil on my nails before applying, so I know that was not the problem. I know they use this as a a base coat at many salons, and now I understand why my salon manicures always chip so quickly!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought this as a slightly cheaper alternative to OPI Nail Envy, but I think that I will have to switch back to the Nail Envy, especially for use as a base coat under other nail polish. My color chips within a day when I use this stuff. :(</li>
            <li> I love this product and have been using it for years.  Luckily I was able to purchase it on Amazon after the beauty store in my community closed</li>
            <li> Really strengthens the nail but should be used every day or night.</li>
            <li> For the first time in my life my nails actually got long and strong. I tried many nail strengtheners and this one was the best. I now get compliments at the salon that I have very beautiful nails. My nails would always split and break, but now all my girlfriends ask if my nails are fake.</li>
            <li> my nails turned yellow, became very brittle and did not grow at all. huge waste of money and time every day.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been struggling with weak brittle nails for some time.  This stuff has helped my nails tremendously!!  They are so much stronger only after a few uses and now I am getting some length.  You do have to be careful not to use too much.  I did at one point and a couple of nails became very sensitive but that has cleared up.  I highly recommend but of course use as directed.</li>
            <li> I was very pleased with the quick response to my order.  I am just now using the product, so I do not know about its quality, but have heard good reviews about it.  Thanks for your promptness in filling my order.</li>
            <li> I bought this product to help my nails after wearing artificial nails for years.  I put a coat on every day for a week and took it off.  I did that for about three weeks and my nails are stronger than before.  I enjoy showing them now more than I did about a month ago.</li>
            <li> I never heard of this product until I saw someone on youtube use it &amp; she recommended it. So I tried it. After for using it for a week, I noticed that my nails kept breaking. It never happened to me before when I used other products. So I stopped using Rejuvacote.</li>
            <li> I was at my hairdresser several months ago and she suggested I should have a manicure.  She then said my nails looked weak.  She recommended the Duri for my nails and said it would help them in a short period of time.  I was a bit skeptical because she charged me $14 for the bottte.  But sure enough it worked.  I then searched Amazon and found it for much less and ordered it.  It makes my soft nails -- harder and they grow without peeling.</li>
            <li> I love this product. I do my own nails and when I use this product my nails grow fast and strong.</li>
            <li> My best friend from France recommended this product-I don&#x27;t know how she discovered this- but it really works. After taking off artificial nails many times and coming back to them because I could not grow nice nails, I tried it again, using Rejuvacote, and, now, 1 month after, I can honestly say that my nails are hard and are growing nicely.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for about a month now and it is the best product I have ever used! I have tried about eveything out there to grow my brittle nails and this product is amazing! My nails are stronger than they have ever been!</li>
            <li> Wonderful product! Nails are stronger in no time. Have recommended to others who also swear by it. So far as I know, difficult to find elsewhere (shops, etc)</li>
            <li> I had given up having nice nails again.  A friend suggested I give this a try,  Outstanding.results</li>
            <li> Do not buy it, it is a waste of money, it doesn&#x27;t work at all, my nail are still fragile!!!!</li>
            <li> I have spent hundreds of dollars on nail products that were supposed do what this one does.  It&#x27;s amazing, I haven&#x27;t had one nail spit or break since I started using it about a month ago.&lt;br /&gt;Ladies, it is the best!!!</li>
            <li> used this when my nails were really damaged on my right hand. - Dry, brittle, splitting and would not grow for over a year - they hurt like I bit my nails or something.  Used this only once a week because it smells of formaldehyde and my nails started to grow out a little.  They would still split at first but they would grow - then they stopped splitting and now they are back to the healthy state they used to be</li>
            <li> Most amazing product for your nails you will ever use! Since I was younger my nails have been soft, bendable, they broke in layers, and I had a habit of biting them. I have also used many other products to make my nails hard and pretty like all my friends had. I tried opi, sally hansen, essi, herbal growth, vitamins for nails, etc. This is seriously the only thing that has worked on them EVER. After 2 weeks of using this product my nails looked like girl nails! It was amazing! People have actually noticed and have told me how nice they look. However, you must use this daily and as the directions say. I missed a few days here and there and my nails began to show it, they got soft again. I would recommend this product to anyone, especially those with ghastly nails like I had!</li>
            <li> Products works to strengthen nails and they begin improving and growing within two weeks.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff but you need to be careful who you buy it from.  I bought from another online vendor and the stuff was old and it did not work.  This vendor is selling fresh merchandise.  Thank you.</li>
            <li> I love this polish. My nails tend to be flimsy and peel all the time. Duri makes them hard and sturdy.</li>
            <li> For the first time in my life I have long nails. This stuff is amazing! Buy this and you won&#x27;t regret it. I will NEVER go without this stuff. I even bring it to the nail salon with me.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this stuff for years and it is one of the best products on the market for maintaining healthy strong nails. It also keeps your manicure looking great all week. I keep polish on my nails constantly and reapply this about 3-7 times per week. The only drawback is that you must switch it out every now and again to avoid yellowing nails if you are using as a base coat.</li>
            <li> I have very weak and peeling nails and after 2 months using it every day (almost) they had became lot better. It doen&#x27;t make your nails grow like crazy but makes them beautiful and strong. It doen&#x27;t hurt unless you have very weak nails which is completely normal, in that case you should only apply it to the tips of the nail for like a week or so.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;Dry fast on nails&lt;br /&gt;Long lasting cause is very liquid (not as quimica alemana which is good but you only get to use half bottle before it gets thick)&lt;br /&gt;Good price&lt;br /&gt;Doesn&#x27;t change your nail polish color&lt;br /&gt;Simple because is just one step&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;I think it makes your polish chip faster when used as base coat&lt;br /&gt;Couldn&#x27;t be wear alone because it peels fast&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll buy this again and again :D</li>
            <li> This product is amazing!!  For the past 15+ years, my nails have been soft, weak and peeling. I tried so many other hardening nail products, but  after using Duri Rejuvacote for only a month I started to notice a difference.  Now after 4 months, they have been transformed into strong, beautiful nails which I have to file to keep from growing too long!  I just followed the directions faithfully and I couldn&#x27;t be happier!!!!</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing I&#x27;ve had peeling flaky nails as long as I can remember my nails are hard and are actually growing I&#x27;ve recommend this to so many of my friends!</li>
            <li> Great product. It really helped my nails grow and not peel. Highly recommended to anyone with problem nails. Good price too</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s excellent for my soft nails.</li>
            <li> I was happy with the results.  Yes I would recommend this product to others.  It is easy and convenient to use.</li>
            <li> If your nails are painful or sore because of it, it&#x27;s because you did not follow the direction you MUST apply ONE base coat on your nails daily, if you apply more than one base coat you may experience pain or discomfort on your nails. After I got it I put more than 2 coats on it oh YES it was PAINFUL so I tried again only ONE base of it didnt hurt at all! try this. :)</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for about three weeks and I can REALLY tell the difference. It does seem to cause other polish placed on top to peal after a couple days or so but that&#x27;s a small price to pay for long strong healthy nails.</li>
            <li> The best product that I brought that work for me and my nails never been this beauitfull in my life I use to wear fake nail at all time&#x27;s now I don&#x27;t,all I use rejuvaccote nail product at all times and tell others about it NOW, my nail are real love that Rejuvacote The Beat Sunshine...(Ann)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for years. It makes your nails strong and they grow very fast. Just apply a coat on every day and your done. It also dries fast.</li>
            <li> LOVE LOVE LOVE this nail polish. It literally has worked wonders on my nails. For those reviews that said it burns, it probably isnt a good idea to put this polish on after acrylics since acrylics thin out your nails. I havent had any pain or any problems with this nail polish and I will be ordering much more in the future</li>
            <li> This product was suggested by my dermatologist and gave me spectacular nails when they had been thin and peeling in layers for years. Can&#x27;t live without it. I even had someone get it for me when I was hospitalized suddenly and wasn&#x27;t able to take it with me.</li>
            <li> I have been a nail biter and cuticle picker for a very long time. I&#x27;ve tried all kinds of \\&quot;no-bite\\&quot; polish. Then I realized that the reason it&#x27;s easier to bite is because my nails were so soft and easy to nibble on - I noticed that I never bit my thumbnails, which were always like talons.  My fingers went from very hard thumbnails to very weak, soft, and slow growing pinky nails, with each nail getting progressively weaker. It took me about 2 months, but now all my nails are hard with pretty white tips, including the pinkies! I had always thought having white tips was genetic, but now I know it&#x27;s because of the nail thickness.  I haven&#x27;t bitten my nails in 2 months, which is a HUGE accomplishment for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You can use polish, but now that the tips are so pretty and white I just use the Rejuvacote and it looks like I had a french tip manicure!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;NOTE: this stuff does NOT speed up the rate of growth. Your nails will grow at the same speed they always have. It&#x27;s just that when they come in they will be harder.</li>
            <li> This has really helped my nail growth.</li>
            <li> I HAVE USED THIS PRODUCT IN THE PAST WITH GREAT SUCCESS. ON THE ORDER FOR 4 BOTTLES FROM AMAZON ONE BOTTLE ARRIVED THAT OBVIOUSLY HAD LEAKED AND IT WAS HARD TO REMOVE FROM THE CARTON.</li>
            <li> My nails started to chip and break easily. I&#x27;ve tried several different nail hardener polishes and they did not work for me. After reading reviews, I figured why not try? After a week, I noticed the difference on my nails and they are hard! Even when I clean or wash dishes...of course they get soft but once fully dry, they are hard again! I&#x27;m able to let them grow at a good length as I want them to be. I really recommend this product to anyone!</li>
            <li> Really works to make your nails stronger.  I use it for a base coat and then for a top coat between manicures.</li>
            <li> I have used this product before to help with weak, brittle nails. Has improved the appearance and condition of my nails helping them to grow longer and stronger</li>
            <li> I love this product.  I have never had nice nails.  They&#x27;ve always been short, they split vertically, peel and have had terrible ridges.  After using this product, after only two weeks I noticed a huge difference.  Now after 2 months my nails are beautiful. Strong, long and a lot less ridges. I highly recommend Rejuvacote for beautiful nails.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been a nail-biter almost all of my life, but every once in a while I would force myself into quitting for special occassions- like Senior prom- so I could get my nails done and not have them be gel or acrylics.  But once my nails reached a certain size- especially if they were wet to any degree- they would be as flimsy as a sheet of paper.  No matter how much I wanted my nails to stay perfect they would always end up tearing, so I really didn&#x27;t see much point in permanently breaking my habit since I&#x27;d never have beautiful nails anyways.  A hopeless cause, I guess you could say.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But then I ran across this product a month or so ago and decided to go out on a limb.  Nothing I&#x27;d ever tried before worked, but after reading the reviews I convinced myself that, for a few bucks, it was worth a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After a few weeks of using this progress religiously I couldn&#x27;t be happier.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My nails not only seem to grow a bit quicker, they&#x27;re now stiff as a board. (That&#x27;s slight exaggeration, but I&#x27;ve yet to see a single one bend, tear, or even give way when I place pressure on the tips.  Which has NEVER happened before.)  I noticed progress within the first few days, mainly because any nail that grew was new nail since I chew, so the results were almost instantaneous for me.  I would highly reccommend this product to anyone who has a nail type like my own, and I do plan on introducing this product to friends when given the chance.  This has got to be the best $6 + S&amp;H I&#x27;ve ever spent!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And to touch base on the \\&quot;tingling\\&quot; / \\&quot;burning\\&quot; sensation a few people have mentioned... yes, that does happen.  I find that I feel the tingle mostly when I place the product on top of a nail that&#x27;s been filed, scratch, or damaged in in such a way.  Something about that seems to make my fingertips more sensitive.  But if my nails are intact and in overall good condition I don&#x27;t feel a thing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The ONLY cons about this product I&#x27;ve found:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;** If you have even the slightest little cut around your nailbeds I wouldn&#x27;t use this product until it&#x27;s healed.  I made the mistake of clipping my cuticles- nicked myself slightly on one finger- then putting the Rejucavote on. Major mistake! It burned to the point I wanted to cry and my finger was sore for several hours afterwards.  I&#x27;ll be certain to groom my cuticles a day or so BEFORE re-applying Rejuvacote!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;** Seems to chip fairly easy, and if that happens I just touch it up a bit when I get the chance.  Easy fix.eds I wouldn&#x27;t use this product until it&#x27;s healed.  I made the mistake of clipping my cuticles- nicked myself slightly on one finger- then putting the Rejucavote on. Major mistake!

            <li> The Rejuvacote bottles arrived in just a couple of days wrapped tight and were an incredible price that I had to purchase two.</li>
            <li> A couple of years ago I was lamenting that my nails were peeling and splitting and I could never have nice nails.  My sister recommended this product.  I have been delighted by the results.  What a miracle this stuff is.  Use it as directed either by itself or as a base coat and top coat for regular polish.  Your nails will grow faster and stronger than ever before--no kidding!  Add a coat every day for the first couple of weeks, stripping it off and starting over once a week.  Believe it or not, I now have to clip my nails because they grow so long.</li>
            <li> A friend recommended this product to me for my weak, peeling nails.  I was skeptical as I have never found a nail strenghtener that actually worked.  Well, I was pleasantly surprised.  After just two weeks, my nails are perfect and my manicures last much longer.  Excellent product!</li>
            <li> I wore acrylics for years because my natural nails were always splitting.  This product is AMAZING.  As mentioned in other reviews, you must follow the directions and apply a quick coat daily.  It dries immediately.  LOVE IT!</li>
            <li> This product is the best thing out there for peeling, cracking, chipping, splitting, or anything else that affects nails.  It is unbelievable.  I have been using it for two years and it started working immediately.  I have recommended it two many of my friends and they all are using it and think it is great.  I tried everything on the internet before this.  Now I am completely happy.</li>
            <li> I have had thin nails that peel for my entire life and have never been able to grow my nails at all.  They usually don&#x27;t grow longer than the tips of my fingers.  I have tried all the products out there including Nail Envy, Nailtiques, special vitamins, gelatin, and nothing has ever worked.  For the first time in 46 years, I have nails that grow so long that they are actually too long and I have to file them back a bit.  Nothing else has changed in my diet or lifestyle so the difference must be from Rejuvacote.  The product goes on easily and dries super fast.  Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> I expected something of a miracle.  Nails still not strong.  Some nails still bend.  I guess it has improved some.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been struggling with my nails for YEARS!  They&#x27;ll grow out just enough for me to really feel good about them, then the sides will peel off and I&#x27;m back to square one.  For a while I thought it was from the nail polish or polish remover I was using.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This was recommended to my by a popular nail polish blogger and it has seriously changed my nails!  They are so strong now and can stand up to almost anything!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This has strengthened them without making them brittle, which can be a challenge.  I don&#x27;t really follow the directions on the bottle. Every couple days I&#x27;ll put on a new coat, when the old one starts chipping off, and remove it once every two weeks or so.  I do think one reason my nails are stronger is that this is a durable coat of protection between my nails and the elements.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll definitely always have this on hand (and nail).  I couldn&#x27;t wish for a better outcome!</li>
            <li> I use this product all the time.  It&#x27;s great.</li>
            <li> my nails are longer than they have ever been in my 72 years.  thank you for making something that really works</li>
            <li> This stuff is THE BEST! I have never been able to grow my nails...I have paid almost $20.00 for OPI nail strengthener with no results! I  put Duri  on right after taking acrylics off with no problems. I know some people experienced pain but I didn&#x27;t have any, fortunately. Get this, trust me, you won&#x27;t regret it!</li>
            <li> After years of acrylic nail use to cover up my weak, damaged nails (I&#x27;m a nurse) I was turned on to this product by a fellow nurse who&#x27;s natural nails were long and strong.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After just weeks of using it according to the instructions, my nails have grown out as strong as they were before I first went to Nursing school, and the frequent hand-washings that started then.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, I just slather on a layer before going to work, it dries quickly, and my nails are protected when I&#x27;m washing my hands a million times in 12 hours. I&#x27;ve been using this product for 2 years now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Trust a nurse...we know damaged nails.</li>
            <li> Referred to this product by my local salon. After paying quite a bit of money for my first two bottles I decided to try amazon.  Found it for one third of the salon price. Very good product used to add strength to nails.  Lasts a long time.  Apply twice per week for best results.</li>
            <li> I bought this product to re-store damage that I received when getting the gel nails at a Nail Spa, it was taken off incorrectly and was not soaked off completely, the place was packed so they did not have time to completely soak all of the polish off, which resulted in them having to get an electric file and get remaining polish off, the process weakened my nails and caused them to break constantly and chip and peel, I did some research and found ravs about this product and decided to try it. I have been using this product and my nails are much stronger and thicker, the peeling is less. I am enjoying this product and since have bought my own gel kit from Amazon and will be doing all my own manicures from now on.</li>
            <li> This has helped my nails by adding a hard protective surface, my nails are still fragile, but this gives them some strength they lost after I stopped going to my manicurist for a &amp;#34;fill&amp;#34; three times a month.. and let my natural nails grow out.  Something that seems to be a common problem.  It helps, but it isn&#x27;t magic.</li>
            <li> This is by FAR the best nail strengthener you can buy!!!  I have tried several other from OPI to Nailtiques and this blows them out of the water.  You will see results in one week.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for years. I have natural nails and I do them myself. I start and finish with Duri. It helps my nails stay healthy and holds the polish on.  I knit, do dishes with total confidence.  try it you&#x27;ll like it.</li>
            <li> This is the second time I&#x27;ve purchased this product. It really works!!  I had been using acrylic nails and finally decided to take them off and try to grow my own but my nails were almost non existent and my nail beds were very weak. Now I have healthy strong nails and nail beds. Just put a coat on every day for seven days then take them off and start all over. Mine took about four to five weeks to start growing again.  I only had the burning sensation once but other than that, I&#x27;ve had no other side effects. I&#x27;m 60+ years old and have beautiful nails again!! Try it!! It works!! But be patient!!</li>
            <li> If you bite your nails or if they are brittle or soft, use Duri once a day and they will grow!  I use it at night while I am watching TV before bed, dries quickly and goes on clear :)</li>
            <li> My nails were splitting and pealing and breaking.  I was going crazy.  Within a week or ten days I noticed a difference. My nails look so great now that I hardly need to use nail polish.</li>
            <li> This nail strengthener actually does work--better than anything I have used.  I have been using it for about 7 years and it is great!</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t had nails like this in years....all ten fingers at one time.....easy to use - the results are great.</li>
            <li> My wife swares by this product, and was nearly out, so I ordered two for her. Excellent product and good price.</li>
            <li> I bought this as a recommendation to strengthen my nails and to serve as a simple base coat. I really like it so far. It&#x27;s nice and thick (but not globby) and comes on smooth. It gives my nails a nice clear finish where I don&#x27;t feel like I need to wear nail polish. It works fine under layers of nail polish too. If you are looking to just use it to keep your nails strong, the box suggests applying a coat daily and then alternating days as needed when your nails get better.</li>
            <li> You must use it everyday and tend to your nails for it to work.  Makes sense</li>
            <li> I have wrestled with thin nails all my life.  When I was attentive and kept polish on them, I could keep them looking decent.  As I got older, they began to get even more brittle and thin and the best \\&quot;over the counter\\&quot; treatments didn&#x27;t help.  I began nail vitamins and saw little real improvement.  I decided to give Rejuvacote a try based on the reviews.  For the first 2 weeks, I couldn&#x27;t see much improvement and my nails continued to be fragile and would split easily.  I kept with it and started seeing improvement around week 3.  Now, it has been almost 6 weeks and I see real improvement.  I am actually going to have to CUT them soon!  I faithfully apply the treatment every day and clean my nails and start fresh again every 7-10 days.  I am thrilled to finally be able to grow my nails again.  They are not super-thick but they are getting thicker and stronger every day and every little bump and scrape does not break or chip them.  I am so happy I gave this product a try and happier still that I bought three bottles!</li>
            <li> OK, i just bought Duri Rejuvacote today at Harmon&#x27;s for $9.99 after a friend highly recommended it, and swore that her nails grew faster and stronger while using it.  I also read all of these rave reviews online.  I just applied my first coat onto my nails about an hour ago and was reading the ingredients and saw that it contains Formaldehyde resin - which if i am correct can be a carcinogen??&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Plus, i read some of the reviews and saw that some people were having bad reactions to the Rejuvacote polish and think that this can be attributed to their sensitivity to formaldehyde.  just so curious as to why there was no mention of this in any of the reviews, or at least the ones that i had seen!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please let me know if anyone has any more info on this as i would love to continue using this product and get the great results everyone else is raving about, but of course without any negative side effects!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;see product ingredients here -&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[...]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;and formaldehyde resin info here -&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[...]</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only had this for a week but so far my nails do feel much harder and less bendable like before. My nails naturally grow slow now due to a bad nail salon experience in February but they are def. looking healthier than last week. Not using any polish and applying once every night before bed..so in 2 weeks i&#x27;ll see the progress and hopefully give it more stars</li>
            <li> When I was getting my acrylic nails removed at the salon, my nail artist reccomended this product. I put a coat on when i got home and a few minutes later, I was in so much pain on my nails and finger tips it was unbelievable! I don&#x27;t know if it was that my nails were so thin from the acrylic that the polish seeped through and irratated me under my nails or what but it was bad! The pain was indescribable! It was burning and stung and was sore all at once! I want strong, long nails so badly, but now I&#x27;m afraid to try anything else!</li>
            <li> Helped OK, I was expecting more</li>
            <li> This is the best product. My gfs can&#x27;t believe how my nails have grown. They are stronger. I have to cut them shorter as they have grown. Will be getting a mani next wk.</li>
            <li> Second bottle of this stuff and will never use anything else. My nails have never been better and I&#x27;ve tried EVERYTHING Super fast shipping.</li>
            <li> This helps my nails grow unlike any other product I have ever used. I have repurchased this product several times and keep bottles everywhere. If I stop using my nails get weak again and split, but with continuous use it definitely delivers.</li>
            <li> Amazing!! I have natural nails and use this as a top coat and the polish does not crack. Also, keeps my polish looking fresh for about a week.</li>
            <li> I was told this was great for your nails and I have to say after a few close calls of nearly breaking my nail I can say this was great</li>
            <li> This is not the first time I have used this product.....&#x27;started in 2010.  It is everything it claims to be!  Completely resurrected my &amp;#34;25-year acrylic addicted&amp;#34; nails from &#x27;death to strong life&amp;#34;.  It&#x27;s great to know, it is still available.  Thank you Amazon!!!</li>
            <li> This stuff is just amazing. I&#x27;ve been using everyday for a bit over a month and the results are beyond my imagination! I&#x27;ve been a nail biter all my life and an avid acrylic nail wearer. My nails were a mess to say the least. I&#x27;ve tried other mail growth products and no changes. However I saw that they were stronger after just a week of using rejuvacote. And after 3 they were longer and vibrant. I finally have the healthy beautiful nails that I used to envy on other girls!</li>
            <li> I am very tough on my nails, due to various household tasks including gardening, cleaning ect.and this product is amazing. I either use it as a top coat after getting a manicure or a base and top coat when doing my own nails and it works great. My nails are longer and stronger than they have ever been. I am prone to frequent breaking and splitting. The key is to apply frequently. In the beginning I applied a coat every day. Now I apply a top coat every other day.</li>
            <li> This is by far the best nail strengthening product, worth its weight in gold! It took 20 years of frustration to find a strengthener that would stop the nails from splitting. Tried everything from vitamins, wearing gloves doing dishes, expensive lotions and potions but nothing can come close to Duri&#x27;s Rejuvacote. Use it as base coat, top coat and once daily over polished nails (touch up the very tip of the nails). In addition, it never dries out.</li>
            <li> I work in the medical field and wear gloves all day. My nails will peal and break if I don&#x27;t use a hardening product. This one is great and inexpensive.</li>
            <li> this is actually the &amp;#34;best&amp;#34; nail hardener on the market-- and I have probably tried them all.  I bring this bottle to the nail salon also, have the maicurist use it as my base coast, then a color polish (or not!) and also use as a top coat.  I continue to apply  it once a nite as directed.</li>
            <li> This product does work. It was recommended to me by a friend and I am very hsppy with the results!</li>
            <li> I just got my acrylics off after 25 years.  I filed off any rough edges, and am applying as directed.  Dries fast, and doesn&#x27;t peel off!  No more dishing out $35 per manicure!  Not to mention my manicurist (even though she is really sweet) talks too much and takes up a good portion of my day doing my nails.  The nails were getting in my way! Recommended!&lt;br /&gt;!</li>
            <li> Awesome product to strengthen nails and for nail growth.  Use it as a base coat and my nails never looked better.  Highly recommend and wonderful customer service!</li>
            <li> The odor is horrible. It made me so sick at my stomach that I could not use it. If I liked this odor, I would of stayed in solar nails.</li>
            <li> This is the first nail strenghener I have ever bought that really works and I have bought a lot of them.  After a couple of weeks my nails are strong and as long as I want them to be.  A great product.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for almost 2 years and love it.  My nails are great and healthy.  Friends keep asking if they are my own nails!  I always tell them what I use and some friends have ordered for themselves.</li>
            <li> After many years of trying various products on my nails, I found the ultimate product! My nails are now strong and  healthy.  This is THE product to have for great nails. Do purchase it!</li>
            <li> I have been using the Rejuvacote for a bit over 2 weeks and can join the club now of satisfied customers. My nails were a wreck! Peeling, breaking at the quick. I couldn&#x27;t grow them at all and I kept them super short. Now they are strong and all one length.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Before you sit down and polish your nails give yourself a little manicure. File them, soak the tips in warm water with a squirt of soap, clean under the nails, use cuticle remover and an orange stick to push back the cuticles. Lastly, wrap a little cotton around the stick or use a Qtip dipped in alcohol to remove any oils from the nail. That should keep the stuff from peeling in large sheets.</li>
            <li> I have been a nail biter all my life (3 decades). A friend recommended that I try this product. I started using in August 2008. I love this product. My nails are very strong and healthy from using this product. I have free edge now when I use to struggle to stop bitting my nails. I started using this product every day. I mostly use it as a base and top coat now. I use it maybe 2-3 times a week. I highly recommend it. I also recommend it to my friends and family.</li>
            <li> The product is good,  I really like it. my nails are strong and growing. My polish stay longing and that good</li>
            <li> Its pretty thick and u can&#x27;t use after polish b/c if the polish chips and u want to do a spot touch up, you will see the difference from the old polish (applied 2days ago) and the touch up b/c the rejuvacote is so thick.  i suggest wearing it over clear nails.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;as for making my nails stronger, i dont see a difference in this from the sally hansen hard as nails..the sally hansen is much thinner and seems to do the same job</li>
            <li> I use this product in combination with Avoplex replenishing oil (by OPI)&lt;br /&gt;and work great after ten days my nails feel strong and grow faster&lt;br /&gt;good product</li>
            <li> Great Product, Now I have Nice Strong &amp; very Long Nails.&lt;br /&gt;I highley suggest  this product, to any one that has trouble growing nails.</li>
            <li> My nails haven&#x27;t been this strong &amp; healthy, since I was a teenager. I&#x27;ve recieved several compliments from friends &amp; complete strangers</li>
            <li> I have been using this for several years and it surpasses all the nail strengtheners I have ever tried.  I recommend this to everyone who wants a protective coat on bare nails or over polish.</li>
            <li> in 3 days I noticed my nails were stronger, longer. they rarely chip or break. the Polish does Peel easily. I hope to find something strong but this works for now. I also like the glossy shine it gives your nails.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping started trying it yesterday let&#x27;s hope it works!</li>
            <li> i went from 17 years of acrylics to this product. it took 6 months to heal my nails, but they are the strongest they have ever been. never again acrylics!</li>
            <li> If you use this product every day for two weeks, you will see a dramatic difference. I have always had short nails and this was recommended to me. My nails are now all long and strong and have not broken (knock on wood) since mid-May. But, you have to keep up the daily use. I agree with others, it dries quickly and will also serve as a good top coat. This is a miracle product.</li>
            <li> I have used this type of product before with no luck. This time my fingernails actually grow! I highly recommend.&lt;br /&gt;.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m skeptical of new polishes, they all usually have the same effect which is nothing. This one however works, not only can I see it working over these past few weeks but I can feel it-and let me just say..OUCH! Yes, if you have a problem with torn cuticles like me, it&#x27;s going to burn like hell, but it really does work. I use it everday and my cuticles are to the point of being healthy now, but it will burn if you have cuts. But I think it&#x27;s worth it!</li>
            <li> I first heard this product on instagram. I heard nothing but good things. So I decided why not? This product is great I gotta say, makes my nails strong and grows very well. Now the only thing that I didnt like is that it starts to peel easily. So the first application I have to do two coats, then the following days one coat. But before the week ends, I do have to remove and do it all over again. Which is no big deal, but its not a very good base when doing your nails. So I just use it bare. But overall great product!</li>
            <li> Its hard to find, great price and received quickly! My mother was impressed I found it! It&#x27;s not carried in stores in Michigan.</li>
            <li> Rejuvacote is the best stuff to use!</li>
            <li> Excellent service, I love the product.</li>
            <li> Just started using it and while I have not seen the harden properties yet, I LOVE how quickly it dries/set. I literally have been using it everyday like the instructions say and I only have to wait a couple minutes before I can use my hands. Even if it doesn&#x27;t do anything for nails I would rebuy just on the fast drying aspect alone.</li>
            <li> It actually really works! My nails broke off easily,constantly splitting and breaking. This was recommended daily and then redoing every week. After 2 weeks, the change was incredible.</li>
            <li> I would recommend it to my friends if they have peeling and split nails.  It really makes my manicure stay</li>
            <li> I use to get fake nails and became allergic to it. So my nails were weak. This is the only think I find that works. It does not make my nails break and it grows it pretty quick. Very happy with it so far</li>
            <li> thus product was recommended by my physician, it is helping my splitting, peeling fingernails. It is easy to use. I love it</li>
            <li> When I first started using Rejuvacote, I had just stopped biting my nails, and they had grown out a little - but they were very thin and peeling. Basically, they looked like I&#x27;ve been wearing acrylic nails for years. I figured I&#x27;d try this out - what did I have to lose? At first, like so many others, I had some kind of reaction to it. My fingers started to hurt, and if you pressed down on the nail bed, it felt as if I had bitten my nails too short. Being the stubborn person I am, I kept using it. Beauty is pain, right? ;) After a couple of days, my nails adjusted and I&#x27;ve been using it since May 2008. I have no problems with it now, even when I take it off and start over again. My nails have since stopped peeling and are so strong!</li>
            <li> I normally do not write product reviews however, I truly  believe in this product that I will waste 10 minutes of my time writing this review.  I have struggled for years with nail biting, weak,chipped, and short nails. My nail salon in my town recommended this product so I decided to buy a bottle.  My nails are so gorgeous, strong, and long that I will never bite them again.  This product is truly amazing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did read the other reviews about how some people were feeling pain when they applied the polish to weak acryllic nails.  I would recommend waiting until your nails have fully recovered or grown out before using this product.  You will truly experience strong and natural nails after just a few weeks.</li>
            <li> My nails was exfoliating for a long time and I always suffered because of this. Started using this product. They look perfect now. No exfoliation at all. I have been using it almost a year, fully satisfied.</li>
            <li> UPDATE: I&#x27;m back with some positive remarks. As I stated below, when I used this product as a base coat, followed by two coats of OPI polish, the results were disastrous. The polish would not adhere to the nail. In fact, when it came time to remove it, all I had to do was slip a fingernail under the polish and peel it off. No acetone needed! HOWEVER... Last week I tried a different approach. I used OPI base coat, two coats of OPI polish, and Rejuvacote as a top coat only. Though it took the Rejuvacote a long time to dry, the results were fantastic. My polish has been on for almost a week now without a single chip -- much better results than I ordinarily get.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SO: Not a good base coat, but an excellent top coat. And all the other remarks about how it really does improve your nails still apply.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;INITIAL REVIEW: Let me state right off the top that this product really does work!! HOW it works is a mystery given that all it does is chip, peel, and snag your clothing. I tried using it as a base coat for nail polish, as recommended, and within two days the polish was flaking off in huge swaths. Yet, somehow, the darn stuff does make your nails appear stronger and healthier. This product delivers the results it promises, but it&#x27;s a total aggravation.</li>
            <li> Love it.......keeps nails strong and healthy☺ They grow like weeds with this stuff.  My nails have never looked better. Buy it!</li>
            <li> received it as promised, and it works great. it is a great product and my wife and friends have used it previously.</li>
            <li> Love this polish -- really works to make nails stronger immediately.</li>
            <li> No improvement whatsoever on my neil</li>
            <li> It peeled. I didn&#x27;t use it long enough to say whether it did or didn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li> Not a good choice for me.</li>
            <li> Nails were weak, peeling, and brittle. Now they are strong and long! Only downside is a toxic smell, like formaldehyde....</li>
            <li> There is misinformation about the danger of ingredients in Rejuvacote and other nail hardeners and polishes.  A must read is a  (scientific)report titled \\&quot;Exposing the Formaldehyde Myth\\&quot; about the ingredient formaldehyde in the cosmetic industry.  It explains how the \\&quot;formaldehyde\\&quot; isn&#x27;t really the same product when used as it chemically changes.  If you fear these ingredients, go to link [...]  so that you really understand the product. I was not going to use any of the nail products until I read this scientific report. I have learned a lot from reading this article about the safety of the ingredients and am now using these nail products. Knowledge is EVERYTHING!  The article does state that some people can be allergic to the ingredients and I would think that those who experienced burning probably were allergic to some of the ingredients but that happens in any medicine, cosmetics or hair coloring products.  A nail technician gave me a bottle of Rejuvacote today after applying it to my nails. My nails have been splitting but are quite strong and I did not experience any burning whatsoever.  I am going to continue to use it to see if it stops the nail from splitting.  I bit my nails growing up and have worn gels and acrylics for many years although my nails are not thin now.  I am sooooo happy not wearing acrylics and gels anymore! I will update after using long enough to see if it quits the splitting of nails.</li>
            <li> This is never not on my nails! Perfect just to leave clear or as a top coat. My nails are long and strong after months of using acrylics. I&#x27;ll never go back to fake nails.</li>
            <li> I always use Rejuvacote as my base and top coat when applying nail polish.  I usually have my nail polish on for 3 weeks.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product.  I love it!! My nails grow so fast now I don&#x27;t even have to go to the nail salon anymore!</li>
            <li> The purchase was perfect, I received it as planned. Nothing to complain. I have been using this product for 3 years</li>
            <li> all women should try it. my girlfriend bought this for me try it, it works then I ran out couldn&#x27;t find in any stores in New England. then I looked on Amazon land and behold I found it. Ordered it and received within a week. Thank-you Amazon, you made me one happy women, and my nails love you.</li>
            <li> I like the product, but haven&#x27;t used it long enough to see if it will help my nails to grow and get stronger.  My friends that recommended love it and they have been using it for a few months and longer.&lt;br /&gt;I am excited to keep using to see my nail grow just a little bit, which I have never had nails.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend to others.</li>
            <li> I expected much more from this product.  My nails still continued to chip even under the coat.  My regular hardener from the department store worked much better.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for three years.  I originally started using it because I didn&#x27;t want to continue having acrylic nails and wanted to get back to my own natural nails.  I had not idea how strong and long my nails would become.  It&#x27;s a fantastic product that I have passed on to friends.  If you want lovely hands and nails...do yourself a favor and try Rejuvacote.  Use as directed and you can&#x27;t loose!</li>
            <li> I love this product. It&#x27;s the only nail system that has made my nails grow and strength the nails as well.</li>
            <li> My manicurist recommended this product. My nails are soft, split, shred. . .  When used as directed, this really works!</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t think it was going to work, but after I gave it a week, my nails are really looking better and growing!</li>
            <li> So far, so good. It does take longer than I&#x27;m used to to dry, but I&#x27;m noticing less peeling on my nails.</li>
            <li> Great product. My mother loves this. Shipped right away.</li>
            <li> This product works to protect your nails from splitting and cracking if used as directed besides giving a nice shine to your nails.</li>
            <li> Many thanks to the customer reviews positive comments and recommendations on this product!  I purchased it and it really works well!  &amp;#34;Pay-it-forward&amp;#34; is definitely the comment applicable to this product!</li>
            <li> Helps strengthen my clients nails and provides a smooth base before Polish.</li>
            <li> This product was magical for me when I moved to an extreme climate and my nails were so dry they peeled and broke. Within several weeks I noticed a difference. My manicurist first introduced Duri Rejuvacote to me, but she charged almost double the price. So glad I found it online. I often use it alone, without color, and it leaves a nice finished-looking shine.</li>
            <li> I have always liked this product and will continue to purchase it as long&lt;br /&gt;as it is available.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is a good product and does help strengthen the nails.</li>
            <li> Love this product been using it for a couple of years now and hasn&#x27;t disappointed me yet. My nails are long and strong and would advise that you give it a try for a couple of months if your nails are constantly breaking.</li>
            <li> Best strengthener on the market. I&#x27;ve tried everything. This one will actually change splitting, thin, weak nails into strong smooth nails. You&#x27;ll see a change in one or two weeks. Use it faithfully as a bottom and top coat, and add a top coat to polished mails every coulple of days in the beginning. I love it!</li>
            <li> Great product and timeliness in delivery was also good; however, I was disappointed to find that the price recently increased.</li>
            <li> I have the most brittle nails that flake off in layers. This strengthens them and actually gets them to grow!</li>
            <li> Long story short, I got similar results when I started drinking a bottle of water every day- but at a much slower pace. And let&#x27;s face it- a lot of people don&#x27;t remember to or have time to put a coat of nail polish on their nails every day. Just try changing your diet- you&#x27;ll be amazed! This does help though, if you&#x27;re willing to treat it like birth control pills and use it every day.</li>
            <li> Many friends had recomended this product and now I see why! This really helps out nails, im so happy i ordered this. My nails would normaly chip or peel; and would never grow! With this product my nails are healthy looking and much stronger!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know what&#x27;s in this stuff but it&#x27;s a miracle. When I first got it I just fallowed the instructions to the T. Didn&#x27;t add any other color to it, just that straight clear coat.  Made my nails as had as if I had done acrylics. Fantastic strength without the damaging filing and chemicals. Love this stuff.</li>
            <li> My nails have changed considerably</li>
            <li> Amazing !!!make sure u use it after painting ur nails extend the wear</li>
            <li> Having weak, thin nails like I do, this is great stuff. Works really well.  Wish the formaldehyde free one would be available at this price.</li>
            <li> Best base coat ever! Since using it the past 3 months, my nails have never been stronger. I was doing gel and my already weak nails got weaker. I used nailtiques and it just made my nails hard but also brittle. Duri really strengthens my nails. So happy to use this in conjunction with poshe!</li>
            <li> First time i wore it everything was fine. the second and third time the polish starting peeling off. Don&#x27;t know if it was because I was washing my hands more but it was peeling off of multiple nails within the second and third day. Don&#x27;t know what to do about that. I have to wash dishes. May have to return it.</li>
            <li> This was used on me while getting a manicure to help my peeling nails.  I&#x27;ve tried many products that have never made a difference.  This is the first one that has worked; within 2 weeks of frequent use, my nails were stronger.  I use it as my base and top coat all the time now.</li>
            <li> I love this product! I&#x27;ve ordered it several times over the years.  Unlike most clear nail polish built for strength, if used as both an undercoat and a final coat over colored polish, it both strengthens your nails and preserves the colored shine from chipping.  It is very subtle and does not diminish a final color.  The brush also keeps its shape nicely and does not clump.</li>
            <li> This product is fabulous!  It will rebuild your nails.  Use it for base and top coat.  Will not be without it...</li>
            <li> I cant give it a rave review because I havent been using it that long but I like it and will continue to use it.</li>
            <li> i like this product allot</li>
            <li> I stopped using it because it hurts when I putted on my nails.</li>
            <li> Has really help control splitting, tearing nails. I have had problem nails for several years. I now keep them trimmed short but they are no longer raggedy and unsightly</li>
            <li> I have been using the product for a month and have noticed a marked improvement in the nail growth. I have very short nails and now you can actually see the tips of the nails &amp; the nails are stronger. My only issue is if you have any cuts or even a scratch on the skin it will sting after applying.</li>
            <li> The product truly strengthened my nails.</li>
            <li> i like the item, i&#x27;ve paid acceptable price and receive it on time, it meets my expectation, i would  recommend it to friends</li>
            <li> DURI Rejuvacote really makes by nails harder.  they have always been soft and bent easy, this really makes a difference!</li>
            <li> As always this product delivers.  My nails are healthier and grow faster when I use this product.&lt;br /&gt;I will recommend it.</li>
            <li> I was very skeptical, after always having peeling, thin nails that break as soon as a I start to get a little length.  I have been using Duri Rejuvacote for 2 months, and my nails are growing and much stronger- in fact I have had to cut them down several times!  My favorite thing about this is that Duri is a wonderful base coat!  I am meticulous when it comes to my polish chipping or peeling- and with Duri I have been able to leave the same color on for a full week without it chipping or peeling off!!!&lt;br /&gt;I apply a base coat of Duri, 2 coats color, and a top coat of Duri, and reapply top coat Duri about 3 days later. I am now ordering a 3 pack so I can share this little secret with my sister and mother!</li>
            <li> Love this product! Fast shipping! Thank you</li>
            <li> it really strengthens your nails within using it for some time. Nice buy</li>
            <li> This is the best polish to restore and protect nails. I love it!</li>
            <li> Recommended highly by my friends,  However, my nails continued to crack and peel.</li>
            <li> Have used for years.&lt;br /&gt;Great product. Nails definitely improve using this and stay strong.</li>
            <li> Very happy to have found a product that actually works to improve my splitting, peeling nails!  I have been using it for about three weeks and definitely seeing a difference.</li>
            <li> This is the best clear nail strengthener that exists on the market. I am very happy that you are carrying this product!</li>
            <li> I did not get the same results as some had posted. Made my cuticles very dry. Not worth it to me.</li>
            <li> This is a great product.</li>
            <li> My wife has been complaining about breaking her nails every time she tries to grow them longer,from doing house hold chores it makes her more irritable.Im so glad she found this for about 2weeks of using this (one coat everyday for a week and 2coats in the 2nd week)now her nails are growing longer and healthy no complain heared lol.I would be happy to buy more for her :)</li>
            <li> I absolutely LOVE this product!!! My nails have stop spliting in 2 weeks!! And they are so strong and healthy now</li>
            <li> I just got it a week ago and started using it immediately so I cannot comment too much on it, but I did purchase this item to see if it would work better that the other hardener that I purchase from amazon a few months ago. I think is call Quimica Alemana. This item worked for a while and then I stared to notice that it wouldn&#x27;t stop breaking, especially my thumbs, so I decided to give this item DURI a try. I hope it works I love to have my nails long and manicured.</li>
            <li> Great product ... using as a help to weak nails and base coat.  So far, it has helped strengthen my nails ... no breaks or splitting for the past two months!</li>
            <li> My nails are starting to look good. It took a few weeks to see a difference in my nails but I just kept using the rejuvacote everyday. I am very pleased with this product and would highly recommend it to anyone.</li>
            <li> I really love it! It&#x27;s wonderful thing for nails! I have never had nails so beautiful and strong! Great thing!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so happy right now that I now have this in my possession.  My nails started to break and split this past weekend so this has come at an awesome time.  Can&#x27;t wait to try it and I&#x27;m sure it will be as others have shared...AMAZING!</li>
            <li> I ordered this product to try and make my nails stronger after years of dealing with them peeling. After a few weeks I have found that my nails are hard and strong. I work a couple nights as a server and my nail polish used to chip from washing my hands so much, now my polish lasts a whole week and still looks new at the end. I would recommend this product to anyone that wants their nails to look professionally done for a way smaller price tag.</li>
            <li> I love this polish to help strengthen and promote growth in my nails! When I was younger, I had always bitten my nails and I decided to stop. I saw the reviews on this product on amazon back then and bought it. It helped me so much to get out of my bitten nails stage. I use it often now to strengthen my nails. My nails get very hard and strong due to this polish. I recommend it to everyone. BEWARE TO THE NEW USERS COMING FROM ACRYLIC AND BITTEN NAILS. It stung so bad when I had it on my nasty bitten nails. I thought the pain would go away in a few minutes but I didn&#x27;t. The pain went away when I took off the polish. My suggestion is to wait for your nails to improve before using this! Love it!</li>
            <li> My nails are so hard to grow. I have arthritis in my hands, so nails naturally don&#x27;t grow well. Plus we own a plant nursery so my hands are constantly getting wet, even with gloves. Soil drys out your hands like you wouldn&#x27;t believe.  I use this product faithfully, applying a fresh coat every day or every other day depending on my workload.  I can at least polish my nails now when going out for dinner.  I always keep an extra bottle on hand so I don&#x27;t ever run out.</li>
            <li> Works very good for my wife.</li>
            <li> My nails broke if the wind blows seriously!  I never had naturally long nails.  They break almost everyday when I do mundane things like opening a door, or cooking, or taking a shower!  Yes, my nails don&#x27;t discriminate, they break all the time, everywhere I am.  I had pretty much given up on it, until my dear friend raved about Rejuvacote.  She actually bought me my first bottle and I started using it, and I have NO PAIN.  I see some other review where the person has pain, but I am gathering that having years of acrylic tips, it must have damaged the nails so much that anything just painted on now without the acryllic will cause pain.  I rarely got tips, too much upkeep and maintenance.  But this bottle does the same thing as gettin fake tips and you can be proud to show off your hands.  This is a must buy item!!!  Be sure to put on a coat every day for it to work right!! :)</li>
            <li> I applied one coat late at night.  By the time I was ready to leave the house in the morning, it was already peeling and chipping off.  Not likely to do any rejuvanating if it won&#x27;t stay on!!!</li>
            <li> My nails were really fragile and brittle, being in and out of water all day. Rejuvacoat really works. You do have to apply it as a top coat every day to see the best results. But now my nails are very strong, as long as i consistently keep the product on my nails daily. Although, I&#x27;ve noticed I have to be very careful when I apply it, because if even the smallest amount gets on my cuticle or skin, it will burn and sting, feeling pretty uncomfortable. Probably because there is formaldehyde in it, haha.</li>
            <li> After having my acrylic nails removed I tried every product I could find to try to strengthen my nails, nothing worked for me until I tried Rejuvacote. This is a great product! My nails no longer split, they are hard and they grow fast. I am getting ready to purchase my 6th bottle!</li>
            <li> Best nail growth and nail saver product</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very happy with this product. I originally purchased it hoping to speed up the nail growth for a torn nail. Although, the speed of the growth is not that much increased, but the overall coloring and healthiness of the nails are much improved.</li>
            <li> Love it.  My nails haven&#x27;t been long and healthy looking in quite a few years.  They are not peeling or splitting anymore.</li>
            <li> My manicurist recommended this to me January of 2013. I followed the instructions and her orders faithfully.  When I had my first manicure (without polish) after 6 weeks, she felt she could see a difference in my nails.  By July they had all grown out and I am now getting a &amp;#34;regular&amp;#34; manicure every two weeks.. a manicure which used to last 2-3 days now goes 11 with dark colors, 13 with light colors. this has been an amazing transformation for me. my nails seem as strong as when i used to use acrylics.  they were great with a gel manicure but my nails were still paper thin.  The downside is this (and read it carefully).  When your nails are strong and grown out, you CANNOT stop using this or they will revert back to what they were..i made that mistake once.  and when i put it on over polish every other day, it takes about 5 minutes to dry vs 1 minute on bare nails.. I&#x27;m a convert.. it may not work for everyone but I&amp;#34;ve gone from stumps to having to have my nails cut when I have a manicure!!!!</li>
            <li> phenomena product that allows you to grow your nails</li>
            <li> I have used Rejuvacote for 4 hyears and absolutely love it - keeps my nails in good shape.  I have recommended this product t many friends.  Use 1 coat of Rejuvacote, 2 coats of your favorite polish, followed by a coat of &#x27;hoof laquer&#x27;.</li>
            <li> Started to see results within 2 days!! Works great!!</li>
            <li> Happy with it-but time will tell....Good delivery service.</li>
            <li> Makes my nails so strong and I can grow them so long, they look fake.  HG!</li>
            <li> I looooove this polish so much. Atter three weeks on intense usage and after a month plus of deaming with damaged nails after a week of acrylica, this really help bring my nails back to life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Although, when attaining length, my nail eventually cracks on the sides (i have weak nails and now take biotin), but all in all still awesome.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for years.  I love it!!</li>
            <li> I have terrible nails hoping this would help, one month later still terrible</li>
            <li> I have always taken pride in my nails since I was in my 20&#x27;s when I was told by a photographer I could be a hand model. Over the years, I have tried every single product on the market to have strong and long nails. None has ever worked as well as Duri, so much so that I tell everyone who compliments me on my gorgeous nails that I use this product named Duri. I have sent it as a gift to many friends all of whom have gotten the same great results that I have. Try it. You will love it.</li>
            <li> I ordered this product a couple weeks after removing acrylic. NOW BE WARNED!!!! If your nails are badly damaged from wearing acrylic or from some other source this could burn!!! I experienced horrible burning! The only way I can explain it is if you&#x27;ve ever had acrylic done and they file/drill too much on the nail plate and it feels like your finger is on fire...that&#x27;s what this was like but times all 10 fingers!! And it happened each day I applied it. After day 3 I had to take it off I couldn&#x27;t bare it and then my nails were so sensitive. BUT.............at around my 5th week of no acrylics I decided to give it another try and NO BURNING except very slightly on 1 or 2 fingers. And then about another week later burning stopped all together. Once you&#x27;re nails have had a change to kind of heal THEN you can wear this and it works amazingly!!!! My nails grew so fast and got strong. I just think it&#x27;s not marketed correctly. It says for &amp;#34;acrylic eaten nails&amp;#34; ummmmmmmmmmm yeah right!!! I don&#x27;t ever want to feel that burning again. But it definitely works!! Another issue I found too is that this is a 7 days system. Each day you put a new coat on and after the 7th day you take it off and start again. I couldn&#x27;t get past day 4 before it all started chipping off but if you take it off and reapply it still works. I found even if I only applied it once and wore it for a few days it still worked. So you&#x27;re taking your chances on this. Some people get no burning at all.</li>
            <li> For the first month or so I applied this product about 2-3 times a week and I didn&#x27;t think it was doing anything.  My nails were growing very slowly but as the weeks went on I noticed I had not broken a nail.  Even when I trim or file them, my nails are very hard and not see through paper thin anymore.  Wish my nails would grow faster but they are getting pretty lengthy and its thanks to this product which has made them durable even when submerged under water for extended periods of time.  Would definitely recommend.</li>
            <li> Huge fan of Rejuvacote. Great quality, very little smell, a best of all, gets the job done!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have very flimsy and weak nails. Rejuvacote hardens my nails within a few days and keeps them healthy until the next application. An added bonus: my nails grow even faster!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> This is the best hardener EVER!  I have tried everything and this works.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Rejuvicoat for 5 years.  My sister envies my nails while she spends big bucks on acrilics.  Not saying they never break, but are strong &amp; very pretty!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product as directed. I feel like my nails might be a little stronger, but can&#x27;t tell if they are growing any faster than normal.</li>
            <li> I have seen an improvement in my nails although it has taken several weeks. My nails weren&#x27;t damaged from acrylics, they are just very thin and tend to peel and break easily. For the first time I now have stronger nails that have grown out and look good. Love this product and will order again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been blessed with very strong long nails since I was 15 years old.  Everyone always thought I had sculpted nails.  Manicurists loved doing my manicures because my nails were always so long and perfect.  Four years ago, without my knowing, I had contacted a heart infection (periocarditis) and my nails became paper thin and bent and broke.  I had no clue what was causing this.  My manicurist was at a loss of what to do.  She was using the best of the best products on me but I could not get my nails back to where they had always been.  Finally, put into the hospital my heart infection was diagnosed.  With antibiotics and heart medications I overcame the heart infection.  One day while shopping I came across this product and have been using it every day for 4 years.  My nails are back to what they once were and never break.  I get weekly manicures and use Rejuvacote as my base and top coats.  I apply it to my own nails nightly.  Another reviewer mentioned an odor.  It smells the same as any nail polish, basecoat or topcoat.  Absolutely no different it the smell.  It dries almost instantly and their remains no smell.  This stuff is fabulous!  Give it a try.  You won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
            <li> I had always either went to a nail salon or used the glue-on nails but got tired of the upkeep of both. I decided to order Rejuvacote based on the reviews and I must say I&#x27;m a happy customer. My nails had already grown out a little before I got this product, but since I&#x27;ve been using it, I&#x27;ve already seen an improvement in my nails. They&#x27;re growing out longer little by little, and my nails are starting to harden. My nails were very flimsy and would break easily but not anymore. I&#x27;ve already gotten compliments on my nails from ladies who thought I went to the salon and were amazed when I told them I did my nails myself and they&#x27;re my natural nails.</li>
            <li> I have been having problems with my nails for many years, after trying Duri my nails are longer and stronger</li>
            <li> friend introduces me to  Rejuvacote&lt;br /&gt;I tried and found out this is really working&lt;br /&gt;GREAT !!!!!!&lt;br /&gt; I can recommend Rejuvacote to all in need and&lt;br /&gt;to all to maintain Nails ~&lt;br /&gt;excellent Product ....</li>
            <li> Let&#x27;s see if it is as good as it is supposed to be</li>
            <li> No complaints as of yet.  Just started using it, I&#x27;ve heard great things about it!</li>
            <li> Great product, really like it. With this I can live my Tomboy lifestyle and still have nails that look like a girl. Great price and was delivered quickly.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product. I am weak nail beds, and applying this daily has made my nails grown &amp; become so much stronger! I buy this product all of the time &amp; highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> I love it works just like it said</li>
            <li> I have been using this for almost a month. Since 16, I would get acrylics and you can imagine the damage I&#x27;ve done to my natural nails for years.  Since using Rejuvacote, my nails are stronger, tougher and longer.  I&#x27;ve always had nubs, hence the acrylics but proud to say I no longer need to pay for or add fake nails.  I like this so much, I also invested in Miracote top coat by the same company. Try it, you&#x27;ll be amazed!  The only thing you need to know is, it contains formaldehyde.</li>
            <li> This product keep my nails strong and&lt;br /&gt;is a wonderful base and top coat.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s great to use with or without nail polish.</li>
            <li> If you have weak nails or nails that just don&#x27;t grow, then this product is for you. I wash my hands repeatedly and must use alcohol based hand sanitizer all day at work (which eats off nail polish). I use this daily...takes less than a minute to apply and am happy to report longer, stronger nails. can&#x27;t go without it! DEFINITELY a must have....LOVE LOVE LOVE!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using a Sally beauty salon product for my nails but I got too lazy to go out and buy a new one so I bought this one! But it did the opposite! My nails chipped and became fragile! Do not buy! Go to Sally Beauty Salon!</li>
            <li> After 17 years of acrylic nails, I decided to give my nails a rest.  This product has saved my nails and is really helping them grown.  I have almost finished this bottle and I have already bought and received another one.  I highly recommend this.</li>
            <li> My experience with this was just horrible!! I had been using nailtique in formula 2 plus for about a month and a half and my nails were beautiful; strong and long! I had never had such beautiful nails and i was disappointed to see i was running low on nailtiques. I decided to search for a different cheaper alternative and found that this was the #1 selling on item on amazons list on nail growth. After reading reviews and seeing how cheap it was I took a leap of faith and ended up falling into a bottomless pit. The nail polish chipped after the first day of applying it!!! That was only the beginning of a mayhem of horror, soon after my nails began to peel, chip and break. In the end i learned my lesson IF ITS TRIED AND TRUE dont try to find replacements. It didnt work for my nails but it might work for yours. Eitherway Im restocking on nailtiques ASAP!</li>
            <li> Nails didn&#x27;t grow but did help with peeling.</li>
            <li> Well first I should say that I bought this stuff and when it got to my house the bottle had been opened and all the polish spilled out into the box. I couldn&#x27;t even get the bottle out of the box. I got amazon to give me a refund for it. When I finally did get it out I saw there was a little left so I put some on my nails. Now when I read some people saying it burned I thought they crazy and being over dramatic. I thought \\&quot;How can nail polish burn your nails?\\&quot; And it didn&#x27;t burn my nails but I guess I got a little on my finger and OMG!!!!! After a few seconds I realized that my finger was burning. And it hurt so so so so bad. I know they say put in on everyday for a week but I don&#x27;t think I can handle the pain.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for several years and was able to recover my nails! They became much stronger now!&lt;br /&gt;Just read the instruction on the bottle carefully and follow them!</li>
            <li> My nails have grown so much, no need for tips anymore!!!</li>
            <li> Have been using this for years and my own nails are now long and beautiful.  Price is great. Bought this bottle for my daughter to try.</li>
            <li> This Works for Me  I use two coats under my nail color and my nails seem to be in much better shape now after the last 4 or five months. Thanks!</li>
            <li> Wow!!! This stuff really works. I have tried many nail strengtheners in the past and I was always let down. Very happy I finally found one that works. For the first time ever, my nails are growing and I don&#x27;t have to worry about them peeling. It does chip. However, it is very fast drying so applying everyday is no big deal.</li>
            <li> I just Love this product. It hardens nails so they actually grow. It doesnt work overnight but it does work!</li>
            <li> Duri nail products work.  My nails split, were brittle, pealing, awful nails.  And, using Duri Rejuvacote as the directions indicate - my nails are beautiful, long and strong!!!&lt;br /&gt;Love this product and Duri Rejuvacote goes on my clean nails as a base coat and then over my nail polish as a top coat.  I apply it every night before bed (it dries fast) and keep doing that until I change color.  Try it!!!!</li>
            <li> I keep re-ordering this product, as it&#x27;s the best one I&#x27;ve found to strengthen nails that tend to split.  You won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
            <li> Absolute genius product , I literally saw my nails expanding at the cuticle level ,still haven&#x27;t seen it go length wise but I am guessing its a slow process and I am positive that it will grow given the improvements I have seen so far . Nails are a lot clear and a lot stronger . Waiting for it to grow so I never have to do gel or acrylic and rock my own :)&lt;br /&gt;Apply religiously twice a day for a week and then once a day for another week ,take a break for one week.repeat.&lt;br /&gt;If it is flexible try not to apply polish on top and let this one be.</li>
            <li> This was recommended by a friend.  I love that it dries super fast and it appears to be working but ... I&#x27;m also taking 1,000 mcg of Biotin so I can&#x27;t really tell if Rejuvacote is the only thing that&#x27;s stopping my nails from peeling.</li>
            <li> I bought this product to try after I took off the acrylic nails and let me tell you that it does what it says. Depending on the damage your nails have sustained, the time it takes for your nails to heal with this product will vary. I use this polish in combination with nail oil, biotin vitamins, and nail creme. I can use all the help I can get! I personally only like one coat of this on my nails because I found when I put the second coat on, it chipped very easily, but that&#x27;s just my preference.</li>
            <li> I am a professional hand model and love this product.  Highly recommend it!  Also, acrylic nails (which are basically applied with super glue to your own nail) can be extremely damaging and may peel/strip away natural nails when removed - sometimes down to the tender tissue underneath that the nail is protecting - so it&#x27;s possible anything would hurt nails and tissue that is in such poor condition!</li>
            <li> This polish never lets me down.  My nails are hard and longer now.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for several years, if used as directed it works wonders on brittle nails..</li>
            <li> I have searched far and wide for the perfect nail strengthener and this is it. I cannot even explain how amazing this stuff is and it works even the first time you use it!</li>
            <li> This product was recommended to me by my manicurist for winter dryness in my nails.  It is great, and arrived right away.</li>
            <li> This stuff works really well to strengthen your nails.  I was in bad shape after some bad gel nails &amp; this helped get my nails healthy &amp; strong again.</li>
            <li> Heard great things about this product. So I wanted to try it for myself. I haven&#x27;t had it long enough to decide.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always had very brittle, weak nails. My nails were routinely frayed and peeling at the ends, and failed to grow - leaving me with ugly, short nails. After having been turned onto it by my nail salon, I&#x27;ve been using Rejuvacote for the last six months and have seen INCREDIBLE results. I now have absolutely FLAWLESS nails - they don&#x27;t split at the ends, they&#x27;re perfectly smooth, really strong, and I&#x27;ve never seen them this long in my entire life. I am amazed by the results I&#x27;ve had with this product!! Plus, it could not be easier to use, and there are no negative side effects! The product goes on your nails fairly clear, with a slight pink tint...it looks good on its own (can be worn as a neutral nail polish), or as a repeated top coat to maintain a manicure. If you struggle with weak, ugly nails, you should buy this ASAP! You&#x27;ll be amazed by the results, if you keep it up and follow the directions!</li>
            <li> I am 60+ and my nails have always been thin and brittle.  I&#x27;ve tried many products over the years.  I had given up on ever having nice nails until a friend told me about Rejuvacote.  I started using it a little over 2 months ago.  I use it daily and all 10 nails are long and beautiful for the first time ever. I can&#x27;t say enough nice things about this product.  It is reasonably priced.  It is easy to apply and dries quickly.  It is very slightly pink tinted and provides a nice sheen.  It doesn&#x27;t chip off.  It works.</li>
            <li> A friend of mine recommended this product to me many years ago.  Although I get lazy sometimes in terms of using it on a regular, it is absolutely the best product for healthy nails.  Its even used in some nail salons...</li>
            <li> really works!!! i was admiring a friends nails and asked her who does them and she told me about this product. i&#x27;ve been using a few months and for the first time in my life my nails are thicker and longer and can withstand wear and tear.  wouldn&#x27;t have believed it...</li>
            <li> It has really made a difference in the strength of my fingernails. I now have long nails that are HARD</li>
            <li> When I bring this to my salon the manicurists say they have other customers that bring theirs in too.  That&#x27;s be ause nothing else works better.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m left speechless because of this product...It was just...amazing. At first I thought it wouldn&#x27;t work and I didn&#x27;t want to buy it, I&#x27;m happy I did so though. This product will NOT make your nails grow. Your nails will grow at its normal speed as it has always grown. It does though..make the, STRONGER. This product makes your nails so strong ladies that after a week of using this for my nails my palms hurt. Your nails will become very strong to the point that you might even harm yourself if you&#x27;re not used to having them. After getting my nails long because of this amazing product i did experience cuts on my face [ because i wasn&#x27;t careful] and also marks on my palms due to my nails. This product does take at least 3 weeks to work but its worth the while.</li>
            <li> great nail growing power been using it since a got it and  i see a tremendous difference in my nails</li>
            <li> This stuff really works. When I got it in the mail I couldn&#x27;t wait to try it on and see if it worked. I applied one coat , it dries super fast. Got results right away. My nails felt stronger.my nails haven&#x27;t been breaking been growing faster then usual. I will be ordering some more soon!</li>
            <li> First time trying this product and already I have seen great results.  Am recommending it to family and friends.  Thank you.</li>
            <li> I wore acrylics for over ten years and after removing them my nails split horizontally at the tips - very frustrating. It did not resolve for over a year, but after using Rejuvacote for a month now they are so much better! I have not experienced the burning issue some have - I think perhaps some people are more sensitive. It lasts for quite a while even though you have to use it every day - well worth the price it&#x27;s available at online.</li>
            <li> I can not buy locally -came very quickly-well packed and good price. great produce.</li>
            <li> This is the only product that has resulted in growing my nails.</li>
            <li> Works just like it should.  Nails are getting stronger every day.  Had acrylics for years and now want to have&lt;br /&gt;healthy strong nails.  This will do the job</li>
            <li> A friend recommended me to purchase this item as my nails are weak and chip/break all the time.  I used this as directed and within 2 weeks I had seriously longer stronger nails.  I will never use another clear polish product as long as they keep making this stuff.</li>
            <li> My nails are long and strong, love love love it.</li>
            <li> Take off your acrylics.  They look ridiculous.  Then put this stuff on.  Once a day for a month.  Your nails will heal and grow, like you never knew they could.</li>
            <li> The product goes on nicely but I can&#x27;t re-apply it as often as directed. Looks like you have to use it daily to get results.</li>
            <li> I have been trying to get my nails back for 6 years after having acrylics removed.  I have 4 nails that crack right down the middle and are as soft as tissue paper. To say I have tried a lot of nail hardeners, is an understatement.&lt;br /&gt;I saw this product in Good Housekeeping Magazine.  As a loyal G.H. subscriber, I have never been disappointed in any product they review or suggest trying.  I found this at my local Bed, Bath and Beyond (only Bed, Bath and Beyonds, that sell beauty products) and tried it.&lt;br /&gt;ONE WEEK, even without using every day as directed, there was an improvement in my nails.  2 weeks later, it is AMAZING!!!  the change in my nails.&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this product!!!!</li>
            <li> This is great.  I had gels and knew they would destroy my nails when I had the gel removed.  I have been using this to rebuild my damaged nails.  It&#x27;s necessary to remove it every week or so because it starts to crackle, but it has really helped my nails get strong again.</li>
            <li> has helped strengthen my nails! goes on easily, dries quickly. gives a nice shine so no more polish is needed</li>
            <li> I love this product !!!!!!!  I had artificial acrylic nails for many years. Yes you guessed it......once I decided I no longer wanted them and had them removed my nails of course were a mess. I have to back up, my nails were always soft, breaking and peeling years ago which is the reason I initially started with the acrylic nails. Well after the removal of the acrylics, my nails were paper thin and looked awful. I tried every type of hardener, strengthener products sold at drug stores, other retails stores, hair salons and nothing seemed to make a difference. One day when I went to a hair salon the owner showed me this product. I had never heard of it and thought why not as I had tried everything else. Almost immediately I noticed a difference. My nails started getting stronger and finally started growing. I have been using this product for over 2 years. I now have long strong nails. I use a coat on clean dry nails and weekly I remove it and put on a fresh coat. You can use two coats (which I initially did). When I want to polish my nails with color I use the Duri Rejuvacote as a base. I then apply one coat of nail color. Let this dry for about five minutes. You can put on another coat of color. I usually just use one coat of color as I find it lasts longer. Then use the Rejuvacote as a top coat, It makes your nails look shiny and extends the life of your polish while keeping your nails strong and healthy. This truly is one product that does what it says. Amazon has the best price and always delivers in a timely manner.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not a miracle product, but with time there will be a noticeable difference with the strength and length of your nails. Also, I would recommend applying  one coat every day, and after 7 days, remove the clear coat from all nails and apply some kind of moisturizer a.k.a. oil to your nails. I personally used CND Solar Oil but I&#x27;m sure a generic Argan Oil would suffice. This is to make sure your nails don&#x27;t become too dry. Wait it out for about a week (meanwhile nourishing your nails with oil) and then start again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had acrylic nails followed by Shellac on my nails for quite some time. You HAVE TO let the damaged portion of your nails grow out COMPLETELY for this product to work (that is what I did). There are reviews out there stating the product makes their nails burn. This is because the nail bed is so weak, the product is reaching the nerve of the fingernail. I&#x27;m not a specialist, but it is somewhat common sense. There is no product out there that will save your nail bed, for this you have to suck it up and wait for the nail to grow out the damaged portion.</li>
            <li> My nails havesn&#x27;t been this long in years! I found this product on Amazon, and I&#x27;d like to say thanks to everyone who reviewed rejuvacote, especially the nurses. I&#x27;m a server/bartender and I have been for a long time, and I am constantly washing my hands, and because of that, I haven&#x27;t been able to grow my nails long in years.  They were constantly spliting on the sides and as a former nail biter, I couln&#x27;t leave them alone once I noticed a split, which means I would usually end up ripping them, and that often meant ripping them down to the quick.&lt;br /&gt;I started using rejuvacote a little over a month ago, and already my nails are longer, stronger and better looking than they have been in years.  I honestly can&#x27;t believe how great they look, and I&#x27;m mot even using it everyday now.  i stared using it everyday as directed and now am usingit every other day.  The other day I even went with bare nails to work and I not one chip or split!! Totally amazing!! I am convinced I can have my own natural nails looking great for the rest of my life with this.  If you are considering buying this, I would definately do so, you won&#x27;t regret it.&lt;br /&gt;Also, to address some other users problems, I&#x27;ve only ever had some mild stinging after using this product and to be honest, it was my fault for trimming my cuticles too far down and then applying it.  It was only some stinging and didn&#x27;t last for more thatn a few minutes.  Note to myself, don&#x27;t trim my cuticles too far before using....  :)</li>
            <li> I dont use it as religioulsy as you are suppossed to but my nails are awesome. I cant believe how strong and long they are. I really want to use it the way you are supposed to, and check out my results then!</li>
            <li> Love this product.  My mani-pedi technician recommended this product, because I was having a toe nail problem.  This product has made a significant difference.</li>
            <li> I started using Rejuvacote after taking off the gel nails I had for years.  Naturally it took time for the damaged nail to grow out but after....wow!  I have never had such strong nails in my entire life.  If I had this product prior I would never needed the gels.</li>
            <li> Best ever!!!!  I took my acrylics off a year ago and my nail tech started using Duri. They were in awfful shape but now they are beautiful</li>
            <li> The price is excellent, the product really strengthens the fingernails. It dries very quickly. It is not a hoax. I will order again.</li>
            <li> I have been trying this product only  for 10 days.  For  the moment my nails look and feel stronger. They say you have to use it every day and after 7 days take it out and start again, but I had to change it after 4 or 5 days because it started peeling</li>
            <li> Best product ever. Works great. Never had long nails until I used this.</li>
            <li> By itself Rejuvacote is no better than Sally Hansen products! However as a base coat and top coat remains to be seen if it does job to strengthen nails that always split before they can grow long.</li>
            <li> Duri Rejuvacote is the ONLY thing that has helped me achieve long, strong and non peeling nails.&lt;br /&gt;My nails forever have been short because they do not  grow and when they would they would be so thin and they would peel.&lt;br /&gt;I started using Rejuvacote about 3 years ago-&lt;br /&gt;With my 1st bottle I noticed a drastic difference within 2 weeks.&lt;br /&gt;I actually had nails that were strong and not peeling and were growing!&lt;br /&gt;Now 3 years later.. My nails are long- about a 1/4 inch long- could be longer but  I file them down.&lt;br /&gt;Honestly, still occasionally - maybe once every 5 months- I break a nail and I end up breaking it bad- and short to where it hurts-&lt;br /&gt;it seems to happen when I get lazy with applying the product.. then I continue using it on an almost daily basis (because I paint my nails almost daily) and my nails grow and catch up with the rest of my nails within about 2 weeks.&lt;br /&gt;This is seriously a miracle worker and yes.. its almost $10 a bottle but its more than worth it!</li>
            <li> Seals nails and keeps them hard and strong</li>
            <li> My fingernails were very thin, peeled easily, and never grew due to past acrylic nail abuse.  I have been using this product for several months and am very pleased with the results.  My nails are healthier looking, strong, and are growing.  In fact, I actually had to cut them recently!  This product is amazing!!! If you use regularly you will see results quickly!</li>
            <li> My nails look a lot stronger!</li>
            <li> .nail tech told me about this product.  She shouldn&#x27;t have done that, as she lost my business.  I haven&#x27;t been back to a salon since because when I polish my nails and use this as a topcoat....well, my manicure stays for at least a week.  Use it every other day over your polished nails, and it looks like you just stepped out of the salon.  If you are like me and love the look of natural nails and love to do your own manicures, you must use this product.  And by the way, it dries in seconds.....</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really not sure how to rate this product.  First, I couldn&#x27;t keep it on.  Some days, I would put as many as 3 coats on and it would peel right off.  I finally gave up after 2 weeks.  But, the next month my nails grew out longer than normal and looked pretty healthy with white tips at the ends.  I decided to start painting again with rejuvacote, until my nails started breaking off, like normal.  I haven&#x27;t used it since.  Not only that, is anyone concerned that there is formaldehyde in it?</li>
            <li> I had allways problems with breaking fingernails. I spent a lot of money with artifical nails. then i tried this product. My own nails got harder and i can grow them. For me it seems the perfect solution.&lt;br /&gt; Be aware; The product contains traces of celluloid. This could create some problems with the so called airport security.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical when I first started using this product because in the past everything else I have used has failed. However this product went above and beyond all my expectations. I&#x27;ve only been using this product for about a month and I can definitely see a difference. I was more of the person to go pay for acrylics because having brittle nails I could never let them grow long. After using this though my nails are longer than they have ever been.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only downfall of this product is that when I put it as a base coat then put color on then put this product as the top coat it tends to chip really easily. Which kinda drives me insane when polish chips, seems like I keep having to take off my polish and do it again which kinda makes my nails not as strong but overall I&#x27;ve been very pleased with this product and I would definitely recommend it to any woman with nails that aren&#x27;t very strong.</li>
            <li> You name nail hardeners and I have tried them! Have problems with nails that split, peel and crease! Thought there was no hope until I tried Rejuvacote at a friend&#x27;s suggestion. I recommend this product absolutely!!!</li>
            <li> Prefer Magic Nails to this as a strengthening tool - however my nails were extremely damaged from having gel nails done a few times, and it does help.</li>
            <li> really good for your nails. I have noted how my nails became stronger after 3rd application.</li>
            <li> My nails had been damaged by someone who filed off gel polish.  They were thin, dry and flaky.  Duri Rejuvacote restored their strength and allowed them to grow.  Love them now!</li>
            <li> Out of countless nail strengthening products I&#x27;ve tried over the last couple of years, this is one of the very few I&#x27;ve gotten positive results with. My nails stopped splitting almost immediately and they&#x27;re becoming stronger, breaking lot less and actually starting to grow.</li>
            <li> Great results; as advertised.</li>
            <li> I love this product!!!!!!!!!!!! I have never had long,strong nails until I started using this product.  I would strongly recommend purchasing it to anyone that has a difficult time with growing long, healthy strong nails.</li>
            <li> Duri Rejuvacote is like a miracle for weak, peeling nails. I have tried every product on the market and just had given up on ever having healthy nails. This is the BEST product out there.</li>
            <li> I love this product!!! It does wonders for your nails and makes them so strong and healthy. I recommend this to anyone who has bad nails and wants to make it strong. It&#x27;s simply amazing!</li>
            <li> this stuff is SO great. They sell it at nail salons for so much more! I LOVE amazon! it makes my nails healthier and stronger and my nails usually break easily. this is one of my holy grails</li>
            <li> This stuff is great at helping brittle nails.....highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I have peely and brittle nails - this product really helps my nails look healthy and grow longer.  Better than a regular clear coat for sure.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for about 4 weeks now. Results are good, not as dramatic as I was expecting, especially after switching to using it a few times a week vs. daily. But good in general if you have weak nails.</li>
            <li> I won&#x27;t use anything else on my nails since this product has allowed my nails not to split or peel.</li>
            <li> Years ago I had no problem with growing my nails out – but over the last few years they tend to split and peel and just catch on either my hair in the shower or whatever and rip. I just had a baby and even during my pregnancy when I was getting tons of calcium, etc. they still were not in great shape. I love having longer fingernails – so I did some research and this came back as the highest rated. So I thought I&#x27;d give it a shot – really glad that I did – I have no idea how it works but I have applied it as per the instructions for about the last six weeks or so and my nails are fabulous! They are strong and healthy and look really nice – I&#x27;ve even washed the car and washed a lot of dishes by hand lately and that has not caused them to split or peel – I highly recommend this and I have just purchased my second bottle.</li>
            <li> I love this product and arrived fast.</li>
            <li> I believe this product hardens and strengthens nails, although you do have to remember to use it daily at the beginning.</li>
            <li> This product shipped quickly and I have enjoyed using it.  It helps keep my nails strong and without breakage throughout the week</li>
            <li> My nails weren&#x27;t doing very well...especially after getting some shellac manicures.  I use this as a top coat and bottom coat along with a biotin supplement each day and I can&#x27;t believe how nice my nails are now.  I just turned 60!</li>
            <li> My nails generally never grow. After using this every other day, or even every 3 days for 2-3 weeks, my nails shoot out like claws!</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t want to waste my money on the nail salon and then having to go every other week for refills. My nails grew after using this nail polish. My nails look natural and I don&#x27;t have to worry about the harsh treatment of gel nails.</li>
            <li> MY NAILS WERE VERY WEAK BEFORE USING THIS - YOU CAN&#x27;T GO WRONG, THIS POLISH IS WONDERFUL!!</li>
            <li> This is what helped me grow my nails, my nails use to be so weak they would break everyday but now i have strong pretty nails (: must get!</li>
            <li> I loved this product so much that I bought it for my friends.  One friend said her stylist noticed how nice her nails were looking and asked what she was using.  That solon now uses the product and sells it too!!! Need I say more???</li>
            <li> I had this on my nails for 3 days when they started to really hurt and turn blue.  When I took the polish off, my nails looked bruised.  It felt like needles had punctured the nail bed.  I do think the product is so heavy it cuts off all circulation and oxygen to the nails.  My nails are on the thin side, so perhaps that is why I had that reaction, but I assume most people using this product have thin nails.  Use with caution!!</li>
            <li> I was recommended this product when I went in for a manicure last year. I was trying to grow my nails on my own and using generic nail growth products. After trying this I will never use anything else. It makes my nails super strong and they grow like crazy! Great product and a decent price.</li>
            <li> This product really works! You must follow the process as stated and you will see huge improvement in growth and nail quality.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for the last few years and it&#x27;s terrific.  For someone who has much keyboard use, you&#x27;ll find that this prevents the splits and chips that come from the normal wear and tear on nails.  The biggest problem I now have as a result of the use of Rejuvacote is that I&#x27;m now having to CLIP my nails as they&#x27;re growing too long!</li>
            <li> Formaldehyde is a main ingredient.</li>
            <li> I have very weak, brittle nails that chip, break and peel even under the best cicumstances. However, i also work in a deli in which I have gloves on for up to 8 hours at a time and moisture builds up, weakening them further.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I ordered this product because I follow a lot of beauty blogs and everyone uses this so I decided to try it. I didn&#x27;t have work for 2 days so i applied a coat for two days and then on each day I worked. Not once did my nails chip, peel or break during or after work. Two and a half weeks in and my nails are going strong. This even makes my manicures last days longer than before!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note- it CAN cause pain on your cuticles or if it gets under your nail. Avoid that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I pair this with the Seche Vite fast dry top coat when I do my manicures and they last amazingly long times.</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful product to grow and keep nails.  I had multiple ridges in my nails and they are gone.  My nails are stronger than ever before and do not chip or break off.</li>
            <li> After about two weeks of using this product I saw a noticeable improvement in my nails. The splitting and cracking had stopped and I was on my way to long beautiful nails. For that 2 stars. But then after an application about three weeks in, like many of the other reviewers, I started to experience pain. On of my fingers even started to turn blue. I immediately removed this from my fingers and won&#x27;t be using again. Beauty doesn&#x27;t have to hurt.</li>
            <li> It is working great!! These are the longest my nails have ever been. I&#x27;ve already ordered another bottle, for a spare.</li>
            <li> This is the only thing I have found that actually keeps my nails in shape with hardly any breaks</li>
            <li> Rejuvacote is really good at repairing the nails and making them stronger, but it stained my nails a hot pink color when used as a base. I haven&#x27;t worn it as a base since.</li>
            <li> If I could give negative stars, I would. This product was supposed to help grow and harden my nails, but three weeks later, my nails are still weak and breakable. I guess the product would work if it actually stayed on my nails, but no matter how many coats I used, it chipped within hours! Ugh, waste of money!</li>
            <li> MY SECOND BOTTLE, WILL BUY MY THIRD BOTTLE REAL SOON.</li>
            <li> I like it very much and use it all the time.  I also have gotten all my friends using it and they like it very much.</li>
            <li> Just received this product and am trying it out.  Too soon to know.</li>
            <li> Yes...it really does make nails stronger.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First time I have ever had nails that don&#x27;t look as if I bite them</li>
            <li> This is the best product I have very used for strengthening  my nails.</li>
            <li> Duri really does work. So far the only drawback is that if I use it as a base coat, the nail polish I put on top peels right off.</li>
            <li> great product and easy to find online</li>
            <li> Rejuvacote by Duri is incredible! I never had nails for thirty years and now I have them.  I have bought every product that&#x27;s out there in the market and all kinds of nail creams, this is truly magic. Nothing else worked.  I had nails that would split and never grow now I have long nails.  I am addicted, this product is amazing!!!!</li>
            <li> This product is excellent if you want your nails to grow.  Best of all I have tried.</li>
            <li> What a waste of money.  After wearing this product for one day the polish is peeling right off.  How on earth can this product work if it doesn&#x27;t stay on?</li>
            <li> This stuff really works. I am a repeat customer.</li>
            <li> I am someone who uses my hands as tools and my nails were a mess. After months of dealing with weak nails that shred and peel off in layers, I tried this for 2 weeks and saw an amazing difference. I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll every use any other nail product again as this one not only works but dries quickly and looks great.</li>
            <li> This stuff works! I have only been using it for two weeks but immediately seen the difference. I went home for the holidays and inadvertently left this baby at home. My nails started to become brittle and weak. So weak that when I washed dishes the hot water felt painful and even burned my finger nails. It was awful. As soon as I arrived to my home I ran and put this on. I swear the next day they felt stronger! It works wonders and I learned my lesson to never leave it behind. I purchased it on a whim after reading the excellent reviews because I was desperate to get my nails back to looking/feeling strong and healthy. I am so happy I did. You will NOT be disappointed. Don&#x27;t question it, buy it. Trust me it works!</li>
            <li> I have NEVER been able to grow long nails.  They were always brittle, broke at the slightest tap and would split on the sides before they got any length.  I began wearing acrylics but grew tired of the cost and time it took to maintain them.  I was talking to a friend and I noticed how nice her nails looked and she turned me on to Rejuvacote.  This is the ONLY nail strenghtener that I have used that actually works!  I have grown my nails to the point that they get too long and I cut them down and start over again.  When I stop using the product my nails will stay long strong and healthy for a little while aftwards, but eventually begin to break and split again, but with a few weeks of using rejuvacote, I am back to long grogeous nails again.  I love the fact that I can go get a pretty french manicure with my own nails rather than putting on nail damaging acrylic nails. Thanks Rejuvacote!</li>
            <li> I have always had terrible nails. This product is the only one that ever worked to help my nails strenthen and  grow</li>
            <li> my weak nails feel rock hard!</li>
            <li> Great product for helping to strengthen fingernails that have been breaking and splitting. So easy to use and effective in a short time.</li>
            <li> I first tried this product in college when a friend gave it to me from her mom&#x27;s salon. I absolutely love it. I have week nails that tend to split/seperate and this product makes a huge difference. Works great alone or under a color.</li>
            <li> this product came recommended after i redeemed a groupon for a mani pedi and was complaining about my normally strong nails, which have become weak and splitting recently. i&#x27;m on week 3 of using this polish and so far so good.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff. I have seen a lot of growth since using this and a lot less breaks. I am very happy with this product.</li>
            <li> The disclaimer on the box is 100% accurate. My nails have always been weak and years of nail polish and shellac use had made them even worse. I have absolutely nothing bad to say about this product. I have been using it for less than 3 months and my nails are quite literally transformed. I didn&#x27;t think it was possible. I am a bartender and I use my hands a lot for my job. My hands are always saturated in cleaning products, alcohol, and citrus which is super hard on them and I haven&#x27;t broken a  nail in months. I could go on and on about how having beautiful nails has increased my confidence. Don&#x27;t hesitate, just go for it!</li>
            <li> A must for my nails.  Works if used everyday according to directions.  Prevents splits and tears and keeps nails strong</li>
            <li> I guess I had a allergic reaction. As soon as I put it in... 10 mins later my finger tips were in pain!!  I read other reviews where people said the same thing. I recently bought nailtiques formula 2 @ Walgreens which has similar ingredients so i wonder if ill have the same reaction.</li>
            <li> I have had acrylic nails for years and finally decided to take them off, only to find my nails were brittle, thin, and horribly damaged. I decided to buy Rejuvacote off Amazon because all of the reviews looked pretty decent. It came in the mail pretty quickly so I was pleased. The next day I decided to apply it to my nails. The directions on the back said to start with one coat so that is what I did. I experienced burning and pain in all of my nail beds. I tried to leave it on there for as long as possible but eventually took it of with nail polish remover. This may be because my nails were so thin but I&#x27;m not sure. A few days later I attempted to apply it again, only this time I used a thinner amount on my nails. By doing this I was able to actually leave it on my nails. The Rejuvacote leaves your nails really shiny and has a good strong top coat. However, if you decide to put your hands in any kinda of water, it will peel right off your nails. There really was no nail growth at all. This product is great if you need a top coat for plain nails or over colored polish but as far as anything else, I probably would not recommend it. Like I said in the beginning, if you apply this after long term wear of acrylic nails, beware.</li>
            <li> The best nail strengthener i have ever bought. I have spent a lot in the past because my nails do not grow and when they do, they break. To make matters worse, i put acrylics on for over a year so when i took them off my nails were a mess. I have been using this since september 2014 and now my nails look amazing. I use it alone or as a bottom and top coat with polish. Dries super fast.</li>
            <li> Ive been using this product for about 5 days now and my nails feel like they r indestructible! not to mention extraa long. I will need to buy another bottle as well as some for backup woo great buy. :)</li>
            <li> #1. It has FARMALDEHUYDE ! Per WebMD: \\&quot;Elle, a celebrity manicurist who writes a blog for Barielle Cosmetics, suggests her clients use polish that is free of formaldehyde, toluene, and dibutyl phthalate.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;#2. How on earth does putting this on top of the nailpolish penetrate the nailpolish to strengthen the nail under it?! It doesn&#x27;t!  That just goes to prove that it&#x27;s the many layers that keep the nails from breaking and not that it&#x27;s actually doing something to nourish the nails so that NAILS themselves become stronger.&lt;br /&gt;I was shocked when i put it on to see that it&#x27;s basically just clear nail polish and not something that penetrates the nail it&#x27;s self to strengthen it! It&#x27;s just a cheap nailpolish which starts chipping off within 1 day (even when put on clean dry nails as the directions say!).</li>
            <li> I know I have reviewed this many times.&lt;br /&gt;If you want to have your own nails without any costly, frequent nail shop visits&lt;br /&gt;this is the answer.&lt;br /&gt;Be sure to follow the directions and it may take a while, but from someone who&lt;br /&gt;could Never grow nail, believe me this works!!!</li>
            <li> Living in the desert my nails were always breaking for 15 years.  Whenever I traveled to higher humidity locales my nails would grow long until I returned to my desert home.  I have been using this product for two months and my nails are strong and long!  I have been receiving compliments on them.  I use the polish daily and remove it once a week to start over.  Good luck!</li>
            <li> This bottle is weak, it did not work, my nails have not grown much at all. The first bottle I bought worked in 3 weeks.</li>
            <li> A friend introduced me to this product.  Her nails looked amazing and mine, not so much.  I started to use this product faithfully and my nails are gorgeous now.</li>
            <li> My nails tend to be a mess, and someone online recommended Duri Rejuvacote.  This is a great product to wear alone or under your nail polish.  It gives my nails a good shine and keeps them from splitting and breaking as easily.</li>
            <li> I bit my nails for 10+ years and was looking to break the habit. After reading the reviews, I thought I would give Rejuvacote a try. This is a miracle product. After just two weeks, my nails were growing and transformed. I haven&#x27;t had a broken nail is over six months and I am a very busy mom. I now have nails that look better than any of the fake nails I use to pay for!</li>
            <li> This nail system does work.  I did not see results until about 30 days, but my nails never grew so I love this stuff.  Now I have to say I use this in conjuction with the Nutra Nail system and my nails grow nicely.  I use the Duri system for a top coat it shines great!  I use the Nutra Nail system like a cuticle oil and massage into my nails.  I love both and I am so happy to have nails.  Now I do not have to pay for false nails.</li>
            <li> My nails have always been a problem.  They split, break, etc.  I have been using this polish daily and my nail are looking better.</li>
            <li> Amazing stuff! Makes my nails so strong!</li>
            <li> Hadn&#x27;t seen much in terms of growth yet after two weeks of use, but found my fingertips in INCREDIBLE pain after applying two nights ago. Removed the product from my nails, but still feeling pain and sensitivity on nail beds. Afraid to use again.</li>
            <li> Love it. My nails are growing and they look very healthy. They grow so fast and  long that I had to cut them. I recommend this product. It really works.</li>
            <li> I only had a very slight improvement. They start to grow then still continue to break and peel. I have used it faithfully and will continue and still hope for some improvement.</li>
            <li> My nails were in very bad shape, always peeling and chipping. I use this as a base coat and a top coat to keep them from peeling. Great product and great brand.</li>
            <li> helps heal and protect problem nails. Have used this product for years and it is excellent. A friend gave this to me along time ago and it performs every time .</li>
            <li> I first bought this at my local nail shop. I have weak thin nails that tend to chip and peel. I finally found this online and it is  much cheaper than in the salon. After a week or so of using as directed, I have decent looking nails :) Love this stuff! As long as I don&#x27;t let them grow too long, my nails stay nice. This is my staple nail product!</li>
            <li> While going to have my nails manicured, I noticed this Duri produce was used in the salon.  It is cheaper for me to use it at home now that my income cannot afford for me to have my nails done professionally anymore.</li>
            <li> Best product ever, my nails are so stronger now and it keeps growing :-) I&#x27;m very happy with this product.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s okay. Makes my nails feel noticeably different. Like... Heavy?&lt;br /&gt;It works though.  Also, I thought I was suppose to take the nail polish off&lt;br /&gt;every day and add a new coat. I misunderstood.</li>
            <li> excellent product, my nails have never looked better and I am 77 years old</li>
            <li> This works great! It also makes your nail polish stay on much longer!</li>
            <li> I think this is a great product. It was referred by a friend and person in the business.</li>
            <li> This product was suggested my a manicurist. My nails were soft and broke easily. Now they are in good shape and very seldom do i break a nail.</li>
            <li> Three years after removing acrylics, my nails were still weak and peeling. Countless manicurists tried their various products and trade secrets to make my nails healthy and attractive, until one mentioned Rejuvacote. She wasn&#x27;t allowed to use it, but she told me that this would work. She was right!  This product did everything the package says.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&#x27;Wish I could include a photo with this review, but you&#x27;ll have to take my word for it. My nails are strong and long, with no more peeling and breaking. Great results from Rejuvacote!  I didn&#x27;t find it in any stores, so thank goodness for Amazon.</li>
            <li> I am thrilled with this product. You can see a difference within a couple of weeks. My nails were splitting terribly and were damaged by using shellac, etc. I intend to use Rejuvacote from now on and keep my fingernails natural. I&#x27;ve used other products that promise to strengthen nails and they did not work for me.....Duri Rejuvacote will be my nail polish forever......</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried a lot of nail strengtheners and growth products from Sally Hansen to OPI.  Some of those work, initially, but once you start to slack off on application, you can kiss your pretty nails goodbye.  I am so impressed with Rejuvacote.  My nails are long, healthy, and strong.  I miss days, I remove the product and let my nails be bare for a few days, and they&#x27;re still beautiful.  An added bonus is the price, it&#x27;s very reasonable.  I would recommend this product to anyone wanting natural nails.  I have battled peeling nails for years (which weakens my nails over time) and this is the first product I&#x27;ve used that I haven&#x27;t had that issue with at all.  I will never be without it.</li>
            <li> My nails are long and very strong.  I buy it for my daughter too and my good friend.  I recommend it highly.</li>
            <li> It is not as effective as I thought.  It also peals off.&lt;br /&gt;My nails have not improve since I started using it.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t work for me !!!!!&lt;br /&gt;Tried it for 2 weeks, nothing. Disappointed :(  after all the positif reviews I was so happy to give it a try !!!!!! 😒</li>
            <li> I bought Rejuvacote because I had heard it makes your nails stronger and helps them grow. I have very brittle nails and have trouble growing them. After using  this product for two weeks, I saw a great improvement in my nails. They seem stronger and are actually growing longer. I definitely would recommend this product.</li>
            <li> My nails were breaking and very soft. I began using Duri two weeks ago and am already noticing that my nails are stronger.</li>
            <li> It is the only treatment that I have found that keeps my nails from breaking and flaking.  It must be applied as a basecoat to be effective and it can be used as a top coat as well.</li>
            <li> I like this item finally my dream came true, my nails are strong and long. I would definitely will recommend the item</li>
            <li> Why do we love it? Because it works~&lt;br /&gt;We don&#x27;t use it every day as instructed, but only several times a week. Still a very, very effective product.</li>
            <li> i&#x27;ve been using this stuff for a couple years after a spa/salon nail tech recommended it to me. it really works! my nails are very thin and weak, and no suppliments or diet changes have helped. i apply one coat of rejuvacote a day and my nails are strong and long-i actually have to cut them when they get too long instead of them just breaking all the time. amazon has the best price on this stuff too.</li>
            <li> After getting my nails done several times they become thin and break easily. I&#x27;ve tried other products over the years but always come back to rejuvacote. I panicked when I realized my bottle was getting low and I couldn&#x27;t find it in stores. I was thrilled to find it on amazon. I have started using it again as I have a wedding to attend and don&#x27;t want stumpy, thin nails. Wow, the growth is amazing.</li>
            <li> I purchased this for me and my mom because QVC stopped selling Prostrong, which worked on our nails. We followed the directions on the bottle and after three days, both of us noticed a major improvement in our nails! She always  gets deep ridges and breaks; mine just won&#x27;t grow and are paper thin. The ridges in my mom&#x27;s nails improved, and my nails started growing and feel much stronger! If this is what happens after three days, what will they be like in a week or a month from now? This stuff is awesome!</li>
            <li> This product is the very best to use on your nails!!!</li>
            <li> first time in ages my nails haven&#x27;t split down the middle. thanks</li>
            <li> Fisrt one i bought was really good i really helped my nails become stronger, however the second bottel that i got after i ran out is not the same its not working the same i dont know why it seems like its a thinner or different formula. Wont purchase again.</li>
            <li> SPLITTING NAILS....I bought this product and it does work BUT I also bought Nail envy which works and I also bought ............&lt;br /&gt;.Natrol: Biotin, 10,000 mcg Maximum Strength, 100 tabs (2 pack) when I ran out of both of the nail brush on strengtheners I was just using the BIOTIN..The BIOTIN is what is really working, my nails are growing like crazy and I&#x27;m having to cut them down. I have not had any more split nails. Spend your money on the biotin.</li>
            <li> This product is truly everything that it claims. I  have as they say,  nails to die for rather than dying nails. My nails grow  fast and they no longer split and crack way down on the sides before the nail even grew out!  I love this product, they look just as good as when I wore shellac nails, but these are mine FINALLY I have great nails, I have tried my whole life to find a product that delivers and this one does it for me!</li>
            <li> Love it, I  clipped my nails short and in a week my nails are growing out and thicker. I need some more before it goes off sale, Thanks Ramona C. Johnson</li>
            <li> My nails kept chipping and breaking and we&#x27;re very weak. I paint my nails like twice a week, so every time I painted them I used this as my base coat. After 2 weeks, I saw a big difference. My nails were longer and much stronger and the chipping almost completely stopped. I was surprised by how quickly my nails became strong</li>
            <li> I love this polish.  It really keeps my nails growing and I now have to trim them every other week!  My nails don&#x27;t break off anymore&lt;br /&gt;or split.</li>
            <li> i bought this for my mom&#x27;s nails as she has thin nails that tear easily and are just all around unhealthy---even with taking supplements.  this coating has helped TREMENDOUSLY!  she is using it regularly and thrilled with it.  THANK YOU!</li>
            <li> This product does not work.  My nails did grow a little but then would split and easy break off.  Not to mention the brown spots that developed under my nails. It looked like under my nails were bleeding and then the blood dried.  My nails started to hurt after about a week.In addition, I had to reapply it several times a day as it kept coming off.  I definately would not recommend this product.</li>
            <li> After a friend raved about this product and insisted I tried it by giving me her partially used bottle to try out, I was hooked. I was VERY skeptical because my nails are extremely thin, break easily, peel, bend, and they always had these sort of &amp;#34;V&amp;#34; shaped splits that went right to the skin at the base of my nail. They hurt! Now, with this product, you need to put it on very clean and manicured nails to start out. I clean and file my own. You put a coat on once a day for 7 day and then take it off, clean your nails really good and start over. It works!! My nails are slowing growing out. They are stronger, and I have no breaking, bending, or peeling. I am really good about keeping it up, and it is paying off. I&#x27;m on my 4th week of this now!</li>
            <li> Do not buy, It burns my nails and I immediately have to take it off my nails. It is painful and I would not recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for some time.  Sometimes it seems to help my nails and sometimes it doesn&#x27;t seem to help much.</li>
            <li> The only reason I didn&#x27;t give this 5 stars is because of the formaldehyde. I had some irritation when used everyday. After using only a few times a week I had no reaction and stunning nail growth!</li>
            <li> I purchased this as a gift but I use the product on a daily basis and have done so for well over a year.</li>
            <li> I always have the hardest time getting all my nails to grow long enough to paint them. I break a couple and have to start all over. Well since using this my nails have been looking better and are growing longer and stronger. I was bummed that mine took so long to receive, and when it finally came half the bottle had spilled during shipping. But as usual Amazon CS was awesome and refunded my money. So basically I have been trying this for free. But I will definitely be ordering more.</li>
            <li> I have always had a bad habit of biting my nails. Over the last few years I&#x27;ve tried stopping, but it takes SO long to see the results of my hard-earned efforts. I usually fail to keep nails as long as the end of my fingers. With Rejuvacote I see the results faster. It does indeed work as they claim and helps grow stronger nails faster.</li>
            <li> tried many other nail strengthener products and none work like Duri Rejuvate Cote.  Can be hard to fine; buy online</li>
            <li> My manicurist uses this product at the salon. She highly recommended it so I purchased from Amazon. I am very happy with the results.</li>
            <li> I have never, in all my life, had fingernails look as good as they do  now.  They are long and beautiful and I&#x27;ve even had to file them down a couple of times because they got too long.  I know it sounds a little vain, but every day I look at my nails and can&#x27;t help admiring them.  I&#x27;ve never been able to grow long nails and to have them all long at the same time is so fun.  And, they&#x27;ve been this way for a month or so. I&#x27;ve tried lots of products in the past, but this one is the only one that&#x27;s ever worked for me.</li>
            <li> Great product and fast shipping!</li>
            <li> Great product! Makes my nails grow faster and stronger.</li>
            <li> Such an excellent product.  I can really tell a difference in my nails.  I&#x27;ve very happy with this!</li>
            <li> Love the product! Sent one to my friend.</li>
            <li> This has made my nails strong and does make them grow very fast.  It also leaves a nice shiny coat. So I don&#x27;t even need polish.  I would definitely recommend it.</li>
            <li> Love it! It healed my nails after using gel for two years. Two nails kept cracking and splitting. They are healed now!!</li>
            <li> I love this product and have used it loyally for years.  It strengthens my nails and is a great top coat for color nail polish.  However, when I received this item I immediately noticed a nail polish smell when I opened the packaging envelope.  The box containing the bottle was crushed and upon opening it, I discovered that the bottle had leaked.  The leak was bad enough to basically glue the bottle to the inside of the box.  I&#x27;m sure that the polish has dried out at least somewhat after having been opened for over a week during the shipping process.</li>
            <li> This product seems to be working for me.  I have tried so many, but will stick with this one.  I found that sticking with it, give it a bit of time and it will work for you.  Give it a try, I think you will like it.</li>
            <li> This is truly an amazing product. My nails were broken and split and really looked bad. After using  Duri my nails are beautiful.</li>
            <li> I had always thought it was the norm for my polish to last no more than a week before it had started to chip &amp; peel.  I noticed my nails had started to peel and break before the week was up - so after reading the reviews on this product I tried it out.  The first week I didn&#x27;t notice much of a difference.  However, after 3 weeks later- My nails are harder and now grow out stronger- which causes the polish to last longer, I guess my nails were growing out soft prior to using this which cause the nail polish to break and peel off faster.  This is a must have- I&#x27;m very happy with the results!</li>
            <li> I find it protects my nails and gives it the look of a professional manicure.</li>
            <li> The only thing I liked about this was the fact that it dried quick.  It didn&#x27;t help with breakage much and made my peeling nails worse. Since it chips within two days it takes layers off of my nail causing them to become weak all over again. I use essie &amp;#34;grow stronger&amp;#34; base coat and essie &amp;#34;no chips ahead&amp;#34; topcoat when I&#x27;m not wearing polish. My nails are amazing now!</li>
            <li> Really good for keeping nails from breaking and chipping.  Been using it for years.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t speak for it myself, but my wife says &amp;#34;5 stars.&amp;#34;  She has also been taking Biotin to strengthen her fingernails.</li>
            <li> I used this product for 2 months, it did not work for me. Peeled off quickly, but then again so does nail polish on my nails.</li>
            <li> This works wonders! In just a week of use (twice a day). I could see such a difference in my nails. My nails were in rough shape because of me putting on fake nails/tips. Thank you all for the reviews of this product which made me give it a try &amp; I&#x27;m so happy I did. No more fake nails/tips for me!</li>
            <li> Love this product., love this price. Have used it for years at retail prices and boy does it work!</li>
            <li> After a month of use I&#x27;m finally growing nails. Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I have been a chronic nail biter for YEARS, and it has completely destroyed my nails to where they are fragile, brittle, and thin. I have finally kicked the habit and was looking for something to help get my nails into shape to be able to withstand everyday life and not instantly break. I also work in a factory which makes it even easier to break my nails. After about a month of using the Rejuvacote, my nails became much much stronger and were able to actually grow. Even with the abuse I put my hands through at work, my nails didn&#x27;t break. After they did get so long, I did get some chips on the ends if my nails, but no splitting, and they were easily filed back to shape. I can&#x27;t recommend this stuff enough if you are wanting nails that are strong and that are givne a chance to really grow. I am very impressed with the Rejuvacote. Definitely will be purchasing again.</li>
            <li> Excellent produce.  Really strengthens nails.  Good to use as and undercoat and top coat.</li>
            <li> I purchased this a couple years ago when I was having some trouble during dry winter months with my fingernails.  They were breaking easily and just didn&#x27;t seem healthy.  This product really helped them to look better.  Then for a couple years I wore acrylic nails.  I just recently decided to give my nails a rest from the acrylics and was quite shocked to realize how much damage they did to my nails.  I knew immediately what to buy.  I once again bought this item and it is bringing back the health of my nails.  It provides a shine while it heals and protects.</li>
            <li> I have never had nice nails. My nails split, crack, chip etc. I had wraps for a while but hated being a slave to my nails plus when I took the wraps off my nails were worse than what I started with. I have been using Duri Rejuvacote for about 3 months. My manicurist cannot believe what this product has done for my nails. I have LONG, STRONG, HEALTHY, BEAUTIFUL nails. I never thought in a million years that I would have the nails that I have today. LOVE, LOVE, LOVE this product.</li>
            <li> Having grown nails all my life (wink) and having continuously colored, doused them with chemicals, painted on acrylics, gels, etc, my poor fingernails have taken a beating low these many years. I decided to go coating free, but found myself suffering from extremely thin, peeling, cracking and splitting nails. Basically they were doing everything but growing out. A girlfriend specifically suggested I order Rejuvacote as it made such a difference in her nails, and told me to order through Amazon as it was extremely expensive (but worth it) in the beauty stores. I believed I had nothing to lose...but was skeptical. I found Rejuvacote on Amazon, paid considerably less than retail, and received it in LESS time than promised. I&#x27;ve used it as recommended on the box (use as base coat, then top coat every day) and it was miraculous, to say the least. Thank you for living up to your claims! Excellent product, and I will be re-ordering soon!</li>
            <li> I like the way the polish goes on and the shine. I think it is helping repair my nails and helping them to grow back quicker.</li>
            <li> My nails normally are always very short because they peel and break right away. THEN I had fake nails put on and took those off, so my nails were in ROUGH shape. I&#x27;ve been using this stuff for 2 weeks and WOW. It repaired my thin nails due to remove the fake one&#x27;s...also as of now there are no peels and my nails are growing longer than I&#x27;ve seen in a long time. LOVE LOVE LOVE it. HIGHLY recommended.</li>
            <li> Never, ever in my 28 years on this Earth, have I had nice nails. I decided to try this stuff out. I am blown away by how amazing my nails are now. They don&#x27;t even look like mine. They are long, smooth, thick and healthy. They used to be really short and brittle. I highly recommend this for anyone!</li>
            <li> After chemo treatment for breast cancer my nails have been the last physical evidence of the damage that the body goes thru. I used to have very strong and healthy nails and was completely unprepared to handle the cracking, splitting, dry and weak nail situation. I tried everything to keep them nice, from acrylics to shellac, the ending result being miserably flimsy and painfully split nails. After far too much $$ getting manicures my nail tech suggested Rejuvacote from Duri cosmetics. I have been using it now for almost one month and am noticing such a difference. Tho&#x27; my nails are not long, strong and luxurious yet, they are not painfully tearing below the quick like before. I keep them very short, and apply Rejuvacote almost every day. I am hoping that in another month this product will have helped me get back to the strong and healthy nails I have had for most of my life. I am a fairly young survivor, with a 1 1/2 year old son who&#x27;s energy and demands keep my life (and hands) very busy. Thank you for this product!! I wish I knew about it sooner</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for almost 2 weeks, and I can already tell a difference.  My nails aren&#x27;t growing as fast as I would like them too, however, they are a lot stronger.  My nails were always very weak and would break as soon as they started growing.  Glad I spent the money on this!</li>
            <li> I am not a nail person. My hands are in water constantly since I clean for living and I have a tendency to wash my hands a lot. They have a hard time growing. My nails are short and I tried to keep up on it but after awhile I noticed it dried them near the cuticles out badly. I wasn&#x27;t too happy to hear it a formaldehyde in it too. It may work for others. Just going to give it to my mother since she has pretty nails and does them all the time.</li>
            <li> This is the second time I have ordered product.  It does what it promises to do.&lt;br /&gt;I have recommended it to friends who have had the same positive result.</li>
            <li> When I found this product, I found the solution to my weak, peeling nails. It works and keeps on working.</li>
            <li> My nails have always been thin and prone to splitting.  After using this for just a few weeks my nails were 100% stronger and beautiful.  My hairdresser couldn&#x27;t believe the difference!  She thought they were acrylic nails.  I&#x27;ve been using this for over a year and now have beautiful nails all the time.  They are strong, thick and no longer split.  I am a true believer!</li>
