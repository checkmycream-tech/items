    <ol>
            <li> Nice value compared to retail stores.  I have found the Systane Ultra to be the best drops for dry eye.</li>
            <li> What can I say.  Like I stated in the title these eye drops work as advertised.  I have dry eyes and these drops soothe my eyes and make them feel refreshed.  They do help with redness to an extent but that is not their main purpose.  They lubricate and moisturize your eyes and are safe to use as often as needed.  My Optometrist recommended these.  They are even safe to use with contact lenses.</li>
            <li> Great product at a great price, shipped quickly.</li>
            <li> I actually felt like my vision was better when I used these. My doc recommended only these.</li>
            <li> I buy these for my mom who has terrible dry eyes that always itch. It&#x27;s the only eye drops she has found to help her with her eyes.</li>
            <li> Reasonable price, got it quickly.</li>
            <li> Bought these for my Dad who is turning 100 this month.  He suffers from dry eyes and these drops have really helped him be more comfortable.  I would recommend these drops.</li>
            <li> If you have dry-eye syndrome this is the only item that has ever worked for me--it&#x27;s that simple.  I&#x27;ll use a single drop one or two times a night and it clearly beats all of the other 8 or so lubricant eye drops that I&#x27;ve tried.  You can go to systane dot com and get a printable discount and sometimes drugstores like CVS have sales on the double bottle boxes so with the coupon you get a good price.  But this triple box deal from Amazon beats anything I&#x27;ve ever seen.</li>
            <li> This product has always given me relief from dry, scratch eyes. Nice to find it on Amazon for a good price.</li>
            <li> I was very happy with this product.</li>
            <li> I use these drops nightly, and they are very soothing.</li>
            <li> arrived on time and price could not be beat</li>
            <li> Thank you it came as it was schedule and the bottles were as I expected. Thank you very much!</li>
            <li> A reorder of a frequently used product.  As expected.</li>
            <li> Used it for several years, great product .</li>
            <li> works better than other products for dry eye</li>
            <li> Great price, great quality!</li>
            <li> immediately relieve for the dry eye feeling&lt;br /&gt;recommended by my  opthalmology Dr</li>
            <li> GOOD PRICE AND ARRIVED FAST</li>
            <li> After trying several brands of eye drops, Systane seems to work best.  I wish it came in larger bottles, though.</li>
            <li> Great drops.  Have been using for several years.</li>
            <li> Nothing special for the money.  Walmart &amp;#34;equate&amp;#34; brands are just as good for less money.  They, Walmart has a good selection of eye drops&lt;br /&gt;and I think they have added an ointment for night time.  The Systane night time ointment works very good for me and I&#x27;ll check out&lt;br /&gt;the &amp;#34;equate&amp;#34; version if they have it.</li>
            <li> only product i would use for my eyes.</li>
            <li> after my lasik surgery i was required to get the preservative free version of these but these are much cheaper and last longer, these are not for red eyes.  they are a great lubricate for those dry tired eyes</li>
            <li> Excellent treatment for dry eyes.  I use in the morning or during the day.</li>
            <li> Fast delivery and this product always help but will try to switch to Systane preservative free.</li>
            <li> Have allergies and just had cataract surgery on both eyes.  This keeps the eyes moist and no itching.</li>
            <li> great value even with retail coupons this 3 pack is a great deal for those who use the product multiple times per day . arrived earlier than expected and in perfect condition will buy again for sure</li>
            <li> Works fine. I have pretty severe dry-eye syndrome and this product really helps.</li>
