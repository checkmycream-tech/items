            <li>Love this product.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;d read reviews of this product on MakeupAlley and many users said it caused them to have breakouts.</li>
            <li>but you use a lot more product.</li>
            <li>but it was more affordable by purchasing from Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li>I love Samshbox products...</li>
            <li>i love this stuff-</li>
            <li>LOVE</li>
            <li>On shine-prone skin, the Photo Finish Light fared better than the original Photo</li>
            <li>This is a great product that glides on extremely smoothly and will make your makeup last all day.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s light and smooths out the skin.  </li>
            <li>I would suggest Pearlesque by Purple Lab available at [...].</li>
            <li>your makeup go on smoothly.</li>
            <li>THIS PRIMER,,,FOUNDATION GOES ON SMOOTHLY AFTER APPLICATION..</li>
            <li>it helps jeep my makeup in place longer and keeps my face shine free.</li>
            <li>Overall great.</li>
            <li>The original Photo Finish is a gel, the Photo Finish Light is a lotion.</li>
            <li>I liked the effect so much that I purchased a full sized product.</li>
            <li>it lists 3 types of parabens ,and propylene glycol(which is a skin-penetrant,also used to clean barnacles of boats,and a hormonal disruptor))  </li>
            <li>I bought this and it feels cool</li>
            <li>I find it&#x27;s really useful for smoothing out my skin before putting makeup on.  </li>
            <li>However, I don&#x27;t feel it really did much to keep my makeup on or make my skin look any better without makeup.</li>
            <li>To wake up to fresh pimples was devastating.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>keeps make up looking fresh and stays put.</li>
            <li>Worth the cost.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li>you tend to have sensitive skin, use the PHOTO FINISH LIGHT product instead of the original Photo Finish.</li>
            <li>first it said it&#x27;s \\&quot;paraben-free\\&quot;,but</li>
            <li>At first I applied it all over.  </li>
            <li>My favorite and have tried several primers.</li>
            <li>I love the way this feels going on and how it makes my foundation last thru the day.</li>
            <li>I wish this product was less expensive, but it does a great job under my foundation of making sure to keep my face feeling smooth but also helps prevent it from getting too oily in my T-Zone.  </li>
            <li>This is a small package, not for daily use, but good for special occasions, travel or testing the product.</li>
            <li>but I cant see much of a difference on my skin.</li>
            <li>After several days of trial and error to see if it wasn&#x27;t the foundation instead of the primer, I found that the PHOTO FINISH LIGHT product did not cause me to break out.</li>
            <li>ABSOLUTELY  </li>
            <li>HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS PRODUCT!  </li>
            <li>It is a very well done product, and very efficient.</li>
            <li>My smashbox primer seems to work slightly better than the primer I had previously purchased.</li>
            <li>Reccommend it highly.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this to anyone who has never used a primer.</li>
            <li>The difference between your face WITH this primer and your face WITHOUT this primer is pretty obvious.</li>
            <li>When you use a foundation brush, it only takes a tiny bit of the primer to do your whole face.</li>
            <li>the tiny little container is hardly worth the time.  </li>
            <li>I absolutely loved the way this product looked and felt on my skin, but every time I wore it my skin would break out like crazy the next day!</li>
            <li>No matter how much I exfoliate I always seem to have little peelies on my nose, but this smooths them out so my makeup doesn&#x27;t look flaky like it used to.  </li>

            <li> I didn&#x27;t like wearing make-up until I discovered this!  It sits on your skin and your foundation sits on it... all day!  It&#x27;s light and smooths out the skin.  When I walk through the door in the evening, my make-up looks like it did when I left in the morning.  I love it!</li>
            <li> I absolutely loved the way this product looked and felt on my skin, but every time I wore it my skin would break out like crazy the next day! Removing it was difficult as well, I felt like no matter how hard I scrubbed it was never completely off. Too expensive and not worth the skin problems it causes!!</li>
            <li> This is a great product that glides on extremely smoothly and will make your makeup last all day. This is a small package, not for daily use, but good for special occasions, travel or testing the product.</li>

            <li> I did like it,until I read the product description,and then the list of ingredients.  first it said it&#x27;s \\&quot;paraben-free\\&quot;,but it lists 3 types of parabens ,and propylene glycol(which is a skin-penetrant,also used to clean barnacles of boats,and a hormonal disruptor))  So I&#x27;m not buying this again.looking for a healthier alternative now.</li>
            <li> My smashbox primer seems to work slightly better than the primer I had previously purchased. However, I don&#x27;t feel it really did much to keep my makeup on or make my skin look any better without makeup. I would suggest Pearlesque by Purple Lab available at [...]. It had been working wonderfully and I can tell a difference after I put it on. Overall, this smashbox primer did little and is not worth the money.</li>
            <li> unusable...I don&#x27;t like the tiny little container is hardly worth the time.  Would not buy them ever again. terrible bad</li>
            <li> Great service, an love this primer.helps your makeup go on smoothly. Will buy from again. Love this product.Reccommend it highly.</li>
            <li> Excellent product. I purchased this so I wouldnt have to bring my big bottle on vacation. I feel the price is a tad bit of the steep side for the size though.</li>
            <li> The Sephora makeup artist used this on my face as a primer before applying other cosmetics. I liked the effect so much that I purchased a full sized product. I should have taken the MA&#x27;s advice and sampled it first!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d read reviews of this product on MakeupAlley and many users said it caused them to have breakouts. Since I have rosacea/acne, this should have been a red flag. But gosh, the product looked SO AMAZING on my face, it almost acts like a spackle for the bad areas and makes your face even for the foundation. The difference between your face WITH this primer and your face WITHOUT this primer is pretty obvious. To wake up to fresh pimples was devastating.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you tend to have sensitive skin, use the PHOTO FINISH LIGHT product instead of the original Photo Finish. After several days of trial and error to see if it wasn&#x27;t the foundation instead of the primer, I found that the PHOTO FINISH LIGHT product did not cause me to break out. The original Photo Finish is a gel, the Photo Finish Light is a lotion. On shine-prone skin, the Photo Finish Light fared better than the original Photo Finish.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The MA used a foundation brush to apply the Photo Finish to my face and that&#x27;s how I&#x27;d advise it to be used also. When you use a foundation brush, it only takes a tiny bit of the primer to do your whole face. If you use your fingers or a sponge, not only do you get unven application but you use a lot more product. As expensive as this product is, the foundation brush will save you money in product.</li>
            <li> Considered one of the best makeup primers by professional makeup artists. Excellent price for an excellent Smashbox product.</li>
            <li> I have ordered this from QVC before so I knew that I liked the product a head of time but it was more affordable by purchasing from Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;This works really well and makes your make up look flawless and stay put all day, I would recommend this to anyone!</li>
            <li> I love Samshbox products...</li>
            <li> I wish this product was less expensive, but it does a great job under my foundation of making sure to keep my face feeling smooth but also helps prevent it from getting too oily in my T-Zone.  At first I applied it all over.  Now I&#x27;ve learned to just put it in dry or oil-prone areas to keep them Matte.</li>
            <li> i love this stuff- a little goes a long way. keeps make up looking fresh and stays put. I would highly recommend this to anyone who has never used a primer.</li>
            <li> ABSOLUTELY  LOVE THIS PRIMER,,,FOUNDATION GOES ON SMOOTHLY AFTER APPLICATION..HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS PRODUCT!  IT ENHANCES MAKEUP APPLICATION.. TRY IT, YOU&#x27;LL LOVE IT!</li>
            <li> I never used a primer before and once I tried this I will never wear makeup without it again! it helps jeep my makeup in place longer and keeps my face shine free.</li>
            <li> My favorite and have tried several primers. Feels great going on, like a sweet baby&#x27;s breath and helps make-up stay!</li>
            <li> I love the way this feels going on and how it makes my foundation last thru the day. Worth the cost.</li>
            <li> I saw the name of the product when viewing a youtube video on how to use concealer. This product lets the bumps and holes in the skin to be covered to smoothen the surface. Then a concealer can do its job. It is a very well done product, and very efficient. A very small amount does the job. It is too bad I had to purchase it online and pay the shipping for it, but I could not find it locally. Overall great.</li>
            <li> I got this years ago as a sample at Sephora and just started using it.  I definitely notice a difference.  Almost every time I wear it under foundation or bronzer, someone mentions how good or happy I look. I think it gives your face a youthful glow, hence the \\&quot;happy\\&quot; comments.  Yes, more expensive than Elf, but with all the compliments it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
