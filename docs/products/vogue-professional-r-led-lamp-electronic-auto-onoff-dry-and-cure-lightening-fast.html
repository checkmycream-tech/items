            <li>I&#x27;ve used several different uv and led lights.this one in my opinion is an excellent professional light!</li>

            <li>It works very well on my clients.</li>

            <li>The only thing I wish I knew how to do is turn off the little beep when you place your fingers into the machine and the light turns on.</li>
            <li>It mentioned professional and the power seemed high, but it takes forever to dry my nails.</li>
            <li>I  had a hard time finding a lamp that would fit my needs and that I could afford.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;The unit arrived much quicker that I expected.  </li>
            <li>big enough for entire hand but unit itself isn&#x27;t so big that it takes up too much room.</li>

            <li> The best, price is is pretty amazing too!</li>
            <li> Perfect for harmony gelish!</li>
            <li> Arrived defective. The top plastic portion was dislodged so I just returned it without even testing it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve gone through 3 other lamps and nothing compares to this one! It literally cure MOST colors is just 5 seconds! Darker colors of course need to be cured longer. I use this lamp for curing hard gel full sets using harmony gelish hard gel and it works beautifully! I couldn&#x27;t be any happier. I&#x27;m a mail tech of 7 years and this has by far been my BEST investment! Thanks Vouge!!!</li>
            <li> works great. love  it</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a licensed cosmetologist for 25 years. I&#x27;ve used several different uv and led lights.this one in my opinion is an excellent professional light! love that it goes on and off automatically..even if you take your hand out during curing time it stops and starts where you left off when put back in. big enough for entire hand but unit itself isn&#x27;t so big that it takes up too much room. i can&#x27;t say there&#x27;s anything I don&#x27;t like about it!</li>
            <li> Ive been using this device for months now. It is one of the best purchases ive made. SO worth the money.&lt;br /&gt;With my old gelish nail dryer, I used to read my kindle while waiting for gelish cures, and could read chapters during a nail session.&lt;br /&gt; Now with this ultra sonic curing device, I dont have time to read, my nails cure so fast. Gives me so much more time to enjoy other things!</li>
            <li> I was debating between the Gelish 18 and this one - after careful review I thought it was worth the saving to chose the Vogue Professional for the value as well as other product reviews.  It has not disappointment me.  Love love love this.</li>
            <li> Worth the money!!! I use this at home and in salon for an added service.</li>
            <li> Love this product! Great product for the money. Cures gel, shellac, and acrylic nails. Cheapest model I found with the highest voltage. The Vogue sticker fell off on the top but you can easily re-stick it with some tape or something. Doesn&#x27;t affect the functionality of the product so it doesn&#x27;t matter to me. Use this every week to do gel nails with Opi and gelish polish. Love the timer options of 5, 20, and 30 seconds.</li>
            <li> I have always went to the salon for my nails.  I wanted an option to do my nails at home - but I was hesitant about how hard it would be and how they would look when finished.  I decided I wanted a LED light because it was #1 faster  #2 safer. ( I saw no reason to  expose my hands to UV light that would age them.)  I also wanted a 18-36 watt lamp.  (The quicker my nails cured the less chance I would mess up my nails)  I wanted to cure my entire hand at one time - not  cure my fingers then thumb separately!  I  had a hard time finding a lamp that would fit my needs and that I could afford.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Vogue Professional - PRO LED (offered by bargainsources) was exactly what I was looking for.  It is amazing.  My whole hand fits in the unit (including my thumbs).  There are options for a 5, 20, and 30 second cure time.  (20 seconds does the trick between coats - but I use the 30 to be on the same side).  It&#x27;s easy to use, the lamp auto turns on when I place my hand inside.  Then turns off when the time is up.  I have had no issues at all.  The first time I used this lamp my nails turned out perfectly.  (I am using Gelish products) It will pay for itself in no time with the money I save from going to the salon.  I love this lamp.  I am glad I didn&#x27;t mess around and get a cheaper / lower watt unit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The unit arrived much quicker that I expected.  Was packaged very well.  I had no problems with anything.  I would buy this lamp from the seller again.</li>
            <li> Ordered this for my mom who does her own nails at home. She loves this! The only thing I wish I knew how to do is turn off the little beep when you place your fingers into the machine and the light turns on. It&#x27;s annoying!</li>
            <li> It is a lot faster and nice size. I wish it had better instructions....very limited.</li>
            <li> Came on time. It works perfect but is not like on the pic. It&#x27;s white color but still I love it. Very professional and save a lot of time. There&#x27;s a sensor so as soon you put fingers in it starts  working.  Sometimes I need to turn it on manually. Can&#x27;t figure it out yet how to make sensors on at all times but I hope I will eventually.</li>
            <li> Just put my nail lamp to the test for the first time yesterday and loved it! Cured my nails extremely quick, and works wonderfully.</li>
            <li> I love this LED lamp.  It works very well on my clients.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my daughter. Great  quality and she loves it.</li>
            <li> Not as happy as I was hoping. It mentioned professional and the power seemed high, but it takes forever to dry my nails. Nothing like my nail technicians that takes seconds. Sometimes there is a little burning sensation as well, not sure if paper thin cut on my skin is causing this. Would not recommend, look for something better.</li>
            <li> Used this machine for the first time yesterday.  Dries nails very quickly. Am very satisfied with this product. Can&#x27;t wait to use it again.</li>
            <li> Top of the line.. I love it. This led light cures gel nails in 20 seconds. 👌👌</li>
            <li> This is an awesome UV lamp.  It is worth the price</li>
            <li> They are working very well so far I love it</li>
            <li> The best machine to do shellac and faster  I loved</li>
            <li> Bought this unit for my girfriend and it just doesnt work.  The nail polish comes off after only a couple days.  She checked at a nail salon and she was doing everything correctly and yet it still does not work correctly.  I would not reccomend this product.  And the return policy is only to repair or replace as there are no refunds and it costs you money to return it to be repaired or replaced.</li>
            <li> Worked great! No problems so far!</li>
