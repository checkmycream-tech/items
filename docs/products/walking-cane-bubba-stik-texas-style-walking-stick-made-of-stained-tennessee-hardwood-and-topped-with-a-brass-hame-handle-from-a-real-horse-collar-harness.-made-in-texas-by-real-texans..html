            <li>but he needs more of a handle on top, believe me it is beautiful.</li>
            <li>A stout, handsome and comfortable stik at a very fair price.  </li>
            <li>and it fit the wood great.</li>
            <li>I have a couple of nice crook style canes which do the job nicely.</li>
            <li>The brass handle is comfortable, bright, and makes the walking stick look like a good piece of furniture.</li>
            <li>It fits nicely in his palm.  </li>
            <li>A nice length for my tall frame too.</li>

            <li>I wasn&#x27;t sure about the &amp;#34;hame&amp;#34; handle, but it&#x27;s really good.</li>
            <li>- -  Thank you for making such a great conversation starter and wonderful product.</li>
            <li>It would be a nice addition to for BUBBA to add either a steel cap to protect the tip.</li>
            <li>Even uninjured, having this is probably a nice way to keep the rif-raf walking on their merry way.</li>
            <li>Very sturdy and brass handle conforms perfectly to hand.</li>
            <li>Nice stick, but the Bubba Stik burned into it turned me off.  </li>
            <li>Excellent product with high quality.</li>
            <li>Very stylish and elegant in my opinion.</li>
            <li>and I am very much impressed with the design of the BubbaStik lines, &amp; with BubbaSam directly.</li>
            <li>I touched upon the BubbaStik web site &amp; product line and became impressed near immediately with its style, strength of design, affordability &amp; made in the U.S.A.</li>
            <li>Very nice product, solid feel and great look</li>
            <li>its very sturdy and being able to cut it off to your own length makes it very nice</li>
            <li>very comfortable walking cane.  </li>
            <li>The hame top is certainly shiny and attractive, makes for quite the luxurious cane until you get to the burned in BUBBA STIK logo on the side.</li>
            <li>and I am sure the TSA will have something to say about my BUBBA STIK</li>
            <li>I am waiting the arrival of my Bubba Stick but wanted to let potential customers know that King Products has excellent customer service.</li>
            <li>and I received many compliments on the styling.</li>
            <li>Kind of cool looking, I am very pleased to have this product available whenever I need it.</li>
            <li>100% satisfied with Amazon and the \\&quot;Bubba Stick\\&quot;</li>
            <li>I said what I wanted to say I do not understand why I must write so many words that aren&#x27;t needed</li>
            <li>The cane looks great though and people really are impresssed by it.</li>
            <li>It seemed to be more for looks than function.</li>
            <li>Well  made, solid, wonderful.</li>
            <li>I love this cane.  </li>
            <li>The quality is top notch.  </li>
            <li>I was sure glad to have it when I injured my knee.  </li>
            <li>sooo  if  you  need  a cane,  why  not  treat your safe to  </li>
            <li>It will develop a lovely patina and then I will shine it and the world will continue to spin.  </li>
            <li>Lovely walking stick.</li>
            <li>It fits the hand so nicely and comfortably.</li>
            <li>The product is well made, heavier then most, and the handle can be used defensively if needed.</li>
            <li>Love the brass sturdy handle.</li>
            <li>I was able to hold them until police arrived.)</li>
            <li>The Bubba Stik not only matches my image but is the best walking cane I have ever owned.</li>
            <li>It looks so good and is so useful</li>
            <li>IT IS A FAVORITE.</li>
            <li>The horse hame brass top is stunning to look at and luxurious in the palm of your hand.</li>
            <li>The rubber ferrule tip is secured and gripping.  </li>
            <li>age caught up with my hips, needed something to support my left leg, this walking stick is perfect.</li>
            <li>Great product and highly recommended.</li>
            <li>The Bubba Walking Stik is great and i highly reccommend it.</li>
            <li>it is 3 inches too long for me but would be perfect for a guy around 6 foot</li>
            <li>Excellent walking stick to take on trails and long walks.</li>
            <li>Finely polished brass Hame handle,  fitted over top of what appears to be Hickory or Ash (two hardest Tennessee woods I know of.)</li>
            <li>Most importantly to me,is that it was made in the U.S.A..</li>
            <li>It is very well made, looks good, and I am always being asked where I got it from.</li>
            <li>It can be easily read from across the room.</li>
            <li>; easily trimmed to your correct length.  </li>
            <li>It is sturdy and easily held.  </li>
            <li>The stained hardwood is light and smooth, lacking the rustic look and weight of the Amish stick</li>
            <li>It is well made, very sturdy and the handles is nice brass.</li>
            <li>worth the 50.00 for sure</li>
            <li>my husband is so proud of his Bubba walking stick, now he is happy to display such a beauty instead of his regular cane, he feels like he is all dressed up</li>
            <li>Use it as my primary cane.</li>
            <li>I really like that the brass is not covered in any kind of coating.  </li>
            <li>Overall if you want a great walking stick, and something to defend yourself in times of need get this one.</li>
            <li>Hame is securely fastened with a counter sunk brass hex screw.</li>
            <li>This cane feels very comfortable in my hand; the knob shaped handle is especially form fitting with the type of arthritis I have in my hands - feels made just for me!</li>
            <li>He had been using those canes you buy at the drug store, but I wanted something unique and &amp;#34;manly&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li>The top of the Hame(head) is positioned for easy grip like holding a doorknob,  only on an angle suitable for walking.</li>
            <li>And these sticks with their long brass handle are mighty nice looking too!  </li>
            <li>Cool brass handle makes for unique purchase.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Brass handle is very comfortable and weight makes it good for safety as well if you should run into a less than friendly dog on a walk .</li>
            <li>I bought this for my father in law, and he was super excited when he got it.</li>
            <li>IT CAME AT FULL LENGTH</li>
            <li>it looks good and appears to be very solid.</li>
            <li>It does not have any self defense use as it could break pretty easy.</li>
            <li>I am thrilled that there are companies that are still putting the customer first, I would love to work with them in the future.</li>
            <li>I began researching for a Walking Stick / Cane that I would not be ashamed of being seen in public, I researched many, many web sites &amp; styles of Walking Sticks / Cane as well as Walking Stafs.</li>
            <li>Being a former Plant Manager I pay close attention to the entire customer experience and find the best sellers are the ones who can remedy issues between the customer and the seller and the methods utilized in making the customer satisfied to the extent that future purchases is all but guaranteed as well as strong recommendations to friends etc.</li>
            <li>Looking forward to many years of use with my new BubbaStik /</li>
            <li>it fits my hand and easy to very comtrible to walk with, if you need one for walking this</li>
            <li>I really love this finely crafted walking stick and unlike the others that have preceded it I believe it will out last and out</li>
            <li>Not nearly as heavy as I thought it&#x27;d be, but sure to make an impression...</li>
            <li>well worth the money</li>
            <li>I sent it as a gift and have not actually seen it, but I got a warm Thank</li>
            <li>As a bonus benefit, the combination of the Bubba Stik and my Filipino stick-fighting lessons in CA 30 years ago turns me into a formidable self-defense system - extremely useful against a knife attack.</li>
            <li>I was extremely delighted with dealing directly with BubbaSam as to my initial contact with several questions, BubbaSam responded to my inquiries that same afternoon with an impressive display of product information, knowledge of intended customer need &amp; a passion about BubbaStik product offerings to include customization possibilities.</li>
            <li>High quality and strong</li>
            <li>Well right away it became one of the items on my Christmas list, and my wife was nice enough to pick it out.</li>
            <li>If I was the type of person who enjoyed advertising for other people, I suppose it would be okay, but as is, it just looks tacky.</li>
            <li>It came right on time, without packing problems.  </li>
            <li>I weigh about 250 and have pushed substantial weight down on top of this safely.</li>
            <li>very high quality, looks great, not you typical run of the mill cane.</li>
            <li>apparently two more scres would not hold into the wood.  </li>
            <li>I am very pleased with the quality of the cane and hope I really never need to use it , but it will always be a prized posession.</li>
            <li>and I could not be happier; it is very well built, fit my hand very well</li>
            <li>Honestly I was disappointed in the cane, I had purchased one before at a Love&#x27;s store in Oklahoma and it had a bright Shiney brass handle</li>
            <li>The twine provides an interesting texture, and an extra grip in that location, and it&#x27;s sort of like taping a baseball bat.</li>
            <li>He absolutely loves this cane!  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure would do as well even though it&#x27;s not one solid</li>
            <li>They cost upwards of double, and more which is just not my style.</li>
            <li>I am assuming this is more of a novelty item versus an acutal cane to use daily.</li>
            <li>they phoned again tonight and were extremely helpful, honest and considerate.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s just as comfortable in the left or right</li>
            <li>Draws lots of positive comments.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s nice to know you have it if it ever came down to it.</li>
            <li>and I was extremely pleased with the overall design &amp; high quality parts &amp; workmanship.</li>
            <li>The tallness of the hickory shaft and the brass, harness collar hame tip are easy to handle, not to mention rather re-assuring when carrying anything else is not possible.</li>
            <li>I certainly will buy another.</li>
            <li>All I know is that I am very dissappointed.</li>
            <li>,I WOULD RECOMMENDED THIS TO EVERY ONE THAT WANTS A WALKING STICK</li>
            <li>Got this for my husband who is getting ready to have surgery on his knee.</li>
            <li>It arrived as described and fast delivery.</li>
            <li>This is a real classey piece of work.  </li>
            <li>It was retrieved and I was more careful after that.  </li>
            <li>You, so mission accomplished.</li>
            <li>ready</li>
            <li>Very sturdy.</li>
            <li>very sterdy and fashionable.</li>
            <li>Very well made, stained,  and hand built.</li>
            <li>I REALLY LIKE THE BUBBA STIK.  </li>
            <li>Thanks.</li>
            <li>Plus, it seems like it would double as a good beating stick if you ever got in a rough spot, haha.</li>
            <li>Its sturdy and nice looking but if your hands prespire in hot weather the handle gets slick.  </li>
            <li>And it is a particular weapon for self defence, whether it is against an animal or person.</li>
            <li>You can go to bubbastikDOTcom  for more custom colored handles,  like chrome(for more money) ,  and expensive woods from around the world,  like  teak. .</li>
            <li>The Bubba Stik I have will last many generations with proper care.&lt;br /&gt;Just</li>
            <li>This exact same walking stick is available at my local Loves Truck stop in Grayson, Ky. for $25.00 and not on clearance</li>
            <li>It offers a unique look and strong support; also the heavy brass end offers a sense of protection.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this cane.    </li>
            <li>I highly recommend purchasing through BubbaStik.com.</li>
            <li>It would be a good one for a man, because it is a little long, but even as a 5&#x27;5&amp;#34; woman, this works for me!</li>
            <li>2014&lt;br /&gt;Received my new StepinStik, from BubbaStik.com on Monday August 11, 2014.</li>
            <li>top heavy and will tip over....much to my dismay at Mt Rushmore when it fell thru the slats of the fence!  </li>
            <li>When this one gets scarred and old</li>
            <li>If you only want a walking stick that you could use to correct unruly behavior this will REALLY do it.  </li>
            <li>Just what I was looking for and as far as style it meets all expectations.</li>
            <li>This cane is very well made the brass pommel is solidly attached.&lt;br /&gt;2.</li>
            <li>I am young and don&#x27;t want an old mans cane</li>
            <li>The only thing is that they don&#x27;t lean against anything very well...</li>
            <li>As far as one reviewer&#x27;s claim about passing TSA &amp; boarding a plane, my job requires weekly air travel all over the country - I&#x27;ve never once been denied boarding with this cane - so that claim does not hold up.</li>
            <li>I get lots of comments on it ,it is very durable and solid .I</li>
            <li>If it has one flaw, I&#x27;d say it is having the brand, a rather loud and unsubtle appellation, emblazoned on the shaft.</li>
            <li>I was excited to get this new cane to walk with, however after only a few days use, the hame began turning my hand colors.</li>
            <li>It is extremely top heavy compared to any other cane i&#x27;ve held</li>
            <li>The one I bought from you was dull and didn&#x27;t fit the wood as well.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a 75 year old Texas Harley rider with occasional bouts of gout.</li>
            <li>Everyone wants to steal it, have to be careful not to leave it un-attended!</li>
            <li>The walking cane I got appeared used as the rubber at the bottom was dirty and the brass top has three screw holes but only has one screw in it as they tapered the wood two much so</li>
    </ol>

            <li> I ordered the StepinStik after speaking with BubbaSam and he furnishing idea’s to what might fit best with my needs, which he was spot on and couldn’t be happier.</li>
            <li> An impressive walking stick with a marvelous solid brass handle!  </li>
            <li> Great cane, very comfortable to use.</li>
            <li> The Bubba Stix is a great strudy and handsome cane.</li>
            <li> Now as for self defense: the cane is very top</li>
            <li> PERFECT... GREAT FOR THE OLD MAN!</li>
            <li> Awesome walking stick, extremely sturdy and of excellent quality.</li>
            <li> Yet, this produce remains strong, durable, and looks great.  </li>
            <li> but he needs more of a handle on top, believe me it is beautiful.</li>
            <li> A stout, handsome and comfortable stik at a very fair price.  </li>
            <li> and it fit the wood great.</li>
            <li> I have a couple of nice crook style canes which do the job nicely.</li>
            <li> The brass handle is comfortable, bright, and makes the walking stick look like a good piece of furniture.</li>
            <li> It fits nicely in his palm.  </li>
            <li> A nice length for my tall frame too.</li>
            <li> nice just what i wanted</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure about the &amp;#34;hame&amp;#34; handle, but it&#x27;s really good.</li>
            <li> - -  Thank you for making such a great conversation starter and wonderful product.</li>
            <li> It would be a nice addition to for BUBBA to add either a steel cap to protect the tip.</li>
            <li> Even uninjured, having this is probably a nice way to keep the rif-raf walking on their merry way.</li>
            <li> Very sturdy and brass handle conforms perfectly to hand.</li>
            <li> Nice stick, but the Bubba Stik burned into it turned me off.  </li>
            <li> Excellent product with high quality.</li>
            <li> Very stylish and elegant in my opinion.</li>
            <li> and I am very much impressed with the design of the BubbaStik lines, &amp; with BubbaSam directly.</li>
            <li> I touched upon the BubbaStik web site &amp; product line and became impressed near immediately with its style, strength of design, affordability &amp; made in the U.S.A.</li>
            <li> Very nice product, solid feel and great look</li>
            <li> its very sturdy and being able to cut it off to your own length makes it very nice</li>
            <li> very comfortable walking cane.  </li>
            <li> The hame top is certainly shiny and attractive, makes for quite the luxurious cane until you get to the burned in BUBBA STIK logo on the side.</li>
            <li> and I am sure the TSA will have something to say about my BUBBA STIK</li>
            <li> I am waiting the arrival of my Bubba Stick but wanted to let potential customers know that King Products has excellent customer service.</li>
            <li> and I received many compliments on the styling.</li>
            <li> Kind of cool looking, I am very pleased to have this product available whenever I need it.</li>
            <li> 100% satisfied with Amazon and the \\&quot;Bubba Stick\\&quot;</li>
            <li> I said what I wanted to say I do not understand why I must write so many words that aren&#x27;t needed</li>
            <li> The cane looks great though and people really are impresssed by it.</li>
            <li> It seemed to be more for looks than function.</li>
            <li> Well  made, solid, wonderful.</li>
            <li> I love this cane.  </li>
            <li> The quality is top notch.  </li>
            <li> I was sure glad to have it when I injured my knee.  </li>
            <li> sooo  if  you  need  a cane,  why  not  treat your safe to  </li>
            <li> It will develop a lovely patina and then I will shine it and the world will continue to spin.  </li>
            <li> Lovely walking stick.</li>
            <li> It fits the hand so nicely and comfortably.</li>
            <li> The product is well made, heavier then most, and the handle can be used defensively if needed.</li>
            <li> Love the brass sturdy handle.</li>
            <li> I was able to hold them until police arrived.)</li>
            <li> The Bubba Stik not only matches my image but is the best walking cane I have ever owned.</li>
            <li> It looks so good and is so useful</li>
            <li> IT IS A FAVORITE.</li>
            <li> The horse hame brass top is stunning to look at and luxurious in the palm of your hand.</li>
            <li> The rubber ferrule tip is secured and gripping.  </li>
            <li> age caught up with my hips, needed something to support my left leg, this walking stick is perfect.</li>
            <li> Great product and highly recommended.</li>
            <li> The Bubba Walking Stik is great and i highly reccommend it.</li>
            <li> it is 3 inches too long for me but would be perfect for a guy around 6 foot</li>
            <li> Excellent walking stick to take on trails and long walks.</li>
            <li> Finely polished brass Hame handle,  fitted over top of what appears to be Hickory or Ash (two hardest Tennessee woods I know of.)</li>
            <li> Most importantly to me,is that it was made in the U.S.A..</li>
            <li> It is very well made, looks good, and I am always being asked where I got it from.</li>
            <li> It can be easily read from across the room.</li>
            <li> ; easily trimmed to your correct length.  </li>
            <li> It is sturdy and easily held.  </li>
            <li> The stained hardwood is light and smooth, lacking the rustic look and weight of the Amish stick</li>
            <li> It is well made, very sturdy and the handles is nice brass.</li>
            <li> worth the 50.00 for sure</li>
            <li> my husband is so proud of his Bubba walking stick, now he is happy to display such a beauty instead of his regular cane, he feels like he is all dressed up</li>
            <li> Use it as my primary cane.</li>
            <li> I really like that the brass is not covered in any kind of coating.  </li>
            <li> Overall if you want a great walking stick, and something to defend yourself in times of need get this one.</li>
            <li> Hame is securely fastened with a counter sunk brass hex screw.</li>
            <li> This cane feels very comfortable in my hand; the knob shaped handle is especially form fitting with the type of arthritis I have in my hands - feels made just for me!</li>
            <li> He had been using those canes you buy at the drug store, but I wanted something unique and &amp;#34;manly&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li> The top of the Hame(head) is positioned for easy grip like holding a doorknob,  only on an angle suitable for walking.</li>
            <li> And these sticks with their long brass handle are mighty nice looking too!  </li>
            <li> Cool brass handle makes for unique purchase.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Brass handle is very comfortable and weight makes it good for safety as well if you should run into a less than friendly dog on a walk .</li>
            <li> I bought this for my father in law, and he was super excited when he got it.</li>
            <li> IT CAME AT FULL LENGTH</li>
            <li> it looks good and appears to be very solid.</li>
            <li> It does not have any self defense use as it could break pretty easy.</li>
            <li> I am thrilled that there are companies that are still putting the customer first, I would love to work with them in the future.</li>
            <li> I began researching for a Walking Stick / Cane that I would not be ashamed of being seen in public, I researched many, many web sites &amp; styles of Walking Sticks / Cane as well as Walking Stafs.</li>
            <li> Being a former Plant Manager I pay close attention to the entire customer experience and find the best sellers are the ones who can remedy issues between the customer and the seller and the methods utilized in making the customer satisfied to the extent that future purchases is all but guaranteed as well as strong recommendations to friends etc.</li>
            <li> Looking forward to many years of use with my new BubbaStik /</li>
            <li> it fits my hand and easy to very comtrible to walk with, if you need one for walking this</li>
            <li> I really love this finely crafted walking stick and unlike the others that have preceded it I believe it will out last and out</li>
            <li> Not nearly as heavy as I thought it&#x27;d be, but sure to make an impression...</li>
            <li> well worth the money</li>
            <li> I sent it as a gift and have not actually seen it, but I got a warm Thank</li>
            <li> As a bonus benefit, the combination of the Bubba Stik and my Filipino stick-fighting lessons in CA 30 years ago turns me into a formidable self-defense system - extremely useful against a knife attack.</li>
            <li> I was extremely delighted with dealing directly with BubbaSam as to my initial contact with several questions, BubbaSam responded to my inquiries that same afternoon with an impressive display of product information, knowledge of intended customer need &amp; a passion about BubbaStik product offerings to include customization possibilities.</li>
            <li> High quality and strong</li>
            <li> Well right away it became one of the items on my Christmas list, and my wife was nice enough to pick it out.</li>
            <li> If I was the type of person who enjoyed advertising for other people, I suppose it would be okay, but as is, it just looks tacky.</li>
            <li> It came right on time, without packing problems.  </li>
            <li> I weigh about 250 and have pushed substantial weight down on top of this safely.</li>
            <li> very high quality, looks great, not you typical run of the mill cane.</li>
            <li> apparently two more scres would not hold into the wood.  </li>
            <li> I am very pleased with the quality of the cane and hope I really never need to use it , but it will always be a prized posession.</li>
            <li> and I could not be happier; it is very well built, fit my hand very well</li>
            <li> Honestly I was disappointed in the cane, I had purchased one before at a Love&#x27;s store in Oklahoma and it had a bright Shiney brass handle</li>
            <li> The twine provides an interesting texture, and an extra grip in that location, and it&#x27;s sort of like taping a baseball bat.</li>
            <li> He absolutely loves this cane!  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure would do as well even though it&#x27;s not one solid</li>
            <li> They cost upwards of double, and more which is just not my style.</li>
            <li> I am assuming this is more of a novelty item versus an acutal cane to use daily.</li>
            <li> they phoned again tonight and were extremely helpful, honest and considerate.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s just as comfortable in the left or right</li>
            <li> Draws lots of positive comments.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s nice to know you have it if it ever came down to it.</li>
            <li> and I was extremely pleased with the overall design &amp; high quality parts &amp; workmanship.</li>
            <li> The tallness of the hickory shaft and the brass, harness collar hame tip are easy to handle, not to mention rather re-assuring when carrying anything else is not possible.</li>
            <li> I certainly will buy another.</li>
            <li> All I know is that I am very dissappointed.</li>
            <li> ,I WOULD RECOMMENDED THIS TO EVERY ONE THAT WANTS A WALKING STICK</li>
            <li> Got this for my husband who is getting ready to have surgery on his knee.</li>
            <li> It arrived as described and fast delivery.</li>
            <li> This is a real classey piece of work.  </li>
            <li> It was retrieved and I was more careful after that.  </li>
            <li> You, so mission accomplished.</li>
            <li> ready</li>
            <li> Very sturdy.</li>
            <li> very sterdy and fashionable.</li>
            <li> Very well made, stained,  and hand built.</li>
            <li> I REALLY LIKE THE BUBBA STIK.  </li>
            <li> Thanks.</li>
            <li> Plus, it seems like it would double as a good beating stick if you ever got in a rough spot, haha.</li>
            <li> Its sturdy and nice looking but if your hands prespire in hot weather the handle gets slick.  </li>
            <li> And it is a particular weapon for self defence, whether it is against an animal or person.</li>
            <li> You can go to bubbastikDOTcom  for more custom colored handles,  like chrome(for more money) ,  and expensive woods from around the world,  like  teak. .</li>
            <li> The Bubba Stik I have will last many generations with proper care.&lt;br /&gt;Just</li>
            <li> This exact same walking stick is available at my local Loves Truck stop in Grayson, Ky. for $25.00 and not on clearance</li>
            <li> It offers a unique look and strong support; also the heavy brass end offers a sense of protection.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this cane.    </li>
            <li> I highly recommend purchasing through BubbaStik.com.</li>
            <li> It would be a good one for a man, because it is a little long, but even as a 5&#x27;5&amp;#34; woman, this works for me!</li>
            <li> 2014&lt;br /&gt;Received my new StepinStik, from BubbaStik.com on Monday August 11, 2014.</li>
            <li> top heavy and will tip over....much to my dismay at Mt Rushmore when it fell thru the slats of the fence!  </li>
            <li> When this one gets scarred and old</li>
            <li> If you only want a walking stick that you could use to correct unruly behavior this will REALLY do it.  </li>
            <li> Just what I was looking for and as far as style it meets all expectations.</li>
            <li> This cane is very well made the brass pommel is solidly attached.&lt;br /&gt;2.</li>
            <li> I am young and don&#x27;t want an old mans cane</li>
            <li> The only thing is that they don&#x27;t lean against anything very well...</li>
            <li> As far as one reviewer&#x27;s claim about passing TSA &amp; boarding a plane, my job requires weekly air travel all over the country - I&#x27;ve never once been denied boarding with this cane - so that claim does not hold up.</li>
            <li> I get lots of comments on it ,it is very durable and solid .I</li>
            <li> If it has one flaw, I&#x27;d say it is having the brand, a rather loud and unsubtle appellation, emblazoned on the shaft.</li>
            <li> I was excited to get this new cane to walk with, however after only a few days use, the hame began turning my hand colors.</li>
            <li> It is extremely top heavy compared to any other cane i&#x27;ve held</li>
            <li> The one I bought from you was dull and didn&#x27;t fit the wood as well.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a 75 year old Texas Harley rider with occasional bouts of gout.</li>
            <li> Everyone wants to steal it, have to be careful not to leave it un-attended!</li>
            <li> The walking cane I got appeared used as the rubber at the bottom was dirty and the brass top has three screw holes but only has one screw in it as they tapered the wood two much so</li>
            <li> It is a shame that such a handsome cane such as this is ruined with such stupidity.</li>
            <li> (although I was a little surprised it shipped from California, not from Texas!)</li>
            <li> I  am 73 and don&#x27;t need a cane at this time, but I had seen one and was afraid that when I needed on I wouldn&#x27;t be able to find one.  </li>
            <li> This cane is long but can be cut to size for a shorter person.</li>
            <li> The shaft is a long grain hardwood.</li>
            <li> The stik is long and may require a trim even for a six-footer.  </li>
            <li> but in every other sense seems the equal of the Amish stick.</li>
            <li> It can be used as a solid club due to the fact the handle is so heavy.&lt;br /&gt;4.</li>
            <li> Another thing, I&#x27;d probably give the stick itself maybe a 3 or 4 star due to the \\&quot;Hard Wood\\&quot; being a rather light type of hard wood.</li>
            <li> The only problem we had was removeing the rubber tip as we needed to cut the stick down a couple of inches.</li>
            <li> As others have mentioned if you have a truck stop nearby you may find this basic model for much less than listed here.</li>
            <li> It has Bubba Stik imprinted in black facing towards the back (or the way the Hame faces. )</li>
            <li> I cover the BUBBA STIK name by winding twine in circles around it in a tight, orderly way, and you can put plain old glue under the twine so you don&#x27;t need to re-twist and tighten it every day.</li>
            <li> Also the finish on the brass handle has started to wear off after a few short months of use.</li>
            <li> I finally did with heavy duty glue and making plugs and using a dowel screw what a pain to fix</li>
            <li> and i will certainly use the cane but kinda wish 2 silly words weren&#x27;t etched and burned into the side.</li>
            <li> so I don&#x27;t need to cut it down any as some folks may.</li>
            <li> It has \\&quot;BUBBA STIK\\&quot; in half inch letters burned into the wood.</li>
            <li> I had a quadruple heart bypass and used my hiking stick to provide a little balance as I recovered.</li>
            <li> My dad is 6&#x27;2 and is at times a little unstable on his feet</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m an X shop teacher and there are hard wood technically called hard</li>
            <li> it seems like a waste of my time and the person that has to review what I wrote.</li>
            <li> He uses it everyday.  </li>
            <li> In other words do not expect Hickory, Ash or some other real hard wood.</li>
            <li> heavy making it useless for Gung Fu cane</li>
            <li> If I have to be injured so badly and convalescing with such a thing to hold me up, I could do much worse.</li>
            <li> AND I STILL HAVE BEEN HESITANT ABOUT CUTTING IT DOWN TO SIZE</li>
            <li> It is not a comfortable cane and is impossible to lean it against a counter or table if you are out shopping and need to use both hands.</li>
            <li> Needing a cane stinks, no question.  </li>
            <li> Could probably put another cutting notch or two.</li>
            <li> I have bad knees</li>
            <li> Too bad it can&#x27;t be adjustible.</li>
            <li> I hurt my knee and ordered this to use instead of an ugly cane.</li>
            <li> He was so shocked and surprized at the quality and appearance!!</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> The walking cane I got appeared used as the rubber at the bottom was dirty and the brass top has three screw holes but only has one screw in it as they tapered the wood two much so apparently two more scres would not hold into the wood.  I don&#x27;t know what their reasoning was.  All I know is that I am very dissappointed. IOt did not even come with any paperwork as to who it was from or what it was.  That is what makes me think they shipped me a used stick.  I definately would not suggest anyone else buying this product from the company.</li>
            <li> I have received my Bubba Stik. It fits my hand well, it has good balance and it looks very good except for one thing. It has \\&quot;BUBBA STIK\\&quot; in half inch letters burned into the wood. It can be easily read from across the room. I travel a lot and I am sure the TSA will have something to say about my BUBBA STIK, it might as well have burned into the stik \\&quot; HEAD BASHER \\&quot;. You are allowed to have a cane with you when you board a plane, the law does not say you are allowed a STICK. It is a shame that such a handsome cane such as this is ruined with such stupidity.</li>
            <li> Bought it for my brother as a gift. He used it once and the knob broke off of it. Had to send it back.</li>
            <li> This is an extremely attractive, sturdy walking stick.  The fact that it has grooves just in case it&#x27;s height needs to be adjusted is a plus.  When this one gets scarred and old I certainly will buy another.</li>
            <li> I am waiting the arrival of my Bubba Stick but wanted to let potential customers know that King Products has excellent customer service. I sent an email through the Amazon link about the product, they called in the am and left a message, when I didn&#x27;t call them back they phoned again tonight and were extremely helpful, honest and considerate. I am thrilled that there are companies that are still putting the customer first, I would love to work with them in the future. I will keep you posted as to the arrival and product.</li>
            <li> I got this after knee surgery and I could not be happier; it is very well built, fit my hand very well and I received many compliments on the styling.</li>
            <li> VERY GOOD PRODUCT ,I WOULD RECOMMENDED THIS TO EVERY ONE THAT WANTS A WALKING STICK AT A GOOD PRICE .</li>
            <li> Its sturdy and nice looking but if your hands prespire in hot weather the handle gets slick.  I almost fell once.  Also the finish on the brass handle has started to wear off after a few short months of use.</li>
            <li> This is the best walking stick of the five that I own.  And it is a particular weapon for self defence, whether it is against an animal or person. DaBubba</li>
            <li> Not nearly as heavy as I thought it&#x27;d be, but sure to make an impression...</li>
            <li> I  am 73 and don&#x27;t need a cane at this time, but I had seen one and was afraid that when I needed on I wouldn&#x27;t be able to find one.  I am very pleased with the quality of the cane and hope I really never need to use it , but it will always be a prized posession.</li>
            <li> This exact same walking stick is available at my local Loves Truck stop in Grayson, Ky. for $25.00 and not on clearance but this is their regular retail price so do not let these guys rip you off. If you want one just keep your eyes open the next time you get gas at the local truck stop and no shipping. Another thing, I&#x27;d probably give the stick itself maybe a 3 or 4 star due to the \\&quot;Hard Wood\\&quot; being a rather light type of hard wood. In other words do not expect Hickory, Ash or some other real hard wood. I&#x27;m an X shop teacher and there are hard wood technically called hard that are of the cheaper variety which are light and easily broken which I believe these are made with.</li>
            <li> Bubba joins the \\&quot;Amish\\&quot; walking stick I purchased earlier this year. The sticks are for my wife and I to use during our walks in the desert - as an aid for walking AND to discourage any feral friends that we may meet. The Bubba arrived promptly and seems sturdy and is a good looking stick. The stained hardwood is light and smooth, lacking the rustic look and weight of the Amish stick but in every other sense seems the equal of the Amish stick.</li>
            <li> I have to use a walking stick everyhere I go. I have a couple of nice crook style canes which do the job nicely. I was looking for something different. This was it. Well made, flawless condition and comfortable to walk with. Kind of cool looking, I am very pleased to have this product available whenever I need it.</li>
            <li> I had a quadruple heart bypass and used my hiking stick to provide a little balance as I recovered. One day I was looking on the web and came upon \\&quot;The Bubba Stix\\&quot; It looked sturdy and the handle caught my attention. Well right away it became one of the items on my Christmas list, and my wife was nice enough to pick it out. I have used it since and can reccommend it. The tallness of the hickory shaft and the brass, harness collar hame tip are easy to handle, not to mention rather re-assuring when carrying anything else is not possible. I will save my duckets for another color.</li>
            <li> Now THIS is my idea of a walking stick! If you need a cane this one will do the job.If you only want a walking stick that you could use to correct unruly behavior this will REALLY do it.  And these sticks with their long brass handle are mighty nice looking too!  High quality and strong; easily trimmed to your correct length.  And the folks who own the company are great people.  Great product and highly recommended.</li>
            <li> Just what I was looking for and as far as style it meets all expectations. 100% satisfied with Amazon and the \\&quot;Bubba Stick\\&quot;</li>
            <li> Great cane, very comfortable to use. Everyone wants to steal it, have to be careful not to leave it un-attended!</li>
            <li> excellent walking cane . I have bad knees so it makes things easier!!</li>
            <li> Just what I wanted.  I said what I wanted to say I do not understand why I must write so many words that aren&#x27;t needed it seems like a waste of my time and the person that has to review what I wrote.</li>
            <li> The Bubba Stix is a great strudy and handsome cane. It offers a unique look and strong support; also the heavy brass end offers a sense of protection. I highly recommend this cane.    Cordially,  Jack</li>
            <li> I purchased this as a gift because I already have two of them. The knob on top is perfect to hold. It fits your hand and never causes hand cramps. I like that you can cut the shaft to your length. It&#x27;s the perfect cane</li>
            <li> Got this for my husband who is getting ready to have surgery on his knee. It is well made, very sturdy and the handles is nice brass. The only problem we had was removeing the rubber tip as we needed to cut the stick down a couple of inches. It arrived as described and fast delivery. Hubby is very happy with his &amp;#34;Bubba&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> The Bubba Stick has given me the ability to continue my walks in town and at home. I feel safer with the Stick beause it is so sturdy. People comment on the originality of the look of the Stick.</li>
            <li> 1. This cane is very well made the brass pommel is solidly attached.&lt;br /&gt;2. This cane is long but can be cut to size for a shorter person. I am 5 foot 8 it is 3 inches too long for me but would be perfect for a guy around 6 foot 2.&lt;br /&gt;3. Now as for self defense: the cane is very top heavy making it useless for Gung Fu cane based martial arts. It can be used as a solid club due to the fact the handle is so heavy.&lt;br /&gt;4. The cane looks great though and people really are impresssed by it. I am young and don&#x27;t want an old mans cane so this fits the bill. worth the 50.00 for sure</li>
            <li> It is not a comfortable cane and is impossible to lean it against a counter or table if you are out shopping and need to use both hands. It seemed to be more for looks than function. It does not have any self defense use as it could break pretty easy.</li>
            <li> This is a real classey piece of work.  The brass handle is comfortable, bright, and makes the walking stick look like a good piece of furniture.</li>
            <li> The hame top is certainly shiny and attractive, makes for quite the luxurious cane until you get to the burned in BUBBA STIK logo on the side. I knew it was coming and i will certainly use the cane but kinda wish 2 silly words weren&#x27;t etched and burned into the side. It is plenty tall, way too tall for me but I needed above the standard 36&amp;#34; (really only another inch) so i will just cut it to my height. It is extremely top heavy compared to any other cane i&#x27;ve held but i was expecting that too. Hopefully no one accuses it of being a club or weapon otherwise.</li>
            <li> This is my 2d Bubba Stick.  I gave 1st one to my Dad.  It came right on time, without packing problems.  Very satisfied!</li>
            <li> my husband is so proud of his Bubba walking stick, now he is happy to display such a beauty instead of his regular cane, he feels like he is all dressed up</li>
            <li> its the best cane I have ever seen . its very sturdy and being able to cut it off to your own length makes it very nice</li>
            <li> As soon as my hand wrapped around this brass knob I knew this was for me. Well  made, solid, wonderful.</li>
            <li> very comfortable walking cane.  great style also.</li>
            <li> I hurt my knee and ordered this to use instead of an ugly cane. It met my expetations, although I had to adjust the height.</li>
            <li> The head broke off and I am still trying to figure out how to fix it I finally did with heavy duty glue and making plugs and using a dowel screw what a pain to fix</li>
            <li> I love this cane.  It is very well made, looks good, and I am always being asked where I got it from.</li>
            <li> Beautifully made. Too bad it can&#x27;t be adjustible.</li>
            <li> Packaging shipped well.  Very attractive.</li>
            <li> my husband loves it.  well worth the money</li>
            <li> My neighbor gave my husband and I each one....Big Bubba and Lady Bubba.  The quality is top notch.  I was sure glad to have it when I injured my knee.  The only thing is that they don&#x27;t lean against anything very well...they&#x27;re top heavy and will tip over....much to my dismay at Mt Rushmore when it fell thru the slats of the fence!  It was retrieved and I was more careful after that.  It&#x27;s an awesome walking stick.  :-)</li>
            <li> I sent it as a gift and have not actually seen it, but I got a warm Thank You, so mission accomplished.</li>
            <li> This is my third one of these (2 lost) so obviously I like it. although I have no idea why they call it Texas style. It is well made but the Tennessee wood is Not a Hardwood ( possibly birch).</li>
            <li> i must say  this is  the  best, cane i  ever  had, plus  good  for  protection,  sooo  if  you  need  a cane,  why  not  treat your safe to  the  {{{best}}}  so  order  it or  ready,  you won&#x27;t  be  srry.  thank  you  S.DAVIS  NYC</li>
            <li> Great product - love the brass handle &amp; craftsmanship &amp; the fact that is made in USA!  Would recommend it to anyone needing a lift!</li>
            <li> GOOD THING AND CORRECT IN THE HAND.</li>
            <li> We bought this for my dad and he loves it.  It fits nicely in his palm.  It is sturdy and easily held.  Thank you</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had one of these for about 4 years. Use it as my primary cane. Draws lots of positive comments. Very sturdy. Very attractive. As far as one reviewer&#x27;s claim about passing TSA &amp; boarding a plane, my job requires weekly air travel all over the country - I&#x27;ve never once been denied boarding with this cane - so that claim does not hold up.</li>
            <li> This cane feels very comfortable in my hand; the knob shaped handle is especially form fitting with the type of arthritis I have in my hands - feels made just for me! Very stylish and elegant in my opinion. A nice length for my tall frame too. As others have mentioned if you have a truck stop nearby you may find this basic model for much less than listed here.</li>
            <li> BOUGHT FOR MY BOSS...LOVES IT</li>
            <li> I really love this finely crafted walking stick and unlike the others that have preceded it I believe it will out last and out shine them all.  I really like that the brass is not covered in any kind of coating.  Just brass.  It will develop a lovely patina and then I will shine it and the world will continue to spin.  Lovely walking stick.</li>
            <li> This item was a gift to a person who needs one to ambulate.  He was so shocked and surprized at the quality and appearance!!</li>
            <li> Perfect for me as a cane, walking stick,-well made, sturdy and handsome.</li>
            <li> nice just what i wanted</li>
            <li> This is a very good walking stick . I get lots of comments on it ,it is very durable and solid .I would order another if I had to.</li>
            <li> This is just stunning and so well-made; I am totally impressed with it (although I was a little surprised it shipped from California, not from Texas!) I wasn&#x27;t sure about the &amp;#34;hame&amp;#34; handle, but it&#x27;s really good. It fits the hand so nicely and comfortably. It would be a good one for a man, because it is a little long, but even as a 5&#x27;5&amp;#34; woman, this works for me!</li>
            <li> The Bubba Walking Stik is great and i highly reccommend it.Most importantly to me,is that it was made in the U.S.A..&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#34;God Bless the U.S.A&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> An impressive walking stick with a marvelous solid brass handle!  While Bubba Stick is branded on the stick I don&#x27;t mind.  I&#x27;d recommend this product!</li>
            <li> Awesome walking stick, extremely sturdy and of excellent quality. Brass handle is very comfortable and weight makes it good for safety as well if you should run into a less than friendly dog on a walk .</li>
            <li> I was completely happy with my order. It was a replacement for one I had that was stolen. Yes, I would recommend King Products to friends.</li>
            <li> awsome....very sterdy and fashionable.</li>
            <li> This &amp;#34;Bubba Stick&amp;#34; is truly a work of art.&lt;br /&gt;My Husband loves it and is proud to be seen using it.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you.</li>
            <li> Needing a cane stinks, no question.  Yet, this produce remains strong, durable, and looks great.  I could not be happier with this cane in my hand.  - -  Thank you for making such a great conversation starter and wonderful product.</li>
            <li> I have to use a cane whenever I walk. The BUBBA STIK was received as a gift. It is truly a gem of a stick and great defensive tool. The product is well made, heavier then most, and the handle can be used defensively if needed. Overall if you want a great walking stick, and something to defend yourself in times of need get this one. The only issue is the rubber tip which will wear out over time. It would be a nice addition to for BUBBA to add either a steel cap to protect the tip.</li>
            <li> If it has one flaw, I&#x27;d say it is having the brand, a rather loud and unsubtle appellation, emblazoned on the shaft. I cover the BUBBA STIK name by winding twine in circles around it in a tight, orderly way, and you can put plain old glue under the twine so you don&#x27;t need to re-twist and tighten it every day. I did not glue it on mine, and tighten it periodically, like worry beads I guess. The twine provides an interesting texture, and an extra grip in that location, and it&#x27;s sort of like taping a baseball bat. It has a rubber stopper on the bottom, and I&#x27;m tall so I don&#x27;t need to cut it down any as some folks may. I weigh about 250 and have pushed substantial weight down on top of this safely. If I have to be injured so badly and convalescing with such a thing to hold me up, I could do much worse. Even uninjured, having this is probably a nice way to keep the rif-raf walking on their merry way. The brass head has some density to it. Well made. Peace!</li>
            <li> I got this cane for my dad on Father&#x27;s day 2012!  He absolutely loves this cane!  He uses it everyday.  My dad is 6&#x27;2 and is at times a little unstable on his feet so he uses a cane.  He had been using those canes you buy at the drug store, but I wanted something unique and &amp;#34;manly&amp;#34;.  He loves this cane!</li>
            <li> Wish the wood was sturdier. Love the brass sturdy handle. Excellent walking stick to take on trails and long walks.</li>
            <li> Very nice product, solid feel and great look</li>
            <li> Excellent product with high quality.</li>
            <li> Great product! Very sturdy and brass handle conforms perfectly to hand. Definitely recommend. Way too tall for 5&#x27;10&amp;#34; person. Could probably put another cutting notch or two.</li>
            <li> (written by NJCELT the husband of Pixiegirl19) Finely polished brass Hame handle,  fitted over top of what appears to be Hickory or Ash (two hardest Tennessee woods I know of.) The top of the Hame(head) is positioned for easy grip like holding a doorknob,  only on an angle suitable for walking. I&#x27;ve used it all day and it&#x27;s just as comfortable in the left or right hand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Hame is securely fastened with a counter sunk brass hex screw. Very well made, stained,  and hand built. It has Bubba Stik imprinted in black facing towards the back (or the way the Hame faces. )&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I guarantee anyone thinking of bettering you over your wallet, will think twice when the see that brass head knocker... lol(seriously though)&lt;br /&gt;It is as well balanced as my Shillelagh Walking stick from Ireland. That Shillelagh got a pair of would be muggers(in downtown Pittsburgh at twilight like a 5 wood hitting a golf ball 300 yards! I was able to hold them until police arrived.) The Bubba Stick I&#x27;m sure would do as well even though it&#x27;s not one solid piece(like a Shillelagh) it is very solid and well balanced! It&#x27;s nice to know you have it if it ever came down to it. I&#x27;m not calling it a weapon, it isn&#x27;t. I&#x27;m just stating(IMO) what its capabilities are!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My wife calls this a gentleman&#x27;s walking stick. She thinks I should only use it for dress occasions. I think this suits any man (or woman) who likes a rugged well made walking stick with a bit of flair.&lt;br /&gt;I bought mine here. You can go to bubbastikDOTcom  for more custom colored handles,  like chrome(for more money) ,  and expensive woods from around the world,  like  teak. . They cost upwards of double, and more which is just not my style. The Bubba Stik I have will last many generations with proper care.&lt;br /&gt;Just letting you know, what customizing they will do for the money.</li>
            <li> PERFECT... GREAT FOR THE OLD MAN!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a 75 year old Texas Harley rider with occasional bouts of gout. My adjustable aluminum walking cane just didn&#x27;t match my biker image. The Bubba Stik not only matches my image but is the best walking cane I have ever owned. As a bonus benefit, the combination of the Bubba Stik and my Filipino stick-fighting lessons in CA 30 years ago turns me into a formidable self-defense system - extremely useful against a knife attack. It looks so good and is so useful, I&#x27;ll probably take it with me even when I don&#x27;t have gout.</li>
            <li> the cane was beautiful, had to return it my brother liked it also for looks but he needs more of a handle on top, believe me it is beautiful.</li>
            <li> Honestly I was disappointed in the cane, I had purchased one before at a Love&#x27;s store in Oklahoma and it had a bright Shiney brass handle and it fit the wood great. The one I bought from you was dull and didn&#x27;t fit the wood as well.</li>
            <li> BubbaStik.com / BubbaSam / Product Review&lt;br /&gt;By Henry Fase, August 16, 2014&lt;br /&gt;Received my new StepinStik, from BubbaStik.com on Monday August 11, 2014. I purchase quite extensively online and I am very much impressed with the design of the BubbaStik lines, &amp; with BubbaSam directly. I began researching for a Walking Stick / Cane that I would not be ashamed of being seen in public, I researched many, many web sites &amp; styles of Walking Sticks / Cane as well as Walking Stafs. I touched upon the BubbaStik web site &amp; product line and became impressed near immediately with its style, strength of design, affordability &amp; made in the U.S.A. I was extremely delighted with dealing directly with BubbaSam as to my initial contact with several questions, BubbaSam responded to my inquiries that same afternoon with an impressive display of product information, knowledge of intended customer need &amp; a passion about BubbaStik product offerings to include customization possibilities. I ordered my StepinStik on Friday and received my purchase on Monday and all shipping charges including package &amp; handling all within my purchase price, no shock &amp; awe at checkout. Upon opening my StepinStik from its well packaged capsule, my eyes lit up and I was extremely pleased with the overall design &amp; high quality parts &amp; workmanship. I ordered the StepinStik after speaking with BubbaSam and he furnishing idea’s to what might fit best with my needs, which he was spot on and couldn’t be happier. Being a former Plant Manager I pay close attention to the entire customer experience and find the best sellers are the ones who can remedy issues between the customer and the seller and the methods utilized in making the customer satisfied to the extent that future purchases is all but guaranteed as well as strong recommendations to friends etc. I highly recommend purchasing through BubbaStik.com. My experience, BubbaStik is the Cadillac of Walking Stik’s. Looking forward to many years of use with my new BubbaStik / StepinStik.new BubbaStik / StepinStik.</li>
            <li> I REALLY LIKE THE BUBBA STIK.  IT IS A FAVORITE. IT CAME AT FULL LENGTH AND I STILL HAVE BEEN HESITANT ABOUT CUTTING IT DOWN TO SIZE BUT THAT FEATURE ALLOWS THE USER TO ADJUST THE LENGTH TO HIS/HER NEEDS.</li>
            <li> The shaft is a long grain hardwood. The horse hame brass top is stunning to look at and luxurious in the palm of your hand.The rubber ferrule tip is secured and gripping.  The stik is long and may require a trim even for a six-footer.  A stout, handsome and comfortable stik at a very fair price.  Thanks.</li>
            <li> age caught up with my hips, needed something to support my left leg, this walking stick is perfect. very high quality, looks great, not you typical run of the mill cane. also a good head knocker if needed!</li>
            <li> I like this walking stick it fits my hand and easy to very comtrible to walk with, if you need one for walking this is one to try.</li>
            <li> Great walking stick. Cool brass handle makes for unique purchase.&lt;br /&gt; Could of done without the &amp;#34;Bubba Stick&amp;#34; burned on back of stick in block letters. But like the quality.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my father in law, and he was super excited when he got it. It is a quality item that is well made. If you need to use a cane, this is the one if you ask me. Plus, it seems like it would double as a good beating stick if you ever got in a rough spot, haha.</li>
            <li> I was excited to get this new cane to walk with, however after only a few days use, the hame began turning my hand colors. I am assuming this is more of a novelty item versus an acutal cane to use daily. As a novelty, it is in great shape and is well manufactured.</li>
            <li> my father in law loves ir he feels it fits his hand perfectly. it looks good and appears to be very solid. give it 5 stars</li>
            <li> Nice stick, but the Bubba Stik burned into it turned me off.  If I was the type of person who enjoyed advertising for other people, I suppose it would be okay, but as is, it just looks tacky.</li>
