            <li>I love the scent.  </li>
            <li>I had to buy more after my family also fell in love with the fragrance.</li>
            <li>I had it myself and knew she would love the&lt;br /&gt;fragrance.  </li>
            <li>I love this scent, it makes me feel like I am on my island when I wear it.</li>
            <li>This is my daughter&#x27;s favorite cologne.</li>
            <li>I love it andchsve for years.</li>
            <li>I love this fragrance I have had people at work</li>
            <li>Love love love it</li>
            <li>Love this perfume -</li>
            <li>It seems like these days so many people are senstative to strong scents, I have never had a problem with Inis.</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t feel like it was the most unique scent I ever smelled.</li>
            <li>Oh by the way, my boyfriend found my little one in my purse and he smells awesome!</li>
            <li>It is light, citrus/fruity and clean smelling.</li>
            <li>Oh so totally fresh!</li>
            <li>I first tried Inis on a trip to Ireland and thought I would never be able to buy it elsewhere.</li>
            <li>This cologne smells clean and fresh and it lasts all day!  </li>
            <li>Honestly, this cologne is too strong and caused several migraines (with just one spray!).</li>
            <li>It is so clean and fresh smelling...</li>
            <li>I bought this based on the reviews and like clean, fresh scents.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s my new favorite now...</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve FINALLY found my favorite perfume!</li>
            <li>I kept trying to wear it because I paid money for it, but I&#x27;m going to go back to Dior Addict 2 and Tresor in Love</li>
            <li>I knew I would love this cologne as I had purchased a bottle during my last trip to Ireland.</li>
            <li>What I found is that if you spray this directly on your skin, the smell is way too overwhelming and too masculine.</li>
            <li>like the other reviewers said, it&#x27;s clean and fresh-smelling, light and crisp, and as a bonus, it&#x27;s not expensive.</li>
            <li>I really like the scent of this cologne.</li>
            <li>The price was reasonable and it was delivered promptly.</li>
            <li>I instantly fell in love with the subtle clean scent.  </li>
            <li>I first found this cologne in an Irish Specialty shop while vacationing in Oregon.  </li>
            <li>If you spray the air and walk into it, the masculine smell seems to evaporate over time leaving a cleaner smell.</li>
            <li>I have alway have loved this fragrance but unable to find in local stores.</li>

            <li> Bought this perfume when I visiting in Fl. Was so happy to find it on Amazon. Love it and will definately buy again! It is so clean and fresh smelling...just like an Irish Island I guess. :)</li>
            <li> I found this cologne when I was in Ireland. Oh so totally fresh! I keep a little one in my purse in case I need to freshen up for an event or a date. It smells like the sea or like you visited Ireland. If you ever get to the Cliffs of Mohr, or kissing the Blarney Stone, you will know what I mean. A wonderful crisp, clean scent. Oh by the way, my boyfriend found my little one in my purse and he smells awesome! Looks like I will have to get more soon!</li>
            <li> I happened upon this perfume in a gift shop. I wasn&#x27;t looking to buy perfume, but it smelled so good, I had to get some. It&#x27;s my new favorite now...like the other reviewers said, it&#x27;s clean and fresh-smelling, light and crisp, and as a bonus, it&#x27;s not expensive. I promise, you will not be disappointed!</li>

            <li> It smells nice and I agree it&#x27;s subtle and not overpowering. Didn&#x27;t feel like it was the most unique scent I ever smelled. It may take on a different scent depending on who wears it.  I gave as a gift so can&#x27;t say from personal experience.</li>
            <li> I was introduced to this fragrance while in Ireland and it has become my go to summer choice. I usually wear Clinique &amp;#34;Elixir&amp;#34; but prefer this in the spring/summer. It is light, citrus/fruity and clean smelling. Love it!</li>
            <li> I love the scent.  I had to buy more after my family also fell in love with the fragrance. thank you</li>
            <li> I bought this is a birthday gift for one of my Irish friends and&lt;br /&gt;she loved it.  I had it myself and knew she would love the&lt;br /&gt;fragrance.  Came way ahead of her celebration so I didn&#x27;t&lt;br /&gt;worry about the delivery factor.</li>
            <li> I love this scent, it makes me feel like I am on my island when I wear it.</li>

            <li> Love this perfume - I bought it on 6/15/2014 and when I sprayed it on this morning (2/20/2015) it was rancid with a very unpleasant odor. It&#x27;s not even a year old, how long was it sitting in the warehouse before I received it for it to go bad this quick.</li>
            <li> This is a perfume, as advertised, for men or women. I have had countless compliments when I wear this perfume. I first tried Inis on a trip to Ireland and thought I would never be able to buy it elsewhere.</li>
