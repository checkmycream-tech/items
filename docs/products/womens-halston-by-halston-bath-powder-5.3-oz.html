            <li>Amazon has done it again by being the &amp;#34;go-to&amp;#34; online purveyor of one of my very favorite products, Halston Perfumed Bath Powder.</li>
            <li>I love it!</li>
            <li>I am sure!</li>
            <li>reminds me of the &amp;#34; 70 &#x27; s &amp;#34; .... nice after a bath or shower...</li>

            <li>This gets harder and harder to find, and some of the halston products that I love, can no longer be found.  </li>
