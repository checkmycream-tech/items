            <li>the product is pretty good,  since when I bought it , I know it shipping from Korean , and take a month ...</li>
            <li>[ Also realized they never sent me the bamboo flavor and replaced it with Shea Butter (came with a free Innisfree cucumber though which seems better)</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m happy for the freebie although not sure if it&#x27;s deliberate or happy accident.</li>
            <li>I had been wanting to try them for awhile, never really knowing which one to choose, the variety pack is perfect!</li>

            <li>Great price for a big pack!</li>
            <li>a light weight essence and doesn&#x27;t clog pores</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d totally recommend these masks; they smell great and they seem to do the job they&#x27;re meant to.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s very easy to use and the materials absorbs very well to your skin.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Not disappointed in terms of quality or variety</li>
            <li>it smells fresh to me, and a bit woodsy too, but i like it!</li>
            <li>Shipped right on time!  </li>
            <li>My skin feels hydrated, toned and overall bright.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t feel that is good for my skin , don&#x27;t make my skin white</li>
            <li>this is cool to try and see if you like it.</li>
            <li>Once you peel off the sheet, rub the leftover essence in your face in massaging circular motions to get the full effect.</li>
            <li>The other packs also came in great condition.</li>
            <li>The package of 15 mask sheets came rather quickly.</li>
            <li>i have tried many different brands and faceshop masks are the most moisturizing</li>
            <li>- maybe it would be better to choose one type to target a specific problem instead of buying the entire set&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, great mask.</li>
            <li>Leaves the skin looking really good and the different functions on each mask is pretty true to what the packaging stated.</li>
            <li>: Lots of serum, good and pretty packaging, light scent, moisturizing and refreshing, great cut, thin, large variety, makes my skin feel soft and dewy after</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m willing to purchase them again!</li>
            <li>The different scents are great and the masks are super soft and soaked.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t expect miracles, but it&#x27;s fun for a nightly luxury.</li>
            <li>Definitely worth a try.  </li>
            <li>They&#x27;re very easy to use (just open the package, unfold the mask, and apply)</li>
            <li>and so I&#x27;ve only tried a few before, but these masks are wonderful!</li>
            <li>i did receive an extra Etude House I Need You (Honey) mask, so that was a lovely surprise too.</li>
            <li>I will definitely be buying more of these when I run out.</li>
            <li>love these facial masks.</li>
            <li>These masks DO contain paraben, as stated in the ingredients list, which I didn&#x27;t realize when I first purchased them.</li>
            <li>Very hydrating!</li>
            <li>I will definitely order more in the future :)</li>
            <li>I bought these because the design was so pretty.</li>
            <li>: Many different types, but don&#x27;t really see a difference between them when I use them</li>
            <li>But itâ€™s nice and fun to try out different facial masks.</li>
            <li>Easy to use, something was leaking when they arrived, but not a big problem</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also much cheaper than buying them in a brick and mortar store.</li>
            <li>This product makes my skin moisturize and very smooth.&lt;br /&gt;ALWAYS</li>
            <li>These aren&#x27;t the cheapest face masks you can buy, but I really like the feel of these.</li>
            <li>the fabric the masks are made of is one of the softest i&#x27;ve used and they are really soaked with essence.&lt;br</li>
            <li>so i use that dor a whole week.</li>
            <li>I enjoy these facial masks a lot!</li>
            <li>I really like it.</li>
            <li>They really make my skin glow.</li>
            <li>Cheap alternative to a real facial.  </li>
            <li>the shipping is fast too.</li>
            <li>Results are temporary, but they are very hydrating if your face needs it.</li>
            <li>Haha</li>
            <li>, it drys a bit fast</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried other masks and this was the most moisturizing.</li>
            <li>also love that there are several different varieties in this pack!  </li>
            <li>Highly recommend this product.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>I tend to use them when my skin needs a little more pampering.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t used all of the masks but my favorites so far are honey and cucumber because they are very moisturizing.</li>
            <li>The variety of masks that you get for the price is definitely worth it, especially if you want something soothing and know you&#x27;re going to be using them often.</li>
            <li>If I could recommend a specific one, the Red Ginseng is sooo good (although it&#x27;s a tad bit stinky) due to</li>
            <li>I am new to face masks</li>
            <li>Did Aloe the next day and it felt really soothing!</li>
            <li>Kind of a hassle to unfold esp when its all wet and sticks to each other.</li>
            <li>I have used these for years, even since I first went to Korea, and they are terrific.  </li>
            <li>Makes your skin feel soft and brand new.</li>
            <li>I wipe the excess liquid from the bag on my elbow and Knees (which tend to be very rough) and it feels super soft!</li>
            <li>I save a little more mask to last me for a while.</li>
            <li>it make my skin soft :&amp;#62;</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s like being in a redwood forest in the early morning.</li>
            <li>After a very stressful day,  these facial packs do wonders.</li>
            <li>they leave your skin feeling soooo soft.  </li>
            <li>Because my skin is really dry during the winter time, I&#x27;m trying out all the moisturizing ones first.</li>
            <li>The cut-outs for the eyes, nose, and mouth were placed fairly accurately for my face size (I have a small face)</li>
            <li>They make my face so soft and leaves a very fresh feeling for the next few days.</li>
            <li>Does cost a little more than getting it shipped directly from Korea, but comes quickly due to amazon prime.</li>
            <li>The two I&#x27;ve tried so far (avocado &amp; cucumber) left my face feeling soft and looking refresh.  </li>
            <li>Found the individual facial packets easy to use and take up little space when i am on the road.</li>
            <li>Exactly like the ones I bought at the little make-up shop in San Francisco Japan town.</li>
            <li>These are less expensive than some of the others out there, but they do contain parabans which supposedly aren&#x27;t that good for you.</li>

            <li> - maybe it would be better to choose one type to target a specific problem instead of buying the entire set&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, great mask.</li>
            <li> Leaves the skin looking really good and the different functions on each mask is pretty true to what the packaging stated.</li>
            <li> : Lots of serum, good and pretty packaging, light scent, moisturizing and refreshing, great cut, thin, large variety, makes my skin feel soft and dewy after</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m willing to purchase them again!</li>
            <li> The different scents are great and the masks are super soft and soaked.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t expect miracles, but it&#x27;s fun for a nightly luxury.</li>
            <li> Definitely worth a try.  </li>
            <li> They&#x27;re very easy to use (just open the package, unfold the mask, and apply)</li>
            <li> and so I&#x27;ve only tried a few before, but these masks are wonderful!</li>
            <li> i did receive an extra Etude House I Need You (Honey) mask, so that was a lovely surprise too.</li>
            <li> I will definitely be buying more of these when I run out.</li>
            <li> love these facial masks.</li>
            <li> These masks DO contain paraben, as stated in the ingredients list, which I didn&#x27;t realize when I first purchased them.</li>
            <li> Very hydrating!</li>
            <li> I will definitely order more in the future :)</li>
            <li> I bought these because the design was so pretty.</li>
            <li> : Many different types, but don&#x27;t really see a difference between them when I use them</li>
            <li> But itâ€™s nice and fun to try out different facial masks.</li>
            <li> Easy to use, something was leaking when they arrived, but not a big problem</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also much cheaper than buying them in a brick and mortar store.</li>
            <li> This product makes my skin moisturize and very smooth.&lt;br /&gt;ALWAYS</li>
            <li> These aren&#x27;t the cheapest face masks you can buy, but I really like the feel of these.</li>
            <li> the fabric the masks are made of is one of the softest i&#x27;ve used and they are really soaked with essence.&lt;br</li>
            <li> so i use that dor a whole week.</li>
            <li> I enjoy these facial masks a lot!</li>
            <li> I really like it.</li>
            <li> They really make my skin glow.</li>
            <li> Cheap alternative to a real facial.  </li>
            <li> the shipping is fast too.</li>
            <li> Results are temporary, but they are very hydrating if your face needs it.</li>
            <li> Haha</li>
            <li> , it drys a bit fast</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried other masks and this was the most moisturizing.</li>
            <li> also love that there are several different varieties in this pack!  </li>
            <li> Highly recommend this product.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I tend to use them when my skin needs a little more pampering.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used all of the masks but my favorites so far are honey and cucumber because they are very moisturizing.</li>
            <li> The variety of masks that you get for the price is definitely worth it, especially if you want something soothing and know you&#x27;re going to be using them often.</li>
            <li> If I could recommend a specific one, the Red Ginseng is sooo good (although it&#x27;s a tad bit stinky) due to</li>
            <li> I am new to face masks</li>
            <li> Did Aloe the next day and it felt really soothing!</li>
            <li> Kind of a hassle to unfold esp when its all wet and sticks to each other.</li>
            <li> I have used these for years, even since I first went to Korea, and they are terrific.  </li>
            <li> Makes your skin feel soft and brand new.</li>
            <li> I wipe the excess liquid from the bag on my elbow and Knees (which tend to be very rough) and it feels super soft!</li>
            <li> I save a little more mask to last me for a while.</li>
            <li> it make my skin soft :&amp;#62;</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s like being in a redwood forest in the early morning.</li>
            <li> After a very stressful day,  these facial packs do wonders.</li>
            <li> they leave your skin feeling soooo soft.  </li>
            <li> Because my skin is really dry during the winter time, I&#x27;m trying out all the moisturizing ones first.</li>
            <li> The cut-outs for the eyes, nose, and mouth were placed fairly accurately for my face size (I have a small face)</li>
            <li> They make my face so soft and leaves a very fresh feeling for the next few days.</li>
            <li> Does cost a little more than getting it shipped directly from Korea, but comes quickly due to amazon prime.</li>
            <li> The two I&#x27;ve tried so far (avocado &amp; cucumber) left my face feeling soft and looking refresh.  </li>
            <li> Found the individual facial packets easy to use and take up little space when i am on the road.</li>
            <li> Exactly like the ones I bought at the little make-up shop in San Francisco Japan town.</li>
            <li> These are less expensive than some of the others out there, but they do contain parabans which supposedly aren&#x27;t that good for you.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s nothing wrong with these masks, though honestly I get better effects out of less expensive brands such as MJ care, Missha, or Fragrance of Morning.</li>
            <li> , i always use them when i don&#x27;t have time due to my busy schedule, it does refresh my skin.</li>
            <li> There is so much liquid goodness in each pouch, that I will usually wear the mask and keep the excess until the next day and slather it on.</li>
            <li> Having never tried masks before, I have to say that I&#x27;m quickly becoming addicted to these!  </li>
            <li> There is usually enough &amp;#34;juice&amp;#34; left in the mask pouch to apply some of the moisture to other parts of my body!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The chin part is ridiculously long and the forehead as well.  </li>
            <li> I ended up throwing half of them away (what was left), and I&#x27;m going back to Innisfree</li>
            <li> , my face has definitely been less dry!</li>
            <li> I have very dry skin</li>
            <li> I know this fuss about paraben doesn&#x27;t rely on solid scientific proof, at least not yet, but I would definitely prefer to avoid paraben altogether.</li>
            <li> Have used products with paraben before but from recent findings I will try not to.&lt;br /&gt;After using for 3 days, green tea -&gt; aloe -&gt;</li>
            <li> Came in rice, acai berry, lemon, aloex2, mung bean, blueberry, avocado, red ginseng, green tea, honey pomegranate, olive, shea butter, kelp scents.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Just be careful not to get the excess moisture from the masks onto any fabric-</li>
            <li> Tried Green Tea first, not sure if it was because it was in the fridge and too cold, but it had a burning sensation for the first 3-5 mins.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t see any extreme changes in my skin condition, but I like to use these masks for relaxation.&lt;br /&gt;14</li>
            <li> The only negative thing I can say about these face masks is that they look pretty creepy.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s not worth it at</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s made for very narrow but long faces.  </li>
            <li> Also a little big for my face and hard to cover my face with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> some of the masks leave a little color on your skin (fruit-based masks for instance) and could leave some color on fabric too.</li>
            <li> Even gave a few to my daughter to try.</li>
            <li> try to use it everyday since my face gets very dried during the winter&lt;br /&gt;and</li>
            <li> Usually my skin starts to peel/dry out when I go to class even though I put on lots of lotion.</li>
            <li> There are no overwhelming scents in any of these!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s supposed to be a sample</li>
            <li> and she freaked people out as we drove past with her staring at them through the passenger side window.</li>
            <li> I do reccomend wearing for at least 20 minutes to allow for maximum absorption.</li>
            <li> Winter-dry wind is very harsh but today, my skin didn&#x27;t peel!</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;it&#x27;s ridiculously expansive</li>
            <li> Although, some of the types I&#x27;m not too crazy about like Ginseng or Lemon.</li>
            <li> I feel very uncomfortable and disguising.</li>
            <li> I absolutely HATE the smell for the ginseng one.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very bad.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Moisturizing and super refreshing.. I love using these before bed and just relax with a book. Don&#x27;t expect miracles, but it&#x27;s fun for a nightly luxury.</li>
            <li> These are probably the best face masks I&#x27;ve had. They don&#x27;t leave a sticky feeling afterwards and they smell so pleasant. It&#x27;s also much cheaper than buying them in a brick and mortar store.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend this product.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s very easy to use and the materials absorbs very well to your skin.&lt;br /&gt;I try to use it everyday since my face gets very dried during the winter&lt;br /&gt;and my makeups does not often absorbs well. This product makes my skin moisturize and very smooth.&lt;br /&gt;ALWAYS ALWAYS order it from amazon when you purchase these in the stores&lt;br /&gt;it&#x27;s ridiculously expansive and it&#x27;s not worth it at all!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PS: I have some acne around my chin area but after using this mask sheets&lt;br /&gt;I can see that my acne are getting better!</li>
            <li> Exactly like the ones I bought at the little make-up shop in San Francisco Japan town. I paid about a dollar each for the ones here and they are the same! Love them, too!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t feel that is good for my skin , don&#x27;t make my skin white</li>
            <li> Tried Green Tea first, not sure if it was because it was in the fridge and too cold, but it had a burning sensation for the first 3-5 mins. Did Aloe the next day and it felt really soothing! Because my skin is really dry during the winter time, I&#x27;m trying out all the moisturizing ones first. And although some reviews say they are easy to unfold, I have to say otherwise. Mask is folded 4 times with another inner fold for nose part. Kind of a hassle to unfold esp when its all wet and sticks to each other. Also a little big for my face and hard to cover my face with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*Update&lt;br /&gt;Had to downgrade one star b/c I didn&#x27;t know it had paraben in it &#x3D;[ Also realized they never sent me the bamboo flavor and replaced it with Shea Butter (came with a free Innisfree cucumber though which seems better) Will finish using the rest and hope for good results but I will avoid buying these again b/c of the paraben. Have used products with paraben before but from recent findings I will try not to.&lt;br /&gt;After using for 3 days, green tea -&gt; aloe -&gt; mung bean, my face has definitely been less dry! Usually my skin starts to peel/dry out when I go to class even though I put on lots of lotion. Winter-dry wind is very harsh but today, my skin didn&#x27;t peel!</li>
            <li> Love these masks! My skin feels great after using them, well moisturized and all. I don&#x27;t see any extreme changes in my skin condition, but I like to use these masks for relaxation.&lt;br /&gt;14 of 16 masks have expiration date in 2017, 2 of 16 in 2016. Came in rice, acai berry, lemon, aloex2, mung bean, blueberry, avocado, red ginseng, green tea, honey pomegranate, olive, shea butter, kelp scents. For whatever reason, I also got 16 instead of 15 masks like it says in the description, but the last one is Aloe by Nature Republic instead of the Face Shop. I&#x27;m happy for the freebie although not sure if it&#x27;s deliberate or happy accident.</li>
            <li> i like to use it after taking off my make up it make my skin soft :&amp;#62;</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product. I&#x27;ve bought it so many times, and it&#x27;s always been perfect, that I felt I had to give it a good review. The variety of masks that you get for the price is definitely worth it, especially if you want something soothing and know you&#x27;re going to be using them often. The different scents are great and the masks are super soft and soaked. I&#x27;ve tried other masks and this was the most moisturizing.</li>
            <li> These aren&#x27;t the cheapest face masks you can buy, but I really like the feel of these. The masks are thin-cut with a good design and the serums feel light and refreshing. I use these after washing my face and applying toner, tapping the serum into my skin after discarding the mask.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros: Lots of serum, good and pretty packaging, light scent, moisturizing and refreshing, great cut, thin, large variety, makes my skin feel soft and dewy after use&lt;br /&gt;Cons: Many different types, but don&#x27;t really see a difference between them when I use them - maybe it would be better to choose one type to target a specific problem instead of buying the entire set&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, great mask. I would recommend them to a friend - buy the set if you want to give all of them a try, but buy one type if you actually want to target a skin problem.</li>
            <li> Not disappointed in terms of quality or variety</li>
            <li> these masks are fantastic! the price point is completely fair, and the variety of masks is divine! i&#x27;ve currently only used the red ginseng one. it smells fresh to me, and a bit woodsy too, but i like it! it&#x27;s like being in a redwood forest in the early morning. i did receive an extra Etude House I Need You (Honey) mask, so that was a lovely surprise too. the fabric the masks are made of is one of the softest i&#x27;ve used and they are really soaked with essence.&lt;br /&gt;shipping was quick too! will be ordering again when I run out! &amp;#60;3</li>
            <li> Loved it! Shared it. Looking forward to my next order.</li>
            <li> I love these masks with a passion! I use them once a week. People comment that I look like I&#x27;m glowing! It has become a staple in my beauty routine! Will buy again when I run out which won&#x27;t be for a while since I have so many! :)</li>
            <li> I bought these a month ago and I have been using them since I got them. I haven&#x27;t used all of the masks but my favorites so far are honey and cucumber because they are very moisturizing. I have very dry skin and after i use the mask theres a lot of serum left inside so i use that dor a whole week. I save a little more mask to last me for a while.</li>
            <li> I love these sheet mask. I had been wanting to try them for awhile, never really knowing which one to choose, the variety pack is perfect! They make your face feel so hydrated, and living in the dryness of Texas, I need it! There is so much liquid goodness in each pouch, that I will usually wear the mask and keep the excess until the next day and slather it on. I do reccomend wearing for at least 20 minutes to allow for maximum absorption. I will definitely purchase again</li>
            <li> The effect of the face mask is healing and hydrating. I&#x27;m very happy with It. Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t run through all of them.  But off the bat, I don&#x27;t like the shape at all.  It&#x27;s made for very narrow but long faces.  If you have a  wider face, the mask is 1&amp;#34; from the side of your face. The chin part is ridiculously long and the forehead as well.  The mouth area is a hug cut out.  I absolutely HATE the smell for the ginseng one.  It smells like wood pulp.  I will stick to the etude house ones from now on.  They fit nicely and always nicely scented.  This one makes me gag.</li>
            <li> I enjoy these facial masks a lot! Although, some of the types I&#x27;m not too crazy about like Ginseng or Lemon. But itâ€™s nice and fun to try out different facial masks. I tend to use them when my skin needs a little more pampering.</li>
            <li> The face shop trually has many good products, include this one. I really like it. I have used the cucumber one. I&#x27;m willing to purchase them again!</li>
            <li> I am new to face masks and so I&#x27;ve only tried a few before, but these masks are wonderful! The mask was saturated when I removed it from the package and applied easily to my face. The cut-outs for the eyes, nose, and mouth were placed fairly accurately for my face size (I have a small face) and it wasn&#x27;t droopy. I left the mask on for 12 minutes and it did not fall off, drip, or feel itchy. After I removed the mask, the remaining product soaked nicely into my skin as I tapped lightly with my fingers to help it absorb. Love the variety of essences and they&#x27;re great right out of the fridge for a soothing effect!</li>
            <li> These masks are awesome. They really make my skin glow. Cheap alternative to a real facial.  I will definitely be buying more of these when I run out.</li>
            <li> What I love the most about these masks is that you don&#x27;t have to wash them off after you use them.  My favorite thing to do is to put them on my face while I&#x27;m lying in bed or lying on the couch watching a movie.  There is usually enough &amp;#34;juice&amp;#34; left in the mask pouch to apply some of the moisture to other parts of my body!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These masks not only hydrate but leave your skin feeling tingly- as though you&#x27;ve had some collagen added!  I try to use them once a week!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also love that there are several different varieties in this pack!  They all leave your skin feeling dewy and refreshed and smell nice!  There are no overwhelming scents in any of these!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just be careful not to get the excess moisture from the masks onto any fabric- some of the masks leave a little color on your skin (fruit-based masks for instance) and could leave some color on fabric too.</li>
            <li> Love them. Moisturizes and pulls out impurities!</li>
            <li> love these facial masks. leave my face smooth and moisturizing. the shipping is fast too.</li>
            <li> I sent these in a care package for my daughter and her cabin mates at camp.  They all loved it and so fun.</li>
            <li> I know this fuss about paraben doesn&#x27;t rely on solid scientific proof, at least not yet, but I would definitely prefer to avoid paraben altogether. These masks DO contain paraben, as stated in the ingredients list, which I didn&#x27;t realize when I first purchased them. I ended up throwing half of them away (what was left), and I&#x27;m going back to Innisfree</li>
            <li> Results are temporary, but they are very hydrating if your face needs it.</li>
            <li> Having never tried masks before, I have to say that I&#x27;m quickly becoming addicted to these!  They&#x27;re very easy to use (just open the package, unfold the mask, and apply) and my skin feels fantastic after removing the mask and working in the remaining product.  I expect I&#x27;ll be ordering more once I run out!</li>
            <li> THIS STUFF IS AMAZING. Would buy again and again and again. You can see the results instantly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No issues with vendor/sale.</li>
            <li> Love them! They make my face so soft and leaves a very fresh feeling for the next few days. Very hydrating! I wipe the excess liquid from the bag on my elbow and Knees (which tend to be very rough) and it feels super soft! I will definitely order more in the future :)</li>
            <li> Just as expected, awesome deal and quick delivery!</li>
            <li> I loved the variety of the masks and the quality. My skin is thanking me.</li>
            <li> Forever in love with these masks. I&#x27;ve tried most of them except lemon (I am not a fan of acidic based products). Leaves the skin looking really good and the different functions on each mask is pretty true to what the packaging stated.</li>
            <li> this is cool to try and see if you like it.</li>
            <li> when I use it, I can smell a strong scene of alcohol. I feel very uncomfortable and disguising. May I return this item? It&#x27;s very bad.</li>
            <li> The package of 15 mask sheets came rather quickly. There&#x27;s a nice variety to choose from and all of them nourishes the skin. I like that you can try all of them to find what works best for your skin.The two I&#x27;ve tried so far (avocado &amp; cucumber) left my face feeling soft and looking refresh.  Even gave a few to my daughter to try.</li>
            <li> Nice product, got recommended this brand by a friend and I love it. I can already see and feel the difference with my skin already.</li>
            <li> These are amazing. Does cost a little more than getting it shipped directly from Korea, but comes quickly due to amazon prime. A great way to relax and really work on clearing the skin, moisturizing it and healing it.</li>
            <li> Good product. Skin feels like silk afterwards.</li>
            <li> I bought these because the design was so pretty. Haha There&#x27;s nothing wrong with these masks, though honestly I get better effects out of less expensive brands such as MJ care, Missha, or Fragrance of Morning. They&#x27;re still fun to use and give your skin good moisture and essence. Read more about this product and others at foodandink.wordpress.com</li>
            <li> LOOOVE these face mask. wonderful they came really quick totally worth it</li>
            <li> I have used these for years, even since I first went to Korea, and they are terrific.  Definitely worth a try.  I swear by them.</li>
            <li> great facial mask!! leave it on for 10min, all the lotion soaked into my skin!!</li>
            <li> I love this product because of its variety and simplicity</li>
            <li> Nice face mask, I use it all the time, keep moisture for the face.</li>
            <li> I use them twice a week. They help to manage my skin a lot. :)</li>
            <li> ABSOLUTELY LOVE THESE SHEET MASKS! They came super quickly and I was very pleased with the variety of treatments that came with the box. I try to use a sheet mask about once a week after I cleanse &amp; tone my face. Pop one of these babies in a freezer for 10 minutes, and then apply to the face for 15-20 minutes. Once you peel off the sheet, rub the leftover essence in your face in massaging circular motions to get the full effect. What I really love about these masks, is that the essence doesn&#x27;t leave a sticky residue on your skin. The absorption quality is so great! My skin feels hydrated, toned and overall bright. Will definitely repurchase once I&#x27;m running low on my stash. If I could recommend a specific one, the Red Ginseng is sooo good (although it&#x27;s a tad bit stinky) due to it&#x27;s uplifting &amp; energizing properties. Try them out everyone!</li>
            <li> the product is pretty good,  since when I bought it , I know it shipping from Korean , and take a month ...</li>
            <li> Great price for a big pack!</li>
            <li> Started using &amp;#34;Face Shop&amp;#34; products while in S. Korea. Found the individual facial packets easy to use and take up little space when i am on the road.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s supposed to be a sample or they accidentally threw it in there but I received an extra pack of mask which is from Etude House. It&#x27;s the first one that I tried and I love it! The other packs also came in great condition. Can&#x27;t wait to try them out!</li>
            <li> These masks are perfect for a mid day pick me up. a light weight essence and doesn&#x27;t clog pores, it drys a bit fast but i like them!</li>
            <li> Makes your skin feel soft and brand new.</li>
            <li> excellent offer ! i always bough these masks from the face shop store in my city and they are costly! but this offer were great!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;for the masks, i always use them when i don&#x27;t have time due to my busy schedule, it does refresh my skin.</li>
            <li> Love these. After a very stressful day,  these facial packs do wonders. I keep mine in the fridge and after i wash my face just put one of these on for about 15 min.</li>
            <li> The only negative thing I can say about these face masks is that they look pretty creepy. My wife put one on while we were driving out to Delaware and she freaked people out as we drove past with her staring at them through the passenger side window. I tried one myself later that night and truth be told, it made my face feel refreshed and my pores feeling like they were actually breathing. I&#x27;d totally recommend these masks; they smell great and they seem to do the job they&#x27;re meant to. Recommended.</li>
            <li> Love the variety and the way it makes my face feel.</li>
            <li> Easy to use, something was leaking when they arrived, but not a big problem</li>
            <li> Excellent product, fast shipping. Thank you.</li>
            <li> I love these face masks...they leave your skin feeling soooo soft.  These are less expensive than some of the others out there, but they do contain parabans which supposedly aren&#x27;t that good for you.</li>
            <li> Works very well, definitely in love with it ! And just love how cheap it is !!!</li>
            <li> a lot of varieties. Tried two. No change till now.</li>
            <li> Shipped right on time!  Love the masks, they&#x27;re absolutely my favorite!!</li>
            <li> Skin looks great after use. Moist and heavenly!</li>
            <li> very moisturizing, pleasant! i have tried many different brands and faceshop masks are the most moisturizing</li>
