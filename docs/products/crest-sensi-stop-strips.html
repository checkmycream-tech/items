            <li>It&#x27;s a good product and easy to use correctly to get the desired result.</li>

            <li>I have found that my sensitivity has been reduced and the application of the strips is very easy.</li>
            <li>These strips are very easy to use.</li>
            <li>I honestly went through all 6 strips because I messed up on most of them except for 2.</li>
            <li>I can finally enjoy my beloved Ice Cream again.</li>
            <li>I used all the toothpaste that claimed to help with sensitive teeth…believe me this is the best product I have ever tried…..</li>
            <li>After trying a lot of products this one is by far the best.</li>
            <li>But wow - Crest Sensi-Stop Strips are the best.</li>
            <li>I have to say that I was pleasantly surprised and impressed.  </li>
            <li>The Crest Sensi-Stop Strips were so easy to use, just 10 minutes!</li>
            <li>And it was worth the calories and tasted amazing!</li>
            <li>Super easy to use and really effective!</li>
            <li>It moved around a lot more than I thought it would or should.  </li>
            <li>so I have five more chances.</li>
            <li>I have used Sensodyne to good effect, but this sounded like it was worth a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I am sure they will work</li>
            <li>Please Crest, you better work.  </li>
            <li>So my advice to get the most out of these strips:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Also, schedule a dentist appointment if the pain continues, as it could be more than just a receding gum line (e.g. a cracked tooth).  </li>
            <li>I have temperature sensitivity in most of my front teeth.</li>
            <li>the longer you keep from eating or drinking the better the results for me.</li>
            <li>You will need to use all six, say 3 on top, and 3 on the bottom.  </li>
            <li>They may work better for you than me.   </li>
            <li>/&gt;I am seriously in love with this product now.</li>
            <li>know when something magical happenes in a Movie?</li>
            <li>Magical...</li>
            <li>It would be more convenient if it was a disolving strip.</li>
            <li>I used to love ice cream.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;These things have been fantastic!  </li>
            <li>I love these strips.</li>
            <li>and I love them.</li>
            <li>4/5 Stars :)</li>
            <li>And who wouldn&#x27;t give up 10 minutes to eat something that they have not been able to eat.</li>
            <li>I knew that would be the sure fire test.</li>
            <li>My sensitivity problems are beyond what most people experience.  </li>
            <li>I get better results using a .97 football mouth piece from walmart and filling it with sensodyne.  </li>
            <li>They&#x27;re more concentrated, and you leave them in your mouth for a longer period of time (10 minutes).</li>
            <li>received  Sensi-Stop Strips free from Crest®!</li>
            <li>I deal with a lot of tooth sensitivity and also have dental emergencies a bit more often than I would like.</li>
            <li>but it would be helpful if I knew I was going to be doing something like having ice cream or something else where the sensitivity is more of an issue.</li>
            <li>I have already purchased more.</li>
            <li>I love this product.  </li>
            <li>and I have not been able to bite in to a popsicle in years.</li>
            <li>But I did it anyway, just in case I hadn&#x27;t placed it appropriately.</li>
            <li>I think that if you apply the strip, close your mouth and don’t talk, eat, or keep touching  the strip with your tongue, you will have a better chance of it staying put.</li>
            <li>I feel SO much better now.</li>
            <li>(I recieved a sample to try for free but my opinions are my own.)</li>
            <li>There is a much better option out there</li>
            <li>That has helped some more.</li>
            <li>I am pleased with the product.</li>
            <li>I found the to las more around a week.</li>
            <li>I received a free package of Crest Sensi-Stop Strips for purpose of testing and review from BzzAgent - these opinions are entirely my own.</li>
            <li>It is a pain sometimes to eat ice cream, which I love.</li>
            <li>I was able to try this free with bzzagent!</li>
            <li>, I&#x27;ve never been the most patient person</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve had more X-Ray&#x27;s done  months after the surgery and the nerve looks good.&lt;br /&gt;Was</li>
            <li>Since using Crest Sensi-Stop Strips, I have been able to eat and drink foods, and beverages that I have avoided for years.</li>
            <li>The best part was they actually worked.</li>
            <li>Something I haven&#x27;t been able to do in years.  </li>
            <li>more effectively.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m, once again, able to drink iced beverages.  </li>
            <li>but you probably will have to use more than one strip for each tooth.</li>
            <li>so they covered more teeth.</li>
            <li>so I feel like I should get more for my money.</li>
            <li>so you get the best pain coverage possible!!</li>
            <li>Anbesol works better and you get more of it for just $6 at Wal-Mart, or any drug store.</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t work any better than just brushing teeth with sensitivity tooth paste even once.  </li>
            <li>The Crest strips helped the pain stop and allowed me to be able to chew comfortably!  </li>
            <li>Check out more reviews and information at wifeontherun.com</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know about for teeth that are more toward the front of your mouth but save your money if you need these for a molar.</li>
            <li>Many reviewers say it helped them.</li>
            <li>Every so often I&#x27;ll switch from my favorite toothpastes to Sensodyne.</li>
            <li>If it works, it is much better than a root canal.</li>
            <li>Much better than toothpaste.</li>
            <li>- I could still feel it after one treatment, though it was much more muted.</li>
            <li>manufacturer assures users that it is safe when used as directed.</li>
            <li>I guess my tooth sensitivity requires something more than just a pain relieving strip.</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>I let them know that they don&#x27;t have to avoid the foods they love to eat because of tooth sensitivity.</li>

            <li>I received the strips for free to try out courtesy smiley360</li>
            <li>got these Sensi-Stop Strips free from Crest® for review purposes.</li>
            <li>The idea of a one-treatment approach is great, but they need a better delivery mechanism, something that is easier to place onto wet, rear gums.  </li>
            <li>I still think these can be good for people who don&#x27;t have as sensitive teeth as mine.</li>
            <li>The medication is effective and works pretty quickly.</li>
            <li>Just to be sure, I waited a couple of Minutes, went to the Freezer and bit right into a Ice Cream Sandwich.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t sure if I was doing it right, and there weren&#x27;t any instructions.  </li>
            <li>but will definitely be buying more!!</li>
            <li>thanks!!!</li>
            <li>Huge success for me!  </li>
            <li>I was excited to try the Sensi-Stop strips for free to see if they would help with my sensitivity.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Crest certainly knows about oral care, this product is easy to apply, and most importantly, it works.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s super easy.  </li>
            <li>I do like them because they are easy and quick.  </li>
            <li>They are quick and easy to use.  </li>
            <li>Easy and quick fix.</li>
            <li>I really love these Crest Sensi-Stop Strips because they are easy to use and really relieve the pain in my teeth.</li>
            <li>When I got them, I immediately tried them, I was so excited.  </li>
            <li>so it was a familiar process.</li>
            <li>I would check with a dentist first to make sure the problem tooth isn&#x27;t crack or cavity.</li>
            <li>, I was really excited to try this product because you use it for 10 minutes one time</li>
            <li>Thank you Crest for consistently being a company that delivers products that help make my life better.</li>
            <li>This is something I will use more often and it really works!</li>
            <li>I have always had issues with tooth sensitivity and was excited to try Crest strips out when I received the offer from Smiley360.</li>
            <li>When I revisited my dentist he saw significant improvement and no sign that I needed a root canal.</li>
            <li>I was excited to give these</li>
            <li>So far I am very pleased with the results.</li>
            <li>I was glad to read that I could use another strip as soon as 24 hours after the first, though.</li>
            <li>I was so excited when I received the Crest Sensi-Stop Strips.  </li>
            <li>and I am so excited to have been part of this campaign.  </li>
            <li>but I never feel like they get my teeth clean</li>
            <li>It has helped my most sensitive tooth better than any toothpaste could do.  </li>
            <li>I was able to try this product free thanks to Crest.</li>
            <li>As someone who has sensitive teeth, I was glad to be able to try Crest Sensi-Stop Strips.</li>
            <li>For the right application and for teeth more in the front, it seems like it is worth a try.  </li>
            <li>I was easily able to place them (pretty quickly) and they did not bother me at all.</li>
            <li>I was given the chance by Smiley360 to try this product for free and I was immediately interested!</li>
            <li>After my first use of Crest Sensi-Stop Strips that I got free from Crest, I noticed a huge difference.  </li>
            <li>Well, I read the information more thoroughly and if you don&#x27;t have success the first treatment, \\&quot;you may treat again --- allowing one day between treatments.\\&quot;  </li>
            <li>but good enough to be noticeable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>far these have provided relief and  are as effective as the toothpastes.</li>
            <li>LOVED these strips will definitely buy them again.</li>
            <li>I cannot say enough good things about them.</li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;Not as good: it only works on one tooth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The strip is applied for 10 minutes, then removed, and your teeth need to remain untouched for an additional 30 minutes for the full effectiveness.</li>
            <li>so I don&#x27;t know if that is true.</li>
            <li>But I can say, that the strip worked for the sweet sensitivity.</li>
            <li>If I really try I can feel it but for the most part, it is like it is gone.</li>
            <li>I would say this lasted me about 3 weeks, not quite a full month</li>
            <li>There is no bad taste associated with the Crest Sensi Stop strips</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re easy to apply and no weird taste.</li>
            <li>I was able to enjoy foods I haven&#x27;t been able to in a long time.  </li>
            <li>Crest Sensi-Stop Strips are an ingenious new product!</li>
            <li>/&gt;Perhaps, I need to just apply a second strip to the area, This kit comes with six strips, that are supposed to each deliver one month of sensitivity protection (so ideally, if you have one sensitive area, this kit should have you covered for 6 months).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I would purchase this again for a quick convenient treatment.</li>
            <li>This product works quickly and the sensitivity relief lasted me 2-3 weeks.</li>
            <li>You are pregnant, or breastfeeding.  </li>
            <li>The packaging claims the relief could last up to a month, I thought if it made it through ten days I&#x27;d be impressed, it did, and I am.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m happy with the relief I got, but it would take several strips to rid my whole mouth from the sensitivity.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a good product and easy to use correctly to get the desired result.good guarantee, but personally, I doubt there&#x27;d be much need for it.</li>
            <li>I could enjoy ice cream and coffee for the first time in years.</li>
            <li>I have extremely sensitive teeth and have had better results from a popular sensitive toothpaste (not Crest brand).</li>
            <li>Of course there are no guarantees that things will remain so positive but my dentist says I could be fine for years ( again, based on x-rays and additional procedures).</li>
            <li>I used them while doing chores around the house.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks to Smiley360 who gave me this product FREE for testing and honest review purposes, my experience is 100% my own and since everyone is different, you may have a totally different experience!</li>
            <li>Easy to apply, no side effects for me, fast results too.</li>
            <li>don&#x27;t work very well, easy to use.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not sure if I was the ideal candidate for this product, but I thought it was worth a try.  </li>
            <li>But lo-and-behold, the sensitivity strips had activated a force field that protected my teeth from the rebels of Luke Warmness (with no vulnerable exhaust ports)!  </li>
            <li>At first I thought, Yay!</li>
            <li>I can finally eat some of my favorite foods again!</li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t necessarily avoid eating the foods (ice cream for an example), I would find creative ways to eat them!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not crazy about these even though I was optimistic and excited at first.  </li>
            <li>I used a clean pair of tweezers that I ran through the dishwasher first.  </li>
            <li>The fact one strip can last up to four weeks is amazing.  </li>
            <li>I received my free Crest Sensi-Stop Strips, thanks to my mission with Smiley360.</li>
            <li>I would give this product 5 stars because it&#x27;s so effective, but my goodness the strips are tiny.</li>
            <li>Plus, they&#x27;re completely worth</li>
            <li>I opened the Package and put the Stripe on my most Sensitive Teeth.</li>
            <li>I have tried many sensitive teeth toothpastes and none have worked.</li>
            <li>I really liked the fact you only had to apply it for 10 minutes</li>
            <li>Like I said before though, they are worth it if you are in pain.</li>
            <li>I received a complimentary box of these from Crest for testing purposes.  </li>
            <li>I got Crest Sensi-Stop Strips complimentary from Crest</li>
            <li>Starts to not feel worth the money.</li>
            <li>The Crest Sensi-Stop worked great for my occasional sensitive teeth.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m rating this 4 stars because for someone like me, who has many sensitive spots, these strips are not too practical.</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s a good guarantee, but personally, I doubt there&#x27;d be much need for it.</li>
            <li>I received a complimentary package of these strips from BzzAgent to sample and review.  </li>
            <li>It may affect the success of the treatment.</li>
            <li>I knew I would be able to tell right away if it was working because my teeth are sensitive every day.</li>
            <li>Crest&#x27;s Sensi-Stop strips are so quick and easy to use; they are just flexible strips that you place over your sensitive teeth for 10 minutes.</li>
            <li>and it starts hurting right away because your Teeth are too sensitive?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I even put them on and didn&#x27;t touch them with anything and still just fell right off.  </li>
            <li>Unlike the Sensodyne, it works right away.</li>
            <li>An easy to use new product,</li>
            <li>I was able to enjoy food I have not had in a long while.</li>
            <li>well they will either cost you more money cause you&#x27;ll have to use more strips or are just not worth the effort.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend people with sensitivity to try this product which I received a free sample of from smiley360.com</li>
            <li>had my doubts that this would work (they say one may give up to a month&#x27;s worth of relief, but if you don&#x27;t get results with the first strip, you can reapply another one after waiting for a day in between applications).</li>
            <li>I had to use the whole package as I found they slid off the tooth unless I held it in place for the full time.</li>
            <li>It was kind of strange feeling to have the strip on my tooth</li>
            <li>I recommend these to anyone with sensitivity that is looking for a working solution to be able to enjoy all of those long lost food items!!</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t completely take the pain away but it certainly reduces it to a much more tolerable level.</li>
            <li>However,  I was lucky enough to get this product as part of a promotion from Crest and was not disappointed!  </li>
            <li>My overall thought on this product is that it works great if you have a specific area to treat.</li>
            <li>The Crest Sensi Stop Strips are easy to apply, work quickly and really eliminated my sensitive teeth pain.  </li>
            <li>They are easy to get out of the package and apply to the sensitive area.  </li>
            <li>Crest Sensi-Stop Strips is available to treat sensitive teeth right at home.</li>
            <li>loved that it worked better than just using toothpaste for sensitive teeth and that it actually worked for the entire four weeks.</li>
            <li>idea is really good however; I think the application needs a little work.</li>
            <li>I have had some sensitivity in a lower left molar for many years.  </li>
            <li>Very helpful!  </li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t used any type of tooth strip before, so the first time I used this</li>
            <li>Only Colgate Pro-Argin toothpaste has been able to provide any relief.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m in so much pain!</li>
            <li>I thought it would be more like the crest white strips</li>
            <li>There was no weird taste or anything.&lt;br</li>
            <li>We&#x27;ll likely buy more when we run out,</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know if that is what they are intended for, but it worked pretty well.</li>
            <li>Thanks Crest!</li>
            <li>If tooth sensitivity is holding you back from enjoyong food or drinks you love, give this product a try.</li>
            <li>The first strip I used gave me about 1 week of relief.  </li>
            <li>The second attempt went much better and the relief was instant.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only used one of the strips and it has provided relief for more than weeks already.</li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t normally spend the money on an item like this since i already have a drawer full of teeth sensitivity products that didn&#x27;t stack up.</li>
            <li>and I will be purchasing more in the future.</li>
            <li>I absolutely recommend Crest Sensi Stop Strips!</li>
            <li>most likely will have to have a root canal done; Bummer!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m even back to drinking my favorite fall beverage - Pumpkin Spice Latte.</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;m not the only one who has tried this maneuver.  </li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m assuming if you can tolerate such, you&#x27;ll be okay with this</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m assuming if you can tolerate such, you&#x27;ll be okay with this product.    </li>
            <li>After using the first strip, there was no relief</li>
            <li>Yes, that&#x27;s exactly what this was like.  </li>
            <li>I also recommend drying the area first with a paper towel to get rid of any excess moisture</li>
            <li>I have tried so many different things to ease my tooth pain.</li>
            <li>I have two areas that periodically are sensitive, the dentist confirmed that it&#x27;s just a sensitivity and not an issue with the teeth.&lt;br /&gt;Never</li>
            <li>Absolutely!</li>
            <li>you first want to brush your teeth</li>
            <li>I am still noticing the benefits and my first trial was a while ago.  </li>
            <li>I just tried this product for the first time.  </li>
            <li>I bought my first pack of these from Hy-Vee.</li>
            <li>I followed the instructions as closely as I could, brushing and flossing first, and waiting 5 minutes before applying the strip.</li>
            <li>People looked at me funny when I would go to a restaurant an order an iced tea without ice, the server would give me the strangest look.</li>
            <li>If you feel it didn’t work the first time you may the process one day</li>
            <li>, I have sensitive gums a lot of the times and these strips work wonders.&amp;#34;I received a free product for the purpose of my review.</li>
            <li>The packaging says that it can prevent tooth sensitivity for up to a month, and it really does!</li>
            <li>My first try, the stripe did move on me</li>
            <li>It really worked for me!</li>
            <li>When I first tried the strips I could eat and drink anything and everything without a problem</li>
            <li>They throbbed for a good few hours after taking the strips off...</li>
            <li>The instructions do not say to trim the plastic strip to fit, but in actual use, it was necessary to trim the strip in order to get the strip in place and have a comfortable fit for an aching  </li>
            <li>I was so excited to be a part of this trial because I have extremely sensitive teeth.  </li>
            <li>I love the new Crest Sensi-Strips that I got for free to try from Crest, They are so easy to use and long lasting results.</li>
            <li>So make sure you place the strip appropriately, even if it&#x27;s on a hard to reach tooth.</li>
            <li>I had a great deal of trouble getting the strip into position near rear teeth.  </li>
            <li>After seeing my dentist, and ruling out a more severe problem than just sensitivity, he suggested that I try these in addition to sensitive toothpaste--before we have to go a more dramatic route to get my tooth to a more manageable state.  </li>
            <li>They hurt when I drink ice water, hot foods, pretty much everything bothers them.</li>
            <li>so I used the coupon that I also received and got me more and my bottom teeth has not been no where as near as sensitive as it was</li>
            <li>They are easy to use and very effective, however if you have sensitivity in you back molars, it is hard to get the strip to stay in place.</li>
            <li>I actually find it pretty easy to put them on during my drive to work.  </li>
            <li>I have to say, after the first treatment, I did not notice really any difference.</li>
            <li>I only have one more treatment left from my free sample</li>
            <li>However, after using the Crest strips I can enjoy many things especially ice cream that I haven’t been able to in such a long time.</li>
            <li>I do eat a lot of acidic foods and drink kombucha which is kind of sour</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t ahve as good of luck as other people with the sensitive teeth pain.  </li>
            <li>I was able to keep a few in different places such as the bathroom and my purse, so the convenience was great.</li>
            <li>They are really easy to use and my teeth are no where near as sensitive anymore!</li>
            <li>I had to try 6 strips just to get one to half way stay in place, and even then, it was kind of wadded up in a ball.  </li>
            <li>or so then they would help someone with more minor issues much longer.  </li>
            <li>I have super sensitive teeth</li>
            <li>I like that they are easy to apply and last for quite some time.</li>
            <li>They were easy to use and only need to be done for 10 minutes once a month.</li>
            <li>It was easy apply strip then wait ten minutes.</li>
            <li>There is no taste and the steps are easy -- leave them in place for ten minutes and then wait 30 minutes before eating or drinking.&lt;br</li>
            <li>One of the problems I found was locating the sensitive tooth; I have a whole mouth full so in my case I ended up using all 6 strips.</li>
            <li>In my situation, it turns out the pain had most likely been due to eating too many acidic foods as well as a temporary surge in heartburn (from unusual stress) which allowed excess stomach acid to be pushed into my mouth.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve eaten and drank certain foods that have stripped my toothpaste sensitivity fighting agents away.  </li>
            <li>After promptly removing the large piece of plastic from my mouth I decided to read the instructions.</li>
            <li>I just assumed that they would be large strips like the whitening strips, but they weren&#x27;t.  </li>
            <li>Also, I really like the convenience of having each strip individually packed making it easy to keep one in your bag/wallet while you&#x27;re out</li>
            <li>We went home, she applied a strip, and an hour later her tooth was just fine.  </li>
            <li>so then the strips will stick better, find the tooth or teeth thats sensitive, be sure your hands are dry and then open the strip and apply the gel side to your tooth and the outer gum line.</li>
            <li>It is so wonderful to actually have very little to no pain at all!!  </li>
            <li>Very good product but a bit difficult to apply.</li>
            <li>I need something a little more powerful than these though.</li>
            <li>So skeptical at first, but luckily it was easy to use, took 10 minutes &amp; did better than anything else I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li>I am going to try them again today, but I don&#x27;t really expect results.  </li>
            <li>Unlike the whitening stripes that stick VERY well on your teeth this strip does not.  </li>
            <li>Thanks to the invented.</li>
            <li>I really wanted to like this product.</li>
            <li>The strips also do not &#x27;stick&#x27; very well to the tooth</li>
            <li>I really wanted this to work for me.</li>
            <li>really like the concept of these strips, they just didn&#x27;t work for me.</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was really hoping these Sensi-stop strips would work.  </li>
            <li>She also wants to know.</li>
            <li>In all, the &amp;#34;treatment&amp;#34; takes about 40 minutes (10 minutes after applying, 30 before you can eat or drink anything), but it really does work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I did not expect this product to work wonders as it is an over the counter product, but it did lessen sensitivity enough to make it comfortable to eat and drink.</li>
            <li>, I can&#x27;t believe how fast these Crest Sensi-Stop Strips really work</li>
            <li>I can mot thank Crest enough for sending me this item free to try.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t have much hope in the strips</li>
            <li>I tried it on my bottom teeth that were hurting at the time and they really do work.</li>
            <li>I tried Crest Sensi-Stop strips and they really work.</li>
            <li>But I didn&#x27;t notice much of a change in sensitivity at all.</li>
            <li>I was hoping these strips would work, but I can’t say I noticed much difference after using them.</li>
            <li>so maybe I just had too much damage for them to work</li>
            <li>I can even eat and drink without as much pain.</li>
            <li>the whole,</li>
            <li>I received the Sensi-stop strips free from Crest and used them on am area where I recently had a crown placed.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not an absolute cure-all</li>
            <li>I tried out one of the strips - and I got fast results.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend Crest Sensi Strips!  </li>
            <li>have a tooth that had a deep cavity filled</li>
            <li>Thanks @Crest, #GotItFree</li>
            <li>Thanks to Crest for letting me try the strips.</li>
            <li>I would recommend saving your money and seeking real treatment from a dentist.</li>
            <li>This is a product I highly recommend for anyone to try with tooth sensitivity!</li>
            <li>They really need to rethink this product.</li>
            <li>fast shipping, as listed</li>
            <li>and they really are making a difference in the pain that I feel. ^_^</li>
            <li>As for the intense spot, it worked really well.</li>
            <li>You wear the strip for 10 minutes, in which time I felt a promising tingling sensation to let me know it was doing</li>
            <li>I truly never thought that a product like this would really work</li>
            <li>and it really does work well to stop that shooting pain</li>
            <li>Fortunately, one strip actually did relieve my tooth pain--in over a week, it hasn&#x27;t bothered me again.</li>
            <li>I really wished that these would have worked for me</li>
            <li>I tried this product but it didn&#x27;t really seem to work.  </li>
            <li>really wanted this product to work.  </li>
            <li>Hopefully my dental appointment won&#x27;t be too much torture today.</li>
            <li>Thanks to the Crest Sensi-Strip</li>
            <li>One that really stood out to me was</li>
            <li>Wait 5 minutes after brushing your teeth to gently place your strip at your gum line.</li>
            <li>so try not to touch them too much, or move them around a lot.</li>
            <li>Really a breakthrough.</li>
            <li>This stuff really works.  </li>
            <li>Had really looked forward to finding something that helped.</li>
            <li>The next morning was my first true test of how the strips had done.  </li>
            <li>As far as results go your mileage will vary but I do have one tooth in particular with mild, persistent issues whenever it comes into contact with ice.</li>
            <li>I tried these strips free from Crest® I have horribly sensitive teeth and these strips seemed to strengthen my tolerance toward my sensitive foods.</li>
            <li>I liked that the treatments/strips didn&#x27;t need to be used daily like the white strips do...</li>
            <li>I used it on one side of my mouth, on my lower back teeth which is the most sensitive spot in my mouth.  </li>
            <li>I have sensitive teeth on my lower, right teeth.</li>
            <li>While you are waiting on the strips to work their magic, read a book, watch a tv show, contemplate your life, stress about holidays with the in-laws, or do some other activity that doesn&#x27;t require much mouth movement.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Not only is the plastic piece too large to fit in a normal sized mouth</li>
            <li>However, Crest Sensi-Stop Strips were very easy to apply and only took ten minutes to apply.</li>
            <li>I may have to use more of them on my other teeth.</li>
            <li>Just to try and test it better, I tried one side and not the other to see if there was even a hint of a difference.</li>
            <li>Excited to make a future purchase!</li>
            <li>These Strips work better than expected!</li>
            <li>I would recommend this product for thise with more severe sensitivity due to the cost.</li>
            <li>The main ingredient responsible for decreasing tooth sensitivity is dipotassium oxalate.</li>
            <li>There&#x27;s only so much Sensodyne I can take -- luckily, Crest Sensi-stop strips came along.</li>
            <li>I have super sensitive teeth and the sensitive toothpaste helps</li>
            <li>I can say without a doubt the past month has been amazing.  </li>
            <li>The only downside I have found is that it does not work for a full month.  </li>
            <li>They&#x27;re &amp;#34;okay&amp;#34; as far as strips go, if not slightly uncomfortable to wear, but they do the job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Additionally, the box does caution the user that this product has been known to NOT last the full month ... something to consider as you weigh Sensodyne against this box (of six strips).</li>
            <li>I will defiantly use another strip though, because it certainly made a difference in my enjoyment of previously sensitive foods!</li>
            <li>This is an excellent product if you have teeth that are sensitive to heat or to cold.</li>
            <li>Easy to apply with minimal prep involved (you basically affix a strip to the tooth in need of soothing and let it sit for 10 minutes)</li>
            <li>I started with 10 minutes per strip, doing the main area where I had noticed sensitivity.  </li>
            <li>I think my receding gumline is the main problem.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Yes, you will salivate a bit more than usual when first applied, but it subsides after a couple minutes.</li>
            <li>But I still think they offer a definite benefit and start to work quickly.</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive teeth!</li>
            <li>The directions are pretty straight forward, much like the crest whitening strips if you have ever tried them just a bit smaller .</li>
            <li>Very pleased to have found a new way to address a common problem</li>
            <li>and I highly recommend them.  </li>
            <li>I had high hopes for these strips.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend, and have already recommended these to others.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product if you are dealing with tooth Sensitivity.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product to the point</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend Crest Sensi-Stop Strips to any one experiencing tooth sensitivity.</li>
            <li>They help bring down tooth sensitivity a bit more effectively that just tooth sensitive tooth past.</li>
            <li>so if you have a large area of sensitive teeth</li>
            <li>They are easy to use,have no funny aftertaste, and the sensitivity and pain were gone for awhile.</li>
            <li>But other than that, , they are really easy to use.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;The strips are kind of hard to get off the sheet.  </li>
            <li>I woke up, got a glass of glacier-like cold water, and proceeded to drink it, preparing for the satanic slaughter of my teeth as I had so commonly experienced after trying to enjoy a beverage that was not lukewarm temperature; you know, like actually putting ice in water and drinking it....</li>
            <li>Makes the product fairly expensive for the amount of relief experienced.</li>
            <li>I was really looking forward to these strips for my sensitive teeth.  </li>
            <li>I really wanted to try Crest Sensi-Stop Strips because I have really sensitive teeth.</li>
            <li>It does work so much faster than a sensitive toothpaste &amp; lasts a lot longer.</li>
            <li>I purchased these first from my local grocery store (and they were much more expensive than on Amazon, figures) and then again from my dentist (also more than Amazon...</li>
            <li>I figured there would be enough foods that have caused me sensitivity in the past to give them a fair try.</li>
            <li>I know it may seem like over the top praise, but I had trouble eating a cupcake or drinking wine</li>
            <li>well I literally had no sensitive areas in my mouth after using them and I was able to brush my teeth with regular tartar control Crest toothpaste.</li>
            <li>/&gt;There is one thing that I noticed that made the strips work even better for me: The first three I applied every month, but the last three I applied on the same night (10 mins a strip, take off, reapply new strip for 10 mins, repeat - total 30 mins per affected area).  </li>
            <li>However, it&#x27;s really not hard at all to figure out.  </li>
            <li>Will update my review if multiple applications do work, but right now I&#x27;m upset that I am out the money for something that did nothing.</li>
            <li>The medication is helpful, if you can finally get it to the right place.</li>
            <li>more than three times.)There is a warning-- not to use with bleeding gums or loose teeth or if you&#x27;re under 18 or \\&quot;have a history of kidney stones\\&quot;-- and a lot of necessary \\&quot;legalese\\&quot; because of it being a medicine sold over the counter.</li>
            <li>I’ve tried several different solutions over the years without much luck, but one new product that’s available is giving me hope at putting a stop to my sensitive teeth issues.  </li>
            <li>The whole process is pretty simple and just requires applying it to the sensitive area and leaving it on for 30 minutes.</li>
            <li>i am able to  enjoy things like hot coffee and cold ice cream with out excrutiating pain</li>
            <li>It works but as with anything new, there is a learning curve.  </li>
            <li>The dentist assures me that with time the problem should lessen, if not resolve all together, but when offered these new strips, I jumped at the chance to try them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>On the generally sensitive teeth, one treatment made my teeth feel like they were brand new again!</li>
            <li>It is very affordable and is worth the money spent.</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive teeth</li>
            <li>still very sensitive.</li>
            <li>have very sensitive teeth</li>
            <li>To their credit, my teeth are generally very sensitive so there is quite the hurdle to give me relief.</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive teeth</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive lower teeth.</li>
            <li>When you remove it from the sheet it is very soft and floppy.</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive teeth.</li>
            <li>I brushed my teeth (with sensitive toothpaste as always) and then stuck them in while I surfed the internet right before bed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have general tooth sensitivity as well, but it&#x27;s all over - not in super tiny spots.</li>
            <li>I was so excited when I saw a commercial for these strips, as I have several very sensitive teeth at the gum line on one side of my mouth.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;These are strips that are applied for 10-minutes and, as expected you need strips for each side, but the overall reduction of sensitivity is nothing short of amazing.</li>
            <li>I got the strip in place on my back tooth on the first try.</li>
            <li>Sensitive teeth are no match for these strips!</li>
            <li>Wow!</li>
            <li>/&gt;Wy wife said she got \\&quot;some\\&quot; relief after the first application and then tried another a week later when the area was bothering her again.</li>
            <li>I am several days out from my first application</li>
            <li>These are more like a small patch that covers about 2 teeth or maybe 3 small teeth at the most.</li>
            <li>You just place them on teeth that are sensitive, wait about 10 mins, and POOF!</li>
            <li>but since this is a New Scientific Breakthrough as far as tooth sensitivity is concerned</li>
            <li>Each strip has such a small amount of medicine on it, it&#x27;s amazing that Crest would get away selling it for so much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I mean-you&#x27;re not going to go drink hot coffee while eating ice cream if you have sensitive teeth, and these aren&#x27;t going to make it possible.</li>
            <li>I have used a sensitive toothpaste in the past and have had more sensitivity after using.</li>
            <li>I have to say, I never thought there&#x27;d be a day when I could just apply a sensi-stop strip and have my sensitive teeth be fixed, but the day has come!  </li>
            <li>I would still need to be careful drinking anything too hot or too cold -- but after using a Sensi-stop strip, I was able to enjoy hot coffee on that side for the first time in a long time.</li>
            <li>I was very surprised to find it fixed my sensitive gum area.</li>
            <li>I do wish they game in bigger strips as most of my teeth are pretty sensitive, so i almost use a whole box to get all my teeth.</li>
            <li>May be it applies only to certain causes of sensitivity and not all.</li>
            <li>Nevertheless, this product should work decent for people who do not have as much sensitivity or their sensitivity is minor.</li>
            <li>In the first 24 hours I didn&#x27;t seem to notice much of a difference, but after the first day or so, I definitely feel much less sensitive in the problem area</li>
            <li>and a little more after the second.  </li>
            <li>These little strips work better than everything I&#x27;ve ever tried for tooth sensitivity, and it only takes 10 minutes!!</li>
            <li>Worked well on sensitive tooth</li>
            <li>And much longer lasting than anything else I have tried.</li>
            <li>For me, I decided to do them at night, after I was completely ready for bed (and having already brushed my teeth, as the instructions recommend).  </li>
            <li>The sensitivity was completely gone for over 3 months.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;- Use them before you go to bed, after having gotten completely ready.&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li>And it has lasted for 3 weeks so far.</li>
            <li>I find the strips provide immediate relief that lasts far longer than they promise.  </li>
            <li>My mom and I both used this because we have sensitive teeth</li>
            <li>I had a sensitive tooth for 3 months and the dentist that treated it twice did not fix the sensitivity but this product worked with 2 treatments, in a score of 1 out of 10</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried toothpastes for sensitive teeth</li>
            <li>and I have a terribly busy schedule.  </li>
            <li>You place the strip over the sensitive area.  </li>
            <li>I have really sensitive teeth.  </li>
            <li>I use sensodyne every day and I am still sensitive.  </li>
            <li>: The strips reduce the sensitivity of (one) sensitive tooth of mine</li>
            <li>I have never seen strips for sensitive teeth.</li>
            <li>It is applied to the sensitive area just like their whitening strips.</li>
            <li>I was pleasantly surprised with these strips.</li>
            <li>You just put it on the sensitive tooth and it works if you use likes</li>
            <li>Colgate Sensitive Pro-relief Pro-argin Toothpaste]]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>completely Pro-argin Toothpaste</li>
            <li>completely solved</li>
            <li>It stays on well until you take it off, which surprised me.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have the product box listing ingredients for my &#x27;sensitive toothpaste,&#x27;</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have the product box listing ingredients for my &#x27;sensitive toothpaste,&#x27;</li>
            <li>The strips work very well if you have a specific area affected by sensitivity.</li>
            <li>I was surprised by that but still wished it were stronger.</li>
            <li>I would recommend these to anyone who has sensitive teeth.</li>
            <li>The tooth is still sensitive to that,</li>
            <li>He suggested I try the Sensi-Stop strips as well as a toothpaste made for sensitive teeth.</li>
            <li>Do you suffer from sensitive teeth?  </li>
            <li>I am on the seventh day now and my tooth feels just slightly sensitive again.</li>
            <li>After two treatments, however, it was nearly gone.</li>
            <li>I have a sensitive tooth that I have been trying to heal for months.</li>
            <li>For almost all of my life I have suffered from sensitive teeth.</li>
            <li>so I stopped using sensitive relief toothpaste.</li>
            <li>Though toothpaste for sensitive teeth works, I always choke on it.</li>
            <li>I have a sensitive molar.  </li>
            <li>There is no way you will get this to remotely resemble staying in place, not for 20 seconds, let alone 10 colossal sized minutes.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have super duper sensitive teeth, only minor sensitivity.</li>
            <li>The fact I get long acting relief plus no toothpaste taste has permanently made me a loyal user of Crest Sensi-Stop Strip for LIFE!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>They work pretty much the same as white teethening stripes but smaller.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Be aware that you are not to use this product if you suffer from bleeding gums, or loose teeth.  </li>
            <li>Makes it pretty difficult to get the gel from the package to the tooth without touching the gel on the strip.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I was very impressed that the Crest Sensi-Stop Strips stopped the sensitivity to not only ice cream, but to cold drinks as well!</li>
            <li>I also had some dental work that I must now use a special mouth wash for a few days</li>
            <li>SO far I have used them 3 times, and I barely have noticed any change at all.</li>
            <li>Crest packaging also mentions some of the causes of tooth sensitivity: receding gums, brushing too hard, acidic or sugary food and grinding your teeth--things I&#x27;m going to watch out for going forward (they say if you need this more than three times for the same tooth to see the dentist).&lt;br</li>
            <li>After years of using sensitive teeth toothpaste and only having relief for a few hours at best, it was getting frustrating, trying to enjoy hot and cold foods and drinks.</li>
            <li>They were easy to use, less hassle than a daily toothpaste and had actual results!</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You are supposed to apply one strip around the gum line of the area that is sensitive (usually sensitivity is caused by a receding gum line that exposes the otherwise unprotected root portion of your tooth - this statement is true because it&#x27;s on the Internet).  </li>
            <li>But when my braces were on, I had to microwave ice cream - even though I have previously made fun of people for doing that.  </li>
            <li>Crest Sensi-Stop strips are fast and simple, and because they come in individually wrapped applications, you can keep one in your bag or toiletry kit for when you&#x27;re out.  </li>
            <li>Once I finally got it to the back tooth I had so much spit in my mouth that it just slip around.  </li>
            <li>The worst part about sensitive spots on your teeth and not being able to enjoy the foods you love or carefully deciding what you can have.</li>
            <li>The sensitivity is not completely gone, but not uncomfortable enough to affect my enjoyment of iced beverages, or even ice cream.</li>
            <li>These strips stopped my tooth sensitivity for a whole month with only one ten minute treatment.</li>
            <li>The results were inconclusive and I was told this is possible in the early stages of root inflammation and infection and because early  infections don&#x27;t always leave traces on x-</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive teeth especially the front ones.</li>
            <li>I noticed my teeth were less sensitive after the first use.</li>
            <li>It is easy to use--just take out the strip (one per tooth, only for a one-time use) and apply it so it lines up with the gumline (usually where the dentin has been exposed and is causing the pain).</li>
            <li>cannot really even break this down into low/high points because there really are only two.&lt;br /&gt;Good</li>
            <li>OK, but they are very hard to get to stay in one place.  </li>
            <li>They don&#x27;t cover a large area and it takes some dexterity to get them in harder to reach places.</li>
            <li>Not my favorite product because it is hard to apply and keep the strips on for a long time</li>
            <li>The morning after I placed my first application, I was able to eat cold cereal without any sensitivity.  </li>
            <li>have spent the entire summer unable to enjoy my favorite iced beverage --- southern style iced tea.  </li>
            <li>it only takes 10 minutes per use and produces immediate results as far as tooth sensitivity is concerned.</li>
            <li>I have used toothpastes and mouthwashes made for sensitive teeth and none of them hold a candle to the instantaneous and lasting relief of the Crest® Sensi-Stop Strips.</li>
            <li>This barely covers one tooth.  </li>
            <li>Finally I found the product that works for my sensitive teeth.</li>
            <li>I plan to use a third strip to see if I can make the sensitivity go completely away.</li>
            <li>I never thought I would see that day again and fixed with such ease as a applying these strips and no trip to the dentist.</li>
            <li>My back tooth is sensitive.  </li>
            <li>I am also a person that uses all-natural toothpaste because I do not like the taste of regular toothpaste - so those sensitive toothpastes out there just don&#x27;t work for me.  </li>
            <li>There are a few of us in our family that suffer from sensitive gums and this product has really helped!</li>
            <li>Expensive for this irregularly effective</li>
            <li>I bought these yesterday as one of my lower molars was super sensitive to sweet and cold things.  </li>
            <li>I have very sensitive teeth, especially on the left side of my mouth.</li>
            <li>They are also super small</li>
            <li>/&gt;These worked very well, my son (30 years old, lives with me because he is disabled) had a tooth ache two weeks ago</li>
            <li>Apply three in a row, to the same sensitive area, ten minutes each.&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li>The last time something like that happened, her tooth hurt for over a week, even with going back to the sensitive toothpaste.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have multiple sensitive spots and so I have to use multiple strips (one for each area of sensitivity).  </li>
            <li>A recently replaced filling has become the sole sensitive spot in my mouth.</li>
            <li>I was really surprised that this actually worked and continued to work for several days.</li>
            <li>Unfortunately, my sensitivity was far greater on the inside, so I tried to put the strip there.  </li>
            <li>The bitty little thing slid around a lot, but I soldiered through and kept it on the spot pretty well for the required 10 minutes.</li>
            <li>I received my free samples of Crest® Sensi-Stop Strips as part of my bzzagent kit, which are packaged similar to the crest  white strips, I was so excited to try them that I failed to read the directions carefully</li>
            <li>I have suffered from sensitive teeth for a long time.</li>
            <li>These strips provide temporary relief, but not a long term solution.</li>
            <li>I tried this product on a sensitive upper left tooth in the back of my mouth.</li>
            <li>I have suffered from sensitive teeth for a long time.  </li>
            <li>I really wanted this to work so that I could go back to enjoying cold treats.&lt;br</li>
            <li>While I have thankfully not had one of the latter to deal with recently, I have tried the strips for cold sensitivity and had quite good results.</li>
            <li>They are very small and a bit difficult to fit onto your teeth when trying to cover more than two.  </li>
            <li>I enjoy cold and hot beverages now</li>
            <li>Crest products are usually amazing, but this one, they really dropped the ball. :(</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t talk or move my mouth much while the strip was on as they moved around slightly when I did so - decreasing the efficacy since I wasn&#x27;t keeping the area</li>
            <li>I just applied my second strip a few days ago and it&#x27;s been about 6 weeks since I put the first one on.</li>
            <li>The only thing I did differently was to dry the sensitive area with the corner of a washcloth (no way am I going to blow air on it!)</li>
            <li>I got about a week of reduced pain, this certainly would be very helpful for situations that I regularly deal with like a damaged filling or chipped tooth, which don&#x27;t quite rise to the level of a dental emergency but are certainly uncomfortable to live with.</li>
            <li>It only minimized it slightly but for me it&#x27;s just not worth to buy a full pack.</li>
            <li>It would work for my minor teeth sensitivities but not my major ones.</li>
            <li>I wore braces for several years as an adult and one of the most alarming things was my new sensitivity to cold.</li>
            <li>There are good and bad points to this product.</li>

            <li> I noticed an immediate reduction in pain and have been very pleased with 4 pain-free days.</li>
            <li> The thought of doing it myself gave me goosebumps, and not the good kind.</li>

            <li> These new Crest Sensi-Stop Strips work great!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good product and easy to use correctly to get the desired result.</li>
            <li> and it is very easy to apply to the surface of your teeth.  </li>
            <li> They are very easy to put on and take off.  </li>
            <li> I have found that my sensitivity has been reduced and the application of the strips is very easy.</li>
            <li> These strips are very easy to use.</li>
            <li> I honestly went through all 6 strips because I messed up on most of them except for 2.</li>
            <li> I can finally enjoy my beloved Ice Cream again.</li>
            <li> I used all the toothpaste that claimed to help with sensitive teeth…believe me this is the best product I have ever tried…..</li>
            <li> After trying a lot of products this one is by far the best.</li>
            <li> But wow - Crest Sensi-Stop Strips are the best.</li>
            <li> I have to say that I was pleasantly surprised and impressed.  </li>
            <li> The Crest Sensi-Stop Strips were so easy to use, just 10 minutes!</li>
            <li> And it was worth the calories and tasted amazing!</li>
            <li> Super easy to use and really effective!</li>
            <li> It moved around a lot more than I thought it would or should.  </li>
            <li> so I have five more chances.</li>
            <li> I have used Sensodyne to good effect, but this sounded like it was worth a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I am sure they will work</li>
            <li> Please Crest, you better work.  </li>
            <li> So my advice to get the most out of these strips:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Also, schedule a dentist appointment if the pain continues, as it could be more than just a receding gum line (e.g. a cracked tooth).  </li>
            <li> I have temperature sensitivity in most of my front teeth.</li>
            <li> the longer you keep from eating or drinking the better the results for me.</li>
            <li> You will need to use all six, say 3 on top, and 3 on the bottom.  </li>
            <li> They may work better for you than me.   </li>
            <li> /&gt;I am seriously in love with this product now.</li>
            <li> know when something magical happenes in a Movie?</li>
            <li> Magical...</li>
            <li> It would be more convenient if it was a disolving strip.</li>
            <li> I used to love ice cream.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;These things have been fantastic!  </li>
            <li> I love these strips.</li>
            <li> and I love them.</li>
            <li> 4/5 Stars :)</li>
            <li> And who wouldn&#x27;t give up 10 minutes to eat something that they have not been able to eat.</li>
            <li> I knew that would be the sure fire test.</li>
            <li> My sensitivity problems are beyond what most people experience.  </li>
            <li> I get better results using a .97 football mouth piece from walmart and filling it with sensodyne.  </li>
            <li> They&#x27;re more concentrated, and you leave them in your mouth for a longer period of time (10 minutes).</li>
            <li> received  Sensi-Stop Strips free from Crest®!</li>
            <li> I deal with a lot of tooth sensitivity and also have dental emergencies a bit more often than I would like.</li>
            <li> but it would be helpful if I knew I was going to be doing something like having ice cream or something else where the sensitivity is more of an issue.</li>
            <li> I have already purchased more.</li>
            <li> I love this product.  </li>
            <li> and I have not been able to bite in to a popsicle in years.</li>
            <li> But I did it anyway, just in case I hadn&#x27;t placed it appropriately.</li>
            <li> I think that if you apply the strip, close your mouth and don’t talk, eat, or keep touching  the strip with your tongue, you will have a better chance of it staying put.</li>
            <li> I feel SO much better now.</li>
            <li> (I recieved a sample to try for free but my opinions are my own.)</li>
            <li> There is a much better option out there</li>
            <li> That has helped some more.</li>
            <li> I am pleased with the product.</li>
            <li> I found the to las more around a week.</li>
            <li> I received a free package of Crest Sensi-Stop Strips for purpose of testing and review from BzzAgent - these opinions are entirely my own.</li>
            <li> It is a pain sometimes to eat ice cream, which I love.</li>
            <li> I was able to try this free with bzzagent!</li>
            <li> , I&#x27;ve never been the most patient person</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve had more X-Ray&#x27;s done  months after the surgery and the nerve looks good.&lt;br /&gt;Was</li>
            <li> Since using Crest Sensi-Stop Strips, I have been able to eat and drink foods, and beverages that I have avoided for years.</li>
            <li> The best part was they actually worked.</li>
            <li> Something I haven&#x27;t been able to do in years.  </li>
            <li> more effectively.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m, once again, able to drink iced beverages.  </li>
            <li> but you probably will have to use more than one strip for each tooth.</li>
            <li> so they covered more teeth.</li>
            <li> so I feel like I should get more for my money.</li>
            <li> so you get the best pain coverage possible!!</li>
            <li> Anbesol works better and you get more of it for just $6 at Wal-Mart, or any drug store.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t work any better than just brushing teeth with sensitivity tooth paste even once.  </li>
            <li> The Crest strips helped the pain stop and allowed me to be able to chew comfortably!  </li>

            <li> I don&#x27;t know about for teeth that are more toward the front of your mouth but save your money if you need these for a molar.</li>
            <li> Many reviewers say it helped them.</li>
            <li> Every so often I&#x27;ll switch from my favorite toothpastes to Sensodyne.</li>
            <li> If it works, it is much better than a root canal.</li>
            <li> Much better than toothpaste.</li>
            <li> - I could still feel it after one treatment, though it was much more muted.</li>
            <li> manufacturer assures users that it is safe when used as directed.</li>
            <li> I guess my tooth sensitivity requires something more than just a pain relieving strip.</li>
            <li> I love this product.</li>
            <li> I let them know that they don&#x27;t have to avoid the foods they love to eat because of tooth sensitivity.</li>

            <li> got these Sensi-Stop Strips free from Crest® for review purposes.</li>
            <li> The idea of a one-treatment approach is great, but they need a better delivery mechanism, something that is easier to place onto wet, rear gums.  </li>
            <li> I still think these can be good for people who don&#x27;t have as sensitive teeth as mine.</li>
            <li> The medication is effective and works pretty quickly.</li>
            <li> Just to be sure, I waited a couple of Minutes, went to the Freezer and bit right into a Ice Cream Sandwich.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure if I was doing it right, and there weren&#x27;t any instructions.  </li>
            <li> but will definitely be buying more!!</li>
            <li> thanks!!!</li>
            <li> Huge success for me!  </li>
            <li> I was excited to try the Sensi-Stop strips for free to see if they would help with my sensitivity.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Crest certainly knows about oral care, this product is easy to apply, and most importantly, it works.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s super easy.  </li>
            <li> I do like them because they are easy and quick.  </li>
            <li> They are quick and easy to use.  </li>
            <li> Easy and quick fix.</li>
            <li> I really love these Crest Sensi-Stop Strips because they are easy to use and really relieve the pain in my teeth.</li>
            <li> When I got them, I immediately tried them, I was so excited.  </li>
            <li> so it was a familiar process.</li>
            <li> I would check with a dentist first to make sure the problem tooth isn&#x27;t crack or cavity.</li>
            <li> , I was really excited to try this product because you use it for 10 minutes one time</li>
            <li> Thank you Crest for consistently being a company that delivers products that help make my life better.</li>
            <li> This is something I will use more often and it really works!</li>
            <li> I have always had issues with tooth sensitivity and was excited to try Crest strips out when I received the offer from Smiley360.</li>
            <li> When I revisited my dentist he saw significant improvement and no sign that I needed a root canal.</li>
            <li> I was excited to give these</li>
            <li> So far I am very pleased with the results.</li>
            <li> I was glad to read that I could use another strip as soon as 24 hours after the first, though.</li>
            <li> I was so excited when I received the Crest Sensi-Stop Strips.  </li>
            <li> and I am so excited to have been part of this campaign.  </li>
            <li> but I never feel like they get my teeth clean</li>
            <li> It has helped my most sensitive tooth better than any toothpaste could do.  </li>
            <li> I was able to try this product free thanks to Crest.</li>
            <li> As someone who has sensitive teeth, I was glad to be able to try Crest Sensi-Stop Strips.</li>
            <li> For the right application and for teeth more in the front, it seems like it is worth a try.  </li>
            <li> I was easily able to place them (pretty quickly) and they did not bother me at all.</li>
            <li> I was given the chance by Smiley360 to try this product for free and I was immediately interested!</li>
            <li> After my first use of Crest Sensi-Stop Strips that I got free from Crest, I noticed a huge difference.  </li>
            <li> Well, I read the information more thoroughly and if you don&#x27;t have success the first treatment, \\&quot;you may treat again --- allowing one day between treatments.\\&quot;  </li>
            <li> but good enough to be noticeable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> far these have provided relief and  are as effective as the toothpastes.</li>
            <li> LOVED these strips will definitely buy them again.</li>
            <li> I cannot say enough good things about them.</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;Not as good: it only works on one tooth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The strip is applied for 10 minutes, then removed, and your teeth need to remain untouched for an additional 30 minutes for the full effectiveness.</li>
            <li> so I don&#x27;t know if that is true.</li>
            <li> But I can say, that the strip worked for the sweet sensitivity.</li>
            <li> If I really try I can feel it but for the most part, it is like it is gone.</li>
            <li> I would say this lasted me about 3 weeks, not quite a full month</li>
            <li> There is no bad taste associated with the Crest Sensi Stop strips</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re easy to apply and no weird taste.</li>
            <li> I was able to enjoy foods I haven&#x27;t been able to in a long time.  </li>
            <li> Crest Sensi-Stop Strips are an ingenious new product!</li>
            <li> /&gt;Perhaps, I need to just apply a second strip to the area, This kit comes with six strips, that are supposed to each deliver one month of sensitivity protection (so ideally, if you have one sensitive area, this kit should have you covered for 6 months).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I would purchase this again for a quick convenient treatment.</li>
            <li> This product works quickly and the sensitivity relief lasted me 2-3 weeks.</li>
            <li> You are pregnant, or breastfeeding.  </li>
            <li> The packaging claims the relief could last up to a month, I thought if it made it through ten days I&#x27;d be impressed, it did, and I am.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m happy with the relief I got, but it would take several strips to rid my whole mouth from the sensitivity.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good product and easy to use correctly to get the desired result.good guarantee, but personally, I doubt there&#x27;d be much need for it.</li>
            <li> I could enjoy ice cream and coffee for the first time in years.</li>
            <li> I have extremely sensitive teeth and have had better results from a popular sensitive toothpaste (not Crest brand).</li>
            <li> Of course there are no guarantees that things will remain so positive but my dentist says I could be fine for years ( again, based on x-rays and additional procedures).</li>
            <li> I used them while doing chores around the house.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks to Smiley360 who gave me this product FREE for testing and honest review purposes, my experience is 100% my own and since everyone is different, you may have a totally different experience!</li>
            <li> Easy to apply, no side effects for me, fast results too.</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t work very well, easy to use.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if I was the ideal candidate for this product, but I thought it was worth a try.  </li>
            <li> But lo-and-behold, the sensitivity strips had activated a force field that protected my teeth from the rebels of Luke Warmness (with no vulnerable exhaust ports)!  </li>
            <li> At first I thought, Yay!</li>
            <li> I can finally eat some of my favorite foods again!</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t necessarily avoid eating the foods (ice cream for an example), I would find creative ways to eat them!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not crazy about these even though I was optimistic and excited at first.  </li>
            <li> I used a clean pair of tweezers that I ran through the dishwasher first.  </li>
            <li> The fact one strip can last up to four weeks is amazing.  </li>
            <li> I received my free Crest Sensi-Stop Strips, thanks to my mission with Smiley360.</li>
            <li> I would give this product 5 stars because it&#x27;s so effective, but my goodness the strips are tiny.</li>
            <li> Plus, they&#x27;re completely worth</li>
            <li> I opened the Package and put the Stripe on my most Sensitive Teeth.</li>
            <li> I have tried many sensitive teeth toothpastes and none have worked.</li>
            <li> I really liked the fact you only had to apply it for 10 minutes</li>
            <li> Like I said before though, they are worth it if you are in pain.</li>
            <li> I received a complimentary box of these from Crest for testing purposes.  </li>
            <li> I got Crest Sensi-Stop Strips complimentary from Crest</li>
            <li> Starts to not feel worth the money.</li>
            <li> The Crest Sensi-Stop worked great for my occasional sensitive teeth.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m rating this 4 stars because for someone like me, who has many sensitive spots, these strips are not too practical.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s a good guarantee, but personally, I doubt there&#x27;d be much need for it.</li>
            <li> I received a complimentary package of these strips from BzzAgent to sample and review.  </li>
            <li> It may affect the success of the treatment.</li>
            <li> I knew I would be able to tell right away if it was working because my teeth are sensitive every day.</li>
            <li> Crest&#x27;s Sensi-Stop strips are so quick and easy to use; they are just flexible strips that you place over your sensitive teeth for 10 minutes.</li>
            <li> and it starts hurting right away because your Teeth are too sensitive?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I even put them on and didn&#x27;t touch them with anything and still just fell right off.  </li>
            <li> Unlike the Sensodyne, it works right away.</li>
            <li> An easy to use new product,</li>
            <li> I was able to enjoy food I have not had in a long while.</li>
            <li> well they will either cost you more money cause you&#x27;ll have to use more strips or are just not worth the effort.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend people with sensitivity to try this product which I received a free sample of from smiley360.com</li>
            <li> had my doubts that this would work (they say one may give up to a month&#x27;s worth of relief, but if you don&#x27;t get results with the first strip, you can reapply another one after waiting for a day in between applications).</li>
            <li> I had to use the whole package as I found they slid off the tooth unless I held it in place for the full time.</li>
            <li> It was kind of strange feeling to have the strip on my tooth</li>
            <li> I recommend these to anyone with sensitivity that is looking for a working solution to be able to enjoy all of those long lost food items!!</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t completely take the pain away but it certainly reduces it to a much more tolerable level.</li>
            <li> However,  I was lucky enough to get this product as part of a promotion from Crest and was not disappointed!  </li>
            <li> My overall thought on this product is that it works great if you have a specific area to treat.</li>
            <li> The Crest Sensi Stop Strips are easy to apply, work quickly and really eliminated my sensitive teeth pain.  </li>
            <li> They are easy to get out of the package and apply to the sensitive area.  </li>
            <li> Crest Sensi-Stop Strips is available to treat sensitive teeth right at home.</li>
            <li> loved that it worked better than just using toothpaste for sensitive teeth and that it actually worked for the entire four weeks.</li>
            <li> idea is really good however; I think the application needs a little work.</li>
            <li> I have had some sensitivity in a lower left molar for many years.  </li>
            <li> Very helpful!  </li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used any type of tooth strip before, so the first time I used this</li>
            <li> Only Colgate Pro-Argin toothpaste has been able to provide any relief.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in so much pain!</li>
            <li> I thought it would be more like the crest white strips</li>
            <li> There was no weird taste or anything.&lt;br</li>
            <li> We&#x27;ll likely buy more when we run out,</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if that is what they are intended for, but it worked pretty well.</li>
            <li> Thanks Crest!</li>
            <li> If tooth sensitivity is holding you back from enjoyong food or drinks you love, give this product a try.</li>
            <li> The first strip I used gave me about 1 week of relief.  </li>
            <li> The second attempt went much better and the relief was instant.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used one of the strips and it has provided relief for more than weeks already.</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t normally spend the money on an item like this since i already have a drawer full of teeth sensitivity products that didn&#x27;t stack up.</li>
            <li> and I will be purchasing more in the future.</li>
            <li> I absolutely recommend Crest Sensi Stop Strips!</li>
            <li> most likely will have to have a root canal done; Bummer!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m even back to drinking my favorite fall beverage - Pumpkin Spice Latte.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;m not the only one who has tried this maneuver.  </li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m assuming if you can tolerate such, you&#x27;ll be okay with this</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m assuming if you can tolerate such, you&#x27;ll be okay with this product.    </li>
            <li> After using the first strip, there was no relief</li>
            <li> Yes, that&#x27;s exactly what this was like.  </li>
            <li> I also recommend drying the area first with a paper towel to get rid of any excess moisture</li>
            <li> I have tried so many different things to ease my tooth pain.</li>
            <li> I have two areas that periodically are sensitive, the dentist confirmed that it&#x27;s just a sensitivity and not an issue with the teeth.&lt;br /&gt;Never</li>
            <li> Absolutely!</li>
            <li> you first want to brush your teeth</li>
            <li> I am still noticing the benefits and my first trial was a while ago.  </li>
            <li> I just tried this product for the first time.  </li>
            <li> I bought my first pack of these from Hy-Vee.</li>
            <li> I followed the instructions as closely as I could, brushing and flossing first, and waiting 5 minutes before applying the strip.</li>
            <li> People looked at me funny when I would go to a restaurant an order an iced tea without ice, the server would give me the strangest look.</li>
            <li> If you feel it didn’t work the first time you may the process one day</li>
            <li> , I have sensitive gums a lot of the times and these strips work wonders.&amp;#34;I received a free product for the purpose of my review.</li>
            <li> The packaging says that it can prevent tooth sensitivity for up to a month, and it really does!</li>
            <li> My first try, the stripe did move on me</li>
            <li> It really worked for me!</li>
            <li> When I first tried the strips I could eat and drink anything and everything without a problem</li>
            <li> They throbbed for a good few hours after taking the strips off...</li>
            <li> The instructions do not say to trim the plastic strip to fit, but in actual use, it was necessary to trim the strip in order to get the strip in place and have a comfortable fit for an aching  </li>
            <li> I was so excited to be a part of this trial because I have extremely sensitive teeth.  </li>
            <li> I love the new Crest Sensi-Strips that I got for free to try from Crest, They are so easy to use and long lasting results.</li>
            <li> So make sure you place the strip appropriately, even if it&#x27;s on a hard to reach tooth.</li>
            <li> I had a great deal of trouble getting the strip into position near rear teeth.  </li>
            <li> After seeing my dentist, and ruling out a more severe problem than just sensitivity, he suggested that I try these in addition to sensitive toothpaste--before we have to go a more dramatic route to get my tooth to a more manageable state.  </li>
            <li> They hurt when I drink ice water, hot foods, pretty much everything bothers them.</li>
            <li> so I used the coupon that I also received and got me more and my bottom teeth has not been no where as near as sensitive as it was</li>
            <li> They are easy to use and very effective, however if you have sensitivity in you back molars, it is hard to get the strip to stay in place.</li>
            <li> I actually find it pretty easy to put them on during my drive to work.  </li>
            <li> I have to say, after the first treatment, I did not notice really any difference.</li>
            <li> I only have one more treatment left from my free sample</li>
            <li> However, after using the Crest strips I can enjoy many things especially ice cream that I haven’t been able to in such a long time.</li>
            <li> I do eat a lot of acidic foods and drink kombucha which is kind of sour</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t ahve as good of luck as other people with the sensitive teeth pain.  </li>
            <li> I was able to keep a few in different places such as the bathroom and my purse, so the convenience was great.</li>
            <li> They are really easy to use and my teeth are no where near as sensitive anymore!</li>
            <li> I had to try 6 strips just to get one to half way stay in place, and even then, it was kind of wadded up in a ball.  </li>
            <li> or so then they would help someone with more minor issues much longer.  </li>
            <li> I have super sensitive teeth</li>
            <li> I like that they are easy to apply and last for quite some time.</li>
            <li> They were easy to use and only need to be done for 10 minutes once a month.</li>
            <li> It was easy apply strip then wait ten minutes.</li>
            <li> There is no taste and the steps are easy -- leave them in place for ten minutes and then wait 30 minutes before eating or drinking.&lt;br</li>
            <li> One of the problems I found was locating the sensitive tooth; I have a whole mouth full so in my case I ended up using all 6 strips.</li>
            <li> In my situation, it turns out the pain had most likely been due to eating too many acidic foods as well as a temporary surge in heartburn (from unusual stress) which allowed excess stomach acid to be pushed into my mouth.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve eaten and drank certain foods that have stripped my toothpaste sensitivity fighting agents away.  </li>
            <li> After promptly removing the large piece of plastic from my mouth I decided to read the instructions.</li>
            <li> I just assumed that they would be large strips like the whitening strips, but they weren&#x27;t.  </li>
            <li> Also, I really like the convenience of having each strip individually packed making it easy to keep one in your bag/wallet while you&#x27;re out</li>
            <li> We went home, she applied a strip, and an hour later her tooth was just fine.  </li>
            <li> so then the strips will stick better, find the tooth or teeth thats sensitive, be sure your hands are dry and then open the strip and apply the gel side to your tooth and the outer gum line.</li>
            <li> It is so wonderful to actually have very little to no pain at all!!  </li>
            <li> Very good product but a bit difficult to apply.</li>
            <li> I need something a little more powerful than these though.</li>
            <li> So skeptical at first, but luckily it was easy to use, took 10 minutes &amp; did better than anything else I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> I am going to try them again today, but I don&#x27;t really expect results.  </li>
            <li> Unlike the whitening stripes that stick VERY well on your teeth this strip does not.  </li>
            <li> Thanks to the invented.</li>
            <li> I really wanted to like this product.</li>
            <li> The strips also do not &#x27;stick&#x27; very well to the tooth</li>
            <li> I really wanted this to work for me.</li>
            <li> really like the concept of these strips, they just didn&#x27;t work for me.</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was really hoping these Sensi-stop strips would work.  </li>
            <li> She also wants to know.</li>
            <li> In all, the &amp;#34;treatment&amp;#34; takes about 40 minutes (10 minutes after applying, 30 before you can eat or drink anything), but it really does work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I did not expect this product to work wonders as it is an over the counter product, but it did lessen sensitivity enough to make it comfortable to eat and drink.</li>
            <li> , I can&#x27;t believe how fast these Crest Sensi-Stop Strips really work</li>
            <li> I can mot thank Crest enough for sending me this item free to try.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t have much hope in the strips</li>
            <li> I tried it on my bottom teeth that were hurting at the time and they really do work.</li>
            <li> I tried Crest Sensi-Stop strips and they really work.</li>
            <li> But I didn&#x27;t notice much of a change in sensitivity at all.</li>
            <li> I was hoping these strips would work, but I can’t say I noticed much difference after using them.</li>
            <li> so maybe I just had too much damage for them to work</li>
            <li> I can even eat and drink without as much pain.</li>
            <li> the whole,</li>
            <li> I received the Sensi-stop strips free from Crest and used them on am area where I recently had a crown placed.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not an absolute cure-all</li>
            <li> I tried out one of the strips - and I got fast results.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend Crest Sensi Strips!  </li>
            <li> have a tooth that had a deep cavity filled</li>
            <li> Thanks @Crest, #GotItFree</li>
            <li> Thanks to Crest for letting me try the strips.</li>
            <li> I would recommend saving your money and seeking real treatment from a dentist.</li>
            <li> This is a product I highly recommend for anyone to try with tooth sensitivity!</li>
            <li> They really need to rethink this product.</li>
            <li> fast shipping, as listed</li>
            <li> and they really are making a difference in the pain that I feel. ^_^</li>
            <li> As for the intense spot, it worked really well.</li>
            <li> You wear the strip for 10 minutes, in which time I felt a promising tingling sensation to let me know it was doing</li>
            <li> I truly never thought that a product like this would really work</li>
            <li> and it really does work well to stop that shooting pain</li>
            <li> Fortunately, one strip actually did relieve my tooth pain--in over a week, it hasn&#x27;t bothered me again.</li>
            <li> I really wished that these would have worked for me</li>
            <li> I tried this product but it didn&#x27;t really seem to work.  </li>
            <li> really wanted this product to work.  </li>
            <li> Hopefully my dental appointment won&#x27;t be too much torture today.</li>
            <li> Thanks to the Crest Sensi-Strip</li>
            <li> One that really stood out to me was</li>
            <li> Wait 5 minutes after brushing your teeth to gently place your strip at your gum line.</li>
            <li> so try not to touch them too much, or move them around a lot.</li>
            <li> Really a breakthrough.</li>
            <li> This stuff really works.  </li>
            <li> Had really looked forward to finding something that helped.</li>
            <li> The next morning was my first true test of how the strips had done.  </li>
            <li> As far as results go your mileage will vary but I do have one tooth in particular with mild, persistent issues whenever it comes into contact with ice.</li>
            <li> I tried these strips free from Crest® I have horribly sensitive teeth and these strips seemed to strengthen my tolerance toward my sensitive foods.</li>
            <li> I liked that the treatments/strips didn&#x27;t need to be used daily like the white strips do...</li>
            <li> I used it on one side of my mouth, on my lower back teeth which is the most sensitive spot in my mouth.  </li>
            <li> I have sensitive teeth on my lower, right teeth.</li>
            <li> While you are waiting on the strips to work their magic, read a book, watch a tv show, contemplate your life, stress about holidays with the in-laws, or do some other activity that doesn&#x27;t require much mouth movement.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Not only is the plastic piece too large to fit in a normal sized mouth</li>
            <li> However, Crest Sensi-Stop Strips were very easy to apply and only took ten minutes to apply.</li>
            <li> I may have to use more of them on my other teeth.</li>
            <li> Just to try and test it better, I tried one side and not the other to see if there was even a hint of a difference.</li>
            <li> Excited to make a future purchase!</li>
            <li> These Strips work better than expected!</li>
            <li> I would recommend this product for thise with more severe sensitivity due to the cost.</li>
            <li> The main ingredient responsible for decreasing tooth sensitivity is dipotassium oxalate.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s only so much Sensodyne I can take -- luckily, Crest Sensi-stop strips came along.</li>
            <li> I have super sensitive teeth and the sensitive toothpaste helps</li>
            <li> I can say without a doubt the past month has been amazing.  </li>
            <li> The only downside I have found is that it does not work for a full month.  </li>
            <li> They&#x27;re &amp;#34;okay&amp;#34; as far as strips go, if not slightly uncomfortable to wear, but they do the job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Additionally, the box does caution the user that this product has been known to NOT last the full month ... something to consider as you weigh Sensodyne against this box (of six strips).</li>
            <li> I will defiantly use another strip though, because it certainly made a difference in my enjoyment of previously sensitive foods!</li>
            <li> This is an excellent product if you have teeth that are sensitive to heat or to cold.</li>
            <li> Easy to apply with minimal prep involved (you basically affix a strip to the tooth in need of soothing and let it sit for 10 minutes)</li>
            <li> I started with 10 minutes per strip, doing the main area where I had noticed sensitivity.  </li>
            <li> I think my receding gumline is the main problem.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Yes, you will salivate a bit more than usual when first applied, but it subsides after a couple minutes.</li>
            <li> But I still think they offer a definite benefit and start to work quickly.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive teeth!</li>
            <li> The directions are pretty straight forward, much like the crest whitening strips if you have ever tried them just a bit smaller .</li>
            <li> Very pleased to have found a new way to address a common problem</li>
            <li> and I highly recommend them.  </li>
            <li> I had high hopes for these strips.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend, and have already recommended these to others.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product if you are dealing with tooth Sensitivity.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product to the point</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend Crest Sensi-Stop Strips to any one experiencing tooth sensitivity.</li>
            <li> They help bring down tooth sensitivity a bit more effectively that just tooth sensitive tooth past.</li>
            <li> so if you have a large area of sensitive teeth</li>
            <li> They are easy to use,have no funny aftertaste, and the sensitivity and pain were gone for awhile.</li>
            <li> But other than that, , they are really easy to use.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;The strips are kind of hard to get off the sheet.  </li>
            <li> I woke up, got a glass of glacier-like cold water, and proceeded to drink it, preparing for the satanic slaughter of my teeth as I had so commonly experienced after trying to enjoy a beverage that was not lukewarm temperature; you know, like actually putting ice in water and drinking it....</li>
            <li> Makes the product fairly expensive for the amount of relief experienced.</li>
            <li> I was really looking forward to these strips for my sensitive teeth.  </li>
            <li> I really wanted to try Crest Sensi-Stop Strips because I have really sensitive teeth.</li>
            <li> It does work so much faster than a sensitive toothpaste &amp; lasts a lot longer.</li>
            <li> I purchased these first from my local grocery store (and they were much more expensive than on Amazon, figures) and then again from my dentist (also more than Amazon...</li>
            <li> I figured there would be enough foods that have caused me sensitivity in the past to give them a fair try.</li>
            <li> I know it may seem like over the top praise, but I had trouble eating a cupcake or drinking wine</li>
            <li> well I literally had no sensitive areas in my mouth after using them and I was able to brush my teeth with regular tartar control Crest toothpaste.</li>
            <li> /&gt;There is one thing that I noticed that made the strips work even better for me: The first three I applied every month, but the last three I applied on the same night (10 mins a strip, take off, reapply new strip for 10 mins, repeat - total 30 mins per affected area).  </li>
            <li> However, it&#x27;s really not hard at all to figure out.  </li>
            <li> Will update my review if multiple applications do work, but right now I&#x27;m upset that I am out the money for something that did nothing.</li>
            <li> The medication is helpful, if you can finally get it to the right place.</li>
            <li> more than three times.)There is a warning-- not to use with bleeding gums or loose teeth or if you&#x27;re under 18 or \\&quot;have a history of kidney stones\\&quot;-- and a lot of necessary \\&quot;legalese\\&quot; because of it being a medicine sold over the counter.</li>
            <li> I’ve tried several different solutions over the years without much luck, but one new product that’s available is giving me hope at putting a stop to my sensitive teeth issues.  </li>
            <li> The whole process is pretty simple and just requires applying it to the sensitive area and leaving it on for 30 minutes.</li>
            <li> i am able to  enjoy things like hot coffee and cold ice cream with out excrutiating pain</li>
            <li> It works but as with anything new, there is a learning curve.  </li>
            <li> The dentist assures me that with time the problem should lessen, if not resolve all together, but when offered these new strips, I jumped at the chance to try them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> On the generally sensitive teeth, one treatment made my teeth feel like they were brand new again!</li>
            <li> It is very affordable and is worth the money spent.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive teeth</li>
            <li> still very sensitive.</li>
            <li> have very sensitive teeth</li>
            <li> To their credit, my teeth are generally very sensitive so there is quite the hurdle to give me relief.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive teeth</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive lower teeth.</li>
            <li> When you remove it from the sheet it is very soft and floppy.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive teeth.</li>
            <li> I brushed my teeth (with sensitive toothpaste as always) and then stuck them in while I surfed the internet right before bed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have general tooth sensitivity as well, but it&#x27;s all over - not in super tiny spots.</li>
            <li> I was so excited when I saw a commercial for these strips, as I have several very sensitive teeth at the gum line on one side of my mouth.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;These are strips that are applied for 10-minutes and, as expected you need strips for each side, but the overall reduction of sensitivity is nothing short of amazing.</li>
            <li> I got the strip in place on my back tooth on the first try.</li>
            <li> Sensitive teeth are no match for these strips!</li>
            <li> Wow!</li>
            <li> /&gt;Wy wife said she got \\&quot;some\\&quot; relief after the first application and then tried another a week later when the area was bothering her again.</li>
            <li> I am several days out from my first application</li>
            <li> These are more like a small patch that covers about 2 teeth or maybe 3 small teeth at the most.</li>
            <li> You just place them on teeth that are sensitive, wait about 10 mins, and POOF!</li>
            <li> but since this is a New Scientific Breakthrough as far as tooth sensitivity is concerned</li>
            <li> Each strip has such a small amount of medicine on it, it&#x27;s amazing that Crest would get away selling it for so much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I mean-you&#x27;re not going to go drink hot coffee while eating ice cream if you have sensitive teeth, and these aren&#x27;t going to make it possible.</li>
            <li> I have used a sensitive toothpaste in the past and have had more sensitivity after using.</li>
            <li> I have to say, I never thought there&#x27;d be a day when I could just apply a sensi-stop strip and have my sensitive teeth be fixed, but the day has come!  </li>
            <li> I would still need to be careful drinking anything too hot or too cold -- but after using a Sensi-stop strip, I was able to enjoy hot coffee on that side for the first time in a long time.</li>
            <li> I was very surprised to find it fixed my sensitive gum area.</li>
            <li> I do wish they game in bigger strips as most of my teeth are pretty sensitive, so i almost use a whole box to get all my teeth.</li>
            <li> May be it applies only to certain causes of sensitivity and not all.</li>
            <li> Nevertheless, this product should work decent for people who do not have as much sensitivity or their sensitivity is minor.</li>
            <li> In the first 24 hours I didn&#x27;t seem to notice much of a difference, but after the first day or so, I definitely feel much less sensitive in the problem area</li>
            <li> and a little more after the second.  </li>
            <li> These little strips work better than everything I&#x27;ve ever tried for tooth sensitivity, and it only takes 10 minutes!!</li>
            <li> Worked well on sensitive tooth</li>
            <li> And much longer lasting than anything else I have tried.</li>
            <li> For me, I decided to do them at night, after I was completely ready for bed (and having already brushed my teeth, as the instructions recommend).  </li>
            <li> The sensitivity was completely gone for over 3 months.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;- Use them before you go to bed, after having gotten completely ready.&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li> And it has lasted for 3 weeks so far.</li>
            <li> I find the strips provide immediate relief that lasts far longer than they promise.  </li>
            <li> My mom and I both used this because we have sensitive teeth</li>
            <li> I had a sensitive tooth for 3 months and the dentist that treated it twice did not fix the sensitivity but this product worked with 2 treatments, in a score of 1 out of 10</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried toothpastes for sensitive teeth</li>
            <li> and I have a terribly busy schedule.  </li>
            <li> You place the strip over the sensitive area.  </li>
            <li> I have really sensitive teeth.  </li>
            <li> I use sensodyne every day and I am still sensitive.  </li>
            <li> : The strips reduce the sensitivity of (one) sensitive tooth of mine</li>
            <li> I have never seen strips for sensitive teeth.</li>
            <li> It is applied to the sensitive area just like their whitening strips.</li>
            <li> I was pleasantly surprised with these strips.</li>
            <li> You just put it on the sensitive tooth and it works if you use likes</li>
            <li> Colgate Sensitive Pro-relief Pro-argin Toothpaste]]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> completely Pro-argin Toothpaste</li>
            <li> completely solved</li>
            <li> It stays on well until you take it off, which surprised me.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have the product box listing ingredients for my &#x27;sensitive toothpaste,&#x27;</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have the product box listing ingredients for my &#x27;sensitive toothpaste,&#x27;</li>
            <li> The strips work very well if you have a specific area affected by sensitivity.</li>
            <li> I was surprised by that but still wished it were stronger.</li>
            <li> I would recommend these to anyone who has sensitive teeth.</li>
            <li> The tooth is still sensitive to that,</li>
            <li> He suggested I try the Sensi-Stop strips as well as a toothpaste made for sensitive teeth.</li>
            <li> Do you suffer from sensitive teeth?  </li>
            <li> I am on the seventh day now and my tooth feels just slightly sensitive again.</li>
            <li> After two treatments, however, it was nearly gone.</li>
            <li> I have a sensitive tooth that I have been trying to heal for months.</li>
            <li> For almost all of my life I have suffered from sensitive teeth.</li>
            <li> so I stopped using sensitive relief toothpaste.</li>
            <li> Though toothpaste for sensitive teeth works, I always choke on it.</li>
            <li> I have a sensitive molar.  </li>
            <li> There is no way you will get this to remotely resemble staying in place, not for 20 seconds, let alone 10 colossal sized minutes.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have super duper sensitive teeth, only minor sensitivity.</li>
            <li> The fact I get long acting relief plus no toothpaste taste has permanently made me a loyal user of Crest Sensi-Stop Strip for LIFE!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> They work pretty much the same as white teethening stripes but smaller.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Be aware that you are not to use this product if you suffer from bleeding gums, or loose teeth.  </li>
            <li> Makes it pretty difficult to get the gel from the package to the tooth without touching the gel on the strip.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I was very impressed that the Crest Sensi-Stop Strips stopped the sensitivity to not only ice cream, but to cold drinks as well!</li>
            <li> I also had some dental work that I must now use a special mouth wash for a few days</li>
            <li> SO far I have used them 3 times, and I barely have noticed any change at all.</li>
            <li> Crest packaging also mentions some of the causes of tooth sensitivity: receding gums, brushing too hard, acidic or sugary food and grinding your teeth--things I&#x27;m going to watch out for going forward (they say if you need this more than three times for the same tooth to see the dentist).&lt;br</li>
            <li> After years of using sensitive teeth toothpaste and only having relief for a few hours at best, it was getting frustrating, trying to enjoy hot and cold foods and drinks.</li>
            <li> They were easy to use, less hassle than a daily toothpaste and had actual results!</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You are supposed to apply one strip around the gum line of the area that is sensitive (usually sensitivity is caused by a receding gum line that exposes the otherwise unprotected root portion of your tooth - this statement is true because it&#x27;s on the Internet).  </li>
            <li> But when my braces were on, I had to microwave ice cream - even though I have previously made fun of people for doing that.  </li>
            <li> Crest Sensi-Stop strips are fast and simple, and because they come in individually wrapped applications, you can keep one in your bag or toiletry kit for when you&#x27;re out.  </li>
            <li> Once I finally got it to the back tooth I had so much spit in my mouth that it just slip around.  </li>
            <li> The worst part about sensitive spots on your teeth and not being able to enjoy the foods you love or carefully deciding what you can have.</li>
            <li> The sensitivity is not completely gone, but not uncomfortable enough to affect my enjoyment of iced beverages, or even ice cream.</li>
            <li> These strips stopped my tooth sensitivity for a whole month with only one ten minute treatment.</li>
            <li> The results were inconclusive and I was told this is possible in the early stages of root inflammation and infection and because early  infections don&#x27;t always leave traces on x-</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive teeth especially the front ones.</li>
            <li> I noticed my teeth were less sensitive after the first use.</li>
            <li> It is easy to use--just take out the strip (one per tooth, only for a one-time use) and apply it so it lines up with the gumline (usually where the dentin has been exposed and is causing the pain).</li>
            <li> cannot really even break this down into low/high points because there really are only two.&lt;br /&gt;Good</li>
            <li> OK, but they are very hard to get to stay in one place.  </li>
            <li> They don&#x27;t cover a large area and it takes some dexterity to get them in harder to reach places.</li>
            <li> Not my favorite product because it is hard to apply and keep the strips on for a long time</li>
            <li> The morning after I placed my first application, I was able to eat cold cereal without any sensitivity.  </li>
            <li> have spent the entire summer unable to enjoy my favorite iced beverage --- southern style iced tea.  </li>
            <li> it only takes 10 minutes per use and produces immediate results as far as tooth sensitivity is concerned.</li>
            <li> I have used toothpastes and mouthwashes made for sensitive teeth and none of them hold a candle to the instantaneous and lasting relief of the Crest® Sensi-Stop Strips.</li>
            <li> This barely covers one tooth.  </li>
            <li> Finally I found the product that works for my sensitive teeth.</li>
            <li> I plan to use a third strip to see if I can make the sensitivity go completely away.</li>
            <li> I never thought I would see that day again and fixed with such ease as a applying these strips and no trip to the dentist.</li>
            <li> My back tooth is sensitive.  </li>
            <li> I am also a person that uses all-natural toothpaste because I do not like the taste of regular toothpaste - so those sensitive toothpastes out there just don&#x27;t work for me.  </li>
            <li> There are a few of us in our family that suffer from sensitive gums and this product has really helped!</li>
            <li> Expensive for this irregularly effective</li>
            <li> I bought these yesterday as one of my lower molars was super sensitive to sweet and cold things.  </li>
            <li> I have very sensitive teeth, especially on the left side of my mouth.</li>
            <li> They are also super small</li>
            <li> /&gt;These worked very well, my son (30 years old, lives with me because he is disabled) had a tooth ache two weeks ago</li>
            <li> Apply three in a row, to the same sensitive area, ten minutes each.&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li> The last time something like that happened, her tooth hurt for over a week, even with going back to the sensitive toothpaste.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have multiple sensitive spots and so I have to use multiple strips (one for each area of sensitivity).  </li>
            <li> A recently replaced filling has become the sole sensitive spot in my mouth.</li>
            <li> I was really surprised that this actually worked and continued to work for several days.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, my sensitivity was far greater on the inside, so I tried to put the strip there.  </li>
            <li> The bitty little thing slid around a lot, but I soldiered through and kept it on the spot pretty well for the required 10 minutes.</li>
            <li> I received my free samples of Crest® Sensi-Stop Strips as part of my bzzagent kit, which are packaged similar to the crest  white strips, I was so excited to try them that I failed to read the directions carefully</li>
            <li> I have suffered from sensitive teeth for a long time.</li>
            <li> These strips provide temporary relief, but not a long term solution.</li>
            <li> I tried this product on a sensitive upper left tooth in the back of my mouth.</li>
            <li> I have suffered from sensitive teeth for a long time.  </li>
            <li> I really wanted this to work so that I could go back to enjoying cold treats.&lt;br</li>
            <li> While I have thankfully not had one of the latter to deal with recently, I have tried the strips for cold sensitivity and had quite good results.</li>
            <li> They are very small and a bit difficult to fit onto your teeth when trying to cover more than two.  </li>
            <li> I enjoy cold and hot beverages now</li>
            <li> Crest products are usually amazing, but this one, they really dropped the ball. :(</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t talk or move my mouth much while the strip was on as they moved around slightly when I did so - decreasing the efficacy since I wasn&#x27;t keeping the area</li>
            <li> I just applied my second strip a few days ago and it&#x27;s been about 6 weeks since I put the first one on.</li>
            <li> The only thing I did differently was to dry the sensitive area with the corner of a washcloth (no way am I going to blow air on it!)</li>
            <li> I got about a week of reduced pain, this certainly would be very helpful for situations that I regularly deal with like a damaged filling or chipped tooth, which don&#x27;t quite rise to the level of a dental emergency but are certainly uncomfortable to live with.</li>
            <li> It only minimized it slightly but for me it&#x27;s just not worth to buy a full pack.</li>
            <li> It would work for my minor teeth sensitivities but not my major ones.</li>
            <li> I wore braces for several years as an adult and one of the most alarming things was my new sensitivity to cold.</li>
            <li> There are good and bad points to this product.</li>
            <li> Worth trying for worse sensitive tooth.</li>
            <li> If you have sensitive teeth that are not directly next to each other</li>
            <li> They are also very thin and delicate (thanks to white strip abuse) and they also now chip very easily.</li>
            <li> a simple small gel strip applied directly to the sensitive area (mine is my lower front teeth) for 10 minutes</li>
            <li> Imagine wetting a piece of toilet paper and trying to stick it onto the side of a tooth in the back of your mouth.  </li>
            <li> relief is noticeable, and although not completely gone, a definite improvement, and, after ten days the effect is still holding.</li>
            <li> The small strip, with the medication on one side, comes on a large plastic sheet.</li>
            <li> It was pretty hard to keep it in place there as well.  </li>
            <li> They do work with a few tips I&#x27;ve found to increase effectiveness, use in conjunction with a daily sensitivity toothpaste, don&#x27;t use with whiteners, keep packs inside crush resistant case, help keep gel on strips, dry sensitive area with q-tip, after applying strip use dry qtip to ensure complete contact, after removing strip</li>
            <li> so I never use them long enough to see if they work.  </li>
            <li> They are long enough to cover about 3 teeth.</li>
            <li> They just would not stick or stay in place long enough to do anything.  </li>
            <li> so that may contribute to the strips not lasting as long.</li>
            <li> I did not give it 5 stars because I want to see how&lt;br /&gt;it works over time and how long it will last.</li>
            <li> For me the process was with it because the effects are deeper than a topical treatment and really long</li>
            <li> long lasting relief.</li>
            <li> /&gt;They were hard to get into position, especially as my sensitive teeth are at the back on my molars.</li>
            <li> Before I was sent the strips complimentary to try from Crest, I had serious teeth and gum pain when I ate cold foods (like Cherry Garcia ice cream) or drank orange juice (which I absolutely love in the mornings).</li>
            <li> Since the protection lasts for a month this worked out, but I hope Crest will seriously consider making a longer version of these strips that can reach both first molars in an average adult&#x27;s mouth.</li>
            <li> I was asked to review this kit by bzzagent in exchange for free strips and initially I was so skeptical.  </li>
            <li> The first time I used them was pretty awkward.</li>
            <li> Unlike Potassium Nitrate (in this Crest product) which only dulls nerves, the Pro-argin actually blocks the &#x27;tubes&#x27; in the enamel of your teeth.</li>
            <li> One had a moderate improvement after a few months using Crest Pro-Health, Sensitive + Enamel Shield toothpaste.  </li>
            <li> These Crest Sensi-Stop Strips 6 Treatments are a blessing for those suffering from sensitive teeth, but they can be difficult to apply and require some time to get them right.</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that the strips are short and I had to use multiple strips to get all of my sensitive teeth.</li>
            <li> not sure how long the effect will last as it has been less than a week since my first application of them.</li>
            <li> These are definitely worth trying if you experience pain due to hot or cold on your teeth.  </li>
            <li> We keep most of our drinking water cold</li>
            <li> I have been able to eat sweets and drink cold beverages.  </li>
            <li> Will have to see how it works in the long run.</li>
            <li> recommend it for a long term use .</li>
            <li> I just don&#x27;t have time to dedicate to a long dental ritual every day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The strips are about an inch long.</li>
            <li> I can now eat and drink what I have shied away from, for so long.</li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t think it lasted that long but again</li>
            <li> But for me it was a complete waste of money.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The Sensi-Stop Strips eased the pain and inflammation and as my stress and heartburn eased the gum irritation became minor- and then disappeared.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this product to someone with just a few sensitive teeth.</li>
            <li> and my teeth are not sensitive anymore.</li>
            <li> Does what it says, but does not last as long as expected.</li>
            <li> I was very skeptical of if they would work on my sensitive teeth, but with a free trial promotion from Bzz Agent I decided to giver them a whirl.</li>
            <li> The tiny little strip, with gel on one side -- much smaller than event the smallest band-aid -- is hard to manipulate and it&#x27;s very easy to fold it over by accident, rub the gel off, or generally just fail to get it to the spot needed.    </li>
            <li> I have a tooth that is super sensitive to cold.</li>
            <li> dentist DID see signs of potentially temporary (and less severe) issues, including gum regression and some related redness.</li>
            <li> As I have gotten older I have noticed increased sensitivity to my teeth when eating cold or hot foods.</li>
            <li> I had extreme sensitivity on my back teeth and two dentists I had gone</li>
            <li> You have a big sheet of plastic with a little piece of the sensitivity strip in the middle.  </li>
            <li> Gave three stars because while the product might work well, I couldn&#x27;t get the tiny little strips situated on my back molars</li>
            <li> I have a few generally sensitive teeth and one extraordinarily sensitive tooth in one small spot</li>
            <li> After removing the strip, there was no funny taste or anything left.</li>
            <li> /&gt;There are several other warnings and precautions listed in the leaflet.</li>
            <li> I am now finding other teeth that are sensitive since my typical problem teeth are no longer problems.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t take very long.</li>
            <li> If any food sits in there very long, I have pain.  </li>
            <li> I really wanted this product to work because drinking cold liquids really bothers my teeth.  </li>
            <li> The only reason I am giving these a 4/5 star rating is that wearing the strips is a bit uncomfortable for me, but the relief they give is well worth it.  </li>
            <li> Hot coffee that I usually sip slowly and carefully did not slow me down at all.</li>
            <li> I thought these strips helped, but no better than the sensitive toothpaste.</li>
            <li> It was still sensitive, but I didn&#x27;t have the screaming sensitivity that I usually have.  </li>
            <li> I expected them to be the length of the Crest White Strips or other strips like that.</li>
            <li> , I would say 1/2 inch long and 1/4 inch wide.  </li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You suffer from bleeding gums or loose teeth.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say I am entirely surprised as my dentist didn&#x27;t have much to offer except some temporary expensive glue along the gum line that only worked for a little bit.</li>
            <li> After just 10 minutes with the New Crest Sensi Stop they have at least up to 6 hours of relief.</li>
            <li> I think this will only work for people with a slight problem with sensitivity.</li>
            <li> to previously couldn&#x27;t figure it out, leaving my only option to be a root canal (according to them - quitters).</li>
            <li> Leave them on for ten minutes and abstain from eating or drinking for another half hour.</li>
            <li> and this made a black and white difference.</li>
            <li> I had total relief of discomfort from the less bothersome tooth, within 10 minutes, as advertised.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always had problems eating or drinking anything really cold like ice cream or drinking anything really hot like coffee because of my sensitive teeth.</li>
            <li> I strong recommend it as it worked for me on a sensitivity issue I was having to cold food.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried several Sensitive teeth toothpastes in the past with little to no relief.</li>
            <li> For 10 minutes of your time to have a thin strip on your teeth you can enjoy cold and hot food and drinks again.  </li>
            <li> Ever since I was little I have had sensitive teeth, especially to the hot and cold food and drinks I use, so these strips take all of that away.</li>
            <li> is the price, which is a little steep for only six applications.  </li>
            <li> Followed the directions precisely, absolutely no change in sensitivity whatsoever.  </li>
            <li> It is disappointing to me because sensitive toothpaste and mouthwash only goes so far.  </li>
            <li> Took the plunge and spent the money seeking immediate pain relief and wish I hadn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> A few days later it was like I had never used them at all.</li>
            <li> The sensitivity was relieved for a few days, but definitely reappeared after 10 days.  </li>
            <li> I had to drink it a few different times to confirm, but I no longer felt any tooth pain!</li>
            <li> , I had this before, so I was really curious receiving this Product from Crest.</li>
            <li> I have been using these strips for the last few weeks</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not a whole mouth piece for all your teeth.</li>
            <li> that never really healed.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I expected it to be for porous enamel, but it treated my problem quite well.</li>
            <li> Total waste of money, and my tooth hurts just from the irritation of trying to put it on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For</li>
            <li> Product arrived as expected.  </li>
            <li> Every time I positioned it on my tooth, it&#x27;d move when I closed my mouth and stick onto my cheek.</li>
            <li> and once you get them wet with your tongue, they move around</li>
            <li> I noticed absolutely no improvement to my tooth sensitivity after using these strips.</li>
            <li> the harder it is to keep in place.  </li>
            <li> It did work to prevent tooth sensitivity, but it only lasted for a few days instead of for a weeks like the package suggests.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t have any problems with them slipping like with the whitening strips.</li>
            <li> A strip has to be applied to an individual tooth, so if you have a few teeth that need application then you also need to use 3 separate strips.</li>
            <li> I could not really tell if these worked or not.  </li>
            <li> The strips are so small, they&#x27;re most impossible to position on any of your back teeth</li>
            <li> and I mean, extremely sensitive.</li>
            <li> My teeth didn&#x27;t feel like I just bit down on a piece of dry ice.  </li>
            <li> I have super sensitivity to cold stuff and never thought I could enjoy cold again</li>
            <li> I am a big time white strip user which causes my teeth to be very sensitive to cold and got things.</li>
            <li> The three that were wasted slipped around in my fingertips, folded in half and finally crumpled into nothing.  </li>
            <li> With extreme sensitivity to hot or cold, everything has to be lukewarm and cold drinks are even less enjoyable at mealtime.</li>
            <li> There was no notable effect until 4:00 AM when I woke up with a toothache that would not let me go back to sleep.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have teeth sensitivity occasionally and usually I just don&#x27;t chew on that side of my mouth to keep it from hurting.  </li>
            <li> I guess I didn&#x27;t look closely enough at the picture on the package, so I found the strips to be ridiculously small.</li>
            <li> Before I did that, however, I wanted to explore other options.  </li>
            <li> I suffer from extreme sensitivity to sweets.</li>
            <li> Based on other reviews, this might help some people with some issues, but my experience was this didn&#x27;t help at all.</li>
            <li> Still, when you&#x27;re talking about sore teeth and gums, it&#x27;s a small price for almost instant relief.  </li>
            <li> But they are so small and flimsy that there is no chance to attach one to a back tooth.</li>
            <li> but it also is sharp around the edges.</li>
            <li> Small enough to use anywhere!  </li>
            <li> I guessing it might be due to my receding gum line.</li>
            <li> drawback is that they only come in one small application size.</li>
            <li> Although they work and provide relief they are costing us in other ways.</li>
            <li> so I didn&#x27;t know if I should repeat the procedure due to any dangers of over-exposure.</li>
            <li> and it only covers a small area.</li>
            <li> but I can drink coffee or tea or even drink ice water or bite a Popsicle without that sharp jolting pain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Usually in the US this is dental visit only offering at $50 to $100 bucks a pop</li>
            <li> ... in other countries it&#x27;s an over the counter toothpaste... luckly you can find it imported on Amazon for about $10.</li>
            <li> The other --- none.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Both were recently examined with no outstanding findings.  </li>
            <li> The only small problem is trying to figure out which tooth is the correct one</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m relieved to be free from any immediate need for a very expensive dental procedure.  </li>
            <li> My teeth are SO sensitive they are literally painful to the slightest touch in certain areas.</li>
            <li> I have a hard time with cold fruit most of all.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The sensi-strips are very difficult to apply and most of the small amount of medicine gets on your fingers, not on your gums.</li>
            <li> It was really difficult to get it on the inside of the tooth/gum area because it is near the back of my mouth.  </li>
            <li> I have a couple of teeth on the right side of my mouth that are very sensitive to cold, so I haven&#x27;t eaten ice cream in a long time, and when I do I have to suffer through my cold treat if I ever forget to keep the ice cream on the left side of my mouth.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Apparently, the bottom wisdom teeth are close to the soft palate, where the gum protection is not as tough as elsewhere in the mouth.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been dealing with sensitivity due to overzealous brushing for years on end (slightly eroded gum line).  </li>
            <li> By the way these 6 tiny strips are hard to apply and keep in place against the teeth.</li>
            <li> The strip was hard to place back there</li>
            <li> The next day I had a cold smoothie, and already the sensitivity had decreased tremendously!</li>
            <li> Crest Sensi-Stop strips are hard to apply and only has 6 strips.</li>
            <li> I had a really bad sensitive tooth that prevented me from having anything hot or cold without much providing annoyance.</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been disappointed with products in the past, but this is the first time something actually did the opposite of what it was advertised for.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m also not sure how long it would take after I stopped doing the treatments for the pain to resurface.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, this didn&#x27;t really help with the problem at all, not even for a day or two.</li>
            <li> only complaint</li>
            <li> They did not make things worse, but I would not buy them again as they do not decrease my cold sensitivity, even with following all of the directions precisely each time.</li>
            <li> My teeth can sometimes become sensitive when drinking cold products, but using the Crest Sensi-Stop Strips, for just a few minutes, soothes the sensitive feelings that cause pain.</li>
            <li> that&#x27;s my only complaint.  </li>
            <li> Since the strips are small you can really only do a few teeth at a time.  </li>
            <li> For me, it was not worth the effort, annoyance, concerns, or price.</li>
            <li> There is no stick at all and after a few tries I couldn&#x27;t tell if the correct side was on my tooth.  </li>
            <li> Love Chrest hate these strips, try again Chrest.</li>
            <li> Also after removing the strips after 10 minutes (which I had to adjust a few times because they kept slipping)</li>
            <li> The strips are very small and hard to handle especially since they are technically a sterile product.</li>
            <li> Also, the strips are really small and a little difficult to maneuver, particularly way back in the mouth.</li>
            <li> Also, the strips are really small and a little difficult to maneuver, particularly way back in the mouth.</li>
            <li> Has been up and down for about 5 minutes now.</li>
            <li> $20 down the drain.</li>
            <li> I have a couple of areas that are prone to sensitive with cold liquids above my canines.</li>
            <li> The strips did make my sensitivity less heightened.</li>
            <li> My bottom teeth stopped hurting for about a half an hour before it wore off</li>
            <li> Not even a slight improvement.</li>
            <li> With my gangster tooth, I only had a subtle improvement.  </li>
            <li> and there is still a slight bit of pain.</li>
            <li> and there is still a slight bit of pain.</li>
            <li> Will take a few weeks to see how it works, but I have sensitive teeth, and it hasn&#x27;t made them worse, so fingers crossed.</li>
            <li> I had come chocolates for valentines day and when some of it got onto that tooth, I didn&#x27;t have the zing that I had previously.  </li>
            <li> but less so.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s March 14th, the sensi strip lasted for less than 2 weeks, maybe 10 days.  </li>
            <li> You keep it on for 10 minutes and then don&#x27;t eat or drink anything for half an hour.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Moreover, I am left truly uncomfortable by the numerous notes of caution on the product.</li>
            <li> They do however cut down on the sensitivity a little bit.</li>
            <li> The instructions tell you that, if you accidentally mess it up, just use another strip.  </li>
            <li> but instead its a small gel strip that you peel off and have to carefully place along your gum line/teeth.</li>
            <li> I can drink cold soda without flinching, take a bite of something hot and not even notice it.  </li>
            <li> They give me&lt;br /&gt;Trouble with everything from cold temperatures, hot temperatures and even to sweets.  </li>
            <li> I can now eat cold and hot without the issues of sensitivity.</li>
            <li> I have sensitivity to both hot and cold.  </li>
            <li> I used to have issues with hot and cold things.</li>
            <li> I have minor sensitivity on one tooth near the gum line, and I had hoped this would allow me to have cold drinks on this side of my mouth.</li>
            <li> so I have tried other things that before bothered my teeth, like hot foods and ice water and although there is a slight pain, it is NOTHING compared to how badly it was before the strips.&lt;br</li>
            <li> and it was painful to eat ice cream or drink something very hot.</li>
            <li> I guess that is the biggest compliment I can give these little strips, I forgot about them.</li>
            <li> These little strips are about 1 1/8” X 3/8”.</li>
            <li> And, we&#x27;re going on a little over three weeks since application.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It is a little tricky to do.  </li>
            <li> Have a tooth that has a little root exposed at the gumline.</li>
            <li> These consist of a wide, rather hard and sharp, plastic strip with a small stripe of gel on one side.</li>
            <li> When I would eat certain foods (ice-cream, strawberries, cold grapes, spicy food, etc.)</li>
            <li> I have a sensitive spot along the gumline that isn&#x27;t bad enough for the dentist to need to crown or do a graft</li>
            <li> After I did the second treatment two weeks later, I felt no pain whatsoever when drinking cold water.</li>
            <li> Once in a while I want something iced cold and it messes my whole mouth up.&lt;br /&gt;These strips are not my answer.  </li>
            <li> I have been struggling with two wisdom teeth that have intense intolerance for cold.</li>
            <li> He did the usual tests to determine if I needed a root canal: checking my reaction to hot and cold temperatures , taking x- rays etc.</li>
            <li> I also had trouble getting it to adhere and stay in place.  </li>
            <li> Dont waste your money :its all packaging no product ..Strips d</li>
            <li> Years of using expensive sensitive toothpaste is over.</li>
            <li> Away Tooth Desensitizer with similar poor results.</li>
            <li> I have actually found these to be irritating to the gum tissue, and not at all helpful.</li>
            <li> Well after a few attempts I got them where I wanted and went to waste time on the internet.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The strip does tone done the sensation by approximately 50% in my estimation so not necessarily an insta-cure</li>
            <li> A few years ago I was head butted by a pit bull while volunteering at an animal shelter.</li>
            <li> Until Crest comes up with an easier way to use the strip, don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> /&gt;After approximately two weeks I needed to apply another strip in a similar location to keep the tooth pain at bay.</li>
            <li> I received a pack of these to try out for free and they are crap.  </li>
            <li> I was also worried about the application process being messy or time consuming.</li>
            <li> a few strips everytime</li>
            <li> I wasted three just to get one to stick, and that one didn&#x27;t do diddly squat to desensitize my tooth.  </li>
            <li> I put one of the strips on and within just a few minutes</li>
            <li> and it did slip a few times.</li>
            <li> I suffer from tooth sensitivity due to hot and cold foods and my whitening regimen, and these stop my sensitivity!  </li>
            <li> I have had a problem with sensitivity to cold as I have gotten older.</li>
            <li> Not easy,</li>
            <li> These strips are so tiny and fragile that they&#x27;re almost impossible to apply.  </li>
            <li> It felt a little silly to have 6 different strips on at once.</li>
            <li> I applied the small strip to my gums.  </li>
            <li> The strip is small but works well.</li>
            <li> I had to hold it on my tooth for it to stay in place, but after the pain I was in (crying out while drinking water!)</li>
            <li> AND FLOSS YOUR TEETH, LAZY (I suggest doing it while taking a shower in the morning;</li>
            <li> Also the product has a Satisfaction Guaranteed promise, where within 60 days, if you are not satisfied with the product Crest will send you a Pre-paid card in the amount of your purchase, which I view as a plus, so no complaints there.</li>
            <li> gel put on a small strip.  </li>
            <li> They are small and adhere without issue.</li>
            <li> My teeth have become sensitive to cold over time.</li>
            <li> Crest Sensi-Stop Strips provide temporary relief to my teeth and gum that is sensitive to cold food, like ice cream.</li>
            <li> They are just small strips, meant for applying to portions of your mouth.</li>
            <li> The directions mention it might take a few treatments to get the desired level of sensitivity relief, with at least one day between treatments.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure I would use it routinely just for sensitivity</li>
            <li> Even though wearing the strips is annoying, it&#x27;s SO WORTH</li>
            <li> The strip went almost unnoticed!</li>
            <li> For those who have several bothersome teeth, it could get a bit expensive to keep them at the desired comfort level.  </li>
            <li> For those who have several bothersome teeth, it could get a bit expensive to keep them at the desired comfort level.  </li>
            <li> I ordered this product because my teeth are sensitive to cold.</li>
            <li> I was not sure that these would work.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure what my dentist did, but I didn&#x27;t have that problem before.  </li>
            <li> I have  couple teeth that are sensitive to cold.</li>
            <li> the sensitive spot on my tooth still flairs up when I splash it with cold water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The strip is small</li>
            <li> Keep in mind, they are quite small</li>
            <li> However, application of small strips is bit difficult for initial use.</li>
            <li> I did not have any tooth sensitivity even with typical foods that cause me issues such as ice cold sugary beverages and ice creams.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical that a strip could provide month long protection for my tooth sensitivity - especially because I use an expensive $30 toothpaste for my tooth sensitivity that helps, but does not make the pain go away</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re a little awkward to use, but overall performed as promised.  </li>
            <li> This product is excessively packaged - I was shocked at the amount of waste for 6 tiny little strips.</li>
            <li> They are too small and way to hard to get to stay in place.  </li>
            <li> I tried these today and really was disappointed.  </li>
            <li> Pretty much worthless.</li>
            <li> We actually went out and had shaved ice, which I usually turn down because it is too painful.</li>
            <li> At such a high cost per strip (up to $6/strip depending on where you buy them), this is terrible advice.  </li>
            <li> The fact that the toothpaste taste last as long as the relief was annoying to say the least.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and i have hardly</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used specialized toothpaste but the transient nature of the sensitivity makes it hard to justify.  </li>
            <li> Over-priced, hard to apply.</li>
            <li> Perhaps it was because it was so hard to keep it there</li>
            <li> and they were hard to get to stick to your teeth.</li>
            <li> so I hardly even notice that they are in my mouth.</li>
            <li> I can now enjoy ice cream without cringing if the cold strays on one of my bad teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My reacton to cold is no different after applying the strip to what it was before applying the strip.  </li>
            <li> was looking forward to the braces coming off for a lot of reasons but at least one of them was to chomp on a popsicle.  </li>
            <li> I have cold sensitivity that reduces my enjoyment of ice cream (a personal weakness)</li>
            <li> I noticed a lot of the reviewers complained that they don’t stay in place.</li>
            <li> I used them for a tooth ache and the pain was gone for at least 2 weeks.</li>
            <li> The next day, I put cold water in there and swished it around.  </li>
            <li> I did manage to keep it there for at least 10 minutes, but I didn&#x27;t notice any difference.  </li>
            <li> I followed directions fully and still felt pain the next day when I consumed cold cereal for breakfast.</li>
            <li> Not nearly as effective as I had hoped.</li>
            <li> you CAN NOT rinse your mouth, drink, eat, or brush your teeth for at least 30 minutes after you remove the strips.</li>
            <li> then after that, you are covered for an entire four weeks from tooth sensitivity, which for me was to cold food and drink</li>
            <li> , we used one of these and his tooth hasn&#x27;t bothered him since, but it was awkward to put in place, after one failed attempt of him trying to put a strip, we resorted to trimming the wide plastic strip before removing the backing and I put on a pair of disposable medical gloves and put the strip in for him.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Real waste of money.</li>
            <li> My teeth are very sensitive to cold foods but with this, I can eat ice cream again!</li>
            <li> Tooth sensitivity is a thing of the past!</li>
            <li> and now I have no more sensitivity!  </li>
            <li> I can eat everything without being afraid to feel pain and to have sensitivity to hot or cold food.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Couple of things to keep in mind - each strip is very small and will cover 1 or 2 teeth each.</li>
            <li> I have tried every sensitive relief toothpaste out there and have been disappointed in all of them.  </li>
            <li> They are very small.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little expensive, but it helps.</li>
            <li> These can be quite expensive for just 6 little strips (patches)</li>
            <li> makes it not seem as bad because you&#x27;re being doubly productive!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Really sorry I wasted the money on these things.</li>
            <li> or because this was not a good application.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Ordered this in hopes of helping alleviating tooth sensitivity quickly by direct application strips, It did not work and I was totally disappointed for the unnecessary expense I incurred for nothing.</li>
            <li> I will stick with using a mouthpiece a few times a month and sitting with toothpaste in my mouth for as long as I can - over this 20.00 crap.</li>
            <li> Personally the gel to me ha a really bad taste that I had to keep in my mouth for approximately 40 minutes.  </li>
            <li> Really, no more pain!!  </li>
            <li> Practically impossible to use effectively due to design flaws.  </li>
            <li> WARNING, this caused me significantly worse tooth pain.  </li>
            <li> the strip made it worse..</li>
            <li> while it keeps it from getting worse, I do not see any relief.</li>
            <li> I used one of these and the pain I felt was decreased dramatically.</li>
            <li> Rip-Off and way</li>
            <li> I got about 2 minutes of relief and then it seemed worse than it was before i tried the strip.</li>
            <li> I have stopped eating anything cold (ice, ice cream, slushes, smoothies, shakes, etc) because it killed me to do so.  </li>
            <li> Have you ever seen one of those terribly over exaggerated infomercials where the consumer is cringing in pain as they eat ice-cream or drink hot coffee?</li>
            <li> I usually have sensitivity eating really cold things, and I tend to get canker sores.</li>
            <li> I can usually eat cold fruit and ice tea for 3 days before having to use the strips again.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s extremely painful and it lasts for a few minutes which seems like an eternity when it&#x27;s happening.</li>
            <li> They are to small and impossible to put into place and even if you get them close they won&#x27;t stay.</li>
            <li> In fact, it worked so well that I realized that the sensitivity had been masking other areas of sensitivity (crap).</li>
            <li> but it is difficult to apply as the strip is slippery.</li>
            <li> Still really expensive</li>
            <li> A bit difficult to handle.</li>
            <li> They are difficult to use, because they slip around in the mouth unless you hold them in place.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical</li>
            <li> I suppose a dentist or dental assistant could do it, by a mere mortal</li>
            <li> Not impressed.  </li>
            <li> I even got my skeptical husband to try them and he is HOOKED.  </li>
            <li> worst part is that they actually made my teeth HURT.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately, I have not had the chance to try these since I have not had sensitivity since receiving the sample.  </li>
            <li> They&#x27;re so expensive that you hate to waste one or two while you&#x27;re trying to get the hang of it.</li>
            <li> So, that lasted for a while, it was an uncomfortable 5 or so minutes of the 10.  </li>
            <li> This is something I’ve always struggled with and it seems to get worse in the summer with all the cold drinks, ice cream and frozen summer treats.</li>
            <li> These strips work to numb pain or cold sensitivity on teeth where the gum exposes a tiny bit of the dentin at the base of the tooth.</li>
            <li> Not perfect</li>
            <li> The one issue that I have with this is that it can be tedious to apply.</li>

            <li> I read and followed the directions as stated on the box. I really wanted this product to work because drinking cold liquids really bothers my teeth.  I applied the small strip to my gums.  It moved around a lot more than I thought it would or should.  Secondly, I got no relief.  My reacton to cold is no different after applying the strip to what it was before applying the strip.  I&#x27;m going to apply another strip and see if that helps.  Six come in a box so I have five more chances.</li>
            <li> WARNING, this caused me significantly worse tooth pain.  I have had some sensitivity in a lower left molar for many years.  It started after a gold crown was put  in. Cold, heat and pressure all cause me pain.  I have used Sensodyne to good effect, but this sounded like it was worth a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At about 6:30 PM, I put it on my gum line for 10 minutes then waited an additional 30 minutes to brush my teeth.  There was no notable effect until 4:00 AM when I woke up with a toothache that would not let me go back to sleep.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been disappointed with products in the past, but this is the first time something actually did the opposite of what it was advertised for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The tooth ache is still there, I hope it goes away.  Crest says this thing works for 30 days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am thinking about writing a letter to the FDA</li>
            <li> Worked well on sensitive tooth but it is difficult to apply as the strip is slippery. The strip is small but works well. Will have to see how it works in the long run.</li>
            <li> &amp;#34;I received a free product for the purpose of my review. Opinions are 100% my own.&amp;#34;  I have teeth sensitivity occasionally and usually I just don&#x27;t chew on that side of my mouth to keep it from hurting.  The Crest strips helped the pain stop and allowed me to be able to chew on both sides of my mouth!</li>
            <li> Crest&#x27;s Sensi-Stop Strips have practically changed my life. Before I was sent the strips complimentary to try from Crest, I had serious teeth and gum pain when I ate cold foods (like Cherry Garcia ice cream) or drank orange juice (which I absolutely love in the mornings). I am definitely going to purchase the Crest Sensi-Stop Strips again in the future and if you have teeth sensitivity, you definitely should as well!</li>
            <li> I was so excited when I saw a commercial for these strips, as I have several very sensitive teeth at the gum line on one side of my mouth.  When I got them, I immediately tried them, I was so excited.  Followed the directions precisely, absolutely no change in sensitivity whatsoever.  They say if there is no change, try them again after one day.  I am going to try them again today, but I don&#x27;t really expect results.  It is disappointing to me because sensitive toothpaste and mouthwash only goes so far.  This seemed like the perfect solution but it just did not work.  Will update my review if multiple applications do work, but right now I&#x27;m upset that I am out the money for something that did nothing.</li>
            <li> Just bought these today.  I am sure they will work but I already have an issue.  Unlike the whitening stripes that stick VERY well on your teeth this strip does not.  If you can&#x27;t get it to stay in place how affective can it be?  Regardless I need some extra help with my teeth sensitivity.  I&#x27;ve eaten and drank certain foods that have stripped my toothpaste sensitivity fighting agents away.  I also had some dental work that I must now use a special mouth wash for a few days and I think is stripping it away further.  Please Crest, you better work.  The price tag is horrible too.  I had a $3 off coupon I used today at the store.  Still really expensive but when your teeth feel bad they know they have you!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I put the strip on my bad teeth it instantly hurt but only for a moment.  I hope it is already working!</li>
            <li> I was about to go to the dentist and demand a root canal. I was even going to arrange it around my hectic work/school schedule. I had a filling redone and have had horrible sensitivity in that tooth. I was at the point where breathing in cold air hurt. Used one of these puppies and have been close to pain free since. I had to hold it on my tooth for it to stay in place, but after the pain I was in (crying out while drinking water!), I don&#x27;t care. These things work!</li>
            <li> I would give this product 5 stars because it&#x27;s so effective, but my goodness the strips are tiny. I bought them because I experience torturous pain for several days after using Crest&#x27;s whitening strips (yes, even the &amp;#34;gentle&amp;#34; kind) so I bought these to use immediately after using the One Hour Express Whitening strips. I guess I didn&#x27;t look closely enough at the picture on the package, so I found the strips to be ridiculously small. I have general tooth sensitivity as well, but it&#x27;s all over - not in super tiny spots. Anyway, I had to use all 6 strips at the same time to cover the entire area the whitening strips did. Since the protection lasts for a month this worked out, but I hope Crest will seriously consider making a longer version of these strips that can reach both first molars in an average adult&#x27;s mouth. It felt a little silly to have 6 different strips on at once. But besides the size issue, they worked incredibly well for my intended use! For once, I could whiten my teeth without throbbing pain for three days afterward!</li>
            <li> I was fortune enough to receive a trial pack from my dentist.  I have very sensitive teeth and it was painful to eat ice cream or drink something very hot. I noticed a small difference after the first treatment. and a little more after the second.  I think I&#x27;ve used it 5 times and i have hardly any problems.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Downside: Personally I didn&#x27;t notice immediate relief and it took multiple treatments (months) so see a drastic improvement. I&#x27;m also not sure how long it would take after I stopped doing the treatments for the pain to resurface.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend it for a long term use . It&#x27;s not a miracle drug but is effective.</li>
            <li> garbage. does not work at all. used 4 of them on the same tooth and got no results at all. still very sensitive. They are also a pain to apply to the back of your mouth</li>
            <li> Expensive for this irregularly effective</li>
            <li> I had a great deal of trouble getting the strip into position near rear teeth.  I also had trouble getting it to adhere and stay in place.  The instructions tell you that, if you accidentally mess it up, just use another strip.  At such a high cost per strip (up to $6/strip depending on where you buy them), this is terrible advice.  The tiny little strip, with gel on one side -- much smaller than event the smallest band-aid -- is hard to manipulate and it&#x27;s very easy to fold it over by accident, rub the gel off, or generally just fail to get it to the spot needed.    The idea of a one-treatment approach is great, but they need a better delivery mechanism, something that is easier to place onto wet, rear gums.  I will not be buying this again.</li>
            <li> OK, but they are very hard to get to stay in one place.  I would not order them again for the price. I am trying the Colgate Pro-Argin toothpaste now.</li>
            <li> They are a bit tricky to put on but they work great.  Very helpful!  And much longer lasting than anything else I have tried.</li>
            <li> Can not get these things to stay on my back tooth. Worthless.</li>
            <li> A bit difficult to handle. Need some sort of tool to actually apply, and when it was applied, it did not remain where it was placed. Has been up and down for about 5 minutes now. Will advise if it actually works.</li>
            <li> They are difficult to use, because they slip around in the mouth unless you hold them in place.</li>
            <li> These are not as easy to apply as they indicate.  The strips seem to begin dissolving immediately before you can even get them placed and they definitely do not last up to 30 days.  I would have been happy for 3 days.  Took the plunge and spent the money seeking immediate pain relief and wish I hadn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> Dont waste your money :its all packaging no product ..Strips d</li>
            <li> My dentist gave me a sample of these to try. I did two treatments of this, but it still did not do the job. It only minimized it slightly but for me it&#x27;s just not worth to buy a full pack. I think this will only work for people with a slight problem with sensitivity. I need something a little more powerful than these though.</li>
            <li> I purchased these first from my local grocery store (and they were much more expensive than on Amazon, figures) and then again from my dentist (also more than Amazon... what was I thinking?).  I had extreme sensitivity on my back teeth and two dentists I had gone to previously couldn&#x27;t figure it out, leaving my only option to be a root canal (according to them - quitters). Before I did that, however, I wanted to explore other options.  That&#x27;s when I discovered these strips o&#x27; wonder, as I have come to call them.  I haven&#x27;t used any type of tooth strip before, so the first time I used this, I was slightly confused because I&#x27;m an idiot.  However, it&#x27;s really not hard at all to figure out.  Plus, they&#x27;re completely worth it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You are supposed to apply one strip around the gum line of the area that is sensitive (usually sensitivity is caused by a receding gum line that exposes the otherwise unprotected root portion of your tooth - this statement is true because it&#x27;s on the Internet).  Then, you leave it on for 10 minutes, take it off, and continue about your day (not eating or drinking within 30 minutes of removing the strip).  For me, I decided to do them at night, after I was completely ready for bed (and having already brushed my teeth, as the instructions recommend).  I started with 10 minutes per strip, doing the main area where I had noticed sensitivity.  I didn&#x27;t talk or move my mouth much while the strip was on as they moved around slightly when I did so - decreasing the efficacy since I wasn&#x27;t keeping the area covered the entire time.  After 10 minutes, I took them off and promptly passed out in bed.  The next morning was my first true test of how the strips had done.  I woke up, got a glass of glacier-like cold water, and proceeded to drink it, preparing for the satanic slaughter of my teeth as I had so commonly experienced after trying to enjoy a beverage that was not lukewarm temperature; you know, like actually putting ice in water and drinking it.... I shuddered at the thought.  But lo-and-behold, the sensitivity strips had activated a force field that protected my teeth from the rebels of Luke Warmness (with no vulnerable exhaust ports)!  And, as advertised, I didn&#x27;t feel the need to patch up the chompers until after about a month.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is one thing that I noticed that made the strips work even better for me: The first three I applied every month, but the last three I applied on the same night (10 mins a strip, take off, reapply new strip for 10 mins, repeat - total 30 mins per affected area).  This worked even better!  The sensitivity was completely gone for over 3 months.  So my advice to get the most out of these strips:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Use them before you go to bed, after having gotten completely ready.&lt;br /&gt;- Apply three in a row, to the same sensitive area, ten minutes each.&lt;br /&gt;- While you are waiting on the strips to work their magic, read a book, watch a tv show, contemplate your life, stress about holidays with the in-laws, or do some other activity that doesn&#x27;t require much mouth movement.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These have worked wonders for my sensitivity and I highly recommend them.  Also, schedule a dentist appointment if the pain continues, as it could be more than just a receding gum line (e.g. a cracked tooth).  AND FLOSS YOUR TEETH, LAZY (I suggest doing it while taking a shower in the morning; makes it not seem as bad because you&#x27;re being doubly productive!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sent from my phone, so apologies in advanced for any autocomplete blenders.</li>
            <li> This is a miracle product. As soon as the strip touched my tooth I got relief. And it has lasted for 3 weeks so far. Easy to apply, no side effects for me, fast results too. I am amazed. Years of using expensive sensitive toothpaste is over. Thanks to the invented.</li>
            <li> I have temperature sensitivity in most of my front teeth. Over the course of several days I followed the directions and applied all 6 strips to the front and back of my affected teeth. I noticed virtually no reduction in sensitivity even immediately after application. A few days later it was like I had never used them at all. I was very disappointed. I&#x27;ve also tried Dentemp Senzzzzz Away Tooth Desensitizer with similar poor results. Only Colgate Pro-Argin toothpaste has been able to provide any relief.</li>
            <li> They do work with a few tips I&#x27;ve found to increase effectiveness, use in conjunction with a daily sensitivity toothpaste, don&#x27;t use with whiteners, keep packs inside crush resistant case, help keep gel on strips, dry sensitive area with q-tip, after applying strip use dry qtip to ensure complete contact, after removing strip the longer you keep from eating or drinking the better the results for me.</li>
            <li> They don&#x27;t stay where I put them very good.</li>
            <li> Did not work. Actually increased sensitivity. Ended up buying toothpaste and mouthwash with argine. That worked.</li>
            <li> These strips are so tiny and sticky--they stick to everything but the gums and teeth.  I had to try 6 strips just to get one to half way stay in place, and even then, it was kind of wadded up in a ball.  Practically impossible to use effectively due to design flaws.  I was really wanting these to work, and hope a more effective application method becomes available.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been dealing with sensitivity due to overzealous brushing for years on end (slightly eroded gum line).  I like to put one of these on when I start to feel any sensation coming from that area.  I find the strips provide immediate relief that lasts far longer than they promise.  I do use a sensitivity/enamel strengthening toothpaste daily and get biannual fluoride treatments, both of which likely support/increase the effectiveness of these.  That all said, I did find that, despite this routine, these were a very happy discovery.</li>
            <li> One strip yielded results for about a week for me. Does what it says, but does not last as long as expected.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in so much pain! It&#x27;s unbearable. ..the strip made it worse..I&#x27;ve been up for hours  trying  to get the pain to go away..</li>
            <li> Dentist gave me these to try. I am glad they were free because they didn&#x27;t help me one bit.</li>
            <li> After seeing my dentist, and ruling out a more severe problem than just sensitivity, he suggested that I try these in addition to sensitive toothpaste--before we have to go a more dramatic route to get my tooth to a more manageable state.  He said about 50% of people find these to be effective.  I have actually found these to be irritating to the gum tissue, and not at all helpful.</li>
            <li> I got these for free from Crest to trial. SO I gave these a try the night before a big party. I figured there would be enough foods that have caused me sensitivity in the past to give them a fair try. I brushed my teeth (with sensitive toothpaste as always) and then stuck them in while I surfed the internet right before bed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They were hard to get into position, especially as my sensitive teeth are at the back on my molars. Well after a few attempts I got them where I wanted and went to waste time on the internet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I kinda forgot about them, getting wrapped up in my pre-bed time entertainments. So in total they were in there for like 30 min. I took them out and went to bed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The next day I feasted and had a great time. I forgot about even putting the strips on the night before or that anything at all was different. I guess that is the biggest compliment I can give these little strips, I forgot about them. I did not have any tooth sensitivity even with typical foods that cause me issues such as ice cold sugary beverages and ice creams. Hot coffee that I usually sip slowly and carefully did not slow me down at all. The foods did not faze me at all. I forgot I was supposed to have pain upon eating these foods. No pain, nothing. I just went about my day and forgot about the strips or sensitivity or anything.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not sure how long the effect will last as it has been less than a week since my first application of them. I am now finding other teeth that are sensitive since my typical problem teeth are no longer problems. I may have to use more of them on my other teeth.</li>
            <li> When I review a product I not only look at how well it works but how easy and convenient it is to use. There are good and bad points to this product. I&#x27;m not big on strips to begin with but since this is a New Scientific Breakthrough as far as tooth sensitivity is concerned I figured I&#x27;d give them a shot. The good is these may be considered convenient in a sense it only takes 10 minutes per use and produces immediate results as far as tooth sensitivity is concerned. Also the product has a Satisfaction Guaranteed promise, where within 60 days, if you are not satisfied with the product Crest will send you a Pre-paid card in the amount of your purchase, which I view as a plus, so no complaints there. Also the package came with some good coupons for the strips and for toothpaste.</li>
            <li> I bought these strips as a last ditch effort. I suffer from extreme sensitivity to sweets. It&#x27;s extremely painful and it lasts for a few minutes which seems like an eternity when it&#x27;s happening. This is a miracle product!! I used them as directed and I tested it out by eating chocolate the next day and to my surprise…no pain! I thought it was a lost cause when the dentist didn&#x27;t know how to help me. My only issue with this product is the application process. I thought it would be more like the crest white strips but instead its a small gel strip that you peel off and have to carefully place along your gum line/teeth. I honestly went through all 6 strips because I messed up on most of them except for 2. But other than that, this is a great product!</li>
            <li> I honestly can&#x27;t say these did the trick with tooth sensitivity.  They are very small and a bit difficult to fit onto your teeth when trying to cover more than two.  You will need to use all six, say 3 on top, and 3 on the bottom.  The sensitivity was relieved for a few days, but definitely reappeared after 10 days.  I&#x27;m not crazy about these even though I was optimistic and excited at first.  They may work better for you than me.   I did receive this product to test so I didn&#x27;t know the actual cost of the test product</li>
            <li> I really wanted to like this product. I have a couple of areas that are prone to sensitive with cold liquids above my canines. Unfortunately, this didn&#x27;t really help with the problem at all, not even for a day or two. Based on other reviews, this might help some people with some issues, but my experience was this didn&#x27;t help at all. Just to try and test it better, I tried one side and not the other to see if there was even a hint of a difference. I tested the second side eventually and still found no release. I can&#x27;t say I am entirely surprised as my dentist didn&#x27;t have much to offer except some temporary expensive glue along the gum line that only worked for a little bit.</li>
            <li> These consist of a wide, rather hard and sharp, plastic strip with a small stripe of gel on one side. You place one in your mouth on the gum line, outside of the tongue area, next to the aching tooth and leave in place for ten minutes. The instructions do not say to trim the plastic strip to fit, but in actual use, it was necessary to trim the strip in order to get the strip in place and have a comfortable fit for an aching  lower molar.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These worked very well, my son (30 years old, lives with me because he is disabled) had a tooth ache two weeks ago, we used one of these and his tooth hasn&#x27;t bothered him since, but it was awkward to put in place, after one failed attempt of him trying to put a strip, we resorted to trimming the wide plastic strip before removing the backing and I put on a pair of disposable medical gloves and put the strip in for him.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommended the product and think it would be a great addition to any home medicine cabinet or first aid kit</li>
            <li> Easy to apply with minimal prep involved (you basically affix a strip to the tooth in need of soothing and let it sit for 10 minutes) these strips are good for medium grade and below tooth sensitivity issues. As far as results go your mileage will vary but I do have one tooth in particular with mild, persistent issues whenever it comes into contact with ice. The strip does tone done the sensation by approximately 50% in my estimation so not necessarily an insta-cure but good enough to be noticeable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Couple of things to keep in mind - each strip is very small and will cover 1 or 2 teeth each. The strips also do not &#x27;stick&#x27; very well to the tooth so you&#x27;ll need to be patient during the 10 minutes of application and try not to talk or move your mouth around. Also, I really like the convenience of having each strip individually packed making it easy to keep one in your bag/wallet while you&#x27;re out and about should you ever need one.</li>
            <li> I really wanted this to work for me. I have a tooth that is super sensitive to cold. I applied the strip according to the directions: Brushed my teeth, waited 5 minutes, applied the strip for 10 minutes, and then waited 30 minutes before eating or drinking.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I decided to test it with a drink of really cold iced tea. At first I thought, Yay! The sensitivity is gone, and then a split second later, the sensitivity was back. I was rather disappointed. So, it helped relieve sensitivity for a fraction of a second. I really wanted this to work so that I could go back to enjoying cold treats.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Perhaps, I need to just apply a second strip to the area, This kit comes with six strips, that are supposed to each deliver one month of sensitivity protection (so ideally, if you have one sensitive area, this kit should have you covered for 6 months).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Application was fairly easy, and the strip stayed in place.There was no weird taste or anything.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really like the concept of these strips, they just didn&#x27;t work for me.</li>
            <li> I received a free product for the purpose of my review. Opinions are 100% my own. My mom and I both used this because we have sensitive teeth and this worked so amazing for us both! I&#x27;m happy and I will be purchasing this :)</li>
            <li> I will start off by stating that I got a free 6 treatment sample from Crest. This has in now way altered my opinions on this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have very sensitive teeth and I mean, extremely sensitive. They are also very thin and delicate (thanks to white strip abuse) and they also now chip very easily. They hurt when I drink ice water, hot foods, pretty much everything bothers them. I was skeptical that a strip could provide month long protection for my tooth sensitivity - especially because I use an expensive $30 toothpaste for my tooth sensitivity that helps, but does not make the pain go away completely.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After reading the instructions (they are really easy to understand and follow), I was able to use the strips with no problem. I was easily able to place them (pretty quickly) and they did not bother me at all. I actually find it pretty easy to put them on during my drive to work.  I have to say, after the first treatment, I did not notice really any difference. After I did the second treatment two weeks later, I felt no pain whatsoever when drinking cold water. We keep most of our drinking water cold so it has always bothered me but I was shocked that I felt nothing. I had to drink it a few different times to confirm, but I no longer felt any tooth pain! I was skeptical so I have tried other things that before bothered my teeth, like hot foods and ice water and although there is a slight pain, it is NOTHING compared to how badly it was before the strips.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am seriously in love with this product now. I only have one more treatment left from my free sample I but will definitely be buying more!!</li>
            <li> Thank&#x27;s to Sensi-Stop Strips I can finally enjoy my beloved Ice Cream again. You know that feeling when you bite in a Ice Cream Sandwich and it starts hurting right away because your Teeth are too sensitive?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well, I had this before, so I was really curious receiving this Product from Crest. I opened the Package and put the Stripe on my most Sensitive Teeth. Just to be sure, I waited a couple of Minutes, went to the Freezer and bit right into a Ice Cream Sandwich.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You know when something magical happenes in a Movie? The Sound they Play?&lt;br /&gt;Well, play that Sound in your mind and think of a real Satisfied Man biting in his Ice Cream Sandwich.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That is how i felt, the strips don&#x27;t disturb you at all, you almost not notice them ... But the Result? Magical...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you Crest for this .. I now can enjoy my Ice Cream again...</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s like the senszzzzz away gel put on a small strip.  Leave on for 10 minutes and remove.  It works but I prefer the gel alone, I brush it on, pop in my Invisaline and go.  It would be more convenient if it was a disolving strip.</li>
            <li> I wore braces for several years as an adult and one of the most alarming things was my new sensitivity to cold. (I managed to get over the sensitivity to jalapenos.)  I used to love ice cream.  I used to chomp on ice chips.  But when my braces were on, I had to microwave ice cream - even though I have previously made fun of people for doing that.  Sometimes Karma just turns around and bites.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was looking forward to the braces coming off for a lot of reasons but at least one of them was to chomp on a popsicle.  OOPS.  NOPE.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was really hoping these Sensi-stop strips would work.  My dentist suggested using them again -- after she repairs a fracture in a tooth -- to see if it would help.  She also wants to know.</li>
            <li> My wife and I both suffer from tooth sensitivity at times, but we usually only use Sensodyne when problems arise, as we don&#x27;t care for how the toothpaste foams (or doesn&#x27;t).  This of, course, leads to problems because it can take days for the toothpaste to work.  Enter Crest Sensi-Stop strips.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These things have been fantastic!  In all, the &amp;#34;treatment&amp;#34; takes about 40 minutes (10 minutes after applying, 30 before you can eat or drink anything), but it really does work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As an example, my wife and I were out for dinner one night and she bit into her ice cream and was hit with a sudden pain in her front teeth.  We went home, she applied a strip, and an hour later her tooth was just fine.  The last time something like that happened, her tooth hurt for over a week, even with going back to the sensitive toothpaste.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only complaint I have about this product is the price, which is a little steep for only six applications.  Still, when you&#x27;re talking about sore teeth and gums, it&#x27;s a small price for almost instant relief.  Crest Sensi-Stop strips are fast and simple, and because they come in individually wrapped applications, you can keep one in your bag or toiletry kit for when you&#x27;re out.  We&#x27;ll likely buy more when we run out, which for me, means five stars.</li>
            <li> I got this product for free as part of the Influenster program. Sensi-Stop Strips are a great remedy for sensitivity at home. They work so similar to the whitening strips so it was a familiar process. I do wish they game in bigger strips as most of my teeth are pretty sensitive, so i almost use a whole box to get all my teeth. (thats why I took away one star) The strips did make my sensitivity less heightened. I did not expect this product to work wonders as it is an over the counter product, but it did lessen sensitivity enough to make it comfortable to eat and drink. I would purchase this again for a quick convenient treatment.</li>
            <li> This product is awesome. It doesn&#x27;t take very long. It is not messy and works a great deal better than toothpaste to treat sensitivity. I would recommend this product to anyone. It is very affordable and is worth the money spent. I was given a free trial of this product to review and I honestly love it!</li>
            <li> I seen immediate results after I tried the free sample that Smiley360 sent me so I used the coupon that I also received and got me more and my bottom teeth has not been no where as near as sensitive as it was, I can&#x27;t believe how fast these Crest Sensi-Stop Strips really work</li>
            <li> I usually have sensitivity eating really cold things, and I tend to get canker sores. I actually used one of these to cover a canker sore and it helped quite a lot. I don&#x27;t know if that is what they are intended for, but it worked pretty well.</li>
            <li> For 10 minutes of your time to have a thin strip on your teeth you can enjoy cold and hot food and drinks again.  No longer will tooth sensitivity be a concern for you.  There is no bad taste associated with the Crest Sensi Stop strips and it is very easy to apply to the surface of your teeth.  The only downside I have found is that it does not work for a full month.  For me it worked only about 2 weeks, but those were two weeks I was able to enjoy food I have not had in a long while. I #GotItFree from Crest thru bzzagent.</li>
            <li> I had high hopes for these strips. I have minor sensitivity on one tooth near the gum line, and I had hoped this would allow me to have cold drinks on this side of my mouth. SO far I have used them 3 times, and I barely have noticed any change at all. Had I not knowingly administered these strips myself, I likely would not have noticed any improvement at all. They did not make things worse, but I would not buy them again as they do not decrease my cold sensitivity, even with following all of the directions precisely each time.</li>
            <li> These may work for your front teeth, I don&#x27;t know. But they are so small and flimsy that there is no chance to attach one to a back tooth. I ruined three that way at $3.00 each!. I suppose a dentist or dental assistant could do it, by a mere mortal hasn&#x27;t a chance. Save your money.</li>
            <li> I used all the toothpaste that claimed to help with sensitive teeth…believe me this is the best product I have ever tried…..with this product on the market…I now can use any toothpaste I want.</li>
            <li> This product works great. I had a sensitive tooth for 3 months and the dentist that treated it twice did not fix the sensitivity but this product worked with 2 treatments, in a score of 1 out of 10 I rate it a high10.</li>
            <li> I love the new Crest Sensi-Strips that I got for free to try from Crest, They are so easy to use and long lasting results. I now can enjoy my favorite Ben and Jerry&#x27;s ice cream without all the pain. Tooth sensitivity is a thing of the past! Thanks Crest!</li>
            <li> They are too small and way to hard to get to stay in place.  My bothersome tooth is in the back and it never got to where it was needed.  There is no stick at all and after a few tries I couldn&#x27;t tell if the correct side was on my tooth.  Once I finally got it to the back tooth I had so much spit in my mouth that it just slip around.  $20 down the drain.</li>
            <li> I have a tip for those people that are having difficulty applying the strip.  I used a clean pair of tweezers that I ran through the dishwasher first.  I got the strip in place on my back tooth on the first try.</li>
            <li> I have suffered from sensitive teeth for a long time. I was excited to try the Sensi-Stop strips for free to see if they would help with my sensitivity. They are easy to use,have no funny aftertaste, and the sensitivity and pain were gone for awhile. I love these strips. I would highly recommend, and have already recommended these to others.</li>
            <li> I can mot thank Crest enough for sending me this item free to try. It has improved my sensitivity to a point I never thought possible. If tooth sensitivity is holding you back from enjoyong food or drinks you love, give this product a try. It will not disappoint!</li>
            <li> I got my strips free from Crest and I love them. I have tried many sensitive teeth toothpastes and none have worked. I didn&#x27;t have much hope in the strips but I tried the strips and was amazed. I have been able to use ice in my drinks again, eat candy and sweets, but most important for I enjoyed a milkshake for the first time in years. This is a product that works and I couldn&#x27;t be happier. The fact one strip can last up to four weeks is amazing.  I changed mine after three weeks because I didn&#x27;t want to risk losing any of the effectiveness. It was still working after three weeks for me and this time im wearing it until it wears off so I know.</li>
            <li> A few years ago I was head butted by a pit bull while volunteering at an animal shelter. No damage according to my dentist but I do suffer from occasional sensitivity in the area where I was hit. I&#x27;ve used specialized toothpaste but the transient nature of the sensitivity makes it hard to justify.  These tabs do seem to provide relief. They are small and adhere without issue. Leave them on for ten minutes and abstain from eating or drinking for another half hour. The effect is supposed to last for up to a month.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So far these have provided relief and  are as effective as the toothpastes. They don&#x27;t cover a large area and it takes some dexterity to get them in harder to reach places. I would check with a dentist first to make sure the problem tooth isn&#x27;t crack or cavity. But all in all, a fast and effective way to get some relief from sensitivity.</li>
            <li> Ordered this in hopes of helping alleviating tooth sensitivity quickly by direct application strips, It did not work and I was totally disappointed for the unnecessary expense I incurred for nothing. By the way these 6 tiny strips are hard to apply and keep in place against the teeth.</li>
            <li> Until Crest comes up with an easier way to use the strip, don&#x27;t waste your money. All the medication comes off on your finger before strip can be put in position. Basically you need a dental assistant with dental tools to get the strip in place with the medication intact. Although the medication may work, it&#x27;s a terrible design.</li>
            <li> This actually works! It&#x27;s a little expensive, but it helps.</li>
            <li> I received these as part of a promotion, the 6 pack. After using just 2 strips I was very pleased with the results! LOVED these strips will definitely buy them again. Makes it easier to drink coffee in the morning and ice cream at night!! 4/5 Stars :)</li>
            <li> The worst part about sensitive spots on your teeth and not being able to enjoy the foods you love or carefully deciding what you can have. I always envied those individuals who could just bite into something cold! The thought of doing it myself gave me goosebumps, and not the good kind. The Crest Sensi-Stop Strips were so easy to use, just 10 minutes! And who wouldn&#x27;t give up 10 minutes to eat something that they have not been able to eat. For me it was something cold...ICE CREAM! I knew that would be the sure fire test. I use Sensodyne religiously to help with my sensitivity and while it keeps it from getting worse, I do not see any relief. So after I used the Sensi-Stop Strips,mi successfully ate my favorite ice cream sundae pain free!!!! And it was worth the calories and tasted amazing! I was grateful to get the Sensi-Stop strips free from Crest.</li>
            <li> Crest sent me a free sample pack of Sensi-Stop Strips to try and give my feedback.  I struggle with receding gum line and tooth sensitivity daily.  I especially have sensitivity with sugary foods. I wear a bite plane every night.  I brush my teeth and swish with mouthwash MULTIPLE times a day to relieve my teeth sensitivity.  If any food sits in there very long, I have pain.  I&#x27;ve tried toothpastes for sensitive teeth but I never feel like they get my teeth clean so I never use them long enough to see if they work.  I am a doctor and I have a terribly busy schedule.  I just don&#x27;t have time to dedicate to a long dental ritual every day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, I was really excited to try this product because you use it for 10 minutes one time and that&#x27;s it.  It&#x27;s super easy.  You get 6 strips in a box.  They are very easy to put on and take off.  The strips are about an inch long. You place the strip over the sensitive area.  Leave it on for 10 minutes and then take it off and don&#x27;t eat or drink for 30 minutes.  It&#x27;s supposed to last 30 days.  Well, it does help, but for me, it did not last 30 days.  I have multiple sensitive spots and so I have to use multiple strips (one for each area of sensitivity).  The first strip I used gave me about 1 week of relief.  The sensitivity relief from the second strip seemed to last about 5 days.  I do like them because they are easy and quick.  My sensitivity problems are beyond what most people experience.  I would say that if these strips help for a week or so then they would help someone with more minor issues much longer.  I would recommend them to any one with sensitivity issues.  They do work.  They are quick and easy to use.  They have lasting results and it&#x27;s not a daily ritual.  I like that.</li>
            <li> Bought some today.  Not impressed.  Didn&#x27;t last a minute.  I have really sensitive teeth.  I can&#x27;t eat ice cream and must drink with a straw.  I tried these today and really was disappointed.  I get better results using a .97 football mouth piece from walmart and filling it with sensodyne.  I use sensodyne every day and I am still sensitive.  Once in a while I want something iced cold and it messes my whole mouth up.&lt;br /&gt;These strips are not my answer.  I will stick with using a mouthpiece a few times a month and sitting with toothpaste in my mouth for as long as I can - over this 20.00 crap.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have super duper sensitive teeth, only minor sensitivity. I tried these out for free, for the purpose of my review but my opinions are 100% my own. I thought these strips helped, but no better than the sensitive toothpaste. I mean-you&#x27;re not going to go drink hot coffee while eating ice cream if you have sensitive teeth, and these aren&#x27;t going to make it possible. They do however cut down on the sensitivity a little bit. So, if you prefer strips to the toothpaste, this is the way to go. They&#x27;re easy to apply. I received a free product for the purpose of my review. Opinions are 100% my own.</li>
            <li> My teeth have become sensitive to cold over time. I received Sensi stop strips free from crest to try and review. They are easy to use and very effective, however if you have sensitivity in you back molars, it is hard to get the strip to stay in place.</li>
            <li> Have you ever seen one of those terribly over exaggerated infomercials where the consumer is cringing in pain as they eat ice-cream or drink hot coffee? When I would eat certain foods (ice-cream, strawberries, cold grapes, spicy food, etc.) I felt like the actor from the infomercial. My face would get contorted.&lt;br /&gt;When I ate cold grapes I would have to put them in my mouth and hold them in my cheek like a chipmunk to warm them up before I could take a bit and not be in pain. The benefit was that I ate slower but I looked like a weirdo while doing it.&lt;br /&gt;When I received my free samples of Crest® Sensi-Stop Strips as part of my bzzagent kit, which are packaged similar to the crest  white strips, I was so excited to try them that I failed to read the directions carefully I attempted to shove the entire plastic strip in my mouth…do not do this. The Crest® Sensi-Stop Strips are not applied the same way as the crest white strips.  Not only is the plastic piece too large to fit in a normal sized mouth but it also is sharp around the edges. After promptly removing the large piece of plastic from my mouth I decided to read the instructions. The second attempt went much better and the relief was instant.&lt;br /&gt;After approximately two weeks I needed to apply another strip in a similar location to keep the tooth pain at bay. It has been two weeks since I applied the second strip and the relief is still holding strong. The Crest® Sensi-Stop Strips are a terrific invention. I have used toothpastes and mouthwashes made for sensitive teeth and none of them hold a candle to the instantaneous and lasting relief of the Crest® Sensi-Stop Strips. I cannot say enough good things about them.</li>
            <li> Crest Sensi-Stop Strips provide temporary relief to my teeth and gum that is sensitive to cold food, like ice cream. The relief provided is about 1 week only. Wished the relief provided is longer than 1 week. Works great overall and easy to place between your teeth and gum. No taste to the strip, which is great as I don&#x27;t like things applied to my teeth and gum to have taste. Overall great product. Would recommend for anyone that have cold sensitivity for their teeth and gum.</li>
            <li> I have been using these strips for the last few weeks and I must say my opinion is mixed. To their credit, my teeth are generally very sensitive so there is quite the hurdle to give me relief. However, I guess I was expecting a tad bit more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I cannot really even break this down into low/high points because there really are only two.&lt;br /&gt;Good: The strips reduce the sensitivity of (one) sensitive tooth of mine&lt;br /&gt;Not as good: it only works on one tooth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other thoughts: The strips are very small and hard to handle especially since they are technically a sterile product. Makes it pretty difficult to get the gel from the package to the tooth without touching the gel on the strip.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall I would say good product, it does work as advertised without too much deviation. Considering the price though, the cost of entry is a bit high.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was fortunate to get a free trial of this product as part of a promotion from Crest.</li>
            <li> This product is amazing! I&#x27;ve never found one that truly did help my tooth sensitivity like this! It&#x27;s so easy to use, not gummy or sticky. It&#x27;s invisible, so no one else even sees it on your teeth! Wonderful! I got it for free from bzzagent.com!!</li>
            <li> I have never seen strips for sensitive teeth. I have very sensitive teeth so I was very happy to receive these for a review. I tried these as soon as I got them in the mail. I tried it on my bottom teeth that were hurting at the time and they really do work. My bottom teeth stopped hurting for about a half an hour before it wore off and they started hurting again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m hoping that after using them for a while the effects will last longer. I will definitely keep you posted if there is any change.</li>
            <li> Sensitive teeth are no match for these strips! I tried these strips free from Crest® I have horribly sensitive teeth and these strips seemed to strengthen my tolerance toward my sensitive foods. I even got to enjoy ice cream with whipped topping!! Huge success for me!  Easy to use, do not slide around.  Small enough to use anywhere!  Excited to make a future purchase!</li>
            <li> I had a really bad sensitive tooth that prevented me from having anything hot or cold without much providing annoyance. I didn&#x27;t have any cavities as I recently just had my annual checkup and cleaning. I guessing it might be due to my receding gum line. I tried Crest Sensi-Stop strips and they really work. It is applied to the sensitive area just like their whitening strips. The box states that it provides relief for up-to a month. I&#x27;ve only used one of the strips and it has provided relief for more than weeks already. I highly recommend this product if you are dealing with tooth Sensitivity.</li>
            <li> These seem to actually work. They help bring down tooth sensitivity a bit more effectively that just tooth sensitive tooth past. They&#x27;re more concentrated, and you leave them in your mouth for a longer period of time (10 minutes). They are just small strips, meant for applying to portions of your mouth. It&#x27;s not a whole mouth piece for all your teeth. The directions mention it might take a few treatments to get the desired level of sensitivity relief, with at least one day between treatments.</li>
            <li> These strips provide temporary relief, but not a long term solution. They&#x27;re &amp;#34;okay&amp;#34; as far as strips go, if not slightly uncomfortable to wear, but they do the job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* I recieved these free from Crest to review. All opinions are my own.</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t normally spend the money on an item like this since i already have a drawer full of teeth sensitivity products that didn&#x27;t stack up. However,  I was lucky enough to get this product as part of a promotion from Crest and was not disappointed!  I used 2 strips over 2 days in one area and have had almost no feeling of sensitivity in that area going on a month now! Definitely recommend.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Only drawback is that they only come in one small application size. Multi sizes would be a great update!</li>
            <li> These strips are amazing! My teeth can sometimes become sensitive when drinking cold products, but using the Crest Sensi-Stop Strips, for just a few minutes, soothes the sensitive feelings that cause pain. I was able to try them FREE from Smiley 360...thanks!!! This is a GREAT product!</li>
            <li> After years of using sensitive teeth toothpaste and only having relief for a few hours at best, it was getting frustrating, trying to enjoy hot and cold foods and drinks. The fact that the toothpaste taste last as long as the relief was annoying to say the least.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then I used Crest Sensi-Stop Strips and there was NO taste, and I have had relief for 4 weeks before needing to apply another strip. It only takes minutes for me to get weeks of relief! The fact I get long acting relief plus no toothpaste taste has permanently made me a loyal user of Crest Sensi-Stop Strip for LIFE!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received  Sensi-Stop Strips free from Crest®! Thank you Crest for consistently being a company that delivers products that help make my life better.</li>
            <li> I was pleasantly surprised with these strips. I deal with a lot of tooth sensitivity and also have dental emergencies a bit more often than I would like. While I have thankfully not had one of the latter to deal with recently, I have tried the strips for cold sensitivity and had quite good results. I got about a week of reduced pain, this certainly would be very helpful for situations that I regularly deal with like a damaged filling or chipped tooth, which don&#x27;t quite rise to the level of a dental emergency but are certainly uncomfortable to live with. I&#x27;m not sure I would use it routinely just for sensitivity but it would be helpful if I knew I was going to be doing something like having ice cream or something else where the sensitivity is more of an issue.</li>
            <li> Did not lower sensitivity at all.  Real waste of money.</li>
            <li> As I have gotten older I have noticed increased sensitivity to my teeth when eating cold or hot foods. These strips were very easy to use and it&#x27;s effective which is a great thing. It&#x27;s been almost 2 weeks now since I applied them and I am still getting relief. This product went above and beyond my expectations.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#34;I received a free product for the purpose of my review. Opinions are 100% my own.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> I did not think that this product could be anywhere close to what it was advertised.  I have tried every sensitive relief toothpaste out there and have been disappointed in all of them.  Even though wearing the strips is annoying, it&#x27;s SO WORTH IT!  I was asked to review this kit by bzzagent in exchange for free strips and initially I was so skeptical.  I can say without a doubt the past month has been amazing.  I can drink cold soda without flinching, take a bite of something hot and not even notice it.  I even got my skeptical husband to try them and he is HOOKED.  Without a doubt we will continue to use these.</li>
            <li> I received these strips to try for free free from Crest. The Crest Sensi Stop Strips are way more effective than any toothpaste I&#x27;ve used for sensitive teeth. This product works quickly and the sensitivity relief lasted me 2-3 weeks. I never got 4 weeks of relief, but I didn&#x27;t expect to. My only complaint is that the strips are short and I had to use multiple strips to get all of my sensitive teeth. It can get pricy. I have already purchased more.</li>
            <li> DID NOT WORK FOR ME. GOOD LUCK.</li>
            <li> i have tried all kinds of things to avoid the dreaded cringe of eating or drinking cold items. So skeptical at first, but luckily it was easy to use, took 10 minutes &amp; did better than anything else I&#x27;ve tried. Ice cold stuff, look out, here I come!</li>
            <li> Crest Sensi-Stop Strips are an ingenious new product! I have sensitive teeth on my lower, right teeth. I was very impressed that the Crest Sensi-Stop Strips stopped the sensitivity to not only ice cream, but to cold drinks as well! I received my free Crest Sensi-Stop Strips, thanks to my mission with Smiley360. I could not be any happier with these Crest Sensi-Stop Strips. I can now eat and drink what I have shied away from, for so long. THANK YOU Crest Sensi-Stop Strips, and Smiley360! My review and opinion are my own.</li>
            <li> I love this product.  It has helped my most sensitive tooth better than any toothpaste could do.  You just put it on the sensitive tooth and it works if you use likes you are supposed to.  It was easy to use and the directions were easy to follow. I would definitely recommend it.  I was able to try this product free thanks to Crest.</li>
            <li> These are amazing! I have super sensitive teeth and I have not been able to bite in to a popsicle in years. This all changed when I tried Crest Sensi-Stop Strips! I love them! Super easy to use and really effective! I enjoy cold and hot beverages now and I could not be happier with these! I received a free product for the purpose of my review. Opinions are 100% my own.</li>
            <li> I received a free sample from Buzzagent and they worked great on my tooth sensitivity.  I have been able to eat sweets and drink cold beverages.  I am able to enjoy my favorite treats now that I have used the strips.</li>
            <li> I am super thrilled for all the reviewers for whom this thing worked !! Did nothing for me :( Not even a slight improvement. May be it applies only to certain causes of sensitivity and not all.</li>
            <li> I was very happy with this product.  I have suffered tooth sensitivity for several years now, and for a variety of reasons.  I liked that the treatments/strips didn&#x27;t need to be used daily like the white strips do...you use them as needed.  I found great relief in the strips and WILL purchase them again...I do wish they were a bit cheaper...that&#x27;s my only complaint.  &amp;#34;I received a free product for the purpose of my review. Opinions are 100% my own.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> I got a sample of this product from BzzAgent and was very impressed with the sensitivity relief that the these strips provide but its at a cost. This product is excessively packaged - I was shocked at the amount of waste for 6 tiny little strips. Although they work and provide relief they are costing us in other ways.</li>
            <li> I tried this product on a sensitive upper left tooth in the back of my mouth. It was the furthest tooth back in my mouth since my molars had already been extracted. The strip was hard to place back there so I used the end of a toothbrush to help. But I didn&#x27;t notice much of a change in sensitivity at all. The instructions don&#x27;t tell me to repeat if necessary so I didn&#x27;t know if I should repeat the procedure due to any dangers of over-exposure. But I did it anyway, just in case I hadn&#x27;t placed it appropriately. At that point I noticed a difference, a big one. So make sure you place the strip appropriately, even if it&#x27;s on a hard to reach tooth.</li>
            <li> These Crest Sensi-Stop Strips 6 Treatments are a blessing for those suffering from sensitive teeth, but they can be difficult to apply and require some time to get them right. I have cold sensitivity that reduces my enjoyment of ice cream (a personal weakness) so have been using toothpaste that has reduced my sensitivity but not eliminated it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These are strips that are applied for 10-minutes and, as expected you need strips for each side, but the overall reduction of sensitivity is nothing short of amazing. I can now enjoy ice cream without cringing if the cold strays on one of my bad teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly Recommended!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CFH</li>
            <li> These little strips are about 1 1/8” X 3/8”. They are long enough to cover about 3 teeth. They are easy to apply and they adhere well. I noticed a lot of the reviewers complained that they don’t stay in place. I did not have that problem. I think that if you apply the strip, close your mouth and don’t talk, eat, or keep touching  the strip with your tongue, you will have a better chance of it staying put. You are supposed to leave them in place for 10 minutes and you can’t eat for 30 minutes. I have had a problem with sensitivity to cold as I have gotten older. I think my receding gumline is the main problem. I was hoping these strips would work, but I can’t say I noticed much difference after using them.</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t work very well, easy to use. I ended up needing a root canal so maybe I just had too much damage for them to work</li>
            <li> These Sensi Stop Strips actually work!! I used one strip and a month later it&#x27;s still working! Crest sent me the strips to try out and I will be purchasing more in the future. They were easy to use, less hassle than a daily toothpaste and had actual results! I recommend these to anyone with sensitivity that is looking for a working solution to be able to enjoy all of those long lost food items!!</li>
            <li> Wow! These are amazing! I have exposed roots from grinding my teeth in my sleep. I used one of these and the pain I felt was decreased dramatically. I feel SO much better now. I can even eat and drink without as much pain. It doesn&#x27;t completely take the pain away but it certainly reduces it to a much more tolerable level. I would definitely recommend these to anyone with pain from exposed roots.</li>
            <li> As someone who has sensitive teeth, I was glad to be able to try Crest Sensi-Stop Strips. (I recieved a sample to try for free but my opinions are my own.) This product came with 6  easy to apply strips. I was able to keep a few in different places such as the bathroom and my purse, so the convenience was great. It made the need for a sensitivity toothpaste obsolete which was nice. The only draw back was having to wait 10 minutes and it only covers a small area. I only have issues with my front teeth so that wasn&#x27;t an issue for me but others might have a larger area of sensitivity, which might be bothersome. The packaging says it lasts up to a month and I don&#x27;t think it lasted that long but again not a problem for me.&lt;br /&gt;On the whole, Crest Sensi-Stop Strips worked great and I think this will be a great product to keep on hand.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive teeth! They give me&lt;br /&gt;Trouble with everything from cold temperatures, hot temperatures and even to sweets.  I&#x27;ve tried several Sensitive teeth toothpastes in the past with little to no relief. I tried tbe Crest Sensi-Stop Strips and found a blessing!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With a simple small gel strip applied directly to the sensitive area (mine is my lower front teeth) for 10 minutes I was able to eliminate almost all my sensitivity! It isn&#x27;t 100% gone but I can drink coffee or tea or even drink ice water or bite a Popsicle without that sharp jolting pain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yes, you will salivate a bit more than usual when first applied, but it subsides after a couple minutes. No eating, drinking or brushing for 30 minutes afterwards though so don&#x27;t do this when you are expecting to do any of those! I used them while doing chores around the house.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks to Smiley360 who gave me this product FREE for testing and honest review purposes, my experience is 100% my own and since everyone is different, you may have a totally different experience!</li>
            <li> There is a much better option out there [[ASIN:B00B9GFQR6 Colgate Sensitive Pro-relief Pro-argin Toothpaste]]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has an ingredient called Pro-argin. Usually in the US this is dental visit only offering at $50 to $100 bucks a pop and you need to repeat every 1 to 2 months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BUT... in other countries it&#x27;s an over the counter toothpaste... luckly you can find it imported on Amazon for about $10. Unlike Potassium Nitrate (in this Crest product) which only dulls nerves, the Pro-argin actually blocks the &#x27;tubes&#x27; in the enamel of your teeth. Use the toothpaste for a week and it&#x27;s like night and day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This completely Pro-argin Toothpaste *** completely solved *** my sensitivity. I know it may seem like over the top praise, but I had trouble eating a cupcake or drinking wine and this made a black and white difference. I have no link or interest in Colgate, just a happy user.</li>
            <li> Go get a fluoride treatment at your dentist office instead!</li>
            <li> Very good product but a bit difficult to apply.</li>
            <li> While the strip did work on my one tooth with an exposed root, I only got relief from hyper-sensitivity for about 7 days. While I guess that falls into the \\&quot;up to one month\\&quot; as the package suggests I did expect relief longer than a week. Makes the product fairly expensive for the amount of relief experienced.</li>
            <li> I received a pack of these to try out for free and they are crap.  They just would not stick or stay in place long enough to do anything.  I even put them on and didn&#x27;t touch them with anything and still just fell right off.  They are also super small so if you have a large area of sensitive teeth well they will either cost you more money cause you&#x27;ll have to use more strips or are just not worth the effort.  Love Chrest hate these strips, try again Chrest.</li>
            <li> My wife has some sensitivity and tried this to get some relief. The whole process is pretty simple and just requires applying it to the sensitive area and leaving it on for 30 minutes. The instructions tell you to no eat, rinse or brush for 30 minutes after removing the strip from your mouth. If you don&#x27;t get results from that, then wait a day and try it again. The package comes with six strips.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wy wife said she got \\&quot;some\\&quot; relief after the first application and then tried another a week later when the area was bothering her again. That has helped some more. Then several days later she used another. Perhaps by the time she has used all six strips ther will be some longer benefit. Some help, even if for a short time, is good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since pain and what it takes to relieve it is seemingly different for everyone, the only way of knowing what will help is to try different things. This could be of help.</li>
            <li> I received the Sensi-stop strips free from Crest and used them on am area where I recently had a crown placed. I noticed results immediately. I like that they are easy to apply and last for quite some time. I just applied my second strip a few days ago and it&#x27;s been about 6 weeks since I put the first one on. It&#x27;s not an absolute cure-all but it does help for every day sensitivity issues.....like drinking ice water for example. I am pleased with the product.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive lower teeth. I have used these strips and found them to work will. I do wish they lasted a bit longer. They say they can last up to one month. I found the to las more around a week. I&#x27;m am still happy with the sensitivity relief for that week. I received a free product for the purpose of my review. Opinions are 100% my own</li>
            <li> I received a free package of Crest Sensi-Stop Strips for purpose of testing and review from BzzAgent - these opinions are entirely my own. I&#x27;ve tested these out twice, and I&#x27;m happy with the results! I have very sensitive teeth, especially on the left side of my mouth. It is a pain sometimes to eat ice cream, which I love. I tried out one of the strips - and I got fast results. It&#x27;s easy to use, and just takes 10 minutes. It stays on well until you take it off, which surprised me. The next day I had a cold smoothie, and already the sensitivity had decreased tremendously!</li>
            <li> I highly recommend Crest Sensi Strips!  I suffer from tooth sensitivity due to hot and cold foods and my whitening regimen, and these stop my sensitivity!  I can eat any foods and there are no sensitivity issues.  They&#x27;re easy to apply and no weird taste. I was able to try this free with bzzagent! Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I was given the chance by Smiley360 to try this product for free and I was immediately interested! My teeth are SO sensitive they are literally painful to the slightest touch in certain areas. This Product made it really easy. I really liked the fact you only had to apply it for 10 minutes, I&#x27;ve never been the most patient person and I&#x27;ve always avoided products that seemed to have a lot of prep work before hand. The strip went almost unnoticed!</li>
            <li> These Strips work better than expected! They were easy to use and only need to be done for 10 minutes once a month. The flavor was not too bad as I was sort of worried about that. I have used a sensitive toothpaste in the past and have had more sensitivity after using. I did not have that issue with these. I can now eat cold and hot without the issues of sensitivity. Would recommend!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received a free product for the purpose of my review. Opinions are 100% my own.</li>
            <li> I absolutely recommend Crest Sensi Stop Strips! My teeth are very sensitive to cold foods but with this, I can eat ice cream again! I&#x27;m so glad I got to try these free from Crest. I&#x27;d definitely recommend these to anybody else suffering from tooth sensitivity.</li>
            <li> I have to say, I never thought there&#x27;d be a day when I could just apply a sensi-stop strip and have my sensitive teeth be fixed, but the day has come!  I have a couple of teeth on the right side of my mouth that are very sensitive to cold, so I haven&#x27;t eaten ice cream in a long time, and when I do I have to suffer through my cold treat if I ever forget to keep the ice cream on the left side of my mouth.  After using a sensi-stop strip, I bravely ate a spoonful of ice cream...and it was heaven!  Or close to it.  My teeth didn&#x27;t feel like I just bit down on a piece of dry ice.  Instead, it just felt like eating ice cream used to, back when I had no teeth problems.  The only reason I am giving these a 4/5 star rating is that wearing the strips is a bit uncomfortable for me, but the relief they give is well worth it.  Please note: I received the product as part of a promotion from the brand (and from BzzAgent).</li>
            <li> This product does work and if you are having tooth pain I would recommend getting it because tooth pain can be unbearable for some people.  The think I didn&#x27;t like about this was that you only get 6 tiny rectangle patches, I would say 1/2 inch long and 1/4 inch wide.  This barely covers one tooth.  I just assumed that they would be large strips like the whitening strips, but they weren&#x27;t.  Like I said before though, they are worth it if you are in pain.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t stop my tooth pain with these strips.&lt;br /&gt;I have a tooth that had a deep cavity filled that never really healed.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve had more X-Ray&#x27;s done  months after the surgery and the nerve looks good.&lt;br /&gt;Was hoping these were going to work but I&#x27;m not feeling any different..&lt;br /&gt;This product probably was not intended for this type of tooth sensitivity issue so it may not be the products fault.&lt;br /&gt;I most likely will have to have a root canal done; Bummer!</li>
            <li> Since using Crest Sensi-Stop Strips, I have been able to eat and drink foods, and beverages that I have avoided for years. With only one strip, I could tell a noticeable difference. We actually went out and had shaved ice, which I usually turn down because it is too painful. I&#x27;m even back to drinking my favorite fall beverage - Pumpkin Spice Latte. I can&#x27;t believe these strips really last a month. They&#x27;re amazing!</li>
            <li> Crest Sensi-Stop Strips worked for me. I was very skeptical of if they would work on my sensitive teeth, but with a free trial promotion from Bzz Agent I decided to giver them a whirl. I was also worried about the application process being messy or time consuming. However, Crest Sensi-Stop Strips were very easy to apply and only took ten minutes to apply. It was easy apply strip then wait ten minutes. The best part was they actually worked. I could enjoy ice cream and coffee for the first time in years. I highly recommend this product to the point I got my husband to let me use his Amazon account to write this review.</li>
            <li> After my first use of Crest Sensi-Stop Strips that I got free from Crest, I noticed a huge difference.  The morning after I placed my first application, I was able to eat cold cereal without any sensitivity.  Something I haven&#x27;t been able to do in years.  I am several days out from my first application and I can still tell a huge difference in my teeth.  I can finally eat some of my favorite foods again!</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s only so much Sensodyne I can take -- luckily, Crest Sensi-stop strips came along. I could definitely tell a difference in one use. I have a sensitive spot along the gumline that isn&#x27;t bad enough for the dentist to need to crown or do a graft so I&#x27;ve just been having to deal with it using Sensodyne. I would still need to be careful drinking anything too hot or too cold -- but after using a Sensi-stop strip, I was able to enjoy hot coffee on that side for the first time in a long time.</li>
            <li> I received a complimentary box of these from Crest for testing purposes.  I was really looking forward to these strips for my sensitive teeth.  They are similar to Crest whitestrips in appearance except smaller.  They do NOT perform the same.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These strips are nearly impossible to keep on.  There is almost no stick to them so they just slide all over and don&#x27;t form to your tooth.  I couldn&#x27;t even talk with them on without it trying to fall out of my mouth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The value isn&#x27;t what I thought either.  Since the strips are small you can really only do a few teeth at a time.  If you have sensitive teeth that are not directly next to each other you could end up needed a few strips everytime you treat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The worst part is that they actually made my teeth HURT.  They throbbed for a good few hours after taking the strips off...you know that deep aching toothache throb?  Yeah, that&#x27;s the one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Whats the deal?  Crest products are usually amazing, but this one, they really dropped the ball. :(</li>
            <li> I got Crest Sensi-Stop Strips complimentary from Crest and I&#x27;m so glad that I was able to try it for free.  Finally I found the product that works for my sensitive teeth. I can eat everything without being afraid to feel pain and to have sensitivity to hot or cold food. Thanks @Crest, #GotItFree</li>
            <li> I have been struggling with two wisdom teeth that have intense intolerance for cold. One had a moderate improvement after a few months using Crest Pro-Health, Sensitive + Enamel Shield toothpaste.  The other --- none.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have spent the entire summer unable to enjoy my favorite iced beverage --- southern style iced tea.  When trying to drink it, I used a straw, trying to contain the liquid to one side of my mouth.  Not easy, but I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;m not the only one who has tried this maneuver.  Enough already!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Apparently, the bottom wisdom teeth are close to the soft palate, where the gum protection is not as tough as elsewhere in the mouth.  Then, I tended to over brush, like crazy,  because wisdom teeth are so vulnerable to decay.  That said, they have been protesting.  Both were recently examined with no outstanding findings.  It was a matter of figuring out how to decrease sensitivity, more effectively.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unexpectedly, I had the opportunity to use and review the Crest Sensi-Stop Strips.  I had never even heard of them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, here&#x27;s what happened.  I had total relief of discomfort from the less bothersome tooth, within 10 minutes, as advertised.  With my gangster tooth, I only had a subtle improvement.  Hm, I thought.  What now?  Well, I read the information more thoroughly and if you don&#x27;t have success the first treatment, \\&quot;you may treat again --- allowing one day between treatments.\\&quot;  The second treatment did the job.  I&#x27;m, once again, able to drink iced beverages.  The sensitivity is not completely gone, but not uncomfortable enough to affect my enjoyment of iced beverages, or even ice cream. And, we&#x27;re going on a little over three weeks since application.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Be aware that you are not to use this product if you suffer from bleeding gums, or loose teeth.  If you have a history of kidney stones.  You are pregnant, or breastfeeding.  You are under the age of 18.  You are allergic to any of the ingredients listed.  I&#x27;m assuming that would be the primary ingredients:  Dipotassium Oxalate, Carbomer, Sodium Hydroxide, Sodium Benzoate, or  Potassium Sorbate.  I don&#x27;t have the product box listing ingredients for my &#x27;sensitive toothpaste,&#x27; but I&#x27;m assuming if you can tolerate such, you&#x27;ll be okay with this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t award five stars because I did have to use the product twice and there is still a slight bit of pain. Also, the strips are really small and a little difficult to maneuver, particularly way back in the mouth. For those who have several bothersome teeth, it could get a bit expensive to keep them at the desired comfort level.  But, if you&#x27;re suffering and none of the contraindications apply to you --- I recommend you give them a try.:  Dipotassium Oxalate, Carbomer, Sodium Hydroxide, Sodium Benzoate, or  Potassium Sorbate.  I don&#x27;t have the product box listing ingredients for my &#x27;sensitive toothpaste,&#x27; but I&#x27;m assuming if you can tolerate such, you&#x27;ll be okay with this product.

            <li> I was impressed with the sensitivity relief from the strips.  I was able to enjoy foods I haven&#x27;t been able to in a long time.  They&#x27;re a little awkward to use, but overall performed as promised.  Thanks to Crest for letting me try the strips.</li>
            <li> These work wonder on tooth pain, period! Forget the Oragel these strips by Crest are amazing at relieving pain AND se nsitivity. I used them for a tooth ache and the pain was gone for at least 2 weeks.</li>
            <li> I noticed a difference the next day, after I used these.  I used it on one side of my mouth, on my lower back teeth which is the most sensitive spot in my mouth.  The next day, I put cold water in there and swished it around.  It was still sensitive, but I didn&#x27;t have the screaming sensitivity that I usually have.  I think with continued use, this can dramatically minimize the sensitivity.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The strips are kind of hard to get off the sheet.  I wasn&#x27;t sure if I was doing it right, and there weren&#x27;t any instructions.  You have a big sheet of plastic with a little piece of the sensitivity strip in the middle.  You have to peel that part off, but it doesn&#x27;t come off easily.  It is a little tricky to do.  I didn&#x27;t notice a taste.  You aren&#x27;t supposed to eat or drink for 30 minutes after you use them and you only leave them on for 10 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am going to try these a week before my next dental cleaning, in January.  If I notice a difference, I will come back and change my review to 5 stars, and you will all be hearing about it!  For now, I recommend giving these a try.</li>
            <li> I ordered this product because my teeth are sensitive to cold. I have a hard time with cold fruit most of all. I have not found a toothpaste that has done the job these treatments have done. I have found that my sensitivity has been reduced and the application of the strips is very easy.</li>
            <li> These strips helped a lot!  I have sensitivity to both hot and cold.  They lasted for a while but eventually the sensitivity returned.</li>
            <li> This is a really great product, I used it and my teeth are feeling great! This is something I will use more often and it really works! I was super amazed! &amp;#34;I received a free product for the purpose of my review. Opinions are 100% my own.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> I received a free product for the purpose of my review. Opinions are 100% my own.&lt;br /&gt;Crest Sensi-Stop Strips for Tooth Sensitivity are medicated strips, similar to tooth whitening strips, that are applied to the gum line for long-term relief of tooth sensitivity. The first thing you need to do is located the affected teeth, as the treatment is applied to a small area. The strip is applied for 10 minutes, then removed, and your teeth need to remain untouched for an additional 30 minutes for the full effectiveness. The strips work very well if you have a specific area affected by sensitivity. A box contains 6 strips, so they don&#x27;t seem meant to treat all of your teeth. The effectiveness of the strips, according to the product, should last up to one month. This seems to be closer to the two week mark in actuality. My overall thought on this product is that it works great if you have a specific area to treat. The medication is effective and works pretty quickly. I would probably stick with sensitivity toothpaste for my overall tooth sensitivity, but I would definitely use this for spot treatments.</li>
            <li> I received a free sample via smiley360.  Unfortunately, I have not had the chance to try these since I have not had sensitivity since receiving the sample.  I look forward to getting a chance to try them!</li>
            <li> I really wanted to try Crest Sensi-Stop Strips because I have really sensitive teeth. I knew I would be able to tell right away if it was working because my teeth are sensitive every day. After using the first strip, there was no relief and I was disappointed but I read in the instructions that it could use another strip the next day if you still have sensitivity. Well, I didn&#x27;t want to wait until the next day and about an hour later, I went ahead and used a second strip. Now, this time I did notice a tiny bit of relief. I was surprised by that but still wished it were stronger. I think the product works but you probably will have to use more than one strip for each tooth. I don&#x27;t like the fact that these are so short either. I expected them to be the length of the Crest White Strips or other strips like that. These are more like a small patch that covers about 2 teeth or maybe 3 small teeth at the most. I think these strips could definitely be stronger since 2 gave me a tiny bit of relief but with 1, I never noticed any difference. I plan to use a third strip to see if I can make the sensitivity go completely away. I do like the fact that these are supposed to last 30 days. It hasn&#x27;t been a month yet so I don&#x27;t know if that is true. I still think these can be good for people who don&#x27;t have as sensitive teeth as mine. Just wish they made each strip stronger or longer so they covered more teeth. These can be quite expensive for just 6 little strips (patches) so I feel like I should get more for my money. Especially if I have to use 2 or 3 strips just for one tooth. Starts to not feel worth the money. Nevertheless, this product should work decent for people who do not have as much sensitivity or their sensitivity is minor. I received a free product for the purpose of my review. This is my honest opinion.</li>
            <li> Sensi-Stop eased the pain of exposed root on my tooth because of receding gum line.  I expected it to be for porous enamel, but it treated my problem quite well. A very welcome pleasant surprise!</li>
            <li> I have super sensitive teeth and the sensitive toothpaste helps and so does anbesol(sp?) but nothing seems to help enough....till now!  The sensi-strips are amazing. It is so wonderful to actually have very little to no pain at all!!  The only small problem is trying to figure out which tooth is the correct one so you get the best pain coverage possible!!</li>
            <li> Pretty much worthless. They are to small and impossible to put into place and even if you get them close they won&#x27;t stay. I can&#x27;t say if they work of not because I couldn&#x27;t get them where they needed to be. Really sorry I wasted the money on these things.</li>
            <li> Garbage!  These strips are so tiny and fragile that they&#x27;re almost impossible to apply.  I wasted three just to get one to stick, and that one didn&#x27;t do diddly squat to desensitize my tooth.  The three that were wasted slipped around in my fingertips, folded in half and finally crumpled into nothing.  Imagine wetting a piece of toilet paper and trying to stick it onto the side of a tooth in the back of your mouth.  Yes, that&#x27;s exactly what this was like.  Total waste of money, and my tooth hurts just from the irritation of trying to put it on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For $18, you&#x27;d think Crest would make these things bigger and easier to work with, but nooo.  Stingy b@st@rds!</li>
            <li> Rip-Off and way Over-priced, hard to apply. Just get Anbesol for $6 bucks. Anbesol works better and you get more of it for just $6 at Wal-Mart, or any drug store. With the tube of anbesol, it should get you 30 or 40 usages rather than 6.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Crest Sensi-Stop strips are hard to apply and only has 6 strips. Each strip has such a small amount of medicine on it, it&#x27;s amazing that Crest would get away selling it for so much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The sensi-strips are very difficult to apply and most of the small amount of medicine gets on your fingers, not on your gums.</li>
            <li> Have a tooth that has a little root exposed at the gumline. Been about a month &amp; no pain yet!</li>
            <li> Product arrived as expected.  It works but as with anything new, there is a learning curve.  You must be patient trying to get them to not slide from the designated spot.  I also recommend drying the area first with a paper towel to get rid of any excess moisture so they don&#x27;t move.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t work any better than just brushing teeth with sensitivity tooth paste even once.  Save your money and just use the toothpaste.</li>
            <li> I have sensitivity from regular whitening so i gave it a shot. I got about 2 minutes of relief and then it seemed worse than it was before i tried the strip. Not to mention that are almost impossible to place correctly. I would recommend saving your money and seeking real treatment from a dentist.</li>
            <li> The Crest Sensi-Stop worked great for my occasional sensitive teeth.  I found them easy to use.&lt;br /&gt;I received a free product for the purpose of my review. Opinions are 100% my own.</li>
            <li> Great product. Will take a few weeks to see how it works, but I have sensitive teeth, and it hasn&#x27;t made them worse, so fingers crossed. YMMV, of course.</li>
            <li> The Crest Sensi-Stop Strips worked to well I literally had no sensitive areas in my mouth after using them and I was able to brush my teeth with regular tartar control Crest toothpaste. I highly recommend people with sensitivity to try this product which I received a free sample of from smiley360.com</li>
            <li> I was not sure that these would work. I have tried so many different things to ease my tooth pain. I put one of the strips on and within just a few minutes it was working. I finally had some relief. It was kind of strange feeling to have the strip on my tooth and it did slip a few times. Besides that, it was one of the best products I have used for tooth pain. I received a free product for the purpose of my review. Opinions are 100% my own.</li>
            <li> Not necess to try yet</li>
            <li> I got to try a free sample of this product from Crest.  I was a bit disappointed that it wasn&#x27;t the cure that I was hoping for, but the product did reduce my tooth sensitivity a noticeable amount.  I would recommend this product for thise with more severe sensitivity due to the cost.</li>
            <li> I received these free as a promotion from Crest and I am so impressed. These strips stopped my tooth sensitivity for a whole month with only one ten minute treatment. They are easy to use and so convenient. I would recommend these to anyone who has sensitive teeth. After trying a lot of products this one is by far the best.</li>
            <li> I have always had issues with tooth sensitivity and was excited to try Crest strips out when I received the offer from Smiley360. The Crest strips helped the pain stop and allowed me to be able to chew comfortably!  I never thought I would see that day again and fixed with such ease as a applying these strips and no trip to the dentist. With extreme sensitivity to hot or cold, everything has to be lukewarm and cold drinks are even less enjoyable at mealtime. However, after using the Crest strips I can enjoy many things especially ice cream that I haven’t been able to in such a long time. This is a product I highly recommend for anyone to try with tooth sensitivity! Disclaimer: I received a free product from Smiley360 to try and review without any compensation.

            <li> I&#x27;m post-chemo.  Two doses did not work for me.</li>
            <li> My back tooth is sensitive.  Can&#x27;t get stip to stay on my back tooth.</li>
            <li> Impossible to apply, impossible to use.  There is no way you will get this to remotely resemble staying in place, not for 20 seconds, let alone 10 colossal sized minutes. Blank will freeze over before you could administer this to stay in place.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know about for teeth that are more toward the front of your mouth but save your money if you need these for a molar. Every time I positioned it on my tooth, it&#x27;d move when I closed my mouth and stick onto my cheek. I&#x27;d rather a tray and gel.</li>
            <li> These are impossible to apply. The small strip, with the medication on one side, comes on a large plastic sheet. When you remove it from the sheet it is very soft and floppy. I imagine it would be fine to apply to teeth that are towards the front of the mouth. But if you have to apply them to molars, watch out. That floppy strip folds on itself in a nanosecond and you&#x27;re toast. They&#x27;re so expensive that you hate to waste one or two while you&#x27;re trying to get the hang of it. I hope Crest looks at reviews every now and then. They really need to rethink this product. The medication is helpful, if you can finally get it to the right place.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t help my tooth.</li>
            <li> Gave three stars because while the product might work well, I couldn&#x27;t get the tiny little strips situated on my back molars so I&#x27;ll never know. The strips are so small, they&#x27;re most impossible to position on any of your back teeth and once you get them wet with your tongue, they move around you don&#x27;t even know which side has the treatment. If they had made them the same size as crest white strips, I would be giving them five stars</li>
            <li> fast shipping, as listed</li>
            <li> If I could, I&#x27;d give these a 3.5 but I&#x27;ll go with 4 because I did get some good results.  I bought these yesterday as one of my lower molars was super sensitive to sweet and cold things.  Put it on for the 10 minutes like it said....what I wasn&#x27;t prepared for was that the strip to actually create the type of pain that I was hoping to alleviate. So, that lasted for a while, it was an uncomfortable 5 or so minutes of the 10.  But I can say, that the strip worked for the sweet sensitivity. I had come chocolates for valentines day and when some of it got onto that tooth, I didn&#x27;t have the zing that I had previously.  It didn&#x27;t work so well for cold, though. The tooth is still sensitive to that, but less so.  I&#x27;ll check back in in a month to let anyone know if the treatment lasted for the 30 days they say it may (tho on the packaging there are a lot of disclaimers around that).  EDIT: It&#x27;s March 14th, the sensi strip lasted for less than 2 weeks, maybe 10 days.  I haven&#x27;t reapplied yet,  but I would actually only give this product a 3 star rating.</li>
            <li> I was very surprised these they work great</li>
            <li> I noticed absolutely no improvement to my tooth sensitivity after using these strips. Many reviewers say it helped them. But for me it was a complete waste of money.</li>
            <li> Every so often I&#x27;ll switch from my favorite toothpastes to Sensodyne. I have two areas that periodically are sensitive, the dentist confirmed that it&#x27;s just a sensitivity and not an issue with the teeth.&lt;br /&gt;Never have I seen this product at my local store, so was happy to test it out.&lt;br /&gt;Crest certainly knows about oral care, this product is easy to apply, and most importantly, it works. Unlike the Sensodyne, it works right away. Very pleased to have found a new way to address a common problem</li>
            <li> A recently replaced filling has become the sole sensitive spot in my mouth. The dentist assures me that with time the problem should lessen, if not resolve all together, but when offered these new strips, I jumped at the chance to try them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It took some time to figure out how to release the strips from the packaging but after that there was no problem. There is no taste and the steps are easy -- leave them in place for ten minutes and then wait 30 minutes before eating or drinking.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The relief is noticeable, and although not completely gone, a definite improvement, and, after ten days the effect is still holding. The packaging claims the relief could last up to a month, I thought if it made it through ten days I&#x27;d be impressed, it did, and I am.</li>
            <li> I received these free to try and review.  The Crest Sensi Stop Strips are easy to apply, work quickly and really eliminated my sensitive teeth pain.  I am exited to have found this item and will for sure be ordering them before I run out of them!</li>
            <li> After I had an episode of  very uncomfortable pain along my gum line. I visited my dentist. He did the usual tests to determine if I needed a root canal: checking my reaction to hot and cold temperatures , taking x- rays etc. The results were inconclusive and I was told this is possible in the early stages of root inflammation and infection and because early  infections don&#x27;t always leave traces on x- rays.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My dentist DID see signs of potentially temporary (and less severe) issues, including gum regression and some related redness. He suggested I try the Sensi-Stop strips as well as a toothpaste made for sensitive teeth. I  jumped at the chance to get a free sample of the Sensi-Stop Strips.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line: they worked and gave me pain relief until my irritated gums healed. In my situation, it turns out the pain had most likely been due to eating too many acidic foods as well as a temporary surge in heartburn (from unusual stress) which allowed excess stomach acid to be pushed into my mouth. This led to gum irritation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Sensi-Stop Strips eased the pain and inflammation and as my stress and heartburn eased the gum irritation became minor- and then disappeared. When I revisited my dentist he saw significant improvement and no sign that I needed a root canal. We&#x27;re still taking a \\&quot;wait and see\\&quot; approach for now. I&#x27;m relieved to be free from any immediate need for a very expensive dental procedure.  Of course there are no guarantees that things will remain so positive but my dentist says I could be fine for years ( again, based on x-rays and additional procedures).</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if I was the ideal candidate for this product, but I thought it was worth a try.  I have had sensitivity to heat and cold in one tooth ever since I had a lower bridge replaced.  I&#x27;m not sure what my dentist did, but I didn&#x27;t have that problem before.  His suggestion was to have a root canal, but then, he is a dentist.  I opted for trying this first.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The instructions said to put the strip on the outside of your gum line.  Unfortunately, my sensitivity was far greater on the inside, so I tried to put the strip there.  It was really difficult to get it on the inside of the tooth/gum area because it is near the back of my mouth.  The strip kept moving around and I finally gave up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried putting it on the outside of the gum line as the instructions said.  It was pretty hard to keep it in place there as well.  I think the farther back it is, the harder it is to keep in place.  I did manage to keep it there for at least 10 minutes, but I didn&#x27;t notice any difference.  Perhaps it was because it was so hard to keep it there or because this was not a good application.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think the idea is a good one.  By having the medication on the strip, it keeps it from staying on your gums longer than recommended.  For the right application and for teeth more in the front, it seems like it is worth a try.  If it works, it is much better than a root canal.</li>
            <li> Do you suffer from sensitive teeth?  This is something I’ve always struggled with and it seems to get worse in the summer with all the cold drinks, ice cream and frozen summer treats. I’ve tried several different solutions over the years without much luck, but one new product that’s available is giving me hope at putting a stop to my sensitive teeth issues.  An easy to use new product, Crest Sensi-Stop Strips is available to treat sensitive teeth right at home. I’ve just started using Crest Sensi-Stop Strips and they really are making a difference in the pain that I feel. ^_^</li>
            <li> These strips work to numb pain or cold sensitivity on teeth where the gum exposes a tiny bit of the dentin at the base of the tooth. Sometimes acidic foods can irritate this area and cause sensitivity. These strips are very easy to use. You just press one of the straps against the tooth and gum that is hurting and leave it in place for 10 minutes. I was really surprised that this actually worked and continued to work for several days. I am on the seventh day now and my tooth feels just slightly sensitive again. I do eat a lot of acidic foods and drink kombucha which is kind of sour so that may contribute to the strips not lasting as long. But I still think they offer a definite benefit and start to work quickly. It Is a product that I will keep on hand from now on.</li>
            <li> There are a few of us in our family that suffer from sensitive gums and this product has really helped!</li>
            <li> I really love these Crest Sensi-Stop Strips because they are easy to use and really relieve the pain in my teeth. Ever since I was little I have had sensitive teeth, especially to the hot and cold food and drinks I use, so these strips take all of that away. I like that the strips are flexible and easy to apply and I noticed my teeth were less sensitive after the first use. There are a few applications in the box that really help take away your sensitivity in your teeth. I received a free product for the purpose of my review. Opinions are 100% my own.</li>
            <li> I received these Crest Sensi Stop Strips for giving my honest feedback on websites. My kit contained what is pictured here, 6 Crest Sensi Stop Strips. I have very sensitive teeth. About 6 teeth on top, and all of my bottom teeth are sensitive to cold foods. I tried using one strip on my upper back teeth, and the strip covered about 3 teeth. The pain relief was great! Much better than toothpaste. I&#x27;m rating this 4 stars because for someone like me, who has many sensitive spots, these strips are not too practical. I&#x27;m happy with the relief I got, but it would take several strips to rid my whole mouth from the sensitivity. I would recommend this product to someone with just a few sensitive teeth.</li>
            <li> This product couldn&#x27;t possibly be easier to use. Open package, slap on teeth, wait 30 minutes before eating. Done. But does it work? Absolutely! I have a few generally sensitive teeth and one extraordinarily sensitive tooth in one small spot (my doctor assures me it isn&#x27;t a cavity, but man that thing hurts). On the generally sensitive teeth, one treatment made my teeth feel like they were brand new again! No pain, even with coffee or iced drinks. In fact, it worked so well that I realized that the sensitivity had been masking other areas of sensitivity (crap). As for the intense spot, it worked really well. Not perfect - I could still feel it after one treatment, though it was much more muted. After two treatments, however, it was nearly gone. If I really try I can feel it but for the most part, it is like it is gone. I intend to keep the Crest Sensi-Stop strips in my medicine cabinet at all times, they are amazing.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a member of Smiley360.com, where I qualify to try brands for free in exchange for sharing my authentic feedback.  I was so excited to be a part of this trial because I have extremely sensitive teeth.  First off, these strips are very easy to use and seemed to adhere well to my problem area.  You wear the strip for 10 minutes, in which time I felt a promising tingling sensation to let me know it was doing it&#x27;s&#x27; job!  In the first 24 hours I didn&#x27;t seem to notice much of a difference, but after the first day or so, I definitely feel much less sensitive in the problem area I had applied a strip to!  The directions indicate that protection can last up to one month, and I am hopeful it will for me!  I will defiantly use another strip though, because it certainly made a difference in my enjoyment of previously sensitive foods!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always had problems eating or drinking anything really cold like ice cream or drinking anything really hot like coffee because of my sensitive teeth. After being able to try out Crest&#x27;s Sensi-Stop strips free from Crest thanks to BzzAgent, I&#x27;ve been able to enjoy all of my favorite things again without pain. Crest&#x27;s Sensi-Stop strips are so quick and easy to use; they are just flexible strips that you place over your sensitive teeth for 10 minutes. They form to your teeth and stay in place so you don&#x27;t have any problems talking and they comfortable. In just 10 minutes you&#x27;ll get a month&#x27;s worth of sensitivity relief!!</li>
            <li> I have been using the Crest Sensi-Stop strips for about a month now and let me tell you, they work!!  I have super sensitivity to cold stuff and never thought I could enjoy cold again but I put these strips on for about fifteen minutes one time and now I have no more sensitivity!  Really, no more pain!!  I truly never thought that a product like this would really work but it does, I am so grateful that I was able to try this for free from Smiley360 because now that I know they really work, I will buy them!!</li>
            <li> I received for free to test out. It would work for my minor teeth sensitivities but not my major ones. The packaging is nice and grabs your attention however the strip is flimsy and does not like to stay in place at times.</li>
            <li> Not my favorite product because it is hard to apply and keep the strips on for a long time and they were hard to get to stick to your teeth. It did work to prevent tooth sensitivity, but it only lasted for a few days instead of for a weeks like the package suggests. I received this product as a promotion.</li>
            <li> Finally an easy way to ease my tooth sensitivity. I have  couple teeth that are sensitive to cold. I was happy to have tried out this product. Its simple to use and it really does work well to stop that shooting pain you get when you drink or eat something really cold - ouch. 1 strip will last you a while. I thought that 1 strip would be enough to use on 2 spots in my mouth, so I just cut 1 in 1/2 and it did the trick.&lt;br /&gt;So you first want to brush your teeth so then the strips will stick better, find the tooth or teeth thats sensitive, be sure your hands are dry and then open the strip and apply the gel side to your tooth and the outer gum line. You wear it for 10 min then remove the strip and don&#x27;t eat or rinse for 30 min.&lt;br /&gt;These strips worked great for me, but as for any products like this, be sure to read the instructions before use. It does work so much faster than a sensitive toothpaste &amp; lasts a lot longer. Im very happy with this product.&lt;br /&gt;*I received a free product for the purpose of my review. Opinions are 100% my own.</li>
            <li> This is an excellent product if you have teeth that are sensitive to heat or to cold. It is easy to use--just take out the strip (one per tooth, only for a one-time use) and apply it so it lines up with the gumline (usually where the dentin has been exposed and is causing the pain). It isn&#x27;t that \\&quot;sticky\\&quot; and is easier to line up if you look in the mirror. You keep it on for 10 minutes and then don&#x27;t eat or drink anything for half an hour.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had my doubts that this would work (they say one may give up to a month&#x27;s worth of relief, but if you don&#x27;t get results with the first strip, you can reapply another one after waiting for a day in between applications). Fortunately, one strip actually did relieve my tooth pain--in over a week, it hasn&#x27;t bothered me again. (They say to see a dentist if you have to use it more than three times.)There is a warning-- not to use with bleeding gums or loose teeth or if you&#x27;re under 18 or \\&quot;have a history of kidney stones\\&quot;-- and a lot of necessary \\&quot;legalese\\&quot; because of it being a medicine sold over the counter. It has several ingredients--and Crest assures us none will harm enamel in any way (it isn&#x27;t a whitener). The main ingredient responsible for decreasing tooth sensitivity is dipotassium oxalate. It works because the strips \\&quot;help stop sensitivity by blocking tubules (the microscopic channels in the dentin that provide a path to the nerve).\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Crest packaging also mentions some of the causes of tooth sensitivity: receding gums, brushing too hard, acidic or sugary food and grinding your teeth--things I&#x27;m going to watch out for going forward (they say if you need this more than three times for the same tooth to see the dentist).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The manufacturer assures users that it is safe when used as directed. If you try it and don&#x27;t like it, Crest even gives you a refund--a pre-paid card in the amount of your purchase if you have the receipt and UPC and \\&quot;call 1-855-251-8468 within 60 days of purchase.\\&quot;  That&#x27;s a good guarantee, but personally, I doubt there&#x27;d be much need for it. It&#x27;s a good product and easy to use correctly to get the desired result.good guarantee, but personally, I doubt there&#x27;d be much need for it. It&#x27;s a good product and easy to use correctly to get the desired result.</li>
            <li> I really wished that these would have worked for me but they didn&#x27;t in my case. I followed directions fully and still felt pain the next day when I consumed cold cereal for breakfast. The product is easy to apply. The strip did stay in place for the allotted time that you are supposed to keep it on. After removing the strip, there was no funny taste or anything left. I guess my tooth sensitivity requires something more than just a pain relieving strip. Give the product a try for yourself as you know what does not work for me may work for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received a free product for the purpose of my review. Opinions are 100% my own.</li>
            <li> I tried this product but it didn&#x27;t really seem to work.  I followed the directions to the tee but the sensitive spot on my tooth still flairs up when I splash it with cold water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really wanted this product to work.  darn:(</li>
            <li> I was given a sample of these strips for free to review. And I am so happy to have the opportunity to try them. I am so impressed with Crest Sensi-Stop Strips! I have a sensitive tooth that I have been trying to heal for months. All the solutions from my dentist has left me gagging and with no relief. But wow - Crest Sensi-Stop Strips are the best. They have no taste so I hardly even notice that they are in my mouth. The strip is small so it is easy to get into my mouth without gagging. And it works!! I no longer have to avoid hot, cold and sweet foods. I love this product.</li>
            <li> I received a complimentary package of these strips from BzzAgent to sample and review.  I have to say that I was pleasantly surprised and impressed.  I have suffered from sensitive teeth for a long time.  I am also a person that uses all-natural toothpaste because I do not like the taste of regular toothpaste - so those sensitive toothpastes out there just don&#x27;t work for me.  I was excited to give these a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I found them to be easy to apply and when the directions were followed - they did not slip off.  I am still noticing the benefits and my first trial was a while ago.  Well Done Crest!</li>
            <li> Not nearly as effective as I had hoped. I received the product from BzzAgent, for free, to try it and share my experiences with others. I have extremely sensitive teeth and have had better results from a popular sensitive toothpaste (not Crest brand). I didn&#x27;t notice any difference at all when using this.</li>
            <li> I shared this review with family and friends. I let them know that they don&#x27;t have to avoid the foods they love to eat because of tooth sensitivity. After just 10 minutes with the New Crest Sensi Stop they have at least up to 6 hours of relief.</li>
            <li> Have a receding gum line on one of my front side teeth. It&#x27;s been sensitives for years. Figured I would try these. Not thinking it would work...I was very surprised to find it fixed my sensitive gum area. Not only that, but I only used one strip and have not had sensitivity in that area for 3 months now. I told my dentist durning my recent dentist visit. She said she would recommend using the strips before I even told her I did. So they must work for others also.</li>
            <li> I just tried this product for the first time.  So far I am very pleased with the results. I did not give it 5 stars because I want to see how&lt;br /&gt;it works over time and how long it will last.</li>
            <li> these strips are amazing i am able to  enjoy things like hot coffee and cold ice cream with out excrutiating pain i ablsolutely love these and recommend them wholeheartly if you suffer from sensitivity  in your teeth</li>
            <li> I bought my first pack of these from Hy-Vee. Twenty bucks! A lot of money, but I was in a lot of pain. The first time I used them was pretty awkward. The bitty little thing slid around a lot, but I soldiered through and kept it on the spot pretty well for the required 10 minutes. I noticed an immediate reduction in pain and have been very pleased with 4 pain-free days. I was glad to read that I could use another strip as soon as 24 hours after the first, though. I have a dental check-up and cleaning today, so I&#x27;m using another strip as I write. I followed the instructions as closely as I could, brushing and flossing first, and waiting 5 minutes before applying the strip. The only thing I did differently was to dry the sensitive area with the corner of a washcloth (no way am I going to blow air on it!) before applying the strip. That helped a great deal in placing the strip and minimizing slippage. Hopefully my dental appointment won&#x27;t be too much torture today.</li>
            <li> ​&lt;br /&gt;   I was so excited when I received the Crest Sensi-Stop Strips.  From Crest  I #GotItFree. All I needed to do was give an honest product review . I was not paid for my  opinion .  For almost all of my life I have suffered from sensitive teeth. I always had to avoid things like ice cold watermelon, ice cream, iced tea and even a cold beer. People looked at me funny when I would go to a restaurant an order an iced tea without ice, the server would give me the strangest look. Have you ever had warm beer? I don’t recommend it.  Thanks to the Crest Sensi-Strip I can enjoy all of the things I have avoided for years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The idea is really good however; I think the application needs a little work. The directions are pretty straight forward, much like the crest whitening strips if you have ever tried them just a bit smaller . One of the problems I found was locating the sensitive tooth; I have a whole mouth full so in my case I ended up using all 6 strips. Also after removing the strips after 10 minutes (which I had to adjust a few times because they kept slipping) you CAN NOT rinse your mouth, drink, eat, or brush your teeth for at least 30 minutes after you remove the strips. It may affect the success of the treatment. Personally the gel to me ha a really bad taste that I had to keep in my mouth for approximately 40 minutes.  If you feel it didn’t work the first time you may the process one day later.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; All in the entire product did work and my teeth are not sensitive anymore. I will probably purchase this product. However I think maybe if the gel was not on a strip, and perhaps in a bottle with a brush, that could be painted onto the teeth and then a mouth guard or mouth trat might be easier than keeping the strips in place.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are also several warnings with this product&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;DON NOT USE THIS PRODUCT IF&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You suffer from bleeding gums or loose teeth.&lt;br /&gt;You have a history of kidney stones.&lt;br /&gt;You arepregnant or breastfeeding.&lt;br /&gt;You are under 18 years old.&lt;br /&gt;You are allergic to any of the ingredients listed on the box.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;      Stop using this product if you experience continuous pain, swelling of the lips, mouth or eyes, rash or headache. Such symptoms may indicate you are allergic to this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are several other warnings and precautions listed in the leaflet. One that really stood out to me was&lt;br /&gt;TAKE CARE NOT TO SWALLOW OR INHALE THE CREST SENSI STOP STRIPS OR THE PLASTIC BACKING. IF INHALED, SEEK IMMEDIATE MEDDICAL ATTENTION.</li>
            <li> I used to have issues with hot and cold things. Both coffee and ice cream, two of my favorite things, were issues for me. These new Crest Sensi-Stop Strips work great! They are really easy to use and my teeth are no where near as sensitive anymore! I am loving them! I got my Sensi-Stop Strips free from Crest® for testing purposes. All opinions expressed are 100% my own.</li>
            <li> These little strips work better than everything I&#x27;ve ever tried for tooth sensitivity, and it only takes 10 minutes!! Wait 5 minutes after brushing your teeth to gently place your strip at your gum line. Keep in mind, they are quite small so try not to touch them too much, or move them around a lot. I didn&#x27;t have any problems with them slipping like with the whitening strips. However I did experience some numbness in my cheek and gums for a while, even after I removed the strip. I last used this product around 3 weeks ago and I am still pain and sensitivity free! &amp;#34;I received a free product for the purpose of my review. Opinions are 100% my own.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> This product is considerably more expensive than a simple tube of Sensodyne and provides the similar protection. For me, it was not worth the effort, annoyance, concerns, or price. Moreover, I am left truly uncomfortable by the numerous notes of caution on the product. I think I&#x27;ll simply remain faithful to my Sensodyne (which my dentist wholeheartedly endorses).    Additionally, the box does caution the user that this product has been known to NOT last the full month ... something to consider as you weigh Sensodyne against this box (of six strips). Best to use Sensodyne consistently than to end up in screaming pain because your Sensi-Strips just wore-off? Food for thought.</li>
            <li> I love Crest products, They always work the best fore me, I have sensitive gums a lot of the times and these strips work wonders.&amp;#34;I received a free product for the purpose of my review. Opinions are 100% my own.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> I never thought that I would have relief from my tooth sensitivity.  I have stopped eating anything cold (ice, ice cream, slushes, smoothies, shakes, etc) because it killed me to do so.  When I was offered the opportunity to test Crest Sensi-stop strips, I jumped on it.  I have tried so many products from strips to toothpaste and nothing has ever helped.  Well, I am here to say that I am now free from tooth sensitivity and can now eat all of my favorite foods again.  The strips are so easy to use. You just place them on teeth that are sensitive, wait about 10 mins, and POOF! the hurt is gone.  It&#x27;s a miracle and I am so excited to have been part of this campaign.  I am now a believer that there is a cure to tooth sensitivity out there and it&#x27;s Crest Sensi-Stop Strips!</li>
            <li> I received Crest Sensi-Stop courtesy of Crest to try at home for free and loved how great it worked!&lt;br /&gt;First, it was extremely easy to use. You place the strip over the outer side of the tooth and gum where you experience sensitivity and let it sit in place for ten minutes, wait 30 minutes afterward, then after that, you are covered for an entire four weeks from tooth sensitivity, which for me was to cold food and drink items.&lt;br /&gt;I loved that it worked better than just using toothpaste for sensitive teeth and that it actually worked for the entire four weeks. I would highly recommend Crest Sensi-Stop Strips to any one experiencing tooth sensitivity.</li>
            <li> I was really happy with this product on the whole. The packaging says that it can prevent tooth sensitivity for up to a month, and it really does! The one issue that I have with this is that it can be tedious to apply. A strip has to be applied to an individual tooth, so if you have a few teeth that need application then you also need to use 3 separate strips. For me the process was with it because the effects are deeper than a topical treatment and really long lasting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this product free of charge from Crest in exchange for my honest opinions.</li>
            <li> I received the strips for free to try out courtesy smiley360 and I am satisfied with the product! I am a big time white strip user which causes my teeth to be very sensitive to cold and got things. The sensi strips almost momentarily cured the sensitivity!</li>
            <li> These are definitely worth trying if you experience pain due to hot or cold on your teeth.  They work pretty much the same as white teethening stripes but smaller.  They are easy to get out of the package and apply to the sensitive area.  My first try, the stripe did move on me but it didn&#x27;t leave any nasty residue or taste.  But other than that, , they are really easy to use.  They did do the job of temporarily easing pain from tooth sensitivity.  I will be using them in the future as needed!  I received these Crest Sensi - stop strips to test out for free!  My opinions are 100% my own.</li>
            <li> It really worked for me! I have very sensitive teeth especially the front ones. I wouldn&#x27;t necessarily avoid eating the foods (ice cream for an example), I would find creative ways to eat them! When I first tried the strips I could eat and drink anything and everything without a problem so I stopped using sensitive relief toothpaste. I would say this lasted me about 3 weeks, not quite a full month but it is better than anything I have ever tried. I would continue using this product.    I was given this product to sample and review.</li>
            <li> Though toothpaste for sensitive teeth works, I always choke on it. It&#x27;s a horrible feeling so I just skip it. I was sent Crest Sensi-Strips and was overjoyed. My molars are my sensitive spots and the strips do a great job of covering them up. I can usually eat cold fruit and ice tea for 3 days before having to use the strips again. SO HAPPY&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I got these Sensi-Stop Strips free from Crest® for review purposes.</li>
            <li> long lasting relief. Worth trying for worse sensitive tooth. Easy and quick fix. However, application of small strips is bit difficult for initial use.Really a breakthrough.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t quite get the relief I was hoping to have</li>
            <li> SO, I tried this and found relief for a day and that was all.  Maybe it will work for others, I sure hope so.</li>
            <li> I have a sensitive molar.  I could not get the strip in the back of my mouth to place on the molar.  It kept sliding around.  I am thinking of returning these to the store.  $18 is a lot to pay for something that won&#x27;t stay on.</li>
            <li> I could not really tell if these worked or not.  I had to use the whole package as I found they slid off the tooth unless I held it in place for the full time. They are very small. I finally just went to the dentist and had the tooth coated.  I would not buy again</li>
            <li> This stuff really works.  I strong recommend it as it worked for me on a sensitivity issue I was having to cold food.</li>
            <li> Not too impressed.  I didn&#x27;t ahve as good of luck as other people with the sensitive teeth pain.  Had really looked forward to finding something that helped.</li>
