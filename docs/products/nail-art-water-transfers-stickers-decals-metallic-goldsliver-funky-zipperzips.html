            <li> Not a good color, they&#x27;re very dull. They worked as expected but I wouldn&#x27;t order them again.</li>
            <li> Very cute amd easy to apply</li>

            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money. I may have left them in the water too long. They were not gold, and when I placed them on my nails, the zippers were white. The instructions stated 20 to 30 seconds in water. I  will try another time because maybe I did not remove all of the film.</li>
            <li> Loved it. just follow the directions</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t tried them yet but I like them</li>
            <li> Love!!! Love!!! Absolutely love!!! Easy to use &amp;&amp; they look extremely cute!! Great buy!!</li>
            <li> Perfect!  I can&#x27;t wait to use them!</li>
            <li> The item of the zipper size are fine. My only misappoiment is the amount you get in this package.</li>
            <li> This product is very easy to use if you follow the directions on the other side and I love the way it comes out looking</li>
            <li> looks so cute on nails</li>
            <li> I may not have mastered applying these, but they seem to smear when the top coat is applied over them. I try to apply one quick coat over them, but can&#x27;t seem to get it right. Maybe it&#x27;s me or maybe it&#x27;s the decals...</li>
            <li> I wish I looked a little more closely at the pic before I purchased them.  The pic they have of the grey nails and gold zippers look nice, but, these are so cheap.  I guess cute for some, but, I was hoping for a more shiny decal with more texture.  I don&#x27;t like the smallest ones...that have no zipper...Shipping was fine, but, I wouldn&#x27;t recommend.  If you want to try them...I&#x27;ll send ya mine!</li>
            <li> My daughter loves these. Took a few tries to get the hang of putting them on with no wrinkles though.</li>
            <li> love these designs and very easy to use.  they came nicely packaged.  and a very good price.</li>
            <li> Ordered this on 1/1/2015. Expected delivery was 1/27 to 2/12. I received on 1/24. It has both gold and black designs. Instructions aren&#x27;t the greatest. Haven&#x27;t used but they seem like they&#x27;ll work perfectly. Overall pleased.</li>
            <li> They look great and are super easy to use! I&#x27;m a total newbie to nail art and didn&#x27;t have any trouble at all applying them.</li>
            <li> I wish the light color zippers were gold color, but they are yellow. Still they are nice.</li>
