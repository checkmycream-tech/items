            <li>Smells good and is a more evening scent then a day time 1..</li>
            <li>The cologne smells good its more for going out not every day use.</li>
            <li>It smells wonderful on him (he had tried it on at a department store in the past) and he was very happy to receive it as a gift.</li>
            <li>excellent cologne, it appears to be authentic, first time using it</li>
            <li>Very nice, clean scent.  </li>
            <li>He was happy as well thank you so much!!</li>
            <li>My woman said she fell in love with me again when I wore this.</li>
            <li>Just smelled this cologne in Macy&#x27;s and it smells better than what I recieved.</li>
            <li>My son love the smell.</li>
            <li>and I have receive many compliments on it.</li>
            <li>Super product for nice price</li>
            <li>Good cologne and right travel to fit in to your travel pouch.  </li>
            <li>Amazing scent worth every penny.</li>
            <li>Not bad!</li>
            <li>Shipped in original package.</li>
            <li>and surprisingly i was have random strangers come up to me just to tell me how good i smelt!</li>
            <li>Love the spray I will be ordering another real soon.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It smells so clean and fresh.</li>
            <li>Arrived Quickly.</li>
            <li>For the price I paid the item is worth it.</li>
            <li>Dont spray to much of you because is a little strong, but it smells good a couple of sprays will do.</li>
            <li>this one is in right proportion.</li>
            <li>is strong but sadly does not have a very good staying power</li>
            <li>Sticks with you most of the day, and the next day too.  </li>
            <li>chicks dig it;)</li>
            <li>Gucci guilty is the best.</li>
            <li>The cologne is the real stuff not the knock off some places try to play off with a cheaper price.</li>
            <li>bought for my husband at a much lower price than department stores and he loves it.</li>
            <li>Gucci guilty intense definitely has a strong scent with good staying power, goes on strong, and fades lightly into a slightly fruity, somewhat floral scent.</li>
            <li>Nice but scent did not last as long as I thought it should.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>But the key thing that got me to buy this right away was all the compliments i was recieving.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not too strong like other Armani or Burberry which I had before, those ones were so strong that people used to smell it and used to say &amp;#34;wow, someone is smelling good&amp;#34; (not sure if they were sarcastic in me being overtly fragrant).&lt;br /&gt;But</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d wear this cologne to a strip club or a bar maybe, but not in a professional setting or a romantic night out with the lady.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not huge on &amp;#34;sweet&amp;#34; floral smelling colognes, I tend to prefer cleaner, light and dry scents.</li>

            <li> Slight vanilla with darker undertones.</li>
            <li> But the sillage and lasting power is very poor, and over the next 2 hours this becomes a close to skin scent.</li>
            <li> Smells a little girly.</li>
            <li> He is still using it, although he doesn&#x27;t wear it everyday because of the price.</li>
            <li> Leading me to believe I was sold fake cologne or expired beware.....</li>
            <li> I bought this on accident,i thought i order Gucci guilty, but i like it alot...</li>
