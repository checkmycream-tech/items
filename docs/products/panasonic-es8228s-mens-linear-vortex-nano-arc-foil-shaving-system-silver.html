            <li>It is the best electric I have ever used, and it isn&#x27;t even close.  </li>
            <li>This razor is just awesome!  </li>
            <li>but I got a great deal at Amazon.com!  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a heck of a performer and rate it as giving you the closest and best shave one could have.</li>
            <li>Best electric shaver ever.</li>
            <li>A great product!  </li>
            <li>but gosh, it is great!  </li>
            <li>The best part is I don&#x27;t get cuts anymore.  </li>
            <li>This is the best shaver</li>
            <li>I also got this for a great price on AMAZON.COM!  </li>
            <li>The floating head is awesome as is the speed it</li>
            <li>Best ever!</li>
            <li>Probably the best thing I like about it is that it doesn&#x27;t have a lot of gimmicks.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never reviewed a product before but would be remiss if I didn&#x27;t say that this is the best electric shaver I&#x27;ve owned in 50+ years.  </li>
            <li>best electric shave ever...</li>
            <li>This razor is awesome.</li>
            <li>I am very happy with it!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not over-exaggerating when I say that this razor is truly one of the best purchases I have ever made.</li>
            <li>the best shave I&#x27;ve ever had.</li>
            <li>best thing about the Panasonic Nano Vortex 8282s, is that they sell the foil and cutter block separately!</li>
            <li>I have found that using Lectric Shave works best before shaving.</li>
            <li>great job Amazon!</li>
            <li>The best one before now was the Braun Series 7 pulsonic.  </li>
            <li>Superb with shave cream.</li>
            <li>Another great shave!</li>
            <li>The best shaver money can buy!</li>
            <li>The ES8228 shaver itself is excellent.</li>
            <li>did like the cleaning system, but it was not the greatest to use.</li>
            <li>Braun&#x27;s cleaning system seems to be the best, but the shave is not.</li>
            <li>Best Shaver I have ever owned.</li>
            <li>I looked at the reviews and this one had the best review for the price.  </li>
            <li>Best razor I ever had.  </li>
            <li>Great QUALITY!  </li>
            <li>this is the best in a market, also Amazon has the best price.</li>
            <li>VERY HAPPY WITH PURCHASE AND RECOMMEND THIS PRODUCT TO ALL THAT WILL LISTEN.</li>
            <li>I am still very happy with Panasonic shavers.</li>
            <li>The best part, a bonus if you will, is the Panasonic is water-resistant.</li>
            <li>I rate the shave quality as excellent.</li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t pass it up and when knowing he wanted it that was perfect.</li>
            <li>Love this shaver!!!</li>
            <li>The Panasonic Vortex is a very good electric shaver.  </li>
            <li>i changed my rating from 1 to 4 stars, it does give a very good shave if you push the blades against the shaving surface.</li>
            <li>The Panasonic does a very good job.  </li>
            <li>it is a very good product.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall this is a very good product, well designed and executed.</li>
            <li>A very nice compact shaver at a great price that does a great job!!</li>
            <li>Beautiful product.  </li>
            <li>and we are both very happy about the ease of use and cleaning and most of all, the close shave!</li>
            <li>After spending a great deal of money over the years on \\&quot;women&#x27;s\\&quot; electric shavers I decided that if I am to get what I&#x27;m looking for then</li>
            <li>It turned out to vbe a great decision.  </li>
            <li>Great job Panasonic on this one.  </li>
            <li>The shaver itself works great after all this time.</li>
            <li>Works great and shaves close.</li>
            <li>- Great for use in the shower.</li>
            <li>and it seems to work great.   </li>
            <li>The cleaning/charging station works great.  </li>
            <li>This is a great shaver.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s just a great product</li>
            <li>and I would recommend it to anyone looking for a really great, close shave.</li>
            <li>Panasonic Linear shavers are great.</li>
            <li>The Cleaner/charger station makes a great stand.</li>
            <li>The convenience is great as when I am in a rush in the morning, I just pop the shaver in the dock and forget about it.    </li>
            <li>Anyway this Panasonic foil type razor is great.</li>
            <li>Plus, Amazon has great deals on the Panasonic stuff which I just couldn&#x27;t pass up.</li>
            <li>I use Gillette Fusion shaving gel and it works great.</li>
            <li>Great price with a rebate made it a bargain.  </li>
            <li>Great amazon price.</li>
            <li>The cleaning system works well and the visible charging indicator is great.  </li>
            <li>&quot; feeling that I always experienced with my Norelco.  </li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s a great shaver for your wife or girlfriend.ve with this item as I have and in the women&#x27;s line, it&#x27;s a great shaver for your wife or girlfriend.</li>
            <li>Great shaver</li>
            <li>The cleaning and charging system is GREAT....</li>
            <li>We both liked this one best &amp; ordered</li>
            <li>But even this great unit didnt match shaving with a blade for closes, and it didn&#x27;t like it if you took 1-2 days off from shaving.  </li>
            <li>It works great in all settings.</li>
            <li>Holds the charge great.</li>
            <li>this is really a great shaver.</li>
            <li>great combo.</li>
            <li>The cleaning system is great except when away from home</li>
            <li>The Panasonic shaves the closest I&#x27;ve experienced and almost never misses the neck hairs.</li>
            <li>Perfect for my vacation razor,easier for me then my Braun to take along even though I do love the Braun.</li>
            <li>gimmicks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I chose the Panasonic over many  others and have to say it shaves the best of any shaver I&#x27;ve owned.</li>
            <li>I am very pleased with the product and am extremely happy.</li>
            <li>This is easily the best electric razor I&#x27;ve owned.</li>
            <li>Good shaver been using it for some time now and still works like the day I used it.</li>
            <li>I got a good shaver this time, AND</li>
            <li>so I will just give my opinion based on the fact that I switched from the good ol&#x27; razor blade to this electric system.    </li>
            <li>That helped me a good deal because otherwise I would never have understood the cleaning cycle operation.   </li>
            <li>It is superb in the shower with soap - smooth and efficient.  </li>
            <li>For the money id try something else doesnt work too good and takes 20-30 minutes to shave....</li>
            <li>Also, the blades were good for about 1.5 shaves before I had to replace them...</li>
            <li>That said, I learned about preparation and good shave soaps..</li>
            <li>I have yet to use an electric shaver that does as good a job as a blade.</li>
            <li>Then I noticed the results weren&#x27;t so good anymore, and I started getting irritation.</li>
            <li>razors and has been on the search for a really GOOD one forever.  </li>
            <li>or so I was good.  </li>
            <li>This had good reviews</li>
            <li>and I thought it was a good price.  </li>
            <li>With frustration boiling over, and seeing these good reviews, I had to give in and buy an ES8228S.      </li>
            <li>but I didn&#x27;t take as good of care of it as I should have so had to replace it with this one.      </li>
            <li>I would pull and stretch the skin while shaving and not once did I get a good shave.</li>
            <li>This is a good razor.  </li>
            <li>I can leave for work in the morning knowing that my skin looks good</li>
            <li>that did a good job of getting these.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Holds its charge for good period.</li>
            <li>Good luck to all you shavers on the electric shaver quest....</li>
            <li>I did some research and the ES8228S looked like a good</li>
            <li>The docking station is a good place to keep your razor when it&#x27;s not in use</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;d be able to get an incredibly close shave.  </li>
            <li>Great shave, great charge, easily cleaned (with tap water or the shower).  </li>
            <li>This is an excellent razor and I&#x27;m glad to recommend it to others looking for a good razor that doesn&#x27;t try to do more than than</li>
            <li>and he&#x27;s always been very satisfied with its shave.</li>
            <li>This is a great shaver for the most part.  </li>
            <li>GREAT, BETTER</li>
            <li>It was an awesome deal with the $30 discount, glad I grabbed it when it was available.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used it for a couple of months now and love it!  </li>
            <li>more!  </li>
            <li>to continue using it, but after 7 years the cleaner/recharger won&#x27;t &amp;#34;clean&amp;#34; any more, and I can&#x27;t find a replacement (still looking!).</li>
            <li>Love this product!</li>
            <li>I purchased this exact shaver about 3 years ago and it is still working perfectly.  </li>
            <li>Who cares, anyway, the shave is great, and maintenance is easy.</li>
            <li>VERY GOOD SHAVER, WORTH THE MONEY.</li>
            <li>Amazing.</li>
            <li>The unit is light and gives a great shave.  </li>
            <li>Cuts amazingly close.</li>
            <li>He is THRILLED with this razor.</li>
            <li>but soon I liked it.</li>
            <li>Since then I&#x27;ve been using a Mach 3 Power shaver and while I liked the close shave, I would get plenty of nicks and cuts on my neck.  </li>
            <li>He absolutely thinks it is the greatest thing!  </li>
            <li>and I liked the idea of the 13,000 RPM linear Panasonic motor.</li>
            <li>In all honestly...</li>
            <li>I used to own a panasonic that I got as a gift about 5 years ago</li>
            <li>The addition of some silicon pads on the grip would be nice.</li>
            <li>the linear head promotes a nice shaving movement.</li>
            <li>The beard disappears very quickly and afterward your skin feels remarkable unburned.</li>
            <li>The good news is that this razor gives you an excellent shave if you use it in the shower, but you will still get a good shave if you are using it dry.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very happy with this purchase and would highly recommend to All.</li>
            <li>As a Gold Box special item, the price was great too.</li>
            <li>best price and free shipping with extremely quick shipping time.  </li>
            <li>My radiation treatments begin tomorrow, I feel very confident and pleased with my purchase.</li>
            <li>For me Panasonic is the best wet/dry shaver on the market that I have been able to find at a reasonable price as well and will continue to be a customer of theirs.</li>
            <li>It shaves quickly and does a great job.</li>
            <li>I just follow the instructions for washing the head each time when it needs recharging and the cleaning is very easy and thorough.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It cleans automatic, you can do manualy too, very easy, but sometimmes</li>
            <li>Awesome for sensitive skin!</li>
            <li>Ist very good at shaving very close....</li>
            <li>A bit pricey but well worth the money, a great product.</li>
            <li>Given the great price that Amazon offered, it was worth it</li>
            <li>this is the best shaver i have ever had so far.</li>
            <li>The best I have had so far.</li>
            <li>Best electric shaver I have owned by far.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s been about a week now, and I am loving it more each day.  </li>
            <li>I reviewed ALL electric razors for my man, this one by far is the best purchase for your money.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Impressions: The design is comfortable in the hand, it&#x27;s well made, and fairly trim and compact.</li>
            <li>It comes with a beautiful leather case and with the wood grain and gold accents, it seems that Panasonic designed it to actually fit comfortably in one&#x27;s hand.</li>
            <li>but once I did that the seal was just not as good as it originally was.      </li>
            <li>This one performs perfectly for him and so far the quality seems to be outstanding.  </li>
            <li>Excellent - use it for those &#x27;in-between&#x27; days when I really don&#x27;t want to break out the double-edge or if I just want a nice quick shave.  </li>
            <li>This was the first Panasonic I tried, and I got a great Gold Box deal on it about 4 months ago.  </li>
            <li>Very comfortable grip too.</li>
            <li>This unit is very, very good at shaving close - even better then the ES8066 did when it was new.</li>
            <li>I wanted to make sure</li>
            <li>An outstanding buy.  </li>
            <li>I have been using Braun razors for many years.  </li>
            <li>so I had some questions for sure.</li>
            <li>The ever increasing price of razor blades make consideration of a quality electric razor a budget item for many of us.</li>
            <li>But like many women I like to use an electric razor - and ones \\&quot;made for women\\&quot;</li>
            <li>They were both OK.  </li>
            <li>The basic functionality of the shaver, however, is excellent - better than Braun, even.</li>
            <li>but this one is 125$ and better</li>
            <li>i love it</li>
            <li>I primarily looked at the nice Norelco Rotaries, and then foil razors.</li>
            <li>is probably better for your hearing then when you crank that favorite song up on the radio.</li>
            <li>Purchased this unit more than 2 years ago.</li>
            <li>The shaver has a nice, light feel in your hand.  </li>
            <li>The smoother the foils go across your face the closer and better the shave.</li>
            <li>I researched many shavers on Amazon and decided to purchase this as suprise Christmas gift.  </li>
            <li>No matter how often I go over my face with the shaver I still feel like it should do better.  </li>
            <li>It is easy to clean and give you a surprisingly close shave.  </li>
            <li>My husband had a Panasonic razor that lasted for probably 20 years and if we had been able to find some replacement parts, he would still be using it.  </li>
            <li>The shave is close and I am getting better at the angles and applied pressure to get it closer each day.  </li>
            <li>There are many combinations you can choose from.  </li>
            <li>it is ok to do it auto.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>I love the shave and the service I have goten from them.</li>
            <li>Gone through many electric ones</li>
            <li>I also like the cleaning syatem which keeps my shaver is top shape between shaves.</li>
            <li>, i tried that, didn&#x27;t work much better.</li>
            <li>OK, on with the review.</li>
            <li>Most noticeable is the weight and balance.</li>
            <li>I actually enjoy shaving now!     </li>
            <li>This is my 3rd Panasonic shaver and it is also the best one that I have owned.  </li>
            <li>but with the 8228 I seem to be able to get a better shave on my neck as well.</li>
            <li>Love love love this shaver.</li>
            <li>Then I decided it would be better for my career to shave more than once a week.</li>
            <li>and I have to say it gives me a better shave than the Braun</li>
            <li>own a Simpson 886-2 sound level meter.  </li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t bother me since I shave in the morning, but just wanted to make sure that you don&#x27;t think that it&#x27;s silent.&lt;br</li>
            <li>This is much better.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s even better -</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve ended up using it once a week for the lubrication effect - and according to the docs I should be able to use it for 3 months at that usage level.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve ended up using it once a week for the lubrication effect - and according to the docs I should be able to use it for 3 months at that usage level.</li>
            <li>I know you&#x27;ll fall in love with this item as I have and in the women&#x27;s line</li>
            <li>I also can&#x27;t say that this model is any better than the less-expensive Panasonic wet-dry shavers on the market.  </li>
            <li>I said it was my favorite shaver.</li>
            <li>But most of the time that&#x27;s no problem.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this razor for more than 6 months now.</li>
            <li>I love this product.  </li>
            <li>I am extremely pleased with it.</li>
            <li>Amazon is my favorite e-shop.</li>
            <li>Couldn&#x27;t get a better shave.</li>
            <li>My Norelco holds most of the hair inside.  </li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m extremely pleased with this product.    </li>
            <li>I am glad I bought it.</li>
            <li>Were it able to, I&#x27;d have rated it a 5.</li>
            <li>Amazon did a great job with the speed of the delivery and that part was flawless, however, the razor itself left much to be desired.</li>
            <li>how many weeks?)</li>
            <li>I have used many shavers including Braun Syncro, Norelco, and Remington.</li>
            <li>I read the reviews that said the opposite for this panasonic - that it works best when you&#x27;ve shaven the day before.  </li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t agree more.  </li>
            <li>and this was a fantastic choice!  </li>
            <li>so many years ago was it caused a severe rash on my neck.  </li>
            <li>This is an outstanding product.  </li>
            <li>I am amazed at how I don&#x27;t cut myself any more.</li>
            <li>LOVE THE CLEANER, WOULD DEFENETLY RECOMEND TO ANYONE</li>
            <li>They were all thrilled and will really enjoy them.  </li>
            <li>I may be ordering more for my sons-in-law.  </li>
            <li>After many hours of research I thought I wanted another Braun...</li>
            <li>their top of the line Pulsonic model.</li>
            <li>The top of the line Braun can be rinsed under water but not used \\&quot;wet\\&quot; or with creams or lotions.</li>
            <li>I was hoping they could have supplied a better case to hold the cord and shaver for extended trips.</li>
            <li>so I&#x27;m sure there will be plenty of room in there for a cord.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>purchasing, this razor still continues to be my favorite.</li>
            <li>The results are better.</li>
            <li>It just keeps going, still love it and have recommended it to many others.</li>
            <li>purchasing, this razor still continues to be my favorite.</li>
            <li>The results are better.</li>
            <li>It just keeps going, still love it and have recommended it to many others.</li>
            <li>I have been able to extend the life for a couple more years by using them with the cord attached.</li>
            <li>The shaver works great, does a very close shave, the trimmer is a nice capability, useful unless you need very fine work done.</li>
            <li>positive thing about the product is it doesn&#x27;t hurt skin at all,, may be this is a best (or good) option for a sensitive light haird beards..</li>
            <li>Received promptly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Proved a nice, clean shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>cause it makes this baby good as new every time!!!</li>
            <li>It is now very clean.</li>
            <li>It is now very clean.</li>
            <li>If you haven&#x27;t used an electric shaver before, or in a long while, like me, you&#x27;ll want to use the best shaving cream/lotion/whatever you can find for yourself.</li>
            <li>The batteries hold a charge for over a week which is almost as good as when I first got it.  </li>
            <li>Pretty good idea</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s pretty good.</li>
            <li>My tips for use: Warm water; Skintimate (women&#x27;s shaving gel with baby oil); a quick double/triple blade shave; rinse and re-apply gel</li>
            <li>Very different, but great in their own way.</li>
            <li>No irritation or pulling at the beard hairs, easy to clean and adjust, nice trimmer for ears and beard around the mouth.  </li>
            <li>- It is very easy to clean.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Luckily, the shaver is very easy to clean manually.</li>
            <li>I am so pleased at how well this razor is able to clean up my face.</li>
            <li>The price from amazon was $99.00 with free shipping, better than anyone.</li>
            <li>This gives me the smoothest most comfortable shave I&#x27;ve ever had.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very happy with it as a wet shaver in the shower.</li>
            <li>The most important question is How close does it shave?  </li>
            <li>The cleaning cart for this won&#x27;t evaporate, but more importantly....</li>
            <li>Its at its best in the shower and thats the only time that its not painful to use.</li>
            <li>Good shaver for the modern man.</li>
            <li>This is a powerful and effective shaver.  </li>
            <li>So easy to use.  </li>
            <li>Also, it was easy to miss spots, and too easy to get cut.    </li>
            <li>No fuss, no bother, and easily maintained.  </li>
            <li>The shave with the poroso shaving soap is amazing and it litterally is better than a straight razor shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Good shaver so far used it for 10 days now gets better with each</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s still going strong</li>
            <li>Still going strong.</li>
            <li>Still going strong.</li>
            <li>It recharges very easily and quickly and gives a smooth shave.  </li>
            <li>I have tried replacing foils and blades once years ago and it wasn&#x27;t nearly as good as a new shaver.</li>
            <li>For added measure and the price of new blades and foil, I found a really good deal on the ES8228S shaver.</li>
            <li>For added measure and the price of new blades and foil, I found a really good deal on the ES8228S shaver.</li>
            <li>I bought this razor for my husband and he loves it for the no tugging and easy, smooth shave.  </li>
            <li>Very quick and smooth shaves.  </li>
            <li>Having been a loyal Braun user, I can say I am pleased with this product.  </li>
            <li>The cleaner works great and the shaver looks new and smells fresh every day.  </li>
            <li>Easy to use and easy to clean.</li>
            <li>Every once in a while you run into a product that is so outstanding that it improves the task of shaving, gives you a great deep shave  or a quick touch up.</li>
            <li>Waterproof means it easy to clean.</li>
            <li>The specs indicate that it should provide 20 shaves between charges, but that must be for men with light beards.  </li>
            <li>Shaving with a Panasonic Linear model is definitely comfortable.  </li>
            <li>I am assuming that Panasonic will repair or replace the shaver, for free.  </li>
            <li>I do it by sound</li>
            <li>the charger won&#x27;t fit in it.</li>
            <li>It gives you a smooth, comfortable and close shave.</li>
            <li>I paid 89.99 for it and free shipping.  </li>
            <li>However, the charging base/cleaning unit died after 6 months of light usage.</li>
            <li>so I wanted to get him one that was easy to use and clean.  </li>
            <li>This razor is fantastic.  </li>
            <li>Overall, a great shaving experience and would recommend to anyone else.</li>
            <li>Great close shave, especially on my upper lip.</li>
            <li>With that said the construction of these shavers did allow me to take it apart easily and clean it up</li>
            <li>Provides a smooth shave without irriatation.</li>
            <li>(I use it for setting up surround sound systems.)  </li>
            <li>Also keep in mind that as the source is moved closer to your ears, the sound level increases.  </li>
            <li>my face and neck are smooth,</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had a cheap electric razor for years.</li>
            <li>/&gt;In use, the ES8228S feels incredibly light and smooth on your face.</li>
            <li>Also the cleaning stuff can be purchased on Amazon or Ebay quite cheap</li>
            <li>It shaves closely and comfortably.</li>
            <li>For the quality of the shave I&#x27;m happy to do that even earlier!    </li>
            <li>Felt so comfortable with this combo</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s great on my Italian beard.</li>
            <li>I would take a week off from shaving and the skin irritation would go away - then my face would be smooth as a baby&#x27;s</li>
            <li>I like this shaver in nearly every way, easy to clean, cuts well, good battery performance, etc.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m going to look for a replacement that doesn&#x27;t sound like a prop plane.</li>
            <li>i enjoy using the vortex panasonic shaver.</li>
            <li>Cheap razors were terrable</li>
            <li>I have been happily using it daily for almost 4 years.</li>
            <li>almost enjoy shaving.</li>
            <li>He saw it on amazons deals and I the price was fantastic.</li>
            <li>So far so good.</li>
            <li>I have been using electric razors for more then 60 years and have found that, although an electric shaver may look more modern,  the shave hasn&#x27;t improved,  </li>
            <li>It seemed like a good idea to test this razor against my old Norelco that I&#x27;ve been using for years.  </li>
            <li>Very rarely does he have irritation or nicks.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The razor fits comfortably in hand, but I do stand by my original impression about it feeling plasticky in hand.  </li>
            <li>oh so smooth and fresh!</li>
            <li>the Panasonic gives a pretty darn smooth shave; not as good as a straight edge but almost.</li>
            <li>It still isn&#x27;t appreciatively better than a shaver that is many years older with its original blades.</li>
            <li>The online company I bought mine from out of Texas was quick to send and easy to buy from.</li>
            <li>and .... he has found his new favorite razor!  </li>
            <li>This Panasonic seems to provide a better shave compared to the others and it is also very fast.</li>
            <li>Super smooth results, but had to do some pressure on my face to get it really smooth.</li>
            <li>Optimistic at first, I am glad that I bought it.  </li>
            <li>Still no problems and still using all the original parts.  </li>
            <li>Still no problems and still using all the original parts.  </li>
            <li>But the outcome was worth it!  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using Norelco for decades; I guess I should stick with what I&#x27;m familiar with.</li>
            <li>I usually don&#x27;t write reviews after one use but this thing is just AWESOME.</li>
            <li>--Rich</li>
            <li>It shaves more hairs on the first pass, the cream eliminates any friction, and gives me the closest shave yet with an electric (some areas of the face feel like I shaved with a blade).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li>so I clean it once a week or so and keep the bathroom door shut.</li>
            <li>I clean it once a week.</li>
            <li>Also, with the foil razor, it turns most of the hair (when it&#x27;s short) into powder, and it&#x27;s nice to just rinse it away in the shower.</li>
            <li>The choice provided for self clean or use of the unit&#x27;s clean cycle provides longer life for the shaver and the cleaner system and Pack.  </li>
            <li>I can choose whether I want to clean the shaver, clean and charge it</li>
            <li>Very solidly built and best feature is how it self cleans by dripping some liquid soap on the blades, starting the razor, the adding warm water and letting work up a lather, and finally just run under warm water faucet. . . .</li>
            <li>and I used to have to use a razor to get it really clean</li>
            <li>It has an odor that I find not to my liking, but the unit is certainly clean and somewhat lubricated afterwards.</li>
            <li>You can also clean the unit with water and hand soap using a an \\&quot;ultrasonic\\&quot; speed mode.</li>
            <li>so it&#x27;s clean as a whistle all the time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li>so it&#x27;s clean as a whistle all the time.    </li>
            <li>The Panasonic also employs a soap cartridge rather than an alcohol cartridge to clean the razor in it&#x27;s station.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had several electric razors in my lifetime (85 years) and this is by far, the best one I have ever had.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s only redeeming qualities are that it looks nice and it works in the shower.</li>
            <li>Clean, close shaves with no irritation, and that&#x27;s what it&#x27;s all about.</li>
            <li>Also definitely the best electric razor i&#x27;ve used thus far whether norelco or braun shavers.</li>
            <li>Do not neglect this; you need to clean it often.  </li>
            <li>I like the fact you can manually clean the Panasonic or use the solution provided.</li>
            <li>The cleaning gets the blades cleaner and they smell soapy clean and not chemically clean.</li>
            <li>When a motor became loud and inefficient, sometimes I&#x27;d send it to a repair shop for $70 or more, but this time I applied that sum toward a Panasonic ES8228S, and I&#x27;m glad I did.</li>
            <li>I notice that another reviewer claims that the alcohol solution in his Braun Clean &#x27;n Charge stand caused a fire.</li>
            <li>, just dry it (if I cleaned it myself), or just charge it (which is great because I can get full use of each charge).  </li>
            <li>I felt that using pure water and the cleaning/lubrication cartridge is probably better for the longevity of the razor.</li>
            <li>I clean it by hand, I don&#x27;t use the cleaning dock - I&#x27;d have gotten the dock-less model had this one not been such a good deal.  </li>
            <li>The ES8228 provides a clean, close shave while maintaining a good battery charge over several weeks.  </li>
            <li>It recharges quickly, feels right in the hand, and pivots easily across the contours of the face.</li>
            <li>I did a lot of research and finally decided that this unit was the most suitable for my needs.</li>
            <li>The Braun shavers I have had for many years have always been very reliable for both.</li>
            <li>Electric shavers used to be simple and provide a fairly close shave.  </li>
            <li>i used philips norelco cool art</li>
            <li>I found out about shaving with the grain, then across the grain, then against the grain (full 3 passes).</li>
            <li>The disadvantages of the straight razor were the difficulty shaving around my chin and neck, as well as the problems of grain on my neck, the steep learning curve of stropping (and shaving), the concentration required to avoid getting too many nicks (I ALWAYS got nicks), and the time...</li>
            <li>I thought it was over-zealous marketing, but I&#x27;ll be darned if it wasn&#x27;t true.  </li>
            <li>I eventually stop and fee that it is good enough.  </li>
            <li>I paid full price;</li>
            <li>I really gotta say how much I love the docking system.  </li>
            <li>Because this shaver is so good you don&#x27;t irritate your skin by shaving the same area over and over.&lt;br /&gt;Couldn&#x27;t be happier.</li>
            <li>Product looks sturdy n cool</li>
            <li>Got this one on a lightening deal and after using it 3 times, I would have paid full price.</li>
            <li>The ES8228S shaver is my fifth panasonic wet/dry shaver and is a nice improvement to my old linear.</li>
            <li>But they all stop any blinking at full charge.</li>
            <li>I use this primarily for shaving in the shower and was amazed to find that I can get a shave that is as-good-as or better than I was getting with more traditional razors.</li>
            <li>Love it so much, you can use it in the shower.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;UPDATE:  March, 2013  The battery still holds a full charge</li>
            <li>A popular auction site often features substantially lower offers.</li>
            <li>the shaver is charging it&#x27;s not bad.</li>
            <li>For the most part, the shave is great, just a couple areas around my neck and left side of my face (since I am right handed, I just gotta get the angles better as it&#x27;s bigger to hold then the Mach 3).      </li>
            <li>Nice construction, great fit, easy to use (once I got through the somewhat complicated manual).  </li>
            <li>EW8228S charges quickly - about an hour for a full charge.</li>
            <li>one is much better than my last models, and was a great deal at a Daily Deal at amazon.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m enjoy it</li>
            <li>So, what I do is I hop in the shower, get my face damp quickly, get my face out of the running water and lather up, and immediately shave with the Panasonic.</li>
            <li>After that it shaves quickly and closely.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a fast shave, easy to clean and recharges quickly.</li>
            <li>Norelcos also let you shave in a quick swirly motion</li>
            <li>After much research by me, I showed him a few I thought would work best based on reviews, price &amp; features.</li>
            <li>Its quick, no going over an area 5 times to get the cut.  </li>
            <li>I did the math and decided that even if it lasted only a year or so then a good electric razor would have been worth it.</li>
            <li>It does an OK job, but my cheap travel Braun M60 works considerably better for dry shaves.    </li>
            <li>SHAVES FACE AND HEAD SUPER CLOSE WITHOUT ANY SKIN IRRITATION.</li>
            <li>/&gt;In conclusion, a great shaver with all the current technology and features offered by the competition at a reasonable asking</li>
            <li>As a professional who sits with clients face to face all day, shave quality is the most important element I look for.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Highly recommend the shaver, but consider if you wouldn&#x27;t be better off buying one without HydraClean.</li>
            <li>With more beard growth it does take more to get through the thickness than normal but take it slow and it will do a great job.  </li>
            <li>I use a hot rag to soften and raise the whiskers, this shaver provides a really smooth shave that lasts.</li>
            <li>The Vortex shaver is clean, fast, and comfortable.</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t sure if it would be any better then the last couple of electric shavers he has own and used once only to discover that he didn&#x27;t like them.</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t live without it any more.</li>
            <li>I do feel that I could probably get a good 7 to 8 days worth of shaving before a re-charge, which is plenty for me since I don&#x27;t take long trips.</li>
            <li>Most of the time I just brush it clean after each shave, then give it a more thorough wet wash every couple of weeks.  </li>
            <li>but I always end up using it dry because it&#x27;s plenty good that way</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very convenient and works very quickly and well.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very convenient and works very quickly and well.</li>
            <li>The first shave with this razor was following a good \\&quot;clipping\\&quot; with my Wahl beard trimmer.</li>
            <li>Good shave dry.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve got a pretty thick beard and this is the best I&#x27;ve owned.</li>
            <li>VERY CLOSE SHAVE AND EASY TO USE.  </li>
            <li>The blinking light is not super bright</li>
            <li>Used dry, this shaver wasn&#x27;t any better than the many others I&#x27;ve tried over the years.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great for quick cleanup of the 5-o&#x27;clock shadow or after a few days of growth.</li>
            <li>I love it because it is no mess!</li>
            <li>Also, it had the nice effect of removing the top layer of dead skin off of my face,</li>
            <li>But a razor would be much easier to use when you need the silky smooth feel.  </li>
            <li>For those that claim that it is too loud...stop being girly men and enjoy a real man&#x27;s shaver....</li>
            <li>- smooth close shave  - battery lasts for several weeks  - easy to clean  </li>
            <li>They seem to clog the works and the shave, while comfortable, isn&#x27;t very close.    </li>
            <li>If you shave everyday, it is great.</li>
            <li>Also, to avoid cuts, I use the top and bottom foil while trying to avoid the slot cutter near the angles, like under my chin, and around my lips.</li>
            <li>Well worth the Amazon(not</li>
            <li>He uses it in the shower or at the sink, it gives a very close shave and is kind to his sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>It looks pretty cool too</li>
            <li>For several years I have struggled to find a good razor that wouldn&#x27;t leave my skin really irritated, but now I&#x27;ve found my solution.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I rarely use the cleaning system.</li>
            <li>But some may find it useful.  </li>
            <li>Actually to be fair, it went from a one star to a two star as a wet shaver.</li>
            <li>I really liked my last shaver (Panasonic ES8077S)</li>
            <li>Totally worth it.</li>
            <li>Another thing I like about the ES822S model is it is made in Japan not China which is rare</li>
            <li>The oil seems to leave a film on the blades and foil, so more frequent cleaning is needed.  </li>
            <li>So far, I&#x27;m pleased with the purchase.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and I expected this one to be equally as good as the others.</li>
            <li>The clearance websites have been featuring this shaver, and the price was compelling</li>
            <li>I got mine and then ordered three more for my adult daughters.  </li>
            <li>It seemed too good to be true, but Panasonic products have never let me down yet.</li>
            <li>By way of comparison, for my previous Braun, the location was perfect insofar as my hand could easily slip into the proper position to (de)activate it, without so much as a glance or a pause.  </li>
            <li>This one seems to fall nicely in the middle ground of high quality and good shave without extra</li>
            <li>Thesmaller the holes in the foil, the more comfortable the shave, but it may take longer to complete, particularly if you have thicker diameter hair.</li>
            <li>However, after 2 weeks of every other day shaves I switched to the wet-shave mode and was even more pleased.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think you will find any other shaver that does as good of a job without causing irritation.    </li>
            <li>I almost always look like I have a 5 o&#x27;clock shadow, even right after shaving.</li>
            <li>And the price is right too.</li>
            <li>I thought the idea of having the shaving gel right in the shaver neat</li>
            <li>I can actually get a closer shave with it than a razor, and with no razor burn so its pretty amazing at its niche.  </li>
            <li>The razor is very quiet, easy to clean, and charges quickly.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re also very convenient to clean, being water-resistant.  </li>
            <li>This shaver is easy to use, easy to clean, and provides the closest shave I&#x27;ve had when used wet.</li>
            <li>A fantastic product highly recommended.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using Norelco Quadra shavers for the past 8 years, quite happily; and had Braun and Eltron shavers before that</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad to see that the extra horsepower/rpm&#x27;s, 3 blades and improved screen - have made this shaver so much better than the old panasonics.  </li>
            <li>Other than these minor issues, it&#x27;s and excellent shaver.</li>
            <li>It takes kind of long to shave.  </li>
            <li>I know, I know, time for a new shaver, but I&#x27;m cheap and I like to use a product until it dies.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The sound of the shaver is different from others I&#x27;ve used - the high speed makes a whining sound as opposed to the familiar buzz.</li>
            <li>I had had about three Panasonic shavers previously and loved all of them.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve found that using too much hot water to try to soften up my beard hairs results in the skin becoming too soft, and the slot cutter on the razor (for longer hairs) grabs my skin and cuts it, leaving nicks.</li>
            <li>I just take it apart and rinse with warm water and liquid hand soap and let it dry which seems to be a lot simpler.</li>
            <li>shaving is very soft and smooth.    </li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s still very, very close.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very comfortable and has never left a nick or rash.  </li>
            <li>If i miss one day, this shaver doesn&#x27;t like it very much.</li>
            <li>Cleaning it under the sink using \\&quot;turbo\\&quot; mode and liquid soap and water (as the instructions say how to do) works fine, and of course the power cord plugs directly into the razor to charge it.</li>
            <li>With enough patience I can usually even get a good shave on these spots, but most of the time I just shave with the Panasonic and then use my traditional razor to tidy up those two spots afterward.    </li>
            <li>With a little patience this can be the best electric razor system for the money a young man, or old man, can expereince.      </li>
            <li>This was my first wet/dry electric razor</li>
            <li>I have never tried a foil razor before, and so was interested in what was offered.</li>
            <li>Not only because the charging unit doubles as a cleaning unit, but because you just snap off the head, and most of the time there&#x27;s nothing inside anyways.  </li>
            <li>My husband has never been interested in electric shavers.  </li>
            <li>The wonders of modern technology!  </li>
            <li>/&gt;After one month of use, I can now safely say that my initial impression was a bit conservative.  </li>
            <li>I was an avid Braun man before then.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the first electric razor that I have ever had.</li>
            <li>This is my first electric shaver I&#x27;ve purchased.</li>
            <li>Trimmer still pretty weak.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;Tired of forgetting to shave before showering and then having to break out the manual blades, I just got this thing today and did my first shave.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Being able to rinse off my razor under water or shave in the shower is a big plus.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Threw the first one away after having it for 4 years accidently.</li>
            <li>This supposedly conforms better to the different angles of your face.</li>
            <li>I prefer the springy coiled cord of the Braun which feels much higher in quality.</li>
            <li>This is my first arc foil razor and</li>
            <li>I tried my Panasonic ES8228S razor for the first time today.  </li>
            <li>This is also the first time that I&#x27;ve tried a foil shaver.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>cleaning base is also pretty cool; though gimicky, it&#x27;s kind of nice to be able to \\&quot;Set it and forget it.\\&quot;  </li>
            <li>The entire razor cost just a bit more than replacement foil/blade for the Braun (which was needed).  </li>
            <li>I gave up on the foil shavers and went back to Norelco because the foil shavers required more care in use to avoid burn.</li>
            <li>Part of what I didn&#x27;t like about blade shaving was the hot water ritual.</li>
            <li>I found out that the Braun replacement battery would cost more than I paid for the razor initially.</li>
            <li>This is my first electric razor (and I am over 50).  </li>
            <li>This is my first foil shaver</li>
            <li>burn for the &#x27;first time&#x27;.</li>
            <li>First impression :    </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a bit loud, but you get used to the \\&quot;buzzing\\&quot; sound it makes.  </li>
            <li>The only issue I have is that it doesn&#x27;t seem to be able to get all areas of my neck or under my chin.</li>
            <li>, I have returned this to Amazon (thanks Amazon!) and will be replacing it with an ES8249</li>
            <li>My husband and I have been married 25 years and have been kinda looking for an electric razor.  </li>
            <li>The sound is a bit too loud, so not everyone will like it.  </li>
            <li>It shaves closer and cuts more hair on the first pass, eliminating a 3rd or 4th pass.</li>
            <li>I have now started using it \\&quot;wet\\&quot; by warming my face with hot water, then applying a Neutragena shaving cream.</li>
            <li>I have now started using it \\&quot;wet\\&quot; by warming my face with hot water, then applying a Neutragena shaving cream.</li>
            <li>first thing in the morning.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve found over this period of time that the unit does not shave closely, even after replacing the blade six months after first using the unit.</li>
            <li>This was a hit and he uses it everyday and comments on how great a shave he gets from his new electric razor.</li>
            <li>I like the new LCD % display and it is better compared to the old style row of LED&#x27;s.</li>
            <li>The shaver is well designed for the hand, which allows easy and flexible use to complete a fast shave.</li>
            <li>This shaver gives me a great shave is half the time of my old one.</li>
            <li>course he had to try it out right away &amp; much to both our amazement</li>
            <li>After reading many reviews, the vast majority of which were highly positive, I ordered one for myself.</li>
            <li>For me, I need more than a 2 day growth for the whiskers to be long enough for the lifters to be able to grab hold for a close shave.  </li>
            <li>As for other features, I&#x27;m less impressed with the sideburn trimmer.</li>
            <li>I prefer to use a old toothbrush to clean it.</li>
            <li>Even with my favorite shaving lotion I still got some minor bumps and skin irritation from use, but after a week</li>
            <li>I bought this razor about 4 months ago and the first time I used it I was very disapointed.</li>
            <li>It leaves too many long hairs 5.</li>
            <li>I got a very close shave on first use without the nicks and cuts of the Braun.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve owned the Panasonic Nano Vortex since October 13th and shaved with it daily, yet the \\&quot;status\\&quot; light (a light that comes on to tell you to replace the soap cartridge) has yet to come on!</li>
            <li>After disappointments with several other razors, this is a welcome relief.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used it for a month now, and while its much more convenient than a blade shaver, its clearly not as close.  </li>
            <li>This is a bit high - but given the extraordinary quality of the shave and the incredibly reasonable cost of the whole unit, I&#x27;ll put up with it.</li>
            <li>This is a bit high - but given the extraordinary quality of the shave and the incredibly reasonable cost of the whole unit, I&#x27;ll put up with it.</li>
            <li>That was easy enough to fix by installing the cartridge.</li>
            <li>(I can easily get 5-6 shaves from it which saves you from packing any charging cables for short trips).  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve owned Panasonic Shavers previously and have always liked them.</li>
            <li>this is my 2nd one, this one is a much better perfomance and a new technologi saver</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using the same shave soap that I was using with the straight razor (Van Der Hagaan), applied with a boar bristle brush, and it provides sufficient lubrication while not clogging up the razor, as it rinses away easily in water.    </li>
            <li>The first charging/cleaning stand finally started to leak from my original shaver that went thru the wash.</li>
            <li>The first charging/cleaning stand finally started to leak from my original shaver that went thru the wash.</li>
            <li>the customers seemed to rate the Panasonic pretty high.</li>
            <li>Quality is very good and have never had one fail.</li>
            <li>and it was a cheap model which was ok, but the foil broke and it was hard to find a replacement.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s quiet and smooth, and gives a really close shave.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t bother with returning it to Panasonic, but I wasn&#x27;t too happy that I paid all this money for something that only lasted for a few months.</li>
            <li>The overall sound of the unit is reasonable.  </li>
            <li>I got this to replace a very well used Panasonic ES8066.</li>
            <li>Pro: Very close shave.</li>
            <li>It came with a unit for cleaning the shaver, which I haven&#x27;t used, so if the same shaver is available WITHOUT this cleaning unit, buy that one.  </li>
            <li>+ holds the charge REALLY well.</li>
            <li>I think its important to take the time to read the user manual, especially if you have never used a wet/dry electric before.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t shave quite as closely as a blade but does a very acceptable job.</li>
            <li>much* closer and</li>
            <li>*much* faster.</li>
            <li>ES8228S really shines.</li>
            <li>After reading about straight razors, I decided to give it a shot.</li>
            <li>I then switched to a real straight razor, and was pleasantly surprised...</li>
            <li>There&#x27;s no advantage to doing it in front of a mirror, as the Panasonic doesn&#x27;t wipe away the soap like a straight or disposable razor</li>
            <li>(God knows where and for how much).</li>
            <li>haha)</li>
            <li>(Really?.</li>
            <li>Step up to the modern world and go with electric.  </li>
            <li>I hadn&#x27;t really given this razor the credit it deserves.  </li>
            <li>It was ok but not really a close shave and a lot of ingrown hairs.  </li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t understand why Panasonic doesn&#x27;t advertise this product because they really have a winner.</li>
            <li>The self cleaning and drying features are also very convenient.&lt;br</li>
            <li>When it arrived I could not believe how beatifull it really is.</li>
            <li>But Panasonic also provides detailed instructions for cleaning with soap and water - a practical solution to a simple procedure.</li>
            <li>I just couldn&#x27;t see spending twice as much on the top-of-the-line Braun.     </li>
            <li>The Panasonic is much lighter and the motor is in the shaving head, shifting the balance from the handle into head.</li>
            <li>In addition to not liking the power cord, I don&#x27;t like the Panasonic cleaning system as much as the Braun.</li>
            <li>and it just felt cheap (it cost almost the same as the 8228).  </li>
            <li>Which is wierd because the wet shave is supposed to be a much better shave.</li>
            <li>In this case, since the razor is used to shave your face, it will be very close to your ears.  </li>
            <li>Thanks guys</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d much prefer if they gave us a car adapter instead.</li>
            <li>For what it&#x27;s worth, I&#x27;m over 60, and have tried every conceivable method,technique, product, and shortcut to shave grooming.  </li>
            <li>It will shave you very close....</li>
            <li>Highly recommended!  </li>
            <li>it really is a VERY close shave, I&#x27;m never pushing him away telling him his stubble is scratching me, his face is always smooth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s enough to light up the doorway with each blink.</li>
            <li>It feels like I&#x27;m in a cheap hotel with a flashing sign outside the window or something.</li>
            <li>The Panasonic just got a closer shave, a bit loud, but well worth it.</li>
            <li>I tried Broun before and it was ineffective and take so much time.</li>
            <li>The razor did not shave my neck very well at all</li>
            <li>provides a very close shave.</li>
            <li>Thanks Panasonic...</li>
            <li>it gives you a real close shave.</li>
            <li>He likes it and is much faster than shaving with cream and razor.</li>
            <li>This razor works well, holds a charge very well</li>
            <li>I purchased this electric shaver since I can no longer use a straight edge shaver.  </li>
            <li>Very close shave, didn&#x27;t use the cleaning features yet.</li>
            <li>Someone suggested a foil shaver and, after much hesitation, I purchased the Braun.</li>
            <li>Braun has hit the snooze button and no longer wants to get up in the morning with me.</li>
            <li>It is performing very well after about four years</li>
            <li>/&gt;Still loving it and using it everyday.</li>
            <li>The only difference between the two is the ES8228S adds a zippered vinyl travel case (vs cloth bag with draw strings) and the head has independent floating foil (each of the 3 foils is on their own suspension to track the curves of the face</li>

            <li>I&#x27;ve never had that experience, but unplugging after cleaning and charging is probably a good idea, as the Panasonic indicator stays at 100% for at least 48 hours.</li>
            <li>I mean a $250 shaver on sale for $78 should be a good deal.  </li>
            <li>The shave is very close; it does a better job than any other razor I&#x27;ve ever had.  </li>
            <li>Electric shaving has sure come a long way since I was young!  </li>
            <li>The shaver works better than any other Panasonic that I have used before.  </li>
            <li>In other words, it will take longer to get a refund that the time I was actually able to use the razor.  </li>
            <li>And you can clean it with soap and water (instructions are included in the manual), but getting it dry (esp in hot humid whether) is a trick.</li>
            <li>I am 72 yrs old and have had a full beard for nearly 40 years and my wife decided it was time to shave it off.  </li>
            <li>I dare you to compare the 2 razors back to back and honestly say the Braun is worth double the price.</li>
            <li>I purchased this at Amazon.com as a daily special.</li>
            <li>previously owned a Braun Synchro 7526 which I loved, especially the trimmer.</li>
            <li>The length of shave time has been cut in half from my old Remington and the shave is nice and close.  </li>
            <li>This is true even if it&#x27;s a hair that gets cut, but not cut as short as the others.</li>
            <li>First, all electric razors are loud and the 3-4 seconds</li>
            <li>I only purchased because of an Amazon sale, but would pay full retail if I ever needed another.  </li>
            <li>It comes with a 30 day Panasonic warranty that if you don&#x27;t like it, you can send it back for a full refund.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Shaving in the shower saves me time and until now panasonic had been the only company to offer a true wet/dry razor.</li>
            <li>No bad, just different.</li>
            <li>If the new ones are any thing like this, buy it!</li>
            <li>In fact, I start off with a quick shave with a razor to quickly get the stubble down closer to the skin and then follow up with the Panasonic.  </li>
            <li>This is a very minor observation, but the travel case is extremely cheap, but it does the job.  </li>
            <li>This is a very minor observation, but the travel case is extremely cheap, but it does the job.  </li>
            <li>I have always enjoyed Panasonic products and noticed this razor at half the asking price of the Braun.</li>
            <li>This actually happened to me in a duffel bag in my car, but luckily I heard it and pulled it out and turned it off.</li>
            <li>The self-cleaning function of this shaver is more of an annoying gimmick than useful feature - you better wash the shaver yourself than listen to 2 hours of loud vacuum-like sound coming from your bathroom.</li>
            <li>only negative I&#x27;ve found is that it doesn&#x27;t do a great job shaving the neck, but that just comes with the territory with electric razors.  </li>
            <li>Battery life per charge is adequate for several shaves.  </li>
            <li>Since then, I purchased the ES8228 and is the same razor with a different outer foil and travel case (scroll to the end for more information).</li>
            <li>main concern is a feature of the battery and charging system that I couldn&#x27;t know about before I bought the unit.</li>
            <li>Following Amazon reviewer Charles Enfield&#x27;s advice on this page, I ordered a bottle of Billy Jealousy Hydroplane shaving cream for the silicone smoothing, and I expect my future shaves with this Panasonic to produce yet better results.</li>
            <li>One carryover from my Braun experience: instead of filling the cleaning receptacle with tap water per the user instructions, I used diluted ethyl rubbing alcohol for the disinfectant effect in order to prevent any contact dermatitis, which I got many years ago from buildup on a Remington shaver that I only brushed and oiled.</li>
            <li>he did NOT have a single nick &amp; his face was smooth.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend the product</li>
            <li>This is a high quality shaver.  </li>
            <li>I recommend this item highly.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this razor for its shave quality.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommended.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommended.  </li>
            <li>All in all, I highly recommend this shaver.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this shaver although I understand it is being phased out for a newer model.  </li>
            <li>If a Product from China is of high quality then buy it from China.</li>
            <li>I had high hopes for this product when I purchased it a year ago.</li>
            <li>i reccomend it highly.</li>
            <li>My high priced Braun ended up in the travel bag.  </li>
            <li>I did alot of research on ALL electric shavers and almost was convinced to purchase a Braun; however; realized they were too high maintenance and costly to maintain.</li>
            <li>That unit was about 5 yrs old on its original set of blades and second set of batteries (it uses 2 AA NiMH inside).</li>
            <li>had Philps, Braun, and other more modest</li>
            <li>At a 1/3 to 1/2 the price of my other shaver, it dose a much better job, wow.  </li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t speak personally for it but from his reaction I&#x27;m pretty certain he&#x27;d rate it five stars as well.</li>
            <li>It would be nice to have a hard case for it, or some sort of lockout on the button to prevent this from happening.    </li>
            <li>5 is no different than the previous 4.s comfortably in hand, but I do stand by my original impression about it feeling plasticky in hand.  </li>
            <li>I really like it so far.</li>
            <li>With sensitive skin and a fast growing beard this works twice a day with no irritation to me.</li>
            <li>Was that thing really that loud?  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s loud, but there&#x27;s not too much buzzing on your skin.</li>
            <li>Legs and underarms that are shaved everyday - just like most men shave their face every day - need some TLC.</li>
            <li>It was an instant success.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using a Braun 8585 for the past several years, and haven&#x27;t been all that pleased with it, mostly because of the consumables and the fact the cleaning fluid evaporates whether you use it or not.    </li>
            <li>I use it everyday in the shower with nothing more than the water of the shower.  </li>
            <li>First off it gets loud, really loud.</li>
            <li>Is it worth extra money to have this?</li>
            <li>I got good shaving results for maybe a month or two of sporadic shavings (and I&#x27;m not that hairy, and my hair is relatively thin).</li>
            <li>It also did a good job with the fine hairs around my \\&quot;turkey neck\\&quot; with only a minimal of fine hairs left behind.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been an almost lifetime devotee to a major brand, have tried other well-known brands over the years and, this one comes out on top.</li>
            <li>Charges quickly, shaves very well (especially if I wet mt face first).  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used three different electric shavers over my life, none of them gave me a close shave, or were easy to use - this one does and is as simple as a razor to use.     </li>
            <li>Shaving is one of my least pleasant daily rituals.</li>
            <li>- performance doesn&#x27;t diminish with low battery  - good looking design  CONS:  - a little loud  - pivot action (gimmick)</li>
            <li>This older version is better for harsh beards but sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>I got this amazing little electric shaver on a Gold Box (or Lightning Deal) - I&#x27;d considered it a month or so earlier when it was also a GB deal.  </li>
            <li>Back in the day before Tesla invented electricity using Ben Franklin&#x27;s kite/key contraption, your only option was to go full bearded or use a straight razor and shaving cream for a close shave.  </li>
            <li>In other words with the Braun I have to frequently \\&quot;double check\\&quot; the closeness of the shave with my hand before moving on to the next area, whereas with the Panasonic I could usually tell much more easily just by sound and feel when I was finished with an area of my beard.&lt;br</li>
            <li>He told me he loves his new electric razor.</li>
            <li>So, I buy a new razor every 1-2 years.</li>
            <li>I purchased this unit from Amazon.com for $89.00 brand new with the cleaning unit(What a Bargain)</li>
            <li>I read that it takes a while to get used to a new razor</li>
            <li>and it made the unit come out like new.  </li>
            <li>I made some so it would be easier to handle than live bait.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve owned a high-end Panasonic shaver before so when it was time for a new unit I wanted to go with Panasonic again.</li>
            <li>hadn&#x27;t purchased a new razor in years</li>
            <li>I missed it until the new one showed up.</li>
            <li>Still runs but needs a new set of blades.</li>
            <li>Still runs but needs a new set of blades.</li>
            <li>Panasonic is making these units lighter, and more ergonomic, this model is weights less than half of my original Panasonic of 10+ years ago.</li>
            <li>The Braun I have shaves just as close in roughly the same amount of time, however this shaver somehow transmits better feedback to the user on closeness of the shave.  </li>
            <li>He has never used it wet yet because it does such a good job dry.</li>
            <li>Only time will tell if this was worth it, but so far I am optimistic.</li>
            <li>His face is very sensitive and he hasnt had any razor burns.  </li>
            <li>I tried my old Braun shaver and I went right back to the Panasonic.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m very pleasantly surprised with this electric razor!  </li>
            <li>However, I shouldn&#x27;t theoretically need to first reach for the razor and put up with the decibels.  </li>
            <li>I purchased my first Panasonic shaver back in 2007.  </li>
            <li>WOW!</li>
            <li>I have been a fan of the Panasonic razor since I bought my first one back in 2000.  </li>
            <li>had I been using it exclusively, however I had been using it simultaneously with a Braun model during the exact same time period, trying to decide between the two.</li>
            <li>I have been using this shaver for the past 8 months or so and absolutely love it.</li>
            <li>I have not replaced the detergent at all, so I  only wash it under hot water.</li>
            <li>It has taken panasonic 17 days to process my order and they finally returned my call after leaving them a pretty animated message.</li>
            <li>Wow!</li>
            <li>I was a little leery of another unit with a cleaner, but at under $80 it seemed an easy choice.  </li>
            <li>It feels appropriately heavy in the hand and the plastic isn&#x27;t particularly slippery or cheap feeling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>As a system, the cheap power cord and water based cleaner knock it down a notch for me.</li>
            <li>A new foil didn&#x27;t fix the problem, so I decided it was time to retire the old girl.</li>
            <li>Wow, does this thing ever live up to</li>
            <li>The shave is slightly less comfortable during the act, but doesn&#x27;t result in any lingering irritation.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried dry shaving with it, but it doesn&#x27;t give me a close shave, it irritates my sensitive skin, and it doesn&#x27;t remove that top layer of dry skin</li>
            <li>+ year old Braun 7526 Syncro with Clean and Charge finally had enough.</li>
            <li>For my beard, the one-pass shaving did not work well either, but this is my 3rd Panasonic shaver and they all pretty much shave the same.</li>
            <li>We live in a modern society and every second counts.  </li>
            <li>The new design here looked strange at first</li>
            <li>The build quality seems decent enough but not of the caliber of a decent Braun.  </li>
            <li>Update, 4 months later: The razor is still solid and super close shave.</li>
            <li>I started with an old Norelco rotary electric, and it would always miss large portions of hair on my face, and especially on my neck</li>
            <li>now this beautifully designed, easy to hold shaver has those aesthetics ruined by hunks of ugly black tape covering all the lights.</li>
            <li>I use it dry and am completely satisfied with it&#x27;s results but have heard that wet shaving will be even closer!</li>
            <li>Rather, I use it about once a week or less often when it is time to clean the unit.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have to worry about damage to the foils anymore or losing the clear plastic cover.</li>
            <li>I am sensitive to noise</li>
            <li>I switched to the Panasonic because the cleaning cartridges are much cheaper and the blades are supposed to last longer than the Braun.</li>
            <li>The only time when I don&#x27;t is when doing 3 passes with a straight razor...</li>
            <li>I stopped using it completely.  </li>
            <li>how much I stropped the blade (I tried a couple different blades, too, and they arrived shave-ready...</li>
            <li>darn near as close of a shave as foam and blades.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s near your ear</li>
            <li>Well Christmas came early for my husband, the dog ATE the package at the front door.  </li>
            <li>Still haven&#x27;t used all the features, but as far as shaving and cleaning its painless.&lt;br /&gt;Never wanted an elec. shaver because of the shaving bumps.</li>
            <li>Bought this razor nearly 2 months ago</li>
            <li>The ES8228 does have a \\&quot;pivot action</li>
            <li>The Vortex cleaning system is a nifty system which works much like my dishewasher on a smaller scale.  </li>
            <li>So far I have not had a problem in transitioning to the electric.  </li>
            <li>Never had a shave that close, loves the fact that it gets cleaned after use, and he doesn&#x27;t even touch the old blades anymore.  </li>
            <li>I purchased this shaver to replace my 7 year old Braun 7570 Syncro.</li>
            <li>cleaner does its job, kinda loud, but i dont mind,</li>
            <li>My old $30 Remmington did a quicker job.  </li>
            <li>and I used it until it completely broke.</li>
            <li>Calling it loud is an understatement.  </li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t bear to have that thing running anywhere near my face.&lt;br</li>
            <li> had been used Panasonic ES762 (vety old one) for along time, then i have just purchased this one.  </li>
            <li>Which naturally occurred when it was about 2 months out of warranty, and Panasonic wouldn&#x27;t budge.</li>
            <li>It is a bit loud though.</li>
            <li>you have sensitive skin, always getting nicks or irritation, give this razor a try.</li>
            <li>So loud in fact that I wear earplugs when I use it.</li>
            <li>As per their instructions, I sent the whole unit back to panasonic with the charger to be repaired or replaced.</li>
            <li>The old panasonic&#x27;s would give a close shave, but would miss a lot of the growth.  </li>
            <li>But beware, it is quite loud.</li>
            <li>This replaced a 4 year old Remington and the difference is night and day.  </li>
            <li>My old Remington has a rubber body.</li>
            <li>This shaver, by far, surpasses any shaver, of any brand that I have ever used.  </li>
            <li>So far I count on the battery to make it through trips.</li>
            <li>Only useful for regular moustache trimming</li>
            <li>What seems to make this a good shaver also makes it vulnerable to premature wear.</li>
            <li>If the Hydroplane seems too expensive, I&#x27;ve also used the shaver with inexpensive shaving oil with good results.  </li>
            <li>With this panasonic, my skin is not tough or irritated even with daily use.  </li>
            <li>I attribute this to a remarkable synergy of technologies: the 13,000 rpm magnetic drive motor with its speed and relative lack of vibration; the curved dual thin foils with the hyper-sharp cutting blocks; the fact that the head and foil assemblies can independently move and pivot to fit your face; the excellent centrally mounted long-hair capturing cutter (the 3rd cutting block - more of a slot in between the two foils).</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t keep the blade sharp enough to do a good job, and I would always start to get tugs and pulls after a few shaves which I couldn&#x27;t recover no matter</li>
            <li>I used it for the first time this morning, dry, and it does indeed shave closer and faster than my Brauns.</li>
            <li>Overall, I highly recommend this well-made shaver, especially if you won&#x27;t be using the beard trimmer much.</li>
            <li>only Negative thing I have to say about this purchase is that I first saw it in a Target store, but really couldn&#x27;t tell much about it (with all the screws they put in their high tech razors so no one will steal parts...bad idea Target),</li>
            <li>It did see a lot of use, but kind of disappointing that I&#x27;ll either have to purchase a separate beard trimmer or purchase a whole new shaver.  </li>
            <li>The best part of the new razor for me is when the foil starts to heat up after a minute or so, I just run it under cold water for a few seconds.</li>
            <li>I then bought a Panasonic (don&#x27;t remember the model, but it was a notch below ES8228S); it was OK, but not exceptional.</li>
            <li>As one who uses BOTH a safety razor followed by an electric everyday, all I can say after using the ES8228S even for the very first time is WOW!  </li>
            <li>The razor head seems like a decent shape overall.  </li>
            <li>I had an older Braun Razor that was an earlier \\&quot;Pulsonic\\&quot; series but the foil over the cutter block always ended up getting a hole in it</li>
            <li>ORDERED PRODUCT LAST MONTH IN OCTOBER TO REPLACE OLDER PANASONIC LINEAR SHAVER.</li>
            <li>This is my 3rd high end Panasonic shaver, and I will use nothing else.   </li>
            <li>I enjoy the fact I can use it wet or dry.  </li>
            <li>Now all I need is a fog free mirror - dream the impossible dream - Enjoy!</li>
            <li>The HydraClean unit can charge, clean, rinse, and dry in any combination (e.g. you can set it to just charge, or just dry or whatever combination).</li>
            <li>The HydraClean unit can charge, clean, rinse, and dry in any combination (e.g. you can set it to just charge, or just dry or whatever combination).</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used the Panasonic both wet and dry, and I got a close irritation free shave.  </li>
            <li>One thing to note is that if you do not clean the razor regularly you will have a fine powder from your trimmings all over the counter in your bathroom.</li>
            <li>Not only does the razor stay cool, but the wet foil glides over my face much easier than a dry foil.</li>
            <li>Thus far I&#x27;ve not wet shaved with this razor, nor have I ran it under water.</li>
            <li>It chagres really fast, so I don&#x27;t have to wait long if the battery is depleted.</li>
            <li>It also doesn&#x27;t deal with long hair very well, so I feel like I can&#x27;t skip a day.  </li>
            <li>A second and thrid pass normally takes care fo the problem.  </li>
            <li>Yes, it gives a terrific shave, nearly as close as a wet blade, and better than any other electric I have tried.     </li>
            <li>I have tried quite a few different electric shavers and this one most definitely tops them all!</li>
            <li>It recharges (via the cord or base) pretty quickly, but I had assumed that I would be able to use it either cordless or plugged in.</li>
            <li>shaves well; definitely a close shave, although for people like me, with a very, very hard facial hair, it might require several passages in order to achieve the result you&#x27;re looking for  + easy to clean.</li>
            <li>with any new shaver, there is some skin irritation as it performs slightly different than the Braun.</li>
            <li>Cleaning is easy, which is my complaint about Norelco.</li>
            <li>It truly shaved as close as the 5-blade Gillette (I use it dry) and was gentle as can be on my skin....</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin on my neck, and until recently I couldn&#x27;t shave every day.  </li>
            <li>He uses this...in a very big Hurry normally, sometimes everyday or every other day &amp; MOST of the time he doesn&#x27;t have any irritation or nicks.</li>
            <li>I usually take it without the charger to trips and has worked great for me during the trip (usually week long trips).</li>
            <li>After lots of research I decided upon the Panasonic ES8228S for a variety of reasons - the fact that I can use it in the shower was my first point of consideration, followed by the nanotech sharp blades and the motor speed.</li>
            <li>I know two other guys who also got this shaver, and they feel exactly as I do</li>
            <li>It is lightweight, can be used wet or dry, shaves very closely, holds a charge for nearly 2 weeks!, has an automatic cleaning base, and is beautiful!</li>
            <li>If I use it dry, it performs really well, but it really shines when I use it wet.  </li>
            <li>Like other reviewers, I&#x27;ve been using Braun shavers for years, generally the 7526, 7570, and higher models.</li>
            <li>I thought it was a little loud at first, but I&#x27;m used to it now.</li>
            <li>Recharging/cleaning is simple, easy and unattended and can be accomplished in less than an hour, even for an almost dead battery.   </li>
            <li>A couple minor issues for me is how loud it is when I am shaving near my sideburns.  </li>
            <li>The battery power doesn&#x27;t last too long, but you just plug it in and it&#x27;s ready to go.  </li>
            <li>shave the only problem so far is to get a close shave in the neck area.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know what&#x27;s happened, but apparently that&#x27;s not the case anymore</li>
            <li>The case it comes with is soft, and only holds the razor...</li>
            <li>I Have returned to using a regular old fashioned manual razor with Gillette Shaving gel</li>
            <li>After only about 3 months of &#x27;on and off&#x27; use, the outer foil on my 8228 wore through completely.  </li>
            <li>I can only get 3 complete shaves before having to recharge the battery.    </li>
            <li>My husband loves this shaver......after his old one finally hit the dust, after  years of use, I bought him another....</li>
            <li>The charging cable also charges the shaver directly so use of the \\&quot;HydraClean\\&quot; bath unit is entirely optional.</li>
            <li>The charging cable also charges the shaver directly so use of the \\&quot;HydraClean\\&quot; bath unit is entirely optional.</li>
            <li>and now I am free from those ridiculous blade prices.</li>
            <li>We just purchased the latest model, however it has 4 cutting blades and don&#x27;t like it nearly as much as this wet/dry shaver.  </li>
            <li>I have been using electric shavers for nearly four decades - starting with Norelcos, moving on to Braun, and recently a couple of Remingtons.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried the wet shave a few times but mostly use it dry.</li>
            <li>Well, with haveing no other alternative I did some research on the net and found the Panasonic Nano Arc Foil Shaver.</li>
            <li>In addition to that the display on the razor only partially works now and it is difficult to tell exactly how much charge is left on the razor and if I need to clean it or replace the blades.</li>
            <li>I have a very fast growing, thick, heavy, dark beard, combined with soft, sensitive, light brown skin.</li>
            <li>The Braun had been gotten really loud over the past couple of years, due to a loose fitting foil block.</li>
            <li>However, given my rough beard and preference for the convenience of dry-shaving, it took far too long to get a decent shave and even then, substantial stubble remained.  </li>
            <li>Clearly the battery life is influenced by how long one takes to shave and since I wear a beard and moustache</li>
            <li>I have a fairly light beard, but have been plagued by other shavers missing neck hairs.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also a bit loud (and long) when it runs in the cleaning cycle.</li>
            <li>and it also helps clean and charge your razor.my only problem and complaint</li>
            <li>With the unbelievably high cost of replacement batteries and blades, expensive shavers like these are pretty much disposable items after way too short a life</li>
            <li>they would just dull too quickly.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend it using shaving cream with it due to closeness</li>
            <li>in all, it&#x27;s clearly a quality unit with unbelievable performance at a real world price.</li>
            <li>All in all, it&#x27;s clearly a quality unit with unbelievable performance at a real world price.</li>
            <li>The lithium ion battery really does take less than an hour to fully charge the unit and the Nickel Hydroxide batteries that come in Braun&#x27;s?</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve always had a problem with stray long hairs down in my neck - and the ES8228S is the first shaver I&#x27;ve ever had</li>
            <li>Because of this, if I miss even a single hair shaving, it shows up rather clearly.</li>
            <li>I never got serious razor burn or a rash with the Braun, but the redness, especially on my neck, is significantly reduced with the Panasonic.</li>
            <li>After experiencing such an excellent wet shave I was expecting similar results when dry shaving, but was somewhat disappointed.</li>
            <li>Use the shaver with dry hands as it is very slippery when wet.</li>
            <li>Battery life DOES seem a bit short (down 10% when I shave, but since it only displays 10% increments, perhaps it shows 90% when it&#x27;s really at 99%?).  </li>
            <li>Given how good this thing shaves with a fresh cutting block, this will probably be the first shaver I&#x27;ve owned where I don&#x27;t resent replacing the cutting block every year.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Given how good this thing shaves with a fresh cutting block, this will probably be the first shaver I&#x27;ve owned where I don&#x27;t resent replacing the cutting block every year.    </li>
            <li>LOVES the snooze button a little too much)</li>
            <li>Shave time for me is about 5 minutes, but I&#x27;m picky and keep going over those tough spots under my jaw until they&#x27;re silky smooth.</li>
            <li>I think it comes down to matching the type of foil on the shaver to the thickness of your particular hair.</li>
            <li>My new shaver was/is just fine, but the first time I used the cleaning base, it spit up cleaning solution all over the counter and promptly shorted out.</li>

            <li> I LOVE IT!!!!  </li>
            <li> As of now, I am very happy with it.</li>
            <li> In fact, this is the THE BEST electric razor I have ever used, and now wish that I had never fallen for the \\&quot;women&#x27;s\\&quot; razor scheme.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used the Braun for years, thinking it was the best thing out there.  </li>
            <li> im very happy</li>
            <li> This is the best shaver I have ever used.</li>
            <li> A note: this razor works best for me if I shave EVERY day.</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful shaver!  </li>
            <li> That&#x27;s perfect for me.  </li>
            <li> He says it&#x27;s the BEST and he esp.</li>
            <li> It is the best electric I have ever used, and it isn&#x27;t even close.  </li>
            <li> This razor is just awesome!  </li>
            <li> but I got a great deal at Amazon.com!  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a heck of a performer and rate it as giving you the closest and best shave one could have.</li>
            <li> Best electric shaver ever.</li>
            <li> A great product!  </li>
            <li> but gosh, it is great!  </li>
            <li> The best part is I don&#x27;t get cuts anymore.  </li>
            <li> This is the best shaver</li>
            <li> I also got this for a great price on AMAZON.COM!  </li>
            <li> The floating head is awesome as is the speed it</li>
            <li> Best ever!</li>
            <li> Probably the best thing I like about it is that it doesn&#x27;t have a lot of gimmicks.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never reviewed a product before but would be remiss if I didn&#x27;t say that this is the best electric shaver I&#x27;ve owned in 50+ years.  </li>
            <li> best electric shave ever...</li>
            <li> This razor is awesome.</li>
            <li> I am very happy with it!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not over-exaggerating when I say that this razor is truly one of the best purchases I have ever made.</li>
            <li> the best shave I&#x27;ve ever had.</li>
            <li> best thing about the Panasonic Nano Vortex 8282s, is that they sell the foil and cutter block separately!</li>
            <li> I have found that using Lectric Shave works best before shaving.</li>
            <li> great job Amazon!</li>
            <li> The best one before now was the Braun Series 7 pulsonic.  </li>
            <li> Superb with shave cream.</li>
            <li> Another great shave!</li>
            <li> The best shaver money can buy!</li>
            <li> The ES8228 shaver itself is excellent.</li>
            <li> did like the cleaning system, but it was not the greatest to use.</li>
            <li> Braun&#x27;s cleaning system seems to be the best, but the shave is not.</li>
            <li> Best Shaver I have ever owned.</li>
            <li> I looked at the reviews and this one had the best review for the price.  </li>
            <li> Best razor I ever had.  </li>
            <li> Great QUALITY!  </li>
            <li> this is the best in a market, also Amazon has the best price.</li>
            <li> VERY HAPPY WITH PURCHASE AND RECOMMEND THIS PRODUCT TO ALL THAT WILL LISTEN.</li>
            <li> I am still very happy with Panasonic shavers.</li>
            <li> The best part, a bonus if you will, is the Panasonic is water-resistant.</li>
            <li> I rate the shave quality as excellent.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t pass it up and when knowing he wanted it that was perfect.</li>
            <li> Love this shaver!!!</li>
            <li> The Panasonic Vortex is a very good electric shaver.  </li>
            <li> i changed my rating from 1 to 4 stars, it does give a very good shave if you push the blades against the shaving surface.</li>
            <li> The Panasonic does a very good job.  </li>
            <li> it is a very good product.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall this is a very good product, well designed and executed.</li>
            <li> A very nice compact shaver at a great price that does a great job!!</li>
            <li> Beautiful product.  </li>
            <li> and we are both very happy about the ease of use and cleaning and most of all, the close shave!</li>
            <li> After spending a great deal of money over the years on \\&quot;women&#x27;s\\&quot; electric shavers I decided that if I am to get what I&#x27;m looking for then</li>
            <li> It turned out to vbe a great decision.  </li>
            <li> Great job Panasonic on this one.  </li>
            <li> The shaver itself works great after all this time.</li>
            <li> Works great and shaves close.</li>
            <li> - Great for use in the shower.</li>
            <li> and it seems to work great.   </li>
            <li> The cleaning/charging station works great.  </li>
            <li> This is a great shaver.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s just a great product</li>
            <li> and I would recommend it to anyone looking for a really great, close shave.</li>
            <li> Panasonic Linear shavers are great.</li>
            <li> The Cleaner/charger station makes a great stand.</li>
            <li> The convenience is great as when I am in a rush in the morning, I just pop the shaver in the dock and forget about it.    </li>
            <li> Anyway this Panasonic foil type razor is great.</li>
            <li> Plus, Amazon has great deals on the Panasonic stuff which I just couldn&#x27;t pass up.</li>
            <li> I use Gillette Fusion shaving gel and it works great.</li>
            <li> Great price with a rebate made it a bargain.  </li>
            <li> Great amazon price.</li>
            <li> The cleaning system works well and the visible charging indicator is great.  </li>
            <li> &quot; feeling that I always experienced with my Norelco.  </li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s a great shaver for your wife or girlfriend.ve with this item as I have and in the women&#x27;s line, it&#x27;s a great shaver for your wife or girlfriend.</li>
            <li> Great shaver</li>
            <li> The cleaning and charging system is GREAT....</li>
            <li> We both liked this one best &amp; ordered</li>
            <li> But even this great unit didnt match shaving with a blade for closes, and it didn&#x27;t like it if you took 1-2 days off from shaving.  </li>
            <li> It works great in all settings.</li>
            <li> Holds the charge great.</li>
            <li> this is really a great shaver.</li>
            <li> great combo.</li>
            <li> The cleaning system is great except when away from home</li>
            <li> The Panasonic shaves the closest I&#x27;ve experienced and almost never misses the neck hairs.</li>
            <li> Perfect for my vacation razor,easier for me then my Braun to take along even though I do love the Braun.</li>
            <li> gimmicks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I chose the Panasonic over many  others and have to say it shaves the best of any shaver I&#x27;ve owned.</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with the product and am extremely happy.</li>
            <li> This is easily the best electric razor I&#x27;ve owned.</li>
            <li> Good shaver been using it for some time now and still works like the day I used it.</li>
            <li> I got a good shaver this time, AND</li>
            <li> so I will just give my opinion based on the fact that I switched from the good ol&#x27; razor blade to this electric system.    </li>
            <li> That helped me a good deal because otherwise I would never have understood the cleaning cycle operation.   </li>
            <li> It is superb in the shower with soap - smooth and efficient.  </li>
            <li> For the money id try something else doesnt work too good and takes 20-30 minutes to shave....</li>
            <li> Also, the blades were good for about 1.5 shaves before I had to replace them...</li>
            <li> That said, I learned about preparation and good shave soaps..</li>
            <li> I have yet to use an electric shaver that does as good a job as a blade.</li>
            <li> Then I noticed the results weren&#x27;t so good anymore, and I started getting irritation.</li>
            <li> razors and has been on the search for a really GOOD one forever.  </li>
            <li> or so I was good.  </li>
            <li> This had good reviews</li>
            <li> and I thought it was a good price.  </li>
            <li> With frustration boiling over, and seeing these good reviews, I had to give in and buy an ES8228S.      </li>
            <li> but I didn&#x27;t take as good of care of it as I should have so had to replace it with this one.      </li>
            <li> I would pull and stretch the skin while shaving and not once did I get a good shave.</li>
            <li> This is a good razor.  </li>
            <li> I can leave for work in the morning knowing that my skin looks good</li>
            <li> that did a good job of getting these.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Holds its charge for good period.</li>
            <li> Good luck to all you shavers on the electric shaver quest....</li>
            <li> I did some research and the ES8228S looked like a good</li>
            <li> The docking station is a good place to keep your razor when it&#x27;s not in use</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;d be able to get an incredibly close shave.  </li>
            <li> Great shave, great charge, easily cleaned (with tap water or the shower).  </li>
            <li> This is an excellent razor and I&#x27;m glad to recommend it to others looking for a good razor that doesn&#x27;t try to do more than than</li>
            <li> and he&#x27;s always been very satisfied with its shave.</li>
            <li> This is a great shaver for the most part.  </li>
            <li> GREAT, BETTER</li>
            <li> It was an awesome deal with the $30 discount, glad I grabbed it when it was available.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it for a couple of months now and love it!  </li>
            <li> more!  </li>
            <li> to continue using it, but after 7 years the cleaner/recharger won&#x27;t &amp;#34;clean&amp;#34; any more, and I can&#x27;t find a replacement (still looking!).</li>
            <li> Love this product!</li>
            <li> I purchased this exact shaver about 3 years ago and it is still working perfectly.  </li>
            <li> Who cares, anyway, the shave is great, and maintenance is easy.</li>
            <li> VERY GOOD SHAVER, WORTH THE MONEY.</li>
            <li> Amazing.</li>
            <li> The unit is light and gives a great shave.  </li>
            <li> Cuts amazingly close.</li>
            <li> He is THRILLED with this razor.</li>
            <li> but soon I liked it.</li>
            <li> Since then I&#x27;ve been using a Mach 3 Power shaver and while I liked the close shave, I would get plenty of nicks and cuts on my neck.  </li>
            <li> He absolutely thinks it is the greatest thing!  </li>
            <li> and I liked the idea of the 13,000 RPM linear Panasonic motor.</li>
            <li> In all honestly...</li>
            <li> I used to own a panasonic that I got as a gift about 5 years ago</li>
            <li> The addition of some silicon pads on the grip would be nice.</li>
            <li> the linear head promotes a nice shaving movement.</li>
            <li> The beard disappears very quickly and afterward your skin feels remarkable unburned.</li>
            <li> The good news is that this razor gives you an excellent shave if you use it in the shower, but you will still get a good shave if you are using it dry.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very happy with this purchase and would highly recommend to All.</li>
            <li> As a Gold Box special item, the price was great too.</li>
            <li> best price and free shipping with extremely quick shipping time.  </li>
            <li> My radiation treatments begin tomorrow, I feel very confident and pleased with my purchase.</li>
            <li> For me Panasonic is the best wet/dry shaver on the market that I have been able to find at a reasonable price as well and will continue to be a customer of theirs.</li>
            <li> It shaves quickly and does a great job.</li>
            <li> I just follow the instructions for washing the head each time when it needs recharging and the cleaning is very easy and thorough.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It cleans automatic, you can do manualy too, very easy, but sometimmes</li>
            <li> Awesome for sensitive skin!</li>
            <li> Ist very good at shaving very close....</li>
            <li> A bit pricey but well worth the money, a great product.</li>
            <li> Given the great price that Amazon offered, it was worth it</li>
            <li> this is the best shaver i have ever had so far.</li>
            <li> The best I have had so far.</li>
            <li> Best electric shaver I have owned by far.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s been about a week now, and I am loving it more each day.  </li>
            <li> I reviewed ALL electric razors for my man, this one by far is the best purchase for your money.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Impressions: The design is comfortable in the hand, it&#x27;s well made, and fairly trim and compact.</li>
            <li> It comes with a beautiful leather case and with the wood grain and gold accents, it seems that Panasonic designed it to actually fit comfortably in one&#x27;s hand.</li>
            <li> but once I did that the seal was just not as good as it originally was.      </li>
            <li> This one performs perfectly for him and so far the quality seems to be outstanding.  </li>
            <li> Excellent - use it for those &#x27;in-between&#x27; days when I really don&#x27;t want to break out the double-edge or if I just want a nice quick shave.  </li>
            <li> This was the first Panasonic I tried, and I got a great Gold Box deal on it about 4 months ago.  </li>
            <li> Very comfortable grip too.</li>
            <li> This unit is very, very good at shaving close - even better then the ES8066 did when it was new.</li>
            <li> I wanted to make sure</li>
            <li> An outstanding buy.  </li>
            <li> I have been using Braun razors for many years.  </li>
            <li> so I had some questions for sure.</li>
            <li> The ever increasing price of razor blades make consideration of a quality electric razor a budget item for many of us.</li>
            <li> But like many women I like to use an electric razor - and ones \\&quot;made for women\\&quot;</li>
            <li> They were both OK.  </li>
            <li> The basic functionality of the shaver, however, is excellent - better than Braun, even.</li>
            <li> but this one is 125$ and better</li>
            <li> i love it</li>
            <li> I primarily looked at the nice Norelco Rotaries, and then foil razors.</li>
            <li> is probably better for your hearing then when you crank that favorite song up on the radio.</li>
            <li> Purchased this unit more than 2 years ago.</li>
            <li> The shaver has a nice, light feel in your hand.  </li>
            <li> The smoother the foils go across your face the closer and better the shave.</li>
            <li> I researched many shavers on Amazon and decided to purchase this as suprise Christmas gift.  </li>
            <li> No matter how often I go over my face with the shaver I still feel like it should do better.  </li>
            <li> It is easy to clean and give you a surprisingly close shave.  </li>
            <li> My husband had a Panasonic razor that lasted for probably 20 years and if we had been able to find some replacement parts, he would still be using it.  </li>
            <li> The shave is close and I am getting better at the angles and applied pressure to get it closer each day.  </li>
            <li> There are many combinations you can choose from.  </li>
            <li> it is ok to do it auto.</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> I love the shave and the service I have goten from them.</li>
            <li> Gone through many electric ones</li>
            <li> I also like the cleaning syatem which keeps my shaver is top shape between shaves.</li>
            <li> , i tried that, didn&#x27;t work much better.</li>
            <li> OK, on with the review.</li>
            <li> Most noticeable is the weight and balance.</li>
            <li> I actually enjoy shaving now!     </li>
            <li> This is my 3rd Panasonic shaver and it is also the best one that I have owned.  </li>
            <li> but with the 8228 I seem to be able to get a better shave on my neck as well.</li>
            <li> Love love love this shaver.</li>
            <li> Then I decided it would be better for my career to shave more than once a week.</li>
            <li> and I have to say it gives me a better shave than the Braun</li>
            <li> own a Simpson 886-2 sound level meter.  </li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t bother me since I shave in the morning, but just wanted to make sure that you don&#x27;t think that it&#x27;s silent.&lt;br</li>
            <li> This is much better.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s even better -</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve ended up using it once a week for the lubrication effect - and according to the docs I should be able to use it for 3 months at that usage level.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve ended up using it once a week for the lubrication effect - and according to the docs I should be able to use it for 3 months at that usage level.</li>
            <li> I know you&#x27;ll fall in love with this item as I have and in the women&#x27;s line</li>
            <li> I also can&#x27;t say that this model is any better than the less-expensive Panasonic wet-dry shavers on the market.  </li>
            <li> I said it was my favorite shaver.</li>
            <li> But most of the time that&#x27;s no problem.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this razor for more than 6 months now.</li>
            <li> I love this product.  </li>
            <li> I am extremely pleased with it.</li>
            <li> Amazon is my favorite e-shop.</li>
            <li> Couldn&#x27;t get a better shave.</li>
            <li> My Norelco holds most of the hair inside.  </li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m extremely pleased with this product.    </li>
            <li> I am glad I bought it.</li>
            <li> Were it able to, I&#x27;d have rated it a 5.</li>
            <li> Amazon did a great job with the speed of the delivery and that part was flawless, however, the razor itself left much to be desired.</li>
            <li> how many weeks?)</li>
            <li> I have used many shavers including Braun Syncro, Norelco, and Remington.</li>
            <li> I read the reviews that said the opposite for this panasonic - that it works best when you&#x27;ve shaven the day before.  </li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t agree more.  </li>
            <li> and this was a fantastic choice!  </li>
            <li> so many years ago was it caused a severe rash on my neck.  </li>
            <li> This is an outstanding product.  </li>
            <li> I am amazed at how I don&#x27;t cut myself any more.</li>
            <li> LOVE THE CLEANER, WOULD DEFENETLY RECOMEND TO ANYONE</li>
            <li> They were all thrilled and will really enjoy them.  </li>
            <li> I may be ordering more for my sons-in-law.  </li>
            <li> After many hours of research I thought I wanted another Braun...</li>
            <li> their top of the line Pulsonic model.</li>
            <li> The top of the line Braun can be rinsed under water but not used \\&quot;wet\\&quot; or with creams or lotions.</li>
            <li> I was hoping they could have supplied a better case to hold the cord and shaver for extended trips.</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m sure there will be plenty of room in there for a cord.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> purchasing, this razor still continues to be my favorite.</li>
            <li> The results are better.</li>
            <li> It just keeps going, still love it and have recommended it to many others.</li>

            <li> It just keeps going, still love it and have recommended it to many others.</li>
            <li> I have been able to extend the life for a couple more years by using them with the cord attached.</li>
            <li> The shaver works great, does a very close shave, the trimmer is a nice capability, useful unless you need very fine work done.</li>
            <li> positive thing about the product is it doesn&#x27;t hurt skin at all,, may be this is a best (or good) option for a sensitive light haird beards..</li>
            <li> Received promptly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Proved a nice, clean shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> cause it makes this baby good as new every time!!!</li>
            <li> It is now very clean.</li>
            <li> It is now very clean.</li>
            <li> If you haven&#x27;t used an electric shaver before, or in a long while, like me, you&#x27;ll want to use the best shaving cream/lotion/whatever you can find for yourself.</li>
            <li> The batteries hold a charge for over a week which is almost as good as when I first got it.  </li>
            <li> Pretty good idea</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s pretty good.</li>
            <li> My tips for use: Warm water; Skintimate (women&#x27;s shaving gel with baby oil); a quick double/triple blade shave; rinse and re-apply gel</li>
            <li> Very different, but great in their own way.</li>
            <li> No irritation or pulling at the beard hairs, easy to clean and adjust, nice trimmer for ears and beard around the mouth.  </li>
            <li> - It is very easy to clean.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Luckily, the shaver is very easy to clean manually.</li>
            <li> I am so pleased at how well this razor is able to clean up my face.</li>
            <li> The price from amazon was $99.00 with free shipping, better than anyone.</li>
            <li> This gives me the smoothest most comfortable shave I&#x27;ve ever had.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very happy with it as a wet shaver in the shower.</li>
            <li> The most important question is How close does it shave?  </li>
            <li> The cleaning cart for this won&#x27;t evaporate, but more importantly....</li>
            <li> Its at its best in the shower and thats the only time that its not painful to use.</li>
            <li> Good shaver for the modern man.</li>
            <li> This is a powerful and effective shaver.  </li>
            <li> So easy to use.  </li>
            <li> Also, it was easy to miss spots, and too easy to get cut.    </li>
            <li> No fuss, no bother, and easily maintained.  </li>
            <li> The shave with the poroso shaving soap is amazing and it litterally is better than a straight razor shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Good shaver so far used it for 10 days now gets better with each</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s still going strong</li>
            <li> Still going strong.</li>
            <li> Still going strong.</li>
            <li> It recharges very easily and quickly and gives a smooth shave.  </li>
            <li> I have tried replacing foils and blades once years ago and it wasn&#x27;t nearly as good as a new shaver.</li>
            <li> For added measure and the price of new blades and foil, I found a really good deal on the ES8228S shaver.</li>
            <li> For added measure and the price of new blades and foil, I found a really good deal on the ES8228S shaver.</li>
            <li> I bought this razor for my husband and he loves it for the no tugging and easy, smooth shave.  </li>
            <li> Very quick and smooth shaves.  </li>
            <li> Having been a loyal Braun user, I can say I am pleased with this product.  </li>
            <li> The cleaner works great and the shaver looks new and smells fresh every day.  </li>
            <li> Easy to use and easy to clean.</li>
            <li> Every once in a while you run into a product that is so outstanding that it improves the task of shaving, gives you a great deep shave  or a quick touch up.</li>
            <li> Waterproof means it easy to clean.</li>
            <li> The specs indicate that it should provide 20 shaves between charges, but that must be for men with light beards.  </li>
            <li> Shaving with a Panasonic Linear model is definitely comfortable.  </li>
            <li> I am assuming that Panasonic will repair or replace the shaver, for free.  </li>
            <li> I do it by sound</li>
            <li> the charger won&#x27;t fit in it.</li>
            <li> It gives you a smooth, comfortable and close shave.</li>
            <li> I paid 89.99 for it and free shipping.  </li>
            <li> However, the charging base/cleaning unit died after 6 months of light usage.</li>
            <li> so I wanted to get him one that was easy to use and clean.  </li>
            <li> This razor is fantastic.  </li>
            <li> Overall, a great shaving experience and would recommend to anyone else.</li>
            <li> Great close shave, especially on my upper lip.</li>
            <li> With that said the construction of these shavers did allow me to take it apart easily and clean it up</li>
            <li> Provides a smooth shave without irriatation.</li>
            <li> (I use it for setting up surround sound systems.)  </li>
            <li> Also keep in mind that as the source is moved closer to your ears, the sound level increases.  </li>
            <li> my face and neck are smooth,</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had a cheap electric razor for years.</li>
            <li> /&gt;In use, the ES8228S feels incredibly light and smooth on your face.</li>
            <li> Also the cleaning stuff can be purchased on Amazon or Ebay quite cheap</li>
            <li> It shaves closely and comfortably.</li>
            <li> For the quality of the shave I&#x27;m happy to do that even earlier!    </li>
            <li> Felt so comfortable with this combo</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s great on my Italian beard.</li>
            <li> I would take a week off from shaving and the skin irritation would go away - then my face would be smooth as a baby&#x27;s</li>
            <li> I like this shaver in nearly every way, easy to clean, cuts well, good battery performance, etc.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m going to look for a replacement that doesn&#x27;t sound like a prop plane.</li>
            <li> i enjoy using the vortex panasonic shaver.</li>
            <li> Cheap razors were terrable</li>
            <li> I have been happily using it daily for almost 4 years.</li>
            <li> almost enjoy shaving.</li>
            <li> He saw it on amazons deals and I the price was fantastic.</li>
            <li> So far so good.</li>
            <li> I have been using electric razors for more then 60 years and have found that, although an electric shaver may look more modern,  the shave hasn&#x27;t improved,  </li>
            <li> It seemed like a good idea to test this razor against my old Norelco that I&#x27;ve been using for years.  </li>
            <li> Very rarely does he have irritation or nicks.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The razor fits comfortably in hand, but I do stand by my original impression about it feeling plasticky in hand.  </li>
            <li> oh so smooth and fresh!</li>
            <li> the Panasonic gives a pretty darn smooth shave; not as good as a straight edge but almost.</li>
            <li> It still isn&#x27;t appreciatively better than a shaver that is many years older with its original blades.</li>
            <li> The online company I bought mine from out of Texas was quick to send and easy to buy from.</li>
            <li> and .... he has found his new favorite razor!  </li>
            <li> This Panasonic seems to provide a better shave compared to the others and it is also very fast.</li>
            <li> Super smooth results, but had to do some pressure on my face to get it really smooth.</li>
            <li> Optimistic at first, I am glad that I bought it.  </li>
            <li> Still no problems and still using all the original parts.  </li>
            <li> Still no problems and still using all the original parts.  </li>
            <li> But the outcome was worth it!  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Norelco for decades; I guess I should stick with what I&#x27;m familiar with.</li>
            <li> I usually don&#x27;t write reviews after one use but this thing is just AWESOME.</li>
            <li> --Rich</li>
            <li> It shaves more hairs on the first pass, the cream eliminates any friction, and gives me the closest shave yet with an electric (some areas of the face feel like I shaved with a blade).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li> so I clean it once a week or so and keep the bathroom door shut.</li>
            <li> I clean it once a week.</li>
            <li> Also, with the foil razor, it turns most of the hair (when it&#x27;s short) into powder, and it&#x27;s nice to just rinse it away in the shower.</li>
            <li> The choice provided for self clean or use of the unit&#x27;s clean cycle provides longer life for the shaver and the cleaner system and Pack.  </li>
            <li> I can choose whether I want to clean the shaver, clean and charge it</li>
            <li> Very solidly built and best feature is how it self cleans by dripping some liquid soap on the blades, starting the razor, the adding warm water and letting work up a lather, and finally just run under warm water faucet. . . .</li>
            <li> and I used to have to use a razor to get it really clean</li>
            <li> It has an odor that I find not to my liking, but the unit is certainly clean and somewhat lubricated afterwards.</li>
            <li> You can also clean the unit with water and hand soap using a an \\&quot;ultrasonic\\&quot; speed mode.</li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s clean as a whistle all the time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li> so it&#x27;s clean as a whistle all the time.    </li>
            <li> The Panasonic also employs a soap cartridge rather than an alcohol cartridge to clean the razor in it&#x27;s station.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had several electric razors in my lifetime (85 years) and this is by far, the best one I have ever had.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s only redeeming qualities are that it looks nice and it works in the shower.</li>
            <li> Clean, close shaves with no irritation, and that&#x27;s what it&#x27;s all about.</li>
            <li> Also definitely the best electric razor i&#x27;ve used thus far whether norelco or braun shavers.</li>
            <li> Do not neglect this; you need to clean it often.  </li>
            <li> I like the fact you can manually clean the Panasonic or use the solution provided.</li>
            <li> The cleaning gets the blades cleaner and they smell soapy clean and not chemically clean.</li>
            <li> When a motor became loud and inefficient, sometimes I&#x27;d send it to a repair shop for $70 or more, but this time I applied that sum toward a Panasonic ES8228S, and I&#x27;m glad I did.</li>
            <li> I notice that another reviewer claims that the alcohol solution in his Braun Clean &#x27;n Charge stand caused a fire.</li>
            <li> , just dry it (if I cleaned it myself), or just charge it (which is great because I can get full use of each charge).  </li>
            <li> I felt that using pure water and the cleaning/lubrication cartridge is probably better for the longevity of the razor.</li>
            <li> I clean it by hand, I don&#x27;t use the cleaning dock - I&#x27;d have gotten the dock-less model had this one not been such a good deal.  </li>
            <li> The ES8228 provides a clean, close shave while maintaining a good battery charge over several weeks.  </li>
            <li> It recharges quickly, feels right in the hand, and pivots easily across the contours of the face.</li>
            <li> I did a lot of research and finally decided that this unit was the most suitable for my needs.</li>
            <li> The Braun shavers I have had for many years have always been very reliable for both.</li>
            <li> Electric shavers used to be simple and provide a fairly close shave.  </li>
            <li> i used philips norelco cool art</li>
            <li> I found out about shaving with the grain, then across the grain, then against the grain (full 3 passes).</li>
            <li> The disadvantages of the straight razor were the difficulty shaving around my chin and neck, as well as the problems of grain on my neck, the steep learning curve of stropping (and shaving), the concentration required to avoid getting too many nicks (I ALWAYS got nicks), and the time...</li>
            <li> I thought it was over-zealous marketing, but I&#x27;ll be darned if it wasn&#x27;t true.  </li>
            <li> I eventually stop and fee that it is good enough.  </li>
            <li> I paid full price;</li>
            <li> I really gotta say how much I love the docking system.  </li>
            <li> Because this shaver is so good you don&#x27;t irritate your skin by shaving the same area over and over.&lt;br /&gt;Couldn&#x27;t be happier.</li>
            <li> Product looks sturdy n cool</li>
            <li> Got this one on a lightening deal and after using it 3 times, I would have paid full price.</li>
            <li> The ES8228S shaver is my fifth panasonic wet/dry shaver and is a nice improvement to my old linear.</li>
            <li> But they all stop any blinking at full charge.</li>
            <li> I use this primarily for shaving in the shower and was amazed to find that I can get a shave that is as-good-as or better than I was getting with more traditional razors.</li>
            <li> Love it so much, you can use it in the shower.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;UPDATE:  March, 2013  The battery still holds a full charge</li>
            <li> A popular auction site often features substantially lower offers.</li>
            <li> the shaver is charging it&#x27;s not bad.</li>
            <li> For the most part, the shave is great, just a couple areas around my neck and left side of my face (since I am right handed, I just gotta get the angles better as it&#x27;s bigger to hold then the Mach 3).      </li>
            <li> Nice construction, great fit, easy to use (once I got through the somewhat complicated manual).  </li>
            <li> EW8228S charges quickly - about an hour for a full charge.</li>
            <li> one is much better than my last models, and was a great deal at a Daily Deal at amazon.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m enjoy it</li>
            <li> So, what I do is I hop in the shower, get my face damp quickly, get my face out of the running water and lather up, and immediately shave with the Panasonic.</li>
            <li> After that it shaves quickly and closely.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a fast shave, easy to clean and recharges quickly.</li>
            <li> Norelcos also let you shave in a quick swirly motion</li>
            <li> After much research by me, I showed him a few I thought would work best based on reviews, price &amp; features.</li>
            <li> Its quick, no going over an area 5 times to get the cut.  </li>
            <li> I did the math and decided that even if it lasted only a year or so then a good electric razor would have been worth it.</li>
            <li> It does an OK job, but my cheap travel Braun M60 works considerably better for dry shaves.    </li>
            <li> SHAVES FACE AND HEAD SUPER CLOSE WITHOUT ANY SKIN IRRITATION.</li>
            <li> /&gt;In conclusion, a great shaver with all the current technology and features offered by the competition at a reasonable asking</li>
            <li> As a professional who sits with clients face to face all day, shave quality is the most important element I look for.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Highly recommend the shaver, but consider if you wouldn&#x27;t be better off buying one without HydraClean.</li>
            <li> With more beard growth it does take more to get through the thickness than normal but take it slow and it will do a great job.  </li>
            <li> I use a hot rag to soften and raise the whiskers, this shaver provides a really smooth shave that lasts.</li>
            <li> The Vortex shaver is clean, fast, and comfortable.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure if it would be any better then the last couple of electric shavers he has own and used once only to discover that he didn&#x27;t like them.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t live without it any more.</li>
            <li> I do feel that I could probably get a good 7 to 8 days worth of shaving before a re-charge, which is plenty for me since I don&#x27;t take long trips.</li>
            <li> Most of the time I just brush it clean after each shave, then give it a more thorough wet wash every couple of weeks.  </li>
            <li> but I always end up using it dry because it&#x27;s plenty good that way</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very convenient and works very quickly and well.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very convenient and works very quickly and well.</li>
            <li> The first shave with this razor was following a good \\&quot;clipping\\&quot; with my Wahl beard trimmer.</li>
            <li> Good shave dry.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve got a pretty thick beard and this is the best I&#x27;ve owned.</li>
            <li> VERY CLOSE SHAVE AND EASY TO USE.  </li>
            <li> The blinking light is not super bright</li>
            <li> Used dry, this shaver wasn&#x27;t any better than the many others I&#x27;ve tried over the years.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great for quick cleanup of the 5-o&#x27;clock shadow or after a few days of growth.</li>
            <li> I love it because it is no mess!</li>
            <li> Also, it had the nice effect of removing the top layer of dead skin off of my face,</li>
            <li> But a razor would be much easier to use when you need the silky smooth feel.  </li>
            <li> For those that claim that it is too loud...stop being girly men and enjoy a real man&#x27;s shaver....</li>
            <li> - smooth close shave  - battery lasts for several weeks  - easy to clean  </li>
            <li> They seem to clog the works and the shave, while comfortable, isn&#x27;t very close.    </li>
            <li> If you shave everyday, it is great.</li>
            <li> Also, to avoid cuts, I use the top and bottom foil while trying to avoid the slot cutter near the angles, like under my chin, and around my lips.</li>
            <li> Well worth the Amazon(not</li>
            <li> He uses it in the shower or at the sink, it gives a very close shave and is kind to his sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> It looks pretty cool too</li>
            <li> For several years I have struggled to find a good razor that wouldn&#x27;t leave my skin really irritated, but now I&#x27;ve found my solution.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I rarely use the cleaning system.</li>
            <li> But some may find it useful.  </li>
            <li> Actually to be fair, it went from a one star to a two star as a wet shaver.</li>
            <li> I really liked my last shaver (Panasonic ES8077S)</li>
            <li> Totally worth it.</li>
            <li> Another thing I like about the ES822S model is it is made in Japan not China which is rare</li>
            <li> The oil seems to leave a film on the blades and foil, so more frequent cleaning is needed.  </li>
            <li> So far, I&#x27;m pleased with the purchase.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and I expected this one to be equally as good as the others.</li>
            <li> The clearance websites have been featuring this shaver, and the price was compelling</li>
            <li> I got mine and then ordered three more for my adult daughters.  </li>
            <li> It seemed too good to be true, but Panasonic products have never let me down yet.</li>
            <li> By way of comparison, for my previous Braun, the location was perfect insofar as my hand could easily slip into the proper position to (de)activate it, without so much as a glance or a pause.  </li>
            <li> This one seems to fall nicely in the middle ground of high quality and good shave without extra</li>
            <li> Thesmaller the holes in the foil, the more comfortable the shave, but it may take longer to complete, particularly if you have thicker diameter hair.</li>
            <li> However, after 2 weeks of every other day shaves I switched to the wet-shave mode and was even more pleased.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think you will find any other shaver that does as good of a job without causing irritation.    </li>
            <li> I almost always look like I have a 5 o&#x27;clock shadow, even right after shaving.</li>
            <li> And the price is right too.</li>
            <li> I thought the idea of having the shaving gel right in the shaver neat</li>
            <li> I can actually get a closer shave with it than a razor, and with no razor burn so its pretty amazing at its niche.  </li>
            <li> The razor is very quiet, easy to clean, and charges quickly.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re also very convenient to clean, being water-resistant.  </li>
            <li> This shaver is easy to use, easy to clean, and provides the closest shave I&#x27;ve had when used wet.</li>
            <li> A fantastic product highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Norelco Quadra shavers for the past 8 years, quite happily; and had Braun and Eltron shavers before that</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad to see that the extra horsepower/rpm&#x27;s, 3 blades and improved screen - have made this shaver so much better than the old panasonics.  </li>
            <li> Other than these minor issues, it&#x27;s and excellent shaver.</li>
            <li> It takes kind of long to shave.  </li>
            <li> I know, I know, time for a new shaver, but I&#x27;m cheap and I like to use a product until it dies.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The sound of the shaver is different from others I&#x27;ve used - the high speed makes a whining sound as opposed to the familiar buzz.</li>
            <li> I had had about three Panasonic shavers previously and loved all of them.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve found that using too much hot water to try to soften up my beard hairs results in the skin becoming too soft, and the slot cutter on the razor (for longer hairs) grabs my skin and cuts it, leaving nicks.</li>
            <li> I just take it apart and rinse with warm water and liquid hand soap and let it dry which seems to be a lot simpler.</li>
            <li> shaving is very soft and smooth.    </li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s still very, very close.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very comfortable and has never left a nick or rash.  </li>
            <li> If i miss one day, this shaver doesn&#x27;t like it very much.</li>
            <li> Cleaning it under the sink using \\&quot;turbo\\&quot; mode and liquid soap and water (as the instructions say how to do) works fine, and of course the power cord plugs directly into the razor to charge it.</li>
            <li> With enough patience I can usually even get a good shave on these spots, but most of the time I just shave with the Panasonic and then use my traditional razor to tidy up those two spots afterward.    </li>
            <li> With a little patience this can be the best electric razor system for the money a young man, or old man, can expereince.      </li>
            <li> This was my first wet/dry electric razor</li>
            <li> I have never tried a foil razor before, and so was interested in what was offered.</li>
            <li> Not only because the charging unit doubles as a cleaning unit, but because you just snap off the head, and most of the time there&#x27;s nothing inside anyways.  </li>
            <li> My husband has never been interested in electric shavers.  </li>
            <li> The wonders of modern technology!  </li>
            <li> /&gt;After one month of use, I can now safely say that my initial impression was a bit conservative.  </li>
            <li> I was an avid Braun man before then.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the first electric razor that I have ever had.</li>
            <li> This is my first electric shaver I&#x27;ve purchased.</li>
            <li> Trimmer still pretty weak.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;Tired of forgetting to shave before showering and then having to break out the manual blades, I just got this thing today and did my first shave.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Being able to rinse off my razor under water or shave in the shower is a big plus.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Threw the first one away after having it for 4 years accidently.</li>
            <li> This supposedly conforms better to the different angles of your face.</li>
            <li> I prefer the springy coiled cord of the Braun which feels much higher in quality.</li>
            <li> This is my first arc foil razor and</li>
            <li> I tried my Panasonic ES8228S razor for the first time today.  </li>
            <li> This is also the first time that I&#x27;ve tried a foil shaver.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> cleaning base is also pretty cool; though gimicky, it&#x27;s kind of nice to be able to \\&quot;Set it and forget it.\\&quot;  </li>
            <li> The entire razor cost just a bit more than replacement foil/blade for the Braun (which was needed).  </li>
            <li> I gave up on the foil shavers and went back to Norelco because the foil shavers required more care in use to avoid burn.</li>
            <li> Part of what I didn&#x27;t like about blade shaving was the hot water ritual.</li>
            <li> I found out that the Braun replacement battery would cost more than I paid for the razor initially.</li>
            <li> This is my first electric razor (and I am over 50).  </li>
            <li> This is my first foil shaver</li>
            <li> burn for the &#x27;first time&#x27;.</li>
            <li> First impression :    </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a bit loud, but you get used to the \\&quot;buzzing\\&quot; sound it makes.  </li>
            <li> The only issue I have is that it doesn&#x27;t seem to be able to get all areas of my neck or under my chin.</li>
            <li> , I have returned this to Amazon (thanks Amazon!) and will be replacing it with an ES8249</li>
            <li> My husband and I have been married 25 years and have been kinda looking for an electric razor.  </li>
            <li> The sound is a bit too loud, so not everyone will like it.  </li>
            <li> It shaves closer and cuts more hair on the first pass, eliminating a 3rd or 4th pass.</li>
            <li> I have now started using it \\&quot;wet\\&quot; by warming my face with hot water, then applying a Neutragena shaving cream.</li>
            <li> I have now started using it \\&quot;wet\\&quot; by warming my face with hot water, then applying a Neutragena shaving cream.</li>
            <li> first thing in the morning.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve found over this period of time that the unit does not shave closely, even after replacing the blade six months after first using the unit.</li>
            <li> This was a hit and he uses it everyday and comments on how great a shave he gets from his new electric razor.</li>
            <li> I like the new LCD % display and it is better compared to the old style row of LED&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> The shaver is well designed for the hand, which allows easy and flexible use to complete a fast shave.</li>
            <li> This shaver gives me a great shave is half the time of my old one.</li>
            <li> course he had to try it out right away &amp; much to both our amazement</li>
            <li> After reading many reviews, the vast majority of which were highly positive, I ordered one for myself.</li>
            <li> For me, I need more than a 2 day growth for the whiskers to be long enough for the lifters to be able to grab hold for a close shave.  </li>
            <li> As for other features, I&#x27;m less impressed with the sideburn trimmer.</li>
            <li> I prefer to use a old toothbrush to clean it.</li>
            <li> Even with my favorite shaving lotion I still got some minor bumps and skin irritation from use, but after a week</li>
            <li> I bought this razor about 4 months ago and the first time I used it I was very disapointed.</li>
            <li> It leaves too many long hairs 5.</li>
            <li> I got a very close shave on first use without the nicks and cuts of the Braun.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve owned the Panasonic Nano Vortex since October 13th and shaved with it daily, yet the \\&quot;status\\&quot; light (a light that comes on to tell you to replace the soap cartridge) has yet to come on!</li>
            <li> After disappointments with several other razors, this is a welcome relief.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it for a month now, and while its much more convenient than a blade shaver, its clearly not as close.  </li>
            <li> This is a bit high - but given the extraordinary quality of the shave and the incredibly reasonable cost of the whole unit, I&#x27;ll put up with it.</li>
            <li> This is a bit high - but given the extraordinary quality of the shave and the incredibly reasonable cost of the whole unit, I&#x27;ll put up with it.</li>
            <li> That was easy enough to fix by installing the cartridge.</li>
            <li> (I can easily get 5-6 shaves from it which saves you from packing any charging cables for short trips).  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve owned Panasonic Shavers previously and have always liked them.</li>
            <li> this is my 2nd one, this one is a much better perfomance and a new technologi saver</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the same shave soap that I was using with the straight razor (Van Der Hagaan), applied with a boar bristle brush, and it provides sufficient lubrication while not clogging up the razor, as it rinses away easily in water.    </li>
            <li> The first charging/cleaning stand finally started to leak from my original shaver that went thru the wash.</li>
            <li> The first charging/cleaning stand finally started to leak from my original shaver that went thru the wash.</li>
            <li> the customers seemed to rate the Panasonic pretty high.</li>
            <li> Quality is very good and have never had one fail.</li>
            <li> and it was a cheap model which was ok, but the foil broke and it was hard to find a replacement.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s quiet and smooth, and gives a really close shave.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t bother with returning it to Panasonic, but I wasn&#x27;t too happy that I paid all this money for something that only lasted for a few months.</li>
            <li> The overall sound of the unit is reasonable.  </li>
            <li> I got this to replace a very well used Panasonic ES8066.</li>
            <li> Pro: Very close shave.</li>
            <li> It came with a unit for cleaning the shaver, which I haven&#x27;t used, so if the same shaver is available WITHOUT this cleaning unit, buy that one.  </li>
            <li> + holds the charge REALLY well.</li>
            <li> I think its important to take the time to read the user manual, especially if you have never used a wet/dry electric before.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t shave quite as closely as a blade but does a very acceptable job.</li>
            <li> much* closer and</li>
            <li> *much* faster.</li>
            <li> ES8228S really shines.</li>
            <li> After reading about straight razors, I decided to give it a shot.</li>
            <li> I then switched to a real straight razor, and was pleasantly surprised...</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s no advantage to doing it in front of a mirror, as the Panasonic doesn&#x27;t wipe away the soap like a straight or disposable razor</li>
            <li> (God knows where and for how much).</li>
            <li> haha)</li>
            <li> (Really?.</li>
            <li> Step up to the modern world and go with electric.  </li>
            <li> I hadn&#x27;t really given this razor the credit it deserves.  </li>
            <li> It was ok but not really a close shave and a lot of ingrown hairs.  </li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t understand why Panasonic doesn&#x27;t advertise this product because they really have a winner.</li>
            <li> The self cleaning and drying features are also very convenient.&lt;br</li>
            <li> When it arrived I could not believe how beatifull it really is.</li>
            <li> But Panasonic also provides detailed instructions for cleaning with soap and water - a practical solution to a simple procedure.</li>
            <li> I just couldn&#x27;t see spending twice as much on the top-of-the-line Braun.     </li>
            <li> The Panasonic is much lighter and the motor is in the shaving head, shifting the balance from the handle into head.</li>
            <li> In addition to not liking the power cord, I don&#x27;t like the Panasonic cleaning system as much as the Braun.</li>
            <li> and it just felt cheap (it cost almost the same as the 8228).  </li>
            <li> Which is wierd because the wet shave is supposed to be a much better shave.</li>
            <li> In this case, since the razor is used to shave your face, it will be very close to your ears.  </li>
            <li> Thanks guys</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d much prefer if they gave us a car adapter instead.</li>
            <li> For what it&#x27;s worth, I&#x27;m over 60, and have tried every conceivable method,technique, product, and shortcut to shave grooming.  </li>
            <li> It will shave you very close....</li>
            <li> Highly recommended!  </li>
            <li> it really is a VERY close shave, I&#x27;m never pushing him away telling him his stubble is scratching me, his face is always smooth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s enough to light up the doorway with each blink.</li>
            <li> It feels like I&#x27;m in a cheap hotel with a flashing sign outside the window or something.</li>
            <li> The Panasonic just got a closer shave, a bit loud, but well worth it.</li>
            <li> I tried Broun before and it was ineffective and take so much time.</li>
            <li> The razor did not shave my neck very well at all</li>
            <li> provides a very close shave.</li>
            <li> Thanks Panasonic...</li>
            <li> it gives you a real close shave.</li>
            <li> He likes it and is much faster than shaving with cream and razor.</li>
            <li> This razor works well, holds a charge very well</li>
            <li> I purchased this electric shaver since I can no longer use a straight edge shaver.  </li>
            <li> Very close shave, didn&#x27;t use the cleaning features yet.</li>
            <li> Someone suggested a foil shaver and, after much hesitation, I purchased the Braun.</li>
            <li> Braun has hit the snooze button and no longer wants to get up in the morning with me.</li>
            <li> It is performing very well after about four years</li>
            <li> /&gt;Still loving it and using it everyday.</li>
            <li> The only difference between the two is the ES8228S adds a zippered vinyl travel case (vs cloth bag with draw strings) and the head has independent floating foil (each of the 3 foils is on their own suspension to track the curves of the face</li>

            <li> I&#x27;ve never had that experience, but unplugging after cleaning and charging is probably a good idea, as the Panasonic indicator stays at 100% for at least 48 hours.</li>
            <li> I mean a $250 shaver on sale for $78 should be a good deal.  </li>
            <li> The shave is very close; it does a better job than any other razor I&#x27;ve ever had.  </li>
            <li> Electric shaving has sure come a long way since I was young!  </li>
            <li> The shaver works better than any other Panasonic that I have used before.  </li>
            <li> In other words, it will take longer to get a refund that the time I was actually able to use the razor.  </li>
            <li> And you can clean it with soap and water (instructions are included in the manual), but getting it dry (esp in hot humid whether) is a trick.</li>
            <li> I am 72 yrs old and have had a full beard for nearly 40 years and my wife decided it was time to shave it off.  </li>
            <li> I dare you to compare the 2 razors back to back and honestly say the Braun is worth double the price.</li>
            <li> I purchased this at Amazon.com as a daily special.</li>
            <li> previously owned a Braun Synchro 7526 which I loved, especially the trimmer.</li>
            <li> The length of shave time has been cut in half from my old Remington and the shave is nice and close.  </li>
            <li> This is true even if it&#x27;s a hair that gets cut, but not cut as short as the others.</li>
            <li> First, all electric razors are loud and the 3-4 seconds</li>
            <li> I only purchased because of an Amazon sale, but would pay full retail if I ever needed another.  </li>
            <li> It comes with a 30 day Panasonic warranty that if you don&#x27;t like it, you can send it back for a full refund.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Shaving in the shower saves me time and until now panasonic had been the only company to offer a true wet/dry razor.</li>
            <li> No bad, just different.</li>
            <li> If the new ones are any thing like this, buy it!</li>
            <li> In fact, I start off with a quick shave with a razor to quickly get the stubble down closer to the skin and then follow up with the Panasonic.  </li>
            <li> This is a very minor observation, but the travel case is extremely cheap, but it does the job.  </li>
            <li> This is a very minor observation, but the travel case is extremely cheap, but it does the job.  </li>
            <li> I have always enjoyed Panasonic products and noticed this razor at half the asking price of the Braun.</li>
            <li> This actually happened to me in a duffel bag in my car, but luckily I heard it and pulled it out and turned it off.</li>
            <li> The self-cleaning function of this shaver is more of an annoying gimmick than useful feature - you better wash the shaver yourself than listen to 2 hours of loud vacuum-like sound coming from your bathroom.</li>
            <li> only negative I&#x27;ve found is that it doesn&#x27;t do a great job shaving the neck, but that just comes with the territory with electric razors.  </li>
            <li> Battery life per charge is adequate for several shaves.  </li>
            <li> Since then, I purchased the ES8228 and is the same razor with a different outer foil and travel case (scroll to the end for more information).</li>
            <li> main concern is a feature of the battery and charging system that I couldn&#x27;t know about before I bought the unit.</li>
            <li> Following Amazon reviewer Charles Enfield&#x27;s advice on this page, I ordered a bottle of Billy Jealousy Hydroplane shaving cream for the silicone smoothing, and I expect my future shaves with this Panasonic to produce yet better results.</li>
            <li> One carryover from my Braun experience: instead of filling the cleaning receptacle with tap water per the user instructions, I used diluted ethyl rubbing alcohol for the disinfectant effect in order to prevent any contact dermatitis, which I got many years ago from buildup on a Remington shaver that I only brushed and oiled.</li>
            <li> he did NOT have a single nick &amp; his face was smooth.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend the product</li>
            <li> This is a high quality shaver.  </li>
            <li> I recommend this item highly.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this razor for its shave quality.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommended.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommended.  </li>
            <li> All in all, I highly recommend this shaver.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this shaver although I understand it is being phased out for a newer model.  </li>
            <li> If a Product from China is of high quality then buy it from China.</li>
            <li> I had high hopes for this product when I purchased it a year ago.</li>
            <li> i reccomend it highly.</li>
            <li> My high priced Braun ended up in the travel bag.  </li>
            <li> I did alot of research on ALL electric shavers and almost was convinced to purchase a Braun; however; realized they were too high maintenance and costly to maintain.</li>
            <li> That unit was about 5 yrs old on its original set of blades and second set of batteries (it uses 2 AA NiMH inside).</li>
            <li> had Philps, Braun, and other more modest</li>
            <li> At a 1/3 to 1/2 the price of my other shaver, it dose a much better job, wow.  </li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t speak personally for it but from his reaction I&#x27;m pretty certain he&#x27;d rate it five stars as well.</li>
            <li> It would be nice to have a hard case for it, or some sort of lockout on the button to prevent this from happening.    </li>
            <li> 5 is no different than the previous 4.s comfortably in hand, but I do stand by my original impression about it feeling plasticky in hand.  </li>
            <li> I really like it so far.</li>
            <li> With sensitive skin and a fast growing beard this works twice a day with no irritation to me.</li>
            <li> Was that thing really that loud?  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s loud, but there&#x27;s not too much buzzing on your skin.</li>
            <li> Legs and underarms that are shaved everyday - just like most men shave their face every day - need some TLC.</li>
            <li> It was an instant success.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using a Braun 8585 for the past several years, and haven&#x27;t been all that pleased with it, mostly because of the consumables and the fact the cleaning fluid evaporates whether you use it or not.    </li>
            <li> I use it everyday in the shower with nothing more than the water of the shower.  </li>
            <li> First off it gets loud, really loud.</li>
            <li> Is it worth extra money to have this?</li>
            <li> I got good shaving results for maybe a month or two of sporadic shavings (and I&#x27;m not that hairy, and my hair is relatively thin).</li>
            <li> It also did a good job with the fine hairs around my \\&quot;turkey neck\\&quot; with only a minimal of fine hairs left behind.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been an almost lifetime devotee to a major brand, have tried other well-known brands over the years and, this one comes out on top.</li>
            <li> Charges quickly, shaves very well (especially if I wet mt face first).  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used three different electric shavers over my life, none of them gave me a close shave, or were easy to use - this one does and is as simple as a razor to use.     </li>
            <li> Shaving is one of my least pleasant daily rituals.</li>
            <li> - performance doesn&#x27;t diminish with low battery  - good looking design  CONS:  - a little loud  - pivot action (gimmick)</li>
            <li> This older version is better for harsh beards but sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li> I got this amazing little electric shaver on a Gold Box (or Lightning Deal) - I&#x27;d considered it a month or so earlier when it was also a GB deal.  </li>
            <li> Back in the day before Tesla invented electricity using Ben Franklin&#x27;s kite/key contraption, your only option was to go full bearded or use a straight razor and shaving cream for a close shave.  </li>
            <li> In other words with the Braun I have to frequently \\&quot;double check\\&quot; the closeness of the shave with my hand before moving on to the next area, whereas with the Panasonic I could usually tell much more easily just by sound and feel when I was finished with an area of my beard.&lt;br</li>
            <li> He told me he loves his new electric razor.</li>
            <li> So, I buy a new razor every 1-2 years.</li>
            <li> I purchased this unit from Amazon.com for $89.00 brand new with the cleaning unit(What a Bargain)</li>
            <li> I read that it takes a while to get used to a new razor</li>
            <li> and it made the unit come out like new.  </li>
            <li> I made some so it would be easier to handle than live bait.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve owned a high-end Panasonic shaver before so when it was time for a new unit I wanted to go with Panasonic again.</li>
            <li> hadn&#x27;t purchased a new razor in years</li>
            <li> I missed it until the new one showed up.</li>
            <li> Still runs but needs a new set of blades.</li>
            <li> Still runs but needs a new set of blades.</li>
            <li> Panasonic is making these units lighter, and more ergonomic, this model is weights less than half of my original Panasonic of 10+ years ago.</li>
            <li> The Braun I have shaves just as close in roughly the same amount of time, however this shaver somehow transmits better feedback to the user on closeness of the shave.  </li>
            <li> He has never used it wet yet because it does such a good job dry.</li>
            <li> Only time will tell if this was worth it, but so far I am optimistic.</li>
            <li> His face is very sensitive and he hasnt had any razor burns.  </li>
            <li> I tried my old Braun shaver and I went right back to the Panasonic.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m very pleasantly surprised with this electric razor!  </li>
            <li> However, I shouldn&#x27;t theoretically need to first reach for the razor and put up with the decibels.  </li>
            <li> I purchased my first Panasonic shaver back in 2007.  </li>
            <li> WOW!</li>
            <li> I have been a fan of the Panasonic razor since I bought my first one back in 2000.  </li>
            <li> had I been using it exclusively, however I had been using it simultaneously with a Braun model during the exact same time period, trying to decide between the two.</li>
            <li> I have been using this shaver for the past 8 months or so and absolutely love it.</li>
            <li> I have not replaced the detergent at all, so I  only wash it under hot water.</li>
            <li> It has taken panasonic 17 days to process my order and they finally returned my call after leaving them a pretty animated message.</li>
            <li> Wow!</li>
            <li> I was a little leery of another unit with a cleaner, but at under $80 it seemed an easy choice.  </li>
            <li> It feels appropriately heavy in the hand and the plastic isn&#x27;t particularly slippery or cheap feeling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> As a system, the cheap power cord and water based cleaner knock it down a notch for me.</li>
            <li> A new foil didn&#x27;t fix the problem, so I decided it was time to retire the old girl.</li>
            <li> Wow, does this thing ever live up to</li>
            <li> The shave is slightly less comfortable during the act, but doesn&#x27;t result in any lingering irritation.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried dry shaving with it, but it doesn&#x27;t give me a close shave, it irritates my sensitive skin, and it doesn&#x27;t remove that top layer of dry skin</li>
            <li> + year old Braun 7526 Syncro with Clean and Charge finally had enough.</li>
            <li> For my beard, the one-pass shaving did not work well either, but this is my 3rd Panasonic shaver and they all pretty much shave the same.</li>
            <li> We live in a modern society and every second counts.  </li>
            <li> The new design here looked strange at first</li>
            <li> The build quality seems decent enough but not of the caliber of a decent Braun.  </li>
            <li> Update, 4 months later: The razor is still solid and super close shave.</li>
            <li> I started with an old Norelco rotary electric, and it would always miss large portions of hair on my face, and especially on my neck</li>
            <li> now this beautifully designed, easy to hold shaver has those aesthetics ruined by hunks of ugly black tape covering all the lights.</li>
            <li> I use it dry and am completely satisfied with it&#x27;s results but have heard that wet shaving will be even closer!</li>
            <li> Rather, I use it about once a week or less often when it is time to clean the unit.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have to worry about damage to the foils anymore or losing the clear plastic cover.</li>
            <li> I am sensitive to noise</li>
            <li> I switched to the Panasonic because the cleaning cartridges are much cheaper and the blades are supposed to last longer than the Braun.</li>
            <li> The only time when I don&#x27;t is when doing 3 passes with a straight razor...</li>
            <li> I stopped using it completely.  </li>
            <li> how much I stropped the blade (I tried a couple different blades, too, and they arrived shave-ready...</li>
            <li> darn near as close of a shave as foam and blades.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s near your ear</li>
            <li> Well Christmas came early for my husband, the dog ATE the package at the front door.  </li>
            <li> Still haven&#x27;t used all the features, but as far as shaving and cleaning its painless.&lt;br /&gt;Never wanted an elec. shaver because of the shaving bumps.</li>
            <li> Bought this razor nearly 2 months ago</li>
            <li> The ES8228 does have a \\&quot;pivot action</li>
            <li> The Vortex cleaning system is a nifty system which works much like my dishewasher on a smaller scale.  </li>
            <li> So far I have not had a problem in transitioning to the electric.  </li>
            <li> Never had a shave that close, loves the fact that it gets cleaned after use, and he doesn&#x27;t even touch the old blades anymore.  </li>
            <li> I purchased this shaver to replace my 7 year old Braun 7570 Syncro.</li>
            <li> cleaner does its job, kinda loud, but i dont mind,</li>
            <li> My old $30 Remmington did a quicker job.  </li>
            <li> and I used it until it completely broke.</li>
            <li> Calling it loud is an understatement.  </li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t bear to have that thing running anywhere near my face.&lt;br</li>
            <li>  had been used Panasonic ES762 (vety old one) for along time, then i have just purchased this one.  </li>
            <li> Which naturally occurred when it was about 2 months out of warranty, and Panasonic wouldn&#x27;t budge.</li>
            <li> It is a bit loud though.</li>
            <li> you have sensitive skin, always getting nicks or irritation, give this razor a try.</li>
            <li> So loud in fact that I wear earplugs when I use it.</li>
            <li> As per their instructions, I sent the whole unit back to panasonic with the charger to be repaired or replaced.</li>
            <li> The old panasonic&#x27;s would give a close shave, but would miss a lot of the growth.  </li>
            <li> But beware, it is quite loud.</li>
            <li> This replaced a 4 year old Remington and the difference is night and day.  </li>
            <li> My old Remington has a rubber body.</li>
            <li> This shaver, by far, surpasses any shaver, of any brand that I have ever used.  </li>
            <li> So far I count on the battery to make it through trips.</li>
            <li> Only useful for regular moustache trimming</li>
            <li> What seems to make this a good shaver also makes it vulnerable to premature wear.</li>
            <li> If the Hydroplane seems too expensive, I&#x27;ve also used the shaver with inexpensive shaving oil with good results.  </li>
            <li> With this panasonic, my skin is not tough or irritated even with daily use.  </li>
            <li> I attribute this to a remarkable synergy of technologies: the 13,000 rpm magnetic drive motor with its speed and relative lack of vibration; the curved dual thin foils with the hyper-sharp cutting blocks; the fact that the head and foil assemblies can independently move and pivot to fit your face; the excellent centrally mounted long-hair capturing cutter (the 3rd cutting block - more of a slot in between the two foils).</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t keep the blade sharp enough to do a good job, and I would always start to get tugs and pulls after a few shaves which I couldn&#x27;t recover no matter</li>
            <li> I used it for the first time this morning, dry, and it does indeed shave closer and faster than my Brauns.</li>
            <li> Overall, I highly recommend this well-made shaver, especially if you won&#x27;t be using the beard trimmer much.</li>
            <li> only Negative thing I have to say about this purchase is that I first saw it in a Target store, but really couldn&#x27;t tell much about it (with all the screws they put in their high tech razors so no one will steal parts...bad idea Target),</li>
            <li> It did see a lot of use, but kind of disappointing that I&#x27;ll either have to purchase a separate beard trimmer or purchase a whole new shaver.  </li>
            <li> The best part of the new razor for me is when the foil starts to heat up after a minute or so, I just run it under cold water for a few seconds.</li>
            <li> I then bought a Panasonic (don&#x27;t remember the model, but it was a notch below ES8228S); it was OK, but not exceptional.</li>
            <li> As one who uses BOTH a safety razor followed by an electric everyday, all I can say after using the ES8228S even for the very first time is WOW!  </li>
            <li> The razor head seems like a decent shape overall.  </li>
            <li> I had an older Braun Razor that was an earlier \\&quot;Pulsonic\\&quot; series but the foil over the cutter block always ended up getting a hole in it</li>
            <li> ORDERED PRODUCT LAST MONTH IN OCTOBER TO REPLACE OLDER PANASONIC LINEAR SHAVER.</li>
            <li> This is my 3rd high end Panasonic shaver, and I will use nothing else.   </li>
            <li> I enjoy the fact I can use it wet or dry.  </li>
            <li> Now all I need is a fog free mirror - dream the impossible dream - Enjoy!</li>
            <li> The HydraClean unit can charge, clean, rinse, and dry in any combination (e.g. you can set it to just charge, or just dry or whatever combination).</li>
            <li> The HydraClean unit can charge, clean, rinse, and dry in any combination (e.g. you can set it to just charge, or just dry or whatever combination).</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used the Panasonic both wet and dry, and I got a close irritation free shave.  </li>
            <li> One thing to note is that if you do not clean the razor regularly you will have a fine powder from your trimmings all over the counter in your bathroom.</li>
            <li> Not only does the razor stay cool, but the wet foil glides over my face much easier than a dry foil.</li>
            <li> Thus far I&#x27;ve not wet shaved with this razor, nor have I ran it under water.</li>
            <li> It chagres really fast, so I don&#x27;t have to wait long if the battery is depleted.</li>
            <li> It also doesn&#x27;t deal with long hair very well, so I feel like I can&#x27;t skip a day.  </li>
            <li> A second and thrid pass normally takes care fo the problem.  </li>
            <li> Yes, it gives a terrific shave, nearly as close as a wet blade, and better than any other electric I have tried.     </li>
            <li> I have tried quite a few different electric shavers and this one most definitely tops them all!</li>
            <li> It recharges (via the cord or base) pretty quickly, but I had assumed that I would be able to use it either cordless or plugged in.</li>
            <li> shaves well; definitely a close shave, although for people like me, with a very, very hard facial hair, it might require several passages in order to achieve the result you&#x27;re looking for  + easy to clean.</li>
            <li> with any new shaver, there is some skin irritation as it performs slightly different than the Braun.</li>
            <li> Cleaning is easy, which is my complaint about Norelco.</li>
            <li> It truly shaved as close as the 5-blade Gillette (I use it dry) and was gentle as can be on my skin....</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin on my neck, and until recently I couldn&#x27;t shave every day.  </li>
            <li> He uses this...in a very big Hurry normally, sometimes everyday or every other day &amp; MOST of the time he doesn&#x27;t have any irritation or nicks.</li>
            <li> I usually take it without the charger to trips and has worked great for me during the trip (usually week long trips).</li>
            <li> After lots of research I decided upon the Panasonic ES8228S for a variety of reasons - the fact that I can use it in the shower was my first point of consideration, followed by the nanotech sharp blades and the motor speed.</li>
            <li> I know two other guys who also got this shaver, and they feel exactly as I do</li>
            <li> It is lightweight, can be used wet or dry, shaves very closely, holds a charge for nearly 2 weeks!, has an automatic cleaning base, and is beautiful!</li>
            <li> If I use it dry, it performs really well, but it really shines when I use it wet.  </li>
            <li> Like other reviewers, I&#x27;ve been using Braun shavers for years, generally the 7526, 7570, and higher models.</li>
            <li> I thought it was a little loud at first, but I&#x27;m used to it now.</li>
            <li> Recharging/cleaning is simple, easy and unattended and can be accomplished in less than an hour, even for an almost dead battery.   </li>
            <li> A couple minor issues for me is how loud it is when I am shaving near my sideburns.  </li>
            <li> The battery power doesn&#x27;t last too long, but you just plug it in and it&#x27;s ready to go.  </li>
            <li> shave the only problem so far is to get a close shave in the neck area.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know what&#x27;s happened, but apparently that&#x27;s not the case anymore</li>
            <li> The case it comes with is soft, and only holds the razor...</li>
            <li> I Have returned to using a regular old fashioned manual razor with Gillette Shaving gel</li>
            <li> After only about 3 months of &#x27;on and off&#x27; use, the outer foil on my 8228 wore through completely.  </li>
            <li> I can only get 3 complete shaves before having to recharge the battery.    </li>
            <li> My husband loves this shaver......after his old one finally hit the dust, after  years of use, I bought him another....</li>
            <li> The charging cable also charges the shaver directly so use of the \\&quot;HydraClean\\&quot; bath unit is entirely optional.</li>
            <li> The charging cable also charges the shaver directly so use of the \\&quot;HydraClean\\&quot; bath unit is entirely optional.</li>
            <li> and now I am free from those ridiculous blade prices.</li>
            <li> We just purchased the latest model, however it has 4 cutting blades and don&#x27;t like it nearly as much as this wet/dry shaver.  </li>
            <li> I have been using electric shavers for nearly four decades - starting with Norelcos, moving on to Braun, and recently a couple of Remingtons.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried the wet shave a few times but mostly use it dry.</li>
            <li> Well, with haveing no other alternative I did some research on the net and found the Panasonic Nano Arc Foil Shaver.</li>
            <li> In addition to that the display on the razor only partially works now and it is difficult to tell exactly how much charge is left on the razor and if I need to clean it or replace the blades.</li>
            <li> I have a very fast growing, thick, heavy, dark beard, combined with soft, sensitive, light brown skin.</li>
            <li> The Braun had been gotten really loud over the past couple of years, due to a loose fitting foil block.</li>
            <li> However, given my rough beard and preference for the convenience of dry-shaving, it took far too long to get a decent shave and even then, substantial stubble remained.  </li>
            <li> Clearly the battery life is influenced by how long one takes to shave and since I wear a beard and moustache</li>
            <li> I have a fairly light beard, but have been plagued by other shavers missing neck hairs.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also a bit loud (and long) when it runs in the cleaning cycle.</li>
            <li> and it also helps clean and charge your razor.my only problem and complaint</li>
            <li> With the unbelievably high cost of replacement batteries and blades, expensive shavers like these are pretty much disposable items after way too short a life</li>
            <li> they would just dull too quickly.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend it using shaving cream with it due to closeness</li>
            <li> in all, it&#x27;s clearly a quality unit with unbelievable performance at a real world price.</li>
            <li> All in all, it&#x27;s clearly a quality unit with unbelievable performance at a real world price.</li>
            <li> The lithium ion battery really does take less than an hour to fully charge the unit and the Nickel Hydroxide batteries that come in Braun&#x27;s?</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always had a problem with stray long hairs down in my neck - and the ES8228S is the first shaver I&#x27;ve ever had</li>
            <li> Because of this, if I miss even a single hair shaving, it shows up rather clearly.</li>
            <li> I never got serious razor burn or a rash with the Braun, but the redness, especially on my neck, is significantly reduced with the Panasonic.</li>
            <li> After experiencing such an excellent wet shave I was expecting similar results when dry shaving, but was somewhat disappointed.</li>
            <li> Use the shaver with dry hands as it is very slippery when wet.</li>
            <li> Battery life DOES seem a bit short (down 10% when I shave, but since it only displays 10% increments, perhaps it shows 90% when it&#x27;s really at 99%?).  </li>
            <li> Given how good this thing shaves with a fresh cutting block, this will probably be the first shaver I&#x27;ve owned where I don&#x27;t resent replacing the cutting block every year.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Given how good this thing shaves with a fresh cutting block, this will probably be the first shaver I&#x27;ve owned where I don&#x27;t resent replacing the cutting block every year.    </li>
            <li> LOVES the snooze button a little too much)</li>
            <li> Shave time for me is about 5 minutes, but I&#x27;m picky and keep going over those tough spots under my jaw until they&#x27;re silky smooth.</li>
            <li> I think it comes down to matching the type of foil on the shaver to the thickness of your particular hair.</li>
            <li> My new shaver was/is just fine, but the first time I used the cleaning base, it spit up cleaning solution all over the counter and promptly shorted out.</li>
            <li> Unlike the Brauns, the Panasonic shaver&#x27;s clipper folds down and out of the way during normal shaving.</li>
            <li> While this usually results in a good shave, it&#x27;s difficult to tell how high to go on the sideburns, and I still miss small patches around my chin and neck, so when I get out of the shower, I use Neutrogena sensitive skin shaving cream and a disposable razor to catch what&#x27;s left.</li>
            <li> I found the Panasonic very hard to maintain and keep clean.</li>
            <li> What I can say is that used in the shower with the right shaving lube it results in the least irritation of any method I&#x27;ve ever tried.</li>
            <li> The advantages of the straight razor were complete control over the shave angle, only a single blade, so no clogging, and when using the type with disposable blades, no worries about the blade going dull.</li>
            <li> I tried it once and the issue with the Phillips shavers is that it is hard to get those little circular shaving heads everywhere easily</li>
            <li> I have contacted Panasonic&#x27;s online warranty site only to learn I&#x27;m going to have to return the entire shaver, and for who knows how long.    </li>
            <li> I have a medium beard, not too thick, but average, though because the color is light, I can get away without shaving for a day.  </li>
            <li> - wish the shave was a bit closer/more efficient for my hard hair  - it looks like the detergent cartridges are pretty pricey</li>
            <li> The only complaint is the grip is a little splippery as the plastic is smooth.  </li>
            <li> (it actually will start to flake if I dry shave it enough).  </li>
            <li> I was concerned as to how long it would last.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just flat out</li>
            <li> It has a lithium ion battery which should last a long time.</li>
            <li> Highest recommendation.battery which should last a long time.</li>
            <li> 3 years on the original base, not bad.</li>
            <li> 3 years on the original base, not bad.</li>
            <li> had it marked down</li>
            <li> that time on he had only ever used a regular manual razor and MOST of the time he was bleeding all over his neck &amp; several places on his face &amp; the irritation would last for days making the next shave painful.</li>
            <li> I rely heavily on customer reviews and compose mine with that in mind, and sometimes I have a little fun with my reviews when everyone else has said it all.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little noisy for the first 20 minutes of the cleaning cycle but then settles down.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little noisy for the first 20 minutes of the cleaning cycle but then settles down.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t need a digital readout to tell me how long it took to shave!)  </li>
            <li> is that the charging station broke after a few years and it would cost as much as a new razor to buy the station from Panasonic.</li>
            <li> I was a fan of Panasonics until I noticed they don&#x27;t last very long.  </li>
            <li> BTW - I&#x27;ve only been using it dry.</li>
            <li> I have actually never used the cleaning system, I just run it under water and let it dry.  </li>
            <li> As a dry shaver, it works well enough for</li>
            <li> But, when a $150 to $199 shaver is broken that quickly, the cartridge price is not a factor.</li>
            <li> My suggestion is to buy a replacement foil and blade as backup should one break or fail...unless you are willing to go under the razor for a few days while you order one or track one down.</li>
            <li> It has a fairly large transformer and is stiff and long, making it harder to wind up and bring.</li>
            <li> Generally I can get a shave that is just as close but with less irritation than a regular razor would give me.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used it for dry shaving but will definitely give a try to the wet shaving soon.</li>
            <li> In my experience, the larger the holes in the foil, the quicker (and possibly closer) shave I&#x27;ll get, but at the expense of comfort due to razor burns.</li>
            <li> Sometimes have to go over the same spot multiple times, although this has been the case with other shavers as well.</li>
            <li> Little irritation, even for sensitive faces.</li>
            <li> It is just a little loud.  </li>
            <li> This is not the case: when the battery completely discharges, you cannot just plug it in and continue shaving, you need to wait a few minutes, unplug it and then continue shaving with the shaver unplugged.</li>
            <li> Wet shaving is the only way to go, for me.</li>
            <li> probably just as long to shave as my Norelco triple head rotary shaver, but quite a bit closer of a shave.  </li>
            <li> The cleaning process would start, but didn&#x27;t make any noises for a few minutes then a loud BEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE.</li>
            <li> Couple of things I don&#x27;t like is that it&#x27;s a bit noisy and takes a long time (hour+) to go through the cleaning cycle.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s still not nearly as much a hassle as a traditional safety razor.  </li>
            <li> but I had a shaver like that a long time ago that after one or two timesrefilling it I never used that feature again.      </li>
            <li> few if any missed hairs (this requires far fewer passes than my Norelco), and I feel like I shaved with a blade without the residual bleeding or irritation.  </li>
            <li> IT TAKES A LONG TIME IF YOU CHOOSE TO SHAVE CLOSE.</li>
            <li> I have been using for long years Philips Shavers.</li>
            <li> Even when I use wet with a shaving foam, there&#x27;s still not enough close shave to get against the grain shaving done.  </li>
            <li> Razor burn is almost non-existant unless you grind away in an area for too long a time (come back to the area 15 minutes later helps), ingrown hairs are 98% cured, and it shaved closer than a rotory with only a few passes.</li>
            <li> If I skip a single day, the hairs on my face are long enough to lay down, and the razor just glides right over them without cutting a large percentage of them, even on the flat area of my cheeks.</li>
            <li> So technically the Panasonic was only used for half the warranty period.</li>
            <li> This razor is the ultimate in portability and closeness of shave,and it can be used wet or dry.</li>
            <li> Lastly, the razor warms but is never hot and it doesn&#x27;t irritate my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have several other rechargeable devices that blink while charging.</li>
            <li> The remington had something that until recently, the other manufacturers just didn&#x27;t have - horsepower and rpm&#x27;s.  </li>
            <li> and the charge still lasts a long time!</li>
            <li> Does not hold a charge for very long.</li>
            <li> My friend convinced me that an appropriately higher-range, well built razor would not give me such a bad experience.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> something shaving dry with an electric doesn&#x27;t do.    </li>
            <li> However, the wet-dry feature means you can shave your neck with a blade without having to dry off your skin before shaving your beard.  </li>
            <li> This was a dry shave too.  </li>
            <li> Decent but slow compared to the 4 cutter version.  </li>
            <li> Gotta say, I had a Panasonic once before in late high school...</li>
            <li> It also has the HyrdaClean Shaving System, a cleaning system that comes with a single disposable solution cartridge.</li>
            <li> Most of my previous shavers have failed in 2-3 years due to batteries losing their storage capacity.</li>
            <li> This is a reminder to everyone not to let the shaver sit around wet (with the shaving head sitting up) for long periods of time as eventually the water will get inside the unit.  </li>
            <li> Evidently Panasonic makes the outer foil quite thin to achieve this.  </li>
            <li> I suspect when the battery gets to the point of needing a full charge to get through one shave, it will be useless.</li>
            <li> did not have much to loose anyway.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it wet and dry but mostly dry.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used a electric razor for over 20 years and as my last one began to break down</li>
            <li> The razor works well, both wet and dry.</li>
            <li> year and half later, my opinion hasn&#x27;t changed.</li>
            <li> A year and half later, my opinion hasn&#x27;t changed.</li>
            <li> * Year 5 is no different than the previous 4.</li>
            <li> It also is quiet and cuts shaving time in half.</li>
            <li> I tried this both dry and wet</li>
            <li> Panasonic also has this razor set up for wet or dry shaves, in or out of the shower or bathtub, with or without shaving cream.</li>
            <li> You can use it wet, dry, with or without shave cream.</li>
            <li> wet or dry.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Can use with a wet or dry</li>
            <li> I shave with the electric, usually dry, and then wet shave with the blade in the shower,</li>
            <li> I have never liked electric razors because of a bad experience I had with one many years ago (which was a high end Remington at the time).</li>
            <li> I have had the ES8228S for about 4 months now and have to give it high marks for its performance although I have one serious misgiving about the device&#x27;s charging system.</li>
            <li> Normally this failure might not have annoyed me so much (it was, after all, out of warranty)</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have an extensive review, but I&#x27;ve owned this unit for a little over a month with no complaints.     </li>
            <li> Also unlike the Braun this Panasonic shaver unit hardly vibrates although it does make a loud wining noise.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s not so bad, as the electric gets most of it).    </li>
            <li> The only caveat, and my only complaint at all about the system, is that the cleaning system is a wee bit noisy.  </li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve sent it to Panasonic&#x27;s service center in McAllen, TX, for repair.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;d always end up with nicks on my neck, no matter how careful I was.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve avoided all nicks and cuts this way, by being careful.    </li>
            <li> this works alright because there&#x27;s not much hair (the razor still clogs,</li>
            <li> I have to be careful to get them with the disposable after I&#x27;m done showering.    </li>
            <li> This shaver excels at a close shave on SHORT stubble, but once there is any length to it get ready to spend some quality time at the task at least if your beard is thick.  </li>
            <li> So I thought maybe it&#x27;s supposed to be a wet shaver</li>
            <li> wet with some lather, just destroys my whiskers....</li>
            <li> I did look at the Phillips Norelco line of wet shavers as well before buying this one,</li>
            <li> Used wet with shaving gel</li>
            <li> A few months ago I began trying different shaving products and techniques in hope of finding something that would work for me.  </li>
            <li> : Some of the reviews you&#x27;ll find vary widely.</li>
            <li> THEN I EXPECTED.</li>
            <li> The shave is a bit too rough for me.  </li>
            <li> The only issue that I have is that there are a couple of trouble spots under my jaw bone.  </li>
            <li> I used it wet</li>
            <li> The people at the cancer center told me I had to use a electric razor because I couldn&#x27;t afford nicks and cuts on my skin.</li>
            <li> Every day it seems to shave closer and faster, I guess it is leveling out the rough spots.</li>
            <li> jump back a few years and share my history...</li>
            <li> Each of these shavers lasted a few years and then made its way to the landfill for various reasons.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve also not used it wet.</li>
            <li> I have only had it for a few weeks and haven&#x27;t tried it with a wet shave yet.</li>
            <li> I think it takes at least 10 minutes to get a half way decent shave.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used electric shavers for over 30 years, most recently Braun and Remington (blech).  </li>
            <li> but you can also wash the Panasonic shaver under warm water without using its recharging base, saving on the cost of having to buy detergent cleaning cartridges every month.</li>
            <li> I switched to cartridge razors (specifically, the Gilette Mach III), but they tend to be too dull after only a couple of shaves, and the blades would clog with hair far too quickly (usually after a single pass).    </li>
            <li> The HydraClean base has been a feature that I&#x27;ve had my doubts about before--it does keep the shaver looking clean, but does it really do anything that using the turbo wash feature with a little soap doesn&#x27;t?</li>
            <li> I have developed psoriasis in the past several months and bled like crazy when using the straight edge on my legs and \\&quot;YES\\</li>
            <li> I have been quite dismayed over the past few years to see the adoption of all kinds of exorbitantly expensive features on better quality shavers.</li>
            <li> Since I rinse the new shaver after every use, I don&#x27;t have much need for the cleaning base, so this isn&#x27;t as big a deal for me.</li>
            <li> It is too bad that Turnpike Appliance in Oceanside, NY - relatively near me - is currently not repairing Panasonic shavers, forcing me to mail the item all the way to Texas rather than just dropping it off and speaking to the tech people directly.  </li>
            <li> When I am on a backpacking trip, I just shave every other day and it lasts for the trip.</li>
            <li> I did not test any other unit</li>
            <li> As other reviewers have pointed out, there&#x27;s no way to lock the flush mounted power button, and so there&#x27;s a risk of it accidentally turning on in your luggage.</li>
            <li> Including other Panasonics.</li>
            <li> I have been shaving with safety razors for the past 50 years, having owned an electric as a teen.  </li>
            <li> When I step out I simply put it in its charging base and select dry and charge or clean.</li>
            <li> I do not have experience with other electrics but this has everything I wanted and does the job.  </li>
            <li> but I have used several rotary shavers in the past.  </li>
            <li> I ordered this during Amazon Deals of the Day the other day and of course chose overnight for Prime members.</li>
            <li> I have an average beard in terms of thickness and growth rate, although I do have a problem with other shavers and razors because I have curly hair and get ingrown hairs, a problem I do not have with Panasonic shavers used wet with Edge gel.</li>
            <li> Is this a weak link in the life of these shavers (five years on my last one, and with Lithium batteries, I can see the current models going even longer)?  </li>
            <li> With extended use of other electric shavers - my skin would toughen and get irritated.</li>
            <li> I have also never replaced the blade and it is still as sharp as ever.  </li>
            <li> The ingrown hairs are 99% gone (I have had only one this past week).</li>
            <li> perhaps I take longer than others who might have to be less careful about the boudaries.</li>
            <li> that crap cheap Gillette foam in the red (or orange?)</li>
            <li> not even the cheapest christmas present has ever given me such a poor shave.</li>
            <li> It was tough, since I&#x27;ve owned 3 Brauns over the past 16 years, but I really wanted to try a wet shaver</li>
            <li> Silver]]I&#x27;ve had mine for four months now but haven&#x27;t really used it until I went on an extended vacation,  I&#x27;ll start out and say something must be wrong, because a hundred other owners think the system is a 4 or 5 star shaver.</li>
            <li> Not worth $250</li>
            <li> I purchased the Panasonic Men&#x27;s Linear Vortex Nano Arc Foil Shaving System for my husband as a late Christmas present (he picked it out).</li>
            <li> so you can&#x27;t go wrong really.</li>
            <li> trimmer is average at best.&lt;br</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s on average.  </li>
            <li> This is the only complaint that I have.....</li>
            <li> have always broken out with razor burn and ingrown hairs on my neck for as long as I started growing facial hair.</li>
            <li> A blade irritates my face, and I don&#x27;t grow a real heavy beard, so I&#x27;ve been trying different kinds of electrics.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m getting old and my skin is getting too thin.  </li>
            <li> The cleaning/charging base is much more streamilined and compact than the Braun.</li>
            <li> Was my favorite shaver until the charging base stopped cleaning.</li>
            <li> I tried it both wet &amp; dry couple of times and It hardly does it job.  </li>
            <li> Going up, down, side ways, in a circe didnt matter.</li>
            <li> With the Panasonic, it&#x27;s cut my shaving time down to half of what a Braun used to take me.</li>
            <li> Much less than other places!  </li>
            <li> I have not had such a bad shave since I was 13 and tried my father&#x27;s straight razor.</li>
            <li> Unable to become used to using an electic razor on a regular basis my entire life, I was reluctant to accept the glowing reviews that I read.</li>
            <li> Oddly, the manual states that after time your beard &#x27;adjusts&#x27; to the razor.  </li>
            <li> It is quieter than my previous Braun.  </li>
            <li> so much - Panasonic doesn&#x27;t waste effort on useless features, but instead provides a product that does what it&#x27;s intended to do, and does it well.  </li>
            <li> Only use if you have a medical necessity to use an electric or need to save money on expensive blades.</li>
            <li> If you shave before bed and the razor is in the master bath, you&#x27;re going to hear it working for a half hour or so.  </li>
            <li> My Norelco costing less than half still works after 6 years.</li>
            <li> It seems to fully charge in less then 15 min.</li>
            <li> About 10 shaves per charge for me, less than the advertised 14.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not louder and I have gotten used to it, but would say it is slightly harsher on the ears</li>
            <li> For travel and bathroom drawer storage, the cord is less user-friendly than the Braun&#x27;s coiled, non-transformer type.</li>
            <li> I just kept nicking and cutting myself too much, though, and I still tended to miss areas, due to the angles of my neck and face.    </li>
            <li> This is not true for me.    </li>
            <li> Also, the hair falls from the blades and makes a mess on the countertop.  </li>
            <li> You will not be disappointed, and with the current rebate Amazon is promoting, this thing is an absolute steal.tually gets as close as a blade without the irritation.  </li>
            <li> You will not be disappointed, and with the current rebate Amazon is promoting, this thing is an absolute steal.</li>
            <li> Little vibration.    </li>
            <li> It is a little noisy-</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little pricey</li>
            <li> I think the manual said it takes a little over 2 hours.    </li>
            <li> It cleans and dries and maintains the shaver in an efficient manner with little cost.  </li>
            <li> Unlike other foil shavers of my past, this one seems immune to shaver burn - while having all the closeness in spades.</li>
            <li> Bought this a little over a month ago.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve got very sensitive skin with a very tough beard.  </li>
            <li> I could live with that, but after having this piece of garbage for only 5 weeks, the battery display on the unit went bad.   </li>
            <li> and I found the wet shave was worse than the dry.</li>
            <li> I typically have high regard for Panasonic products, however this experience left me disappointed in both the shaver&#x27;s reliability and</li>
            <li> Once the shave soap on my face is rinsed away, though, the foil starts to stick to my skin and will \\&quot;jerk\\&quot; without gliding smoothly, missing hairs.  </li>
            <li> I had been using Norelco 3 round head shaver for 10 years, after it broke</li>
            <li> I have had this for 4 months or so and use it everyday.</li>
            <li> However, I still have a few issues with getting all the stubs on the \\&quot;first\\&quot; pass.  </li>
            <li> After 3 months I decided that it didnt make sense to have to shave twice everyday and retired this razor.</li>
            <li> Then I tried a phillips shaver, one with the round circles on it.</li>
            <li> Well, mine is dead and needs replacing</li>
            <li> I use it everyday without any problems, but I have to shave everyday.</li>
            <li> and it was here within a few days,</li>
            <li> The shave really is not comfortable at all, it never has been.</li>
            <li> A few months ago the cleaning system stopped working.&lt;br</li>
            <li> a few times.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I have had this raiser for a few years now.</li>
            <li> Almost bought one based on a few blogs on the web.</li>
            <li> The cleaning base is nice, but unnecessary.</li>
            <li> (less of course my descendant of Marley&#x27;s attack)!</li>
            <li> Also, I could&#x27;ve lived without the base unit: I&#x27;m not sure if it achieves much over simple cleaning with water and soap.</li>
            <li> I recently tookthe razor on a month long trip, and left the base at home.</li>
            <li> I broke the base unit while trying to clean it.  </li>
            <li> I broke the base unit while trying to clean it.  </li>
            <li> The foil and cutting head seems to last a long time.  </li>
            <li> It does a decent job, but it is rather small in profile, and in an awkward position.  </li>
            <li> I found that doing all 3 tends to give me pretty bad razor burn, so I usually stuck with 2.</li>
            <li> I have not experienced any irritation on my face, or neck dry shaving.  </li>
            <li> As he now has to shave head on a regular basis as well as chin under beard and razor blades have become so expensive stores are locking them up</li>
            <li> It seems excessive and not efficient.  </li>
            <li> I have had three Panasonic shavers in the past 15 years.</li>
            <li> I can now shave everyday without the redness!</li>
            <li> I am unable to see what I&#x27;m trying to trim because of the location of the trimmer on the back side of the shaver.</li>
            <li> My man is \\&quot;Hairy\\&quot;, thick hair, he could probably grow a beard within a few days - He loves this razor and it doesn&#x27;t chaffe his face.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Norelco for the past 15 years, and before that, I was using a Remington Microscreen.  </li>
            <li> I probably will never use the liquid cleaning system because the supplies are expensive and I don&#x27;t believe it is necessary in any way.</li>
            <li> I note that Amazon&#x27;s price for the Panasonic ES8228S has risen about $50 in the past month.</li>
            <li> I hardly used it.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I hardly used it.</li>
            <li> The neck is always a hard area to shave</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if this is a common occurrence with these shavers.  </li>
            <li> in all, I would have paid at least twice</li>
            <li> The cutting block is supposed to last a year and the foil two years - so it&#x27;s not like you&#x27;re doing it all the time.</li>
            <li> The cutting block is supposed to last a year and the foil two years - so it&#x27;s not like you&#x27;re doing it all the time.</li>
            <li> Use at least for one month to get used to it.  </li>
            <li> As with all electric razors, it won&#x27;t shave as close as a blade, at least not on my skin.  </li>
            <li> My only disappointment was living in a city of 80,000</li>
            <li> I gave it a try, knowing I could try it for 30 days and send it back if unhappy.</li>
            <li> Since it was going to be a pain to deal with Panasonic service (what, return the whole shaver for a defective base problem?</li>
            <li> (I have a rather pronounced trachea and fairly sharp jaw, both of which are difficult to shave around).</li>
            <li> But all of that is now in the past!    </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s bad enough that I&#x27;m nearsighted.  </li>
            <li> and I find gives the closest least irritating shave.</li>
            <li> Con: the cleaning base unit has a loud fan.</li>
            <li> when i tried it as a fisrt time, i was surprised because of not heart or bloody skin.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not pleasant at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and he&#x27;s always disappointed in them and had to use them in combination with regular blades.  </li>
            <li> However, the constantly blinking lights on this device are driving me crazy!</li>
            <li> While I&#x27;m still not sure about the effectiveness and value of HydraClean, unfortunately I am now convinced that this is a weak link.</li>
            <li> Sorry to be repetitive, but I purchased the Panasonic ES8109 a year ago and this is my review.</li>
            <li> but It doesnt work on tough beards.  </li>
            <li> I have a very thick beard and could be washed under the sink with water and hand soap if you&#x27;re on a trip and don&#x27;t want to take along the cleaning/charging unit.</li>
            <li> As for base unit, I don&#x27;t use it daily.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s razor, not an entertainment device with unnecessary bells and whistles.</li>
            <li> This is the worse shaver I have ever had,</li>
            <li> and I had to use my disposable to finish up after a frustrating 15 minute shave with this thing.</li>
            <li> And, if the warranty fails to cover my complaint, I&#x27;m looking at [...] to replace the outer foil.  </li>
            <li> Replacing the blades doesn&#x27;t help, hell it makes it hurt worse.</li>
            <li> That to me is the worst feature of all and its one that no one really considers when choosing a razor.</li>
            <li> shave you get without irritating the face.  </li>
            <li> I received this shaver approximately 6 years ago.</li>
            <li> But even worse, the constant blinking is incredibly annoying at night.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I believe in giving credit where credit is due, but I also believe in letting others know when I have a BAD EXPERIENCE.</li>
            <li> However the Panasonics recharging base is harder to use than the Brauns</li>
            <li> No more hairs all over the bathroom counter!!!</li>
            <li> or I just bought the wrong one.  </li>
            <li> and it was expensive</li>
            <li> I started with the Norelco (had a couple expensive models), but they never gave a close shave.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always had a difficult time shaving.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not perfect, but no razor will be for the challenge of shaving my face.</li>
            <li> Blades/foil are expensive to replace to.</li>
            <li> Seems weird to have a shaver in the shower -</li>
            <li> I had gotten tired of cutting myself with throw away type razors.  </li>
            <li> The pop out side burn trimmer is absolutely useless as it doesn&#x27;t cut at all.</li>
            <li> And the supposedly sideburns trimmer is useless.</li>
            <li> No matter how you slice it, I either had numerous missed hairs on my face and neck and terrible razor burn.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Works well, but not perfect.</li>
            <li> Probably about 10 years ago he tried an electric razor and looked like he was attacked by an angry Cat</li>
            <li> but the quality and performance of Philips products have been decreasing for years unfortunately.</li>
            <li> This expensive one should&#x27;ve lasted longer than 18 months...</li>
            <li> Sorry if it seems scripted and not well done.</li>
            <li> I started with the style with replaceable blades, but the blades are VERY thin, and so flex and cut if hitting any hairs which haven&#x27;t been sufficiently softened.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s actually dangerously loud.&lt;br</li>
            <li> (Eltrons have Braun bodies and upgraded gold plated foils and cutting blocks).</li>
            <li> /&gt;UPDATE:  I&#x27;m afraid this razor has found its way to my drawer.  </li>
            <li> (sounds dirty) this morning</li>
            <li> After 18 months, the self cleaner base has broken.</li>
            <li> The base is noisy, and the flashing lights are annoying if your bathroom faces the bedroom, but one doesn&#x27;t actually need the base nor the cleaning cartridges to use this razor.    </li>
            <li> I do wish the cleaning cartridges weren&#x27;t so expensive!</li>
            <li> Boy, was I wrong!  </li>
            <li> If so, it is too bad.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been shaving for 50 years, and never had i shaved with anything as bad as this.</li>
            <li> Disappointed.</li>
            <li> but it wont (call me stupid).</li>
            <li> I keep the base unit stored away when not needed.  </li>
            <li> When you consider this, the foils literally outlasted the charging base.</li>
            <li> I like the base cleaning unit, but have also found cleaning under the faceut works just as well.  </li>
            <li> I opted for this model with the charging/cleaning base because our water has a lot of minerals in it.</li>
            <li> Now using the base that came with this razor....</li>
            <li> Now using the base that came with this razor....</li>
            <li> I am very very disappointed.</li>
            <li> This shaver is horrible.  </li>
            <li> Those things are awful compared to this.</li>
            <li> I hate shaving!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d tried a $40-range electric razor from another manufacturer a couple years ago and the results were horrific.  </li>
            <li> It was a terrible shave</li>
            <li> It was horrible and would catch my skin.</li>
            <li> /&gt;First, some background...I have lived for years with the pain, troubles, and embarrassment of terrible razor burn.  </li>
            <li> If you get this you&#x27;re not going to be disappointed!!</li>
            <li> Worst of all, it doesn&#x27;t work when its plugged in.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Good shaver been using it for some time now and still works like the day I used it.</li>
            <li> I got this to replace a very well used Panasonic ES8066. That unit was about 5 yrs old on its original set of blades and second set of batteries (it uses 2 AA NiMH inside). After seeing the cost of replacement blades I decided to upgrade. This unit is very, very good at shaving close - even better then the ES8066 did when it was new. My dad tried it out and stated that this is the only electric razor that did not irritate his skin.    Pro: Very close shave. Little irritation, even for sensitive faces. Waterproof means it easy to clean. Little vibration.    Con: the cleaning base unit has a loud fan. I am sensitive to noise so I clean it once a week or so and keep the bathroom door shut.</li>
            <li> I purchased this shaver after buying a remington and had two replacements under warranty.  I had had about three Panasonic shavers previously and loved all of them.  I wanted to make sure I got a good shaver this time, AND THIS WAS IT.  I LOVE IT!!!!  It came with a unit for cleaning the shaver, which I haven&#x27;t used, so if the same shaver is available WITHOUT this cleaning unit, buy that one.  I just follow the instructions for washing the head each time when it needs recharging and the cleaning is very easy and thorough.  The specs indicate that it should provide 20 shaves between charges, but that must be for men with light beards.  I get five shaves between charges, which is no big problem.  When I am on a backpacking trip, I just shave every other day and it lasts for the trip.</li>
            <li> Unable to become used to using an electic razor on a regular basis my entire life, I was reluctant to accept the glowing reviews that I read. Let me just say I am now a believer, and haven&#x27;t used my blade razor since purchasing this razor.</li>
            <li> I had this Panasonic for only 3 weeks now, and I&#x27;ve been using it 5 times a week. I&#x27;ve only used it for dry shaving but will definitely give a try to the wet shaving soon. As of now, I am very happy with it. I did not test any other unit so I will just give my opinion based on the fact that I switched from the good ol&#x27; razor blade to this electric system.    + fits well in the hand. I don&#x27;t find the location of the off/on switch to be an annoyance as pointed out by a reviewer  + shaves well; definitely a close shave, although for people like me, with a very, very hard facial hair, it might require several passages in order to achieve the result you&#x27;re looking for  + easy to clean. Once you put it on the stand, it takes care of itself. I clean it once a week. I have not replaced the cleaning cartridge yet.  + holds the charge REALLY well. Used it for 10 days, 5-7 minutes every day, and it still had 10% left.    - a bit noisy when it is being cleaned on the stand  - wish the shave was a bit closer/more efficient for my hard hair  - it looks like the detergent cartridges are pretty pricey</li>
            <li> So easy to use.  Charges quickly, shaves very well (especially if I wet mt face first).  An outstanding buy.  I have no negatives regarding the razor or Amazon.</li>
            <li> Good shaver so far used it for 10 days now gets better with each shave the only problem so far is to get a close shave in the neck area. The price from amazon was $99.00 with free shipping, better than anyone.</li>
            <li> I have been using Braun razors for many years.  The Panasonic ES8228S Men&#x27;s Linear Vortex Nano Arc Foil Razor, gives a close shave.  The razor is very quiet, easy to clean, and charges quickly.</li>
            <li> My husband and I both got one of these shavers. He for his head and face and myself for my  legs and we are both very happy about the ease of use and cleaning and most of all, the close shave! A bit pricey but well worth the money, a great product.</li>
            <li> I have had this shaver for 18 months now. After about 9 months, the sideburn trimmer broke (and I only used it about 6 times). After 18 months, the self cleaner base has broken. This is not the quality I expect. The Braun shavers I have had for many years have always been very reliable for both. I switched to the Panasonic because the cleaning cartridges are much cheaper and the blades are supposed to last longer than the Braun. But, when a $150 to $199 shaver is broken that quickly, the cartridge price is not a factor. I am very very disappointed.</li>
            <li> I bought this razor only because I wanted to maybe skip shaving with a razor occasionally on weekends, etc.  I mean a $250 shaver on sale for $78 should be a good deal.  NOT!  This shaver is horrible.  It takes longer to shave with this than it does to lather up and do the job.  Electric shavers used to be simple and provide a fairly close shave.  I don&#x27;t know what&#x27;s happened, but apparently that&#x27;s not the case anymore or I just bought the wrong one.  Don&#x27;t buy this if you&#x27;re trying to shave face!</li>
            <li> This was my first wet/dry electric razor so I had some questions for sure. The ever increasing price of razor blades make consideration of a quality electric razor a budget item for many of us. I have used this razor about a month now so I have a bit of experience with it. The razor works well, both wet and dry. I think its important to take the time to read the user manual, especially if you have never used a wet/dry electric before. That helped me a good deal because otherwise I would never have understood the cleaning cycle operation.   Frankly, I question if the battery life claim of two weeks on battery alone. Clearly the battery life is influenced by how long one takes to shave and since I wear a beard and moustache perhaps I take longer than others who might have to be less careful about the boudaries. I do feel that I could probably get a good 7 to 8 days worth of shaving before a re-charge, which is plenty for me since I don&#x27;t take long trips. Recharging/cleaning is simple, easy and unattended and can be accomplished in less than an hour, even for an almost dead battery.   Overall, it works well. Doesn&#x27;t shave quite as closely as a blade but does a very acceptable job. Given the great price that Amazon offered, it was worth it and now I am free from those ridiculous blade prices.</li>
            <li> So this is a razor supposedly for men. But like many women I like to use an electric razor - and ones \\&quot;made for women\\&quot; just never deliver what I&#x27;m looking for. Legs and underarms that are shaved everyday - just like most men shave their face every day - need some TLC. After spending a great deal of money over the years on \\&quot;women&#x27;s\\&quot; electric shavers I decided that if I am to get what I&#x27;m looking for then I have to look at where the technology and effort is at - and that&#x27;s with \\&quot;men&#x27;s\\&quot; razors. After lots of research I decided upon the Panasonic ES8228S for a variety of reasons - the fact that I can use it in the shower was my first point of consideration, followed by the nanotech sharp blades and the motor speed. And I have not been disapointed! In fact, this is the THE BEST electric razor I have ever used, and now wish that I had never fallen for the \\&quot;women&#x27;s\\&quot; razor scheme. Those things are awful compared to this. My legs and underarms have never been happier - or smoother! I bought my husband a Panasonic several (8+) years ago and it&#x27;s still going strong and he&#x27;s always been very satisfied with its shave. Now there are 2 fans in the family.</li>
            <li> I used the ES8077 for a couple of years, then bought an ES8228 last December.  They were both OK.  Shaving with a Panasonic Linear model is definitely comfortable.  They&#x27;re also very convenient to clean, being water-resistant.  However, given my rough beard and preference for the convenience of dry-shaving, it took far too long to get a decent shave and even then, substantial stubble remained.  I recently switched to a Braun Series 7 and the shave is *much* closer and *much* faster.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve got very sensitive skin with a very tough beard.  I&#x27;ve used the Braun for years, thinking it was the best thing out there.  I saw this on Amazon (and it happened to be on sale that day), and decided to take a flyer on it.  It turned out to vbe a great decision.  This gives me the smoothest most comfortable shave I&#x27;ve ever had.  I&#x27;m sold on the Panasonic&#x27;s now!</li>
            <li> It is superb in the shower with soap - smooth and efficient.  I bought this for my brother in law.  I must note, however, that mine, which I bought last December, had the liquid crystal display die on me recently and I&#x27;ve sent it to Panasonic&#x27;s service center in McAllen, TX, for repair.  I don&#x27;t know if this is a common occurrence with these shavers.  If so, it is too bad.  I am assuming that Panasonic will repair or replace the shaver, for free.  It is too bad that Turnpike Appliance in Oceanside, NY - relatively near me - is currently not repairing Panasonic shavers, forcing me to mail the item all the way to Texas rather than just dropping it off and speaking to the tech people directly.  The basic functionality of the shaver, however, is excellent - better than Braun, even.</li>
            <li> this is the best shaver i have ever had so far. i used philips norelco cool art and it was expensive 176$ but this one is 125$ and better i love it it is small and slick elegant look . im very happy</li>
            <li> Shaving is one of my least pleasant daily rituals. Or so it was before I switched to Panasonic ES8228S. What a difference a shaver can make. I started with the Norelco (had a couple expensive models), but they never gave a close shave. I then bought a Panasonic (don&#x27;t remember the model, but it was a notch below ES8228S); it was OK, but not exceptional. ES8228S really shines. It&#x27;s quiet and smooth, and gives a really close shave. The only thing I cannot understand is why it does not work when plugged in. It recharges (via the cord or base) pretty quickly, but I had assumed that I would be able to use it either cordless or plugged in. This is not the case: when the battery completely discharges, you cannot just plug it in and continue shaving, you need to wait a few minutes, unplug it and then continue shaving with the shaver unplugged. Also, I could&#x27;ve lived without the base unit: I&#x27;m not sure if it achieves much over simple cleaning with water and soap. It&#x27;s also a bit loud (and long) when it runs in the cleaning cycle. Other than these minor issues, it&#x27;s and excellent shaver.</li>
            <li> For the money id try something else doesnt work too good and takes 20-30 minutes to shave....</li>
            <li> I have used electrc shavers for 40 years. The Vortex shaver is clean, fast, and comfortable. The shaver is well designed for the hand, which allows easy and flexible use to complete a fast shave. I have not experienced any irritation on my face, or neck dry shaving.  This is the best shaver I have ever used.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always had a difficult time shaving. I have a very fast growing, thick, heavy, dark beard, combined with soft, sensitive, light brown skin. Because of this, if I miss even a single hair shaving, it shows up rather clearly. This is true even if it&#x27;s a hair that gets cut, but not cut as short as the others. I almost always look like I have a 5 o&#x27;clock shadow, even right after shaving. The only time when I don&#x27;t is when doing 3 passes with a straight razor...but I&#x27;ll get to that.      I started with an old Norelco rotary electric, and it would always miss large portions of hair on my face, and especially on my neck (I have a rather pronounced trachea and fairly sharp jaw, both of which are difficult to shave around). I switched to cartridge razors (specifically, the Gilette Mach III), but they tend to be too dull after only a couple of shaves, and the blades would clog with hair far too quickly (usually after a single pass).    After reading about straight razors, I decided to give it a shot. I started with the style with replaceable blades, but the blades are VERY thin, and so flex and cut if hitting any hairs which haven&#x27;t been sufficiently softened. Also, the blades were good for about 1.5 shaves before I had to replace them...they would just dull too quickly.  That said, I learned about preparation and good shave soaps..that crap cheap Gillette foam in the red (or orange?) can doesn&#x27;t lubricate nearly enough...I stopped using it completely.  I just kept nicking and cutting myself too much, though, and I still tended to miss areas, due to the angles of my neck and face.    I then switched to a real straight razor, and was pleasantly surprised...I found out about shaving with the grain, then across the grain, then against the grain (full 3 passes). I found that doing all 3 tends to give me pretty bad razor burn, so I usually stuck with 2. However, the hair on my neck grows in every direction, so no matter WHICH way I shaved, I would hit some hair with the grainand others against...I&#x27;d always end up with nicks on my neck, no matter how careful I was.  Also, learning to strop is something I didn&#x27;t manage to master...I can&#x27;t keep the blade sharp enough to do a good job, and I would always start to get tugs and pulls after a few shaves which I couldn&#x27;t recover no matter how much I stropped the blade (I tried a couple different blades, too, and they arrived shave-ready...so I know it&#x27;s my stropping technique that is faulty).  Also, it was easy to miss spots, and too easy to get cut.    The advantages of the straight razor were complete control over the shave angle, only a single blade, so no clogging, and when using the type with disposable blades, no worries about the blade going dull. Also, it had the nice effect of removing the top layer of dead skin off of my face, something shaving dry with an electric doesn&#x27;t do.    The disadvantages of the straight razor were the difficulty shaving around my chin and neck, as well as the problems of grain on my neck, the steep learning curve of stropping (and shaving), the concentration required to avoid getting too many nicks (I ALWAYS got nicks), and the time...it was so time consuming to shave that way.    So, I started reading reviews of wet/dry electric razors. I primarily looked at the nice Norelco Rotaries, and then foil razors. I have never tried a foil razor before, and so was interested in what was offered. I finally decided on the Panasonic ES8228S after reading numerous reviews.  Another reviewer commented that he couldn&#x27;t cut himself, even when he tried. This is not true for me.    I&#x27;ve tried dry shaving with it, but it doesn&#x27;t give me a close shave, it irritates my sensitive skin, and it doesn&#x27;t remove that top layer of dry skin (it actually will start to flake if I dry shave it enough).  Wet shaving is the only way to go, for me. I&#x27;ve been using the same shave soap that I was using with the straight razor (Van Der Hagaan), applied with a boar bristle brush, and it provides sufficient lubrication while not clogging up the razor, as it rinses away easily in water.    I&#x27;ve found that using too much hot water to try to soften up my beard hairs results in the skin becoming too soft, and the slot cutter on the razor (for longer hairs) grabs my skin and cuts it, leaving nicks. So, what I do is I hop in the shower, get my face damp quickly, get my face out of the running water and lather up, and immediately shave with the Panasonic. I do it by sound (I can hear the hairs being cut) and feel. There&#x27;s no advantage to doing it in front of a mirror, as the Panasonic doesn&#x27;t wipe away the soap like a straight or disposable razor does...I still can&#x27;t see what I&#x27;m doing.  Also, with the foil razor, it turns most of the hair (when it&#x27;s short) into powder, and it&#x27;s nice to just rinse it away in the shower. Once the shave soap on my face is rinsed away, though, the foil starts to stick to my skin and will \\&quot;jerk\\&quot; without gliding smoothly, missing hairs.  Also, to avoid cuts, I use the top and bottom foil while trying to avoid the slot cutter near the angles, like under my chin, and around my lips. I&#x27;ve avoided all nicks and cuts this way, by being careful.    While this usually results in a good shave, it&#x27;s difficult to tell how high to go on the sideburns, and I still miss small patches around my chin and neck, so when I get out of the shower, I use Neutrogena sensitive skin shaving cream and a disposable razor to catch what&#x27;s left. this works alright because there&#x27;s not much hair (the razor still clogs, but it&#x27;s not so bad, as the electric gets most of it).    A note: this razor works best for me if I shave EVERY day. If I skip a single day, the hairs on my face are long enough to lay down, and the razor just glides right over them without cutting a large percentage of them, even on the flat area of my cheeks. I have to be careful to get them with the disposable after I&#x27;m done showering.    The cleaning base is nice, but unnecessary. I recently tookthe razor on a month long trip, and left the base at home. Cleaning it under the sink using \\&quot;turbo\\&quot; mode and liquid soap and water (as the instructions say how to do) works fine, and of course the power cord plugs directly into the razor to charge it. The base is noisy, and the flashing lights are annoying if your bathroom faces the bedroom, but one doesn&#x27;t actually need the base nor the cleaning cartridges to use this razor.    The case it comes with is soft, and only holds the razor...the charger won&#x27;t fit in it. As other reviewers have pointed out, there&#x27;s no way to lock the flush mounted power button, and so there&#x27;s a risk of it accidentally turning on in your luggage. This actually happened to me in a duffel bag in my car, but luckily I heard it and pulled it out and turned it off. It would be nice to have a hard case for it, or some sort of lockout on the button to prevent this from happening.    This is easily the best electric razor I&#x27;ve owned. It&#x27;s not perfect, but no razor will be for the challenge of shaving my face. I&#x27;m very happy with it as a wet shaver in the shower.</li>
            <li> I bought this shaver for my husband for Christmas. I wasn&#x27;t sure if it would be any better then the last couple of electric shavers he has own and used once only to discover that he didn&#x27;t like them. This was a hit and he uses it everyday and comments on how great a shave he gets from his new electric razor. A very nice compact shaver at a great price that does a great job!!</li>
            <li> So far so good. You definitely need to follow the recommendation of letting your face and skin get used to it for some weeks. After that it shaves quickly and closely. I really like it so far.</li>
            <li> I hate shaving! This shaver is easy to use, easy to clean, and provides the closest shave I&#x27;ve had when used wet. It recharges quickly, feels right in the hand, and pivots easily across the contours of the face. I almost (not quite, but almost) look forward to shaving each morning.</li>
            <li> I have yet to use an electric shaver that does as good a job as a blade. That being said, this product does as close a shave as any I&#x27;ve ever used. I&#x27;ve been an almost lifetime devotee to a major brand, have tried other well-known brands over the years and, this one comes out on top. It gives you a smooth, comfortable and close shave. The cleaning unit works well and the shaver is good-looking too! Well worth the Amazon(not the suggested retail)purchase price.</li>
            <li> The Panasonic Vortex is a very good electric shaver.  darn near as close of a shave as foam and blades.  The shaving process does take longer than I had hoped - it is not a one pass deal.  probably just as long to shave as my Norelco triple head rotary shaver, but quite a bit closer of a shave.  Not worth $250 but if you can get it for $135, I would recommend it.  I have only had it for a few weeks and haven&#x27;t tried it with a wet shave yet.</li>
            <li> The best I have had so far.Including other Panasonics.I especially like the visual percentage of charge remaining readout.The cleaning system is of no use to me.I just use a brush as I always have.</li>
            <li> This older version is better for harsh beards but sensitive skin.  We just purchased the latest model, however it has 4 cutting blades and don&#x27;t like it nearly as much as this wet/dry shaver.  Now the price for the 3 blade shaver is through the roof!  Disappointed.</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful shaver!  I&#x27;ve used it for a couple of months now and love it!  I paid 89.99 for it and free shipping.  I get a close shave just as I would if I used a razor.  I no longer get razor burns or ingrown hairs.  Love this shaver!!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used a electric razor for over 20 years and as my last one began to break down I spotted this item for sale. After reading many reviews, the vast majority of which were highly positive, I ordered one for myself. Amazing. The two biggest complaints in reviews were noise and closeness. First, all electric razors are loud and the 3-4 seconds it&#x27;s near your ear is probably better for your hearing then when you crank that favorite song up on the radio. Second, having used Braun razors for the last 12+ years, this Panasonic shaved closer and faster than ANY model of Braun I ever owned. Sorry Braun, our love affair is over.</li>
            <li> Well Christmas came early for my husband, the dog ATE the package at the front door.  Shredded box all over the front yard, the razor has bite marks and one part is damaged but I&#x27;m told I can buy a replacement locally.  So... he set it up to see if it works and .... he has found his new favorite razor!  He loves it - bite marks and all - and has said it shaves closer than any razor he has had before (I&#x27;ve bought a ton of them).  Great job Panasonic on this one.  Highly recommend the product (less of course my descendant of Marley&#x27;s attack)!</li>
            <li> Purchased this unit more than 2 years ago. The shaver itself works great after all this time. However, the charging base/cleaning unit died after 6 months of light usage. The cleaning process would start, but didn&#x27;t make any noises for a few minutes then a loud BEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE. Checked all the holes, nothing clogged. Just wouldn&#x27;t work anymore. I didn&#x27;t bother with returning it to Panasonic, but I wasn&#x27;t too happy that I paid all this money for something that only lasted for a few months. For my beard, the one-pass shaving did not work well either, but this is my 3rd Panasonic shaver and they all pretty much shave the same.</li>
            <li> I had been using Norelco 3 round head shaver for 10 years, after it broke I got the Panasonic ES8228S.  I have had this for 4 months or so and use it everyday. Works great and shaves close. Couple of things I don&#x27;t like is that it&#x27;s a bit noisy and takes a long time (hour+) to go through the cleaning cycle.</li>
            <li> This is a high quality shaver.  I like that it cleans, dries, and charges up all at the same time.  It arrived without any paperwork or brochure so I had to figure out everything myself (no directions).  This made me think that this item was sent back from another customer.</li>
            <li> I got good shaving results for maybe a month or two of sporadic shavings (and I&#x27;m not that hairy, and my hair is relatively thin). Then I noticed the results weren&#x27;t so good anymore, and I started getting irritation. Another 1-2 months later it shaved like your regular 30-dollar Braun and irritation abounded. I had to order blades and foil replacement, and they cost around 40 dollars. The self-cleaning function of this shaver is more of an annoying gimmick than useful feature - you better wash the shaver yourself than listen to 2 hours of loud vacuum-like sound coming from your bathroom. And you have to buy detergent regularly too (God knows where and for how much).</li>
            <li> I got this amazing little electric shaver on a Gold Box (or Lightning Deal) - I&#x27;d considered it a month or so earlier when it was also a GB deal.  I hesitated because despite the reviews, I was an electric razor skeptic.  I&#x27;d tried a $40-range electric razor from another manufacturer a couple years ago and the results were horrific.  My friend convinced me that an appropriately higher-range, well built razor would not give me such a bad experience.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This razor feels well-built.  I clean it by hand, I don&#x27;t use the cleaning dock - I&#x27;d have gotten the dock-less model had this one not been such a good deal.  It feels appropriately heavy in the hand and the plastic isn&#x27;t particularly slippery or cheap feeling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now for the shave!  It&#x27;s not quite as close as a 3-4 blade traditional razor - but it&#x27;s still very, very close.  For me, it&#x27;s about as close as my beard is 3-4 hours out from a safety razor shave.  That&#x27;s perfect for me.  I have to make multiple passes for neck and under my jaw.  It&#x27;s still not nearly as much a hassle as a traditional safety razor.  Oddly, the manual states that after time your beard &#x27;adjusts&#x27; to the razor.  I thought it was over-zealous marketing, but I&#x27;ll be darned if it wasn&#x27;t true.  Each day requires fewer passes for my neck and jaw.  Lastly, the razor warms but is never hot and it doesn&#x27;t irritate my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m very pleasantly surprised with this electric razor!  I&#x27;ll never go back to a safety razor.</li>
            <li> Provides a comfortable,even shave.  The shaver has a nice, light feel in your hand.  Cleaning is easy, which is my complaint about Norelco.</li>
            <li> I have not had such a bad shave since I was 13 and tried my father&#x27;s straight razor.I am 67 now this razor does not get anywhere close.I think it takes at least 10 minutes to get a half way decent shave.You go over the same spot 10 or 20 times and you still feel a 5 oclock shadow. Does anyone know of an electric razor which will give a close shave.</li>
            <li> I bought this razor for my husband for Christmas.  He has always had problems getting a close shave with elec. razors and has been on the search for a really GOOD one forever.  He is THRILLED with this razor. He says it&#x27;s the BEST and he esp. likes the self-cleaning  feature. I recommend this item highly.</li>
            <li> I purchased the Panasonic Men&#x27;s Linear Vortex Nano Arc Foil Shaving System for my husband as a late Christmas present (he picked it out). He has used it ever since it was delivered and has stopped using his traditional razor. He told me he loves his new electric razor. He uses it in the shower or at the sink, it gives a very close shave and is kind to his sensitive skin. He says it makes shaving easier.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used three different electric shavers over my life, none of them gave me a close shave, or were easy to use - this one does and is as simple as a razor to use.     I don&#x27;t have an extensive review, but I&#x27;ve owned this unit for a little over a month with no complaints.     Some things I&#x27;ve noted since my use:  - If you haven&#x27;t used an electric shaver before, or in a long while, like me, you&#x27;ll want to use the best shaving cream/lotion/whatever you can find for yourself. Even with my favorite shaving lotion I still got some minor bumps and skin irritation from use, but after a week or so I was good.  - Great for use in the shower. In fact that&#x27;s the only place I use it.  - It is very easy to clean. Not only because the charging unit doubles as a cleaning unit, but because you just snap off the head, and most of the time there&#x27;s nothing inside anyways.  - I charge/clean the unit once a week and it seems to work great.   - I can shave with this unit, stretch my skin and shave again - it&#x27;s as close as using a razor. But a razor would be much easier to use when you need the silky smooth feel.  - I can&#x27;t stress the lotion! (Put the lotion in the basket! haha) The smoother the foils go across your face the closer and better the shave.</li>
            <li> My husband has never been interested in electric shavers.  He complained about them never cutting close enough and skin irritation.  I researched many shavers on Amazon and decided to purchase this as suprise Christmas gift.  He loves it! As he now has to shave head on a regular basis as well as chin under beard and razor blades have become so expensive stores are locking them up (Really?. He has also now begun to use it to shave back of neck between hair cuts.  I can&#x27;t speak personally for it but from his reaction I&#x27;m pretty certain he&#x27;d rate it five stars as well.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been on somewhat of an electric razor odyssey for the last several years.  A blade irritates my face, and I don&#x27;t grow a real heavy beard, so I&#x27;ve been trying different kinds of electrics.  This was the first Panasonic I tried, and I got a great Gold Box deal on it about 4 months ago.  It is the best electric I have ever used, and it isn&#x27;t even close.  If I use it dry, it performs really well, but it really shines when I use it wet.  I use a shaving soap and badger hair brush, and this electric cuts me ALMOST as close as any blade I&#x27;ve ever used.  The only reason I give 4 stars instead of 5 is that it does not do well on those troublesome neck hairs just above my adam&#x27;s apple- but I&#x27;ve never had an electric that did.  The cleaning/charging station works great.  It is a little noisy- if I&#x27;m showering and shaving before my wife gets up, I don&#x27;t put the razor in for cleaning.  It lasts about a week on one charge for me.</li>
            <li> I would like to get a shave such that when I  run my fingers over my face I do not feel stubble.  I have been using electric razors for more then 60 years and have found that, although an electric shaver may look more modern,  the shave hasn&#x27;t improved,  No matter how often I go over my face with the shaver I still feel like it should do better.  I eventually stop and fee that it is good enough.  It still isn&#x27;t appreciatively better than a shaver that is many years older with its original blades.</li>
            <li> This shaver excels at a close shave on SHORT stubble, but once there is any length to it get ready to spend some quality time at the task at least if your beard is thick.  In fact, I start off with a quick shave with a razor to quickly get the stubble down closer to the skin and then follow up with the Panasonic.  I can actually get a closer shave with it than a razor, and with no razor burn so its pretty amazing at its niche.  However, I shouldn&#x27;t theoretically need to first reach for the razor and put up with the decibels.  Its showerproof design is life changing.</li>
            <li> I purchased this at Amazon.com as a daily special. Optimistic at first, I am glad that I bought it.  It was an instant success.  I enjoy the fact I can use it wet or dry.  It fully charges in a matter of minutes.  It is easy to clean and give you a surprisingly close shave.  [[ASIN:B00176V2SK Panasonic ES8228S Men&#x27;s Linear Vortex Nano Arc Foil Shaving System, Silver]]</li>
            <li> This razor is just awesome!  My husband had a Panasonic razor that lasted for probably 20 years and if we had been able to find some replacement parts, he would still be using it.  This one performs perfectly for him and so far the quality seems to be outstanding.  The luxurious styling is a bonus!  It&#x27;s a little pricey but I got a great deal at Amazon.com!  I do wish the cleaning cartridges weren&#x27;t so expensive!</li>
            <li> This is a great shaver.  The unit is light and gives a great shave.  The choice provided for self clean or use of the unit&#x27;s clean cycle provides longer life for the shaver and the cleaner system and Pack.  The power report is helpful to see what user power is left, and if you need to use the stand/cleaner.  Good shaver for the modern man.</li>
            <li> As one who uses BOTH a safety razor followed by an electric everyday, all I can say after using the ES8228S even for the very first time is WOW!  It gives you one of the closest shaves you can imagine and I am amazed about how close it shaves.  It&#x27;s a heck of a performer and rate it as giving you the closest and best shave one could have.</li>
            <li> I rely heavily on customer reviews and compose mine with that in mind, and sometimes I have a little fun with my reviews when everyone else has said it all.  The wonders of modern technology!  Back in the day before Tesla invented electricity using Ben Franklin&#x27;s kite/key contraption, your only option was to go full bearded or use a straight razor and shaving cream for a close shave.  But takes a lot of energy, and who has time for that!  We live in a modern society and every second counts.  Step up to the modern world and go with electric.  Having been a loyal Braun user, I can say I am pleased with this product.  The shave is close.  The build quality seems decent enough but not of the caliber of a decent Braun.  It feels plasticky.  I paid full price; no discounts.&lt;br /&gt;***UPDATE***&lt;br /&gt;After one month of use, I can now safely say that my initial impression was a bit conservative.  I hadn&#x27;t really given this razor the credit it deserves.  The most important question is How close does it shave?  Answer:  The shave is very close; it does a better job than any other razor I&#x27;ve ever had.  I highly recommend this razor for its shave quality.  As for other features, I&#x27;m less impressed with the sideburn trimmer. It does a decent job, but it is rather small in profile, and in an awkward position.  It takes a glance, a twist of the unit, and two hands to open and close it.  By way of comparison, for my previous Braun, the location was perfect insofar as my hand could easily slip into the proper position to (de)activate it, without so much as a glance or a pause.  The overall sound of the unit is reasonable.  No complaints there.  It is quieter than my previous Braun.  As for base unit, I don&#x27;t use it daily.  Rather, I use it about once a week or less often when it is time to clean the unit.  I keep the base unit stored away when not needed.  Thus far I&#x27;ve not wet shaved with this razor, nor have I ran it under water. The razor head seems like a decent shape overall.  The razor fits comfortably in hand, but I do stand by my original impression about it feeling plasticky in hand.  This is a very minor observation, but the travel case is extremely cheap, but it does the job.  Conclusion:  Highly recommended.  Also, I give Amazon 5 stars.&lt;br /&gt;***UPDATE****&lt;br /&gt;A year and half later, my opinion hasn&#x27;t changed. Have not had any problems.&lt;br /&gt;***UPDATE***&lt;br /&gt;Four years later, my opinion hasn&#x27;t changed.  Still no problems and still using all the original parts.  Only problem was my fault.  I broke the base unit while trying to clean it.  No big loss.  I hardly used it.&lt;br /&gt;***UPDATE***&lt;br /&gt;Year 5 is no different than the previous 4.s comfortably in hand, but I do stand by my original impression about it feeling plasticky in hand.  This is a very minor observation, but the travel case is extremely cheap, but it does the job.  Conclusion:  Highly recommended.  Also, I give Amazon 5 stars. ***UPDATE**** A year and half later, my opinion hasn&#x27;t changed. Have not had any problems. ***UPDATE*** Four years later, my opinion hasn&#x27;t changed.  Still no problems and still using all the original parts.  Only problem was my fault.  I broke the base unit while trying to clean it.  No big loss.  I hardly used it. ***UPDATE*** Year 5 is no different than the previous 4.</li>
            <li> Until about 10 years ago I wouldn&#x27;t even consider an electric razor.  Then I tried the Braun. It was ok but not really a close shave and a lot of ingrown hairs.  It finally was so noisy I couldn&#x27;t stand it any longer.  I read some reviews on the ES8228S and Target had it marked down so I thought I&#x27;d try it.  I use a pre-electric shave lotion and got the smoothest shave I think I&#x27;ve ever had.  It also is quiet and cuts shaving time in half. I can&#x27;t understand why Panasonic doesn&#x27;t advertise this product because they really have a winner.</li>
            <li> I bought this as an anniversary gift for my husband.  He had never used an electric razor before so I wanted to get him one that was easy to use and clean.  This had good reviews and I thought it was a good price.  Although I saw it at Target for $99 a week after buying it off Amazon! Doh! It looks pretty cool too so you can&#x27;t go wrong really.</li>
            <li> This razor is fantastic.  For several years I have struggled to find a good razor that wouldn&#x27;t leave my skin really irritated, but now I&#x27;ve found my solution.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only negative I&#x27;ve found is that it doesn&#x27;t do a great job shaving the neck, but that just comes with the territory with electric razors.  However, the wet-dry feature means you can shave your neck with a blade without having to dry off your skin before shaving your beard.  The self cleaning and drying features are also very convenient.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s just a great product and I would recommend it to anyone looking for a really great, close shave.</li>
            <li> Panasonic Linear shavers are great. I have been using them for years. Quality is very good and have never had one fail. I have tried replacing foils and blades once years ago and it wasn&#x27;t nearly as good as a new shaver. Blades/foil are expensive to replace to. So, I buy a new razor every 1-2 years. The new design here looked strange at first but soon I liked it. I like the new LCD % display and it is better compared to the old style row of LED&#x27;s. Personally I don&#x27;t use the cleaning system because that will need cleaning too. I prefer to use a old toothbrush to clean it. The Cleaner/charger station makes a great stand. I don&#x27;t have to worry about damage to the foils anymore or losing the clear plastic cover. Watch the prices as they vary from ~$100(lowest) on up. I have bought another one as a back-up.</li>
            <li> I purchased my first Panasonic shaver back in 2007.  It was the 8168S.  I was an avid Braun man before then. I had used the Braun before I purchased the Panasonic but once I started using it, I was hooked.  I then heard about the 8228S offered by Brookstone as an exclusive.  I went to their site and purchase it.  Best electric shaver I have owned by far.  Great shave, great charge, easily cleaned (with tap water or the shower).  I think I have purchased four different models of the Panasonic since then and none of them compare.  Three blades, four blades (are they up to that now?), none of them have matched this model.  I ordered two of these today to keep them on hand.  Best electric shaver ever.</li>
            <li> A great product!  However, I still have a few issues with getting all the stubs on the \\&quot;first\\&quot; pass.  Seems weird to have a shaver in the shower - but gosh, it is great!  A second and thrid pass normally takes care fo the problem.  I would rate the product a 4.75 if possible.  Now all I need is a fog free mirror - dream the impossible dream - Enjoy!</li>
            <li> Gotta say, I had a Panasonic once before in late high school...and it was a cheap model which was ok, but the foil broke and it was hard to find a replacement.  That was over 10 years ago.  Since then I&#x27;ve been using a Mach 3 Power shaver and while I liked the close shave, I would get plenty of nicks and cuts on my neck.  Even recently after doing research on shaving tips, I would still get nicks and cuts.  With frustration boiling over, and seeing these good reviews, I had to give in and buy an ES8228S.      It&#x27;s been about a week now, and I am loving it more each day.  The best part is I don&#x27;t get cuts anymore.  The shave is close and I am getting better at the angles and applied pressure to get it closer each day.  For the most part, the shave is great, just a couple areas around my neck and left side of my face (since I am right handed, I just gotta get the angles better as it&#x27;s bigger to hold then the Mach 3).      I really gotta say how much I love the docking system.  I can choose whether I want to clean the shaver, clean and charge it, just dry it (if I cleaned it myself), or just charge it (which is great because I can get full use of each charge).  There are many combinations you can choose from.  The convenience is great as when I am in a rush in the morning, I just pop the shaver in the dock and forget about it.    A couple minor issues for me is how loud it is when I am shaving near my sideburns.  Another gripe is the time it takes to cleaning system to work.  It seems excessive and not efficient.  I think the manual said it takes a little over 2 hours.    Overall, a great shaving experience and would recommend to anyone else.</li>
            <li> This is the best shaver I ever had.&lt;br /&gt;I had Philps, Braun, and other more modest Panasonic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This one is much better than my last models, and was a great deal at a Daily Deal at amazon.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m enjoy it and I recomend for anyone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It cleans automatic, you can do manualy too, very easy, but sometimmes it is ok to do it auto.</li>
            <li> I bought this around Christmas time in 2011 and didn&#x27;t want to review this item until I had used it for a while.  It&#x27;s the first electric razor that I have ever had. I had gotten tired of cutting myself with throw away type razors.  I&#x27;m getting old and my skin is getting too thin.  Anyway this Panasonic foil type razor is great. It&#x27;s a fast shave, easy to clean and recharges quickly. I think the charge lasts about a week. Oh. I rarely use the cleaning system. I just take it apart and rinse with warm water and liquid hand soap and let it dry which seems to be a lot simpler. I love it.</li>
            <li> I purchased this unit from Amazon.com for $89.00 brand new with the cleaning unit(What a Bargain) When it arrived I could not believe how beatifull it really is. Well the initial charge took only about 30 minutes and well I went for it and shaved... for me yes it worked as close as a blade no doubt about it.    A fantastic product highly recommended. For those that claim that it is too loud...stop being girly men and enjoy a real man&#x27;s shaver....hope this helps.</li>
            <li> This is my first electric shaver I&#x27;ve purchased. Cuts amazingly close. Still haven&#x27;t used all the features, but as far as shaving and cleaning its painless.&lt;br /&gt;Never wanted an elec. shaver because of the shaving bumps. Because this shaver is so good you don&#x27;t irritate your skin by shaving the same area over and over.&lt;br /&gt;Couldn&#x27;t be happier.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my husbands B-Day in January.  He absolutely thinks it is the greatest thing!  He has never had an razor like this (he used to be a disposable guy!)and he can use it in the shower or in the car, etc!  It did take a couple times until his skin was used to the difference of blades (it didn&#x27;t get real deep), but he is silky-smooth now!  The product says it takes 30 days for this to happen...more like 14.  It is just a little loud.  It has a definant buzz!  But the outcome was worth it!  I also got this for a great price on AMAZON.COM!  Much less than other places!  Hope you will like this product too!</li>
            <li> Update, 4 months later: The razor is still solid and super close shave. Trimmer still pretty weak.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I previously owned a Braun Synchro 7526 which I loved, especially the trimmer. It finally up and died after 5 years of service.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tired of forgetting to shave before showering and then having to break out the manual blades, I just got this thing today and did my first shave. Super smooth results, but had to do some pressure on my face to get it really smooth. The floating head is awesome as is the speed it cuts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The trimmer is average at best.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cleaning function is a bit of a joke. I gotta say the Braun also excelled in that too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As with any new shaver, there is some skin irritation as it performs slightly different than the Braun. The documentation says it will take 30 days for your skin to get used to if I use the razor regularly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Being able to rinse off my razor under water or shave in the shower is a big plus.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We&#x27;ll see how this thing survives a vacation and the length of time for my whiskers to grow back, and maybe I&#x27;ll give it a 5th star.</li>
            <li> I have had three Panasonic shavers in the past 15 years. Threw the first one away after having it for 4 years accidently. My second one is still working but wanted to try the swival head one. I love the shave and the service I have goten from them. Best ever! Would buy and recomend to all. The online company I bought mine from out of Texas was quick to send and easy to buy from.</li>
            <li> Bought this razor nearly 2 months ago so I&#x27;ve had some time to get used to it. This is an excellent razor and I&#x27;m glad to recommend it to others looking for a good razor that doesn&#x27;t try to do more than than a razor should.  The ES8228 provides a clean, close shave while maintaining a good battery charge over several weeks.  Probably the best thing I like about it is that it doesn&#x27;t have a lot of gimmicks. It&#x27;s razor, not an entertainment device with unnecessary bells and whistles. (Don&#x27;t even get me started on manufacturers wasting development time and money to jazz up a simple product - I don&#x27;t need a digital readout to tell me how long it took to shave!)  The ES8228 does have a \\&quot;pivot action selector\\&quot; which simply allows the razor head to rotate about ½\\&quot; along multiple axes. This supposedly conforms better to the different angles of your face. I consider this a gimmick and use the switch provided to turn it off. But some may find it useful.  It also has the HyrdaClean Shaving System, a cleaning system that comes with a single disposable solution cartridge. The user manual recommends replacing the cleaning cartridge every 6 months. But Panasonic also provides detailed instructions for cleaning with soap and water - a practical solution to a simple procedure. Most of the time I just brush it clean after each shave, then give it a more thorough wet wash every couple of weeks.  I think that&#x27;s why I like the ES8228 so much - Panasonic doesn&#x27;t waste effort on useless features, but instead provides a product that does what it&#x27;s intended to do, and does it well.  PROS:  - smooth close shave  - battery lasts for several weeks  - easy to clean  - performance doesn&#x27;t diminish with low battery  - good looking design  CONS:  - a little loud  - pivot action (gimmick)</li>
            <li> Awesome for sensitive skin! I can now shave everyday without the redness! It chagres really fast, so I don&#x27;t have to wait long if the battery is depleted.</li>
            <li> Product looks sturdy n cool but It doesnt work on tough beards.  I tried it both wet &amp; dry couple of times and It hardly does it job.  positive thing about the product is it doesn&#x27;t hurt skin at all,, may be this is a best (or good) option for a sensitive light haird beards..</li>
            <li> I have been shaving with safety razors for the past 50 years, having owned an electric as a teen.  The ES8228s with Vortex cleaning system is my retirement gift to myself.  The shaver is as smoothe as my safety razor and so convenient to shave in the shower or anywheres for that matter.  No fuss, no bother, and easily maintained.  The highest rpm in the industry helps to maintain the smoothness too.  The Vortex cleaning system is a nifty system which works much like my dishewasher on a smaller scale.  It cleans and dries and maintains the shaver in an efficient manner with little cost.  So far I have not had a problem in transitioning to the electric.  I have a medium beard, not too thick, but average, though because the color is light, I can get away without shaving for a day.  I am amazed with this product.  Electric shaving has sure come a long way since I was young!  And the price is right too.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my hubby.  He&#x27;s used regular razors for years.  Gone through many electric ones and he&#x27;s always disappointed in them and had to use them in combination with regular blades.  Got him this one for his birthday and he loves it!  Never had a shave that close, loves the fact that it gets cleaned after use, and he doesn&#x27;t even touch the old blades anymore.  I feel like I hit a home-run out of the park with this birthday present.  And, thank you Amazon for recommending it.</li>
            <li> This shaver gives me a great shave is half the time of my old one. I also like the cleaning syatem which keeps my shaver is top shape between shaves.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never reviewed a product before but would be remiss if I didn&#x27;t say that this is the best electric shaver I&#x27;ve owned in 50+ years.  I only purchased because of an Amazon sale, but would pay full retail if I ever needed another.  Very solidly built and best feature is how it self cleans by dripping some liquid soap on the blades, starting the razor, the adding warm water and letting work up a lather, and finally just run under warm water faucet. . . . Voila! Job done.</li>
            <li> [[ASIN:B00176V2SK Panasonic ES8228S Men&#x27;s Linear Vortex Nano Arc Foil Shaving System, Silver]]I&#x27;ve had mine for four months now but haven&#x27;t really used it until I went on an extended vacation,  I&#x27;ll start out and say something must be wrong, because a hundred other owners think the system is a 4 or 5 star shaver. This is the worse shaver I have ever had, not even the cheapest christmas present has ever given me such a poor shave. I have to spend 20 minutes shaving, and it is not close. So I thought maybe it&#x27;s supposed to be a wet shaver, i tried that, didn&#x27;t work much better. Actually to be fair, it went from a one star to a two star as a wet shaver. I contacted Amazon to see about returning it, they said my return date had passed. When I get back to the states, I will try to give panasonic a call. This panasonic says it is ES8228S, mine does not have the S on the end. I don&#x27;t know what to say, I can only tell the problem I am having with it. I&#x27;ve been shaving for 50 years, and never had i shaved with anything as bad as this. I would not recommend this shaver to anyone. Of course if you want one, I will give you a 25 percent discount and ship for free.&lt;br /&gt;Early December i changed my rating from 1 to 4 stars, it does give a very good shave if you push the blades against the shaving surface.</li>
            <li> I purchased this shaver to replace my 7 year old Braun 7570 Syncro. The Braun had been gotten really loud over the past couple of years, due to a loose fitting foil block. A new foil didn&#x27;t fix the problem, so I decided it was time to retire the old girl. I read every review on Amazon and everywhere else before making my decision. It was tough, since I&#x27;ve owned 3 Brauns over the past 16 years, but I really wanted to try a wet shaver and I liked the idea of the 13,000 RPM linear Panasonic motor. Plus, Amazon has great deals on the Panasonic stuff which I just couldn&#x27;t pass up. I just couldn&#x27;t see spending twice as much on the top-of-the-line Braun.     OK, on with the review. The feel of the Panasonic is totally different from the Braun. Like a Japanese car versus a German car. Very different, but great in their own way. Most noticeable is the weight and balance. The Panasonic is much lighter and the motor is in the shaving head, shifting the balance from the handle into head. No bad, just different. The cleaning/charging base is much more streamilined and compact than the Braun. My only gripe is the power cord. I prefer the springy coiled cord of the Braun which feels much higher in quality. But you don&#x27;t shave with the power cord.     Shaving performance... WOW! Since I&#x27;ve been shaving with an electric for 16 years, I didn&#x27;t need the 30 days recommended to let my face adjust. I could tell from Day 1 that I made the correct decision. Great close shave, especially on my upper lip. Shave time for me is about 5 minutes, but I&#x27;m picky and keep going over those tough spots under my jaw until they&#x27;re silky smooth. I can do it in about 3 minutes if I&#x27;m in a hurry. The best part of the new razor for me is when the foil starts to heat up after a minute or so, I just run it under cold water for a few seconds. Not only does the razor stay cool, but the wet foil glides over my face much easier than a dry foil. I never got serious razor burn or a rash with the Braun, but the redness, especially on my neck, is significantly reduced with the Panasonic. I actually enjoy shaving now!     In addition to not liking the power cord, I don&#x27;t like the Panasonic cleaning system as much as the Braun. I prefer the antiseptic quality of the Braun solution and the alcohol based cleaner dries in a fraction of the time. Since I rinse the new shaver after every use, I don&#x27;t have much need for the cleaning base, so this isn&#x27;t as big a deal for me. If I was just rating the shaver itself, I would give it 5 stars. As a system, the cheap power cord and water based cleaner knock it down a notch for me. All in all, I highly recommend this shaver.</li>
            <li> best electric shave ever...no lie....wet with some lather, just destroys my whiskers....cleaner does its job, kinda loud, but i dont mind, cause it makes this baby good as new every time!!!</li>
            <li> I have been a fan of the Panasonic razor since I bought my first one back in 2000.  This is my 3rd Panasonic shaver and it is also the best one that I have owned.  I really liked my last shaver (Panasonic ES8077S) but I didn&#x27;t take as good of care of it as I should have so had to replace it with this one.      This is a reminder to everyone not to let the shaver sit around wet (with the shaving head sitting up) for long periods of time as eventually the water will get inside the unit.  With that said the construction of these shavers did allow me to take it apart easily and clean it up but once I did that the seal was just not as good as it originally was.      With the 8228 I find that the shave is even closer than what I had with the 8077 and that it feels smoother on the skin as well.  The neck is always a hard area to shave and I used to have to use a razor to get it really clean but with the 8228 I seem to be able to get a better shave on my neck as well. I use Gillette Fusion shaving gel and it works great. I saw someone say that they felt the shaver got clogged with the shaving cream but I have not found that to be the case in my use.  With more beard growth it does take more to get through the thickness than normal but take it slow and it will do a great job.  I don&#x27;t think you will find any other shaver that does as good of a job without causing irritation.    I did look at the Phillips Norelco line of wet shavers as well before buying this one, in fact I bought one, took it out of the box, looked at it and just found the construction of the unit so inferior to the Panasonic I was concerned as to how long it would last.  I tried it once and the issue with the Phillips shavers is that it is hard to get those little circular shaving heads everywhere easily and it just felt cheap (it cost almost the same as the 8228).  I thought the idea of having the shaving gel right in the shaver neat but I had a shaver like that a long time ago that after one or two timesrefilling it I never used that feature again.      For me Panasonic is the best wet/dry shaver on the market that I have been able to find at a reasonable price as well and will continue to be a customer of theirs.</li>
            <li> Love love love this shaver. I&#x27;ve been wanting a wet/dry electric razor for years but didn&#x27;t want to spend a ton of money.  Got this one on a lightening deal and after using it 3 times, I would have paid full price. Totally worth it. Nice construction, great fit, easy to use (once I got through the somewhat complicated manual).  Treat yourself and get this.</li>
            <li> I bought this razor about 4 months ago and the first time I used it I was very disapointed. It was a terrible shave and I had to use my disposable to finish up after a frustrating 15 minute shave with this thing. I read that it takes a while to get used to a new razor so I decided to give it some time. After 3 months of using it I gave up and its sitting in my drawer and hasn&#x27;t been touched since. It seemed to work \\&quot;ok\\&quot; on the cheek area, over the lip and jaw line but I could not get it to shave well at all on my neck no matter which way I went. I would pull and stretch the skin while shaving and not once did I get a good shave. Going up, down, side ways, in a circe didnt matter. I tried this both dry and wet and I found the wet shave was worse than the dry. Which is wierd because the wet shave is supposed to be a much better shave. 90% of the time I ended up shaving the neck area with a disposable after using this razor.The pop out side burn trimmer is absolutely useless as it doesn&#x27;t cut at all. After 3 months I decided that it didnt make sense to have to shave twice everyday and retired this razor. I suppose it is possible I recieved a faulty razor but I personally would not reccommend this product to anyone.</li>
            <li> I have had this razor for about 2 years now and have 5 issues with it. 1. Does not hold a charge for very long. 2. Discharges just sitting there. 3. Only gets about 5 or 6 shaves out of a charge. 4. It leaves too many long hairs 5. And the supposedly sideburns trimmer is useless. I am unable to see what I&#x27;m trying to trim because of the location of the trimmer on the back side of the shaver. In all honestly...I do not recommend this shaver.</li>
            <li> This razor is awesome. I thought it was a little loud at first, but I&#x27;m used to it now. Who cares, anyway, the shave is great, and maintenance is easy.</li>
            <li> I purchased this over two years ago so I can finally give you my long-term review:  This is a great shaver for the most part.  It&#x27;s very comfortable and has never left a nick or rash.  I&#x27;ve used it wet and dry but mostly dry.  The cleaner works great and the shaver looks new and smells fresh every day.  The batteries hold a charge for over a week which is almost as good as when I first got it.  I have replaced the blades and foil once.  A couple of nit-picky points:  It doesn&#x27;t shave as close as a blade, but perhaps no shaver does.  It takes kind of long to shave.  My old $30 Remmington did a quicker job.  Just today, the beard trimmer broke.  It did see a lot of use, but kind of disappointing that I&#x27;ll either have to purchase a separate beard trimmer or purchase a whole new shaver.  Overall, I highly recommend this well-made shaver, especially if you won&#x27;t be using the beard trimmer much.</li>
            <li> I received my shaver about a month ago.  Great price with a rebate made it a bargain.  I&#x27;ve used electric shavers for over 30 years, most recently Braun and Remington (blech).  This is a powerful and effective shaver.  The motor buzzes like a bumblebee and never slows, regardless of the beard thickness.  The length of shave time has been cut in half from my old Remington and the shave is nice and close.  The unit came with the charger/cleaner which I thought was just a gimmick until I used it.  I&#x27;ve used it once since I&#x27;ve had the shaver and it made the unit come out like new.  I highly recommend this shaver although I understand it is being phased out for a newer model.  If the new ones are any thing like this, buy it!</li>
            <li> I ordered this shaver for my boyfriend in December,still underneath the sink and it&#x27;s June.  He said it doesn&#x27;t have a close enough shave. I tried.</li>
            <li> I used to own a panasonic that I got as a gift about 5 years ago and I used it until it completely broke. Then I tried a phillips shaver, one with the round circles on it. It was horrible and would catch my skin. It would give me irritation for hours. So I went to the razor. Then went to the safety razor with blade and shaving soap. Then I decided it would be better for my career to shave more than once a week. Hence the purchase of this. The shave with the poroso shaving soap is amazing and it litterally is better than a straight razor shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just buy this.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the Braun 8995 shaver for over two years and switched to this Panasonic shaver a couple of days ago. I got a very close shave on first use without the nicks and cuts of the Braun. Also unlike the Braun this Panasonic shaver unit hardly vibrates although it does make a loud wining noise. The big difference between the two is that you can use the Panasonic in the shower with shaving cream which I consider a big plus. However the Panasonics recharging base is harder to use than the Brauns but you can also wash the Panasonic shaver under warm water without using its recharging base, saving on the cost of having to buy detergent cleaning cartridges every month. Another thing I like about the ES822S model is it is made in Japan not China which is rare these days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE 08/29/12 Broke after a year. Cartridge replacement stunk to high-hell and made water smell foul. I found the Panasonic very hard to maintain and keep clean. It does Not matter that it is made in Japan. If a Product from China is of high quality then buy it from China. I Have returned to using a regular old fashioned manual razor with Gillette Shaving gel and I find gives the closest least irritating shave. IMHO there is NO electric razor that shaves as close as a manual razor blade! Only use if you have a medical necessity to use an electric or need to save money on expensive blades.</li>
            <li> What seems to make this a good shaver also makes it vulnerable to premature wear. Yes, it gives a terrific shave, nearly as close as a wet blade, and better than any other electric I have tried.     Evidently Panasonic makes the outer foil quite thin to achieve this.  After only about 3 months of &#x27;on and off&#x27; use, the outer foil on my 8228 wore through completely.  Another downside is battery life. I can only get 3 complete shaves before having to recharge the battery.    I have contacted Panasonic&#x27;s online warranty site only to learn I&#x27;m going to have to return the entire shaver, and for who knows how long.    And, if the warranty fails to cover my complaint, I&#x27;m looking at [...] to replace the outer foil.  So, buyer beware!</li>
            <li> The ES8228S shaver is my fifth panasonic wet/dry shaver and is a nice improvement to my old linear. My tips for use: Warm water; Skintimate (women&#x27;s shaving gel with baby oil); a quick double/triple blade shave; rinse and re-apply gel and then use the Panasonic. With sensitive skin and a fast growing beard this works twice a day with no irritation to me. Use the shaver with dry hands as it is very slippery when wet. The addition of some silicon pads on the grip would be nice. I made some so it would be easier to handle than live bait. Great amazon price.</li>
            <li> My husband has believed that electric razors do not shave close enough. Since using this razor, he has changed his mind.</li>
            <li> I used to be a Panasonic user years ago, then my wife gave me a Braun 360° 4 years ago. I got used to it, but then recently it was not shaving as I required.  I wen ahead and bought this Panasonic and I have to say it gives me a better shave than the Braun and I got no irritation! I am very happy with it!</li>
            <li> This is a good razor.  The cleaning system works well and the visible charging indicator is great.  No need to guess whether to charge or not.  This is my first arc foil razor and I like.  Provides a smooth shave without irriatation.</li>
            <li> I tried my Panasonic ES8228S razor for the first time today.  After about three seconds, I pulled it away from my face, shut it off, and stared at it.  Was that thing really that loud?  I turned it on and tried shaving again.  It made my ear hurt on the side I was shaving.  Calling it loud is an understatement.  I couldn&#x27;t bear to have that thing running anywhere near my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I own a Simpson 886-2 sound level meter.  (I use it for setting up surround sound systems.)  It seemed like a good idea to test this razor against my old Norelco that I&#x27;ve been using for years.  The Norelco measured around 73 dBA; the Panasonic pushed the meter to 82 dBA.  That&#x27;s actually dangerously loud.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Prolonged exposure to noises of 85 dBA and above will cause hearing damage.  That&#x27;s on average.  Some people may find that sounds at levels even lower than 85 dBA are damaging.  Also keep in mind that as the source is moved closer to your ears, the sound level increases.  In this case, since the razor is used to shave your face, it will be very close to your ears.  No wonder it hurt.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I packed the razor up and contacted Amazon for a return slip.  It&#x27;s bad enough that I&#x27;m nearsighted.  I&#x27;m not risking going deaf, too.</li>
            <li>  had been used Panasonic ES762 (vety old one) for along time, then i have just purchased this one.  when i tried it as a fisrt time, i was surprised because of not heart or bloody skin. shaving is very soft and smooth.    The Shaver is a Panasonic.    Thanks guys</li>
            <li> My husband loves this shaver......after his old one finally hit the dust, after  years of use, I bought him another....and he once again loves the Panasonic Vortex Nano shaver......thx DL</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not over-exaggerating when I say that this razor is truly one of the best purchases I have ever made. Wow, does this thing ever live up to it&#x27;s billing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First, some background...I have lived for years with the pain, troubles, and embarrassment of terrible razor burn.  I shaved with every iteration of the Gillette blades from the time I started shaving as a kid.  About 5 years ago, I finally tried the electric route and have used a Norelco Quadra 7 and Gillette Fusion interchangeably depending on the situation (about 90% electric and razor for touch ups).  No matter how you slice it, I either had numerous missed hairs on my face and neck and terrible razor burn.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No more!  This Panasonic 8228s is a miracle worker.  It truly shaved as close as the 5-blade Gillette (I use it dry) and was gentle as can be on my skin....there is no \\&quot;tugging\\&quot; or \\&quot;pulling\\&quot; feeling that I always experienced with my Norelco.  This is also the first time that I&#x27;ve tried a foil shaver.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I finish shaving, there is NO BURN on my face...my face and neck are smooth, few if any missed hairs (this requires far fewer passes than my Norelco), and I feel like I shaved with a blade without the residual bleeding or irritation.  What a relief!  I can leave for work in the morning knowing that my skin looks good and I have a close shave without being self-conscious from razor irriation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cleaning base is also pretty cool; though gimicky, it&#x27;s kind of nice to be able to \\&quot;Set it and forget it.\\&quot;  The only caveat, and my only complaint at all about the system, is that the cleaning system is a wee bit noisy.  If you shave before bed and the razor is in the master bath, you&#x27;re going to hear it working for a half hour or so.  Doesn&#x27;t bother me since I shave in the morning, but just wanted to make sure that you don&#x27;t think that it&#x27;s silent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, I would have paid at least twice what I did on Amazon for this....this is my holy grail, I can&#x27;t believe I finally found a shaver that actually gets as close as a blade without the irritation.  You will not be disappointed, and with the current rebate Amazon is promoting, this thing is an absolute steal.tually gets as close as a blade without the irritation.  You will not be disappointed, and with the current rebate Amazon is promoting, this thing is an absolute steal.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using a Braun 8585 for the past several years, and haven&#x27;t been all that pleased with it, mostly because of the consumables and the fact the cleaning fluid evaporates whether you use it or not.    With the recent sale on the Panasonic, I had to go for it.  Night and day.  The entire razor cost just a bit more than replacement foil/blade for the Braun (which was needed).  The cleaning cart for this won&#x27;t evaporate, but more importantly.... the shave was AS CLOSE as a blade.  I let my hair grow for 4 days in anticipation of the arrival of this just to see what it could do.  It passed the wife and toddler test with flying colors.  My son likes to rub his cheek against mine after I&#x27;ve shaved, if there&#x27;s any stubble at all, he comments about it.  NADA.  This was a dry shave too.  Battery life DOES seem a bit short (down 10% when I shave, but since it only displays 10% increments, perhaps it shows 90% when it&#x27;s really at 99%?).  Anyway, goodbye Braun, I&#x27;m never coming back.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had a cheap electric razor for years. This is much better. Shaving in the shower rocks.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll add my effusive praise for the Panasonic ES8228S to the others here. I&#x27;ve been using Norelco Quadra shavers for the past 8 years, quite happily; and had Braun and Eltron shavers before that (Eltrons have Braun bodies and upgraded gold plated foils and cutting blocks). I use blades fitfully in between - liking the close shave but not liking the nicks and longer ritual. I gave up on the foil shavers and went back to Norelco because the foil shavers required more care in use to avoid burn. Plus they seemed to need more frequent foil and cutting block replacement than the Norelcos. Norelcos also let you shave in a quick swirly motion I enjoyed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The ES8228S is a different league than all of those. Unlike other foil shavers of my past, this one seems immune to shaver burn - while having all the closeness in spades. I attribute this to a remarkable synergy of technologies: the 13,000 rpm magnetic drive motor with its speed and relative lack of vibration; the curved dual thin foils with the hyper-sharp cutting blocks; the fact that the head and foil assemblies can independently move and pivot to fit your face; the excellent centrally mounted long-hair capturing cutter (the 3rd cutting block - more of a slot in between the two foils). I&#x27;ve always had a problem with stray long hairs down in my neck - and the ES8228S is the first shaver I&#x27;ve ever had that did a good job of getting these.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In use, the ES8228S feels incredibly light and smooth on your face. It&#x27;s loud, but there&#x27;s not too much buzzing on your skin. The beard disappears very quickly and afterward your skin feels remarkable unburned. It&#x27;s just flat out the best shave I&#x27;ve ever had. BTW - I&#x27;ve only been using it dry. Part of what I didn&#x27;t like about blade shaving was the hot water ritual. Used wet with shaving gel it&#x27;s even better - but I always end up using it dry because it&#x27;s plenty good that way and I&#x27;m done quicker.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The EW8228S charges quickly - about an hour for a full charge. It has a lithium ion battery which should last a long time. A big backlit LED display tells you level of charge as a percentage number. It comes with a cartridge detergent cleaning/charging unit (the \\&quot;HydraClean\\&quot; system)that washes and lubricates the shaver automatically; but the detergent cartridges cost $5/month ($15 for a 3 pack) list. They are currently discounted about 30% on Amazon. The HydraClean unit can charge, clean, rinse, and dry in any combination (e.g. you can set it to just charge, or just dry or whatever combination). It&#x27;s a little noisy for the first 20 minutes of the cleaning cycle but then settles down. It has an odor that I find not to my liking, but the unit is certainly clean and somewhat lubricated afterwards. You can also clean the unit with water and hand soap using a an \\&quot;ultrasonic\\&quot; speed mode. It&#x27;s very convenient and works very quickly and well. The charging cable also charges the shaver directly so use of the \\&quot;HydraClean\\&quot; bath unit is entirely optional. I&#x27;ve ended up using it once a week for the lubrication effect - and according to the docs I should be able to use it for 3 months at that usage level. I wash it under the tap after every use so it&#x27;s clean as a whistle all the time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cutter and foil assemblies cost about 1/2 the cost of the shaver - list - to replace (once again, discounted about 30% on Amazon). This is a bit high - but given the extraordinary quality of the shave and the incredibly reasonable cost of the whole unit, I&#x27;ll put up with it. The cutting block is supposed to last a year and the foil two years - so it&#x27;s not like you&#x27;re doing it all the time. Given how good this thing shaves with a fresh cutting block, this will probably be the first shaver I&#x27;ve owned where I don&#x27;t resent replacing the cutting block every year.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, it&#x27;s clearly a quality unit with unbelievable performance at a real world price.

            <li> I bought this shaver from Amazon.com in October because Panasonic had an instant $30 rebate during the month of October. I had an older Braun Razor that was an earlier \\&quot;Pulsonic\\&quot; series but the foil over the cutter block always ended up getting a hole in it resulting in my face bleeding with one damaged hole in the foil. Braun sells the foil and cutter block assembly as a package and the cost keeps going up. I&#x27;ve spent three times the price of my old Braun shaver on cutter blocks and foils. I finally researched the Panasonic Nano Vortex and found that it had the fastest speed for I have a very thick beard and could be washed under the sink with water and hand soap if you&#x27;re on a trip and don&#x27;t want to take along the cleaning/charging unit. It comes with a beautiful leather case and with the wood grain and gold accents, it seems that Panasonic designed it to actually fit comfortably in one&#x27;s hand. The trimmer is also a step above the Braun trimmer for it sticks out away from the razor instead of along side it where you may be trimming your moustache or sideburns and end up shaving your moustache or sideburns with the Braun...a design flaw with Braun that&#x27;s never been corrected. The Panasonic also employs a soap cartridge rather than an alcohol cartridge to clean the razor in it&#x27;s station. With Braun cleaning systems, you must replace the alcohol about once a month if not sooner. I&#x27;ve owned the Panasonic Nano Vortex since October 13th and shaved with it daily, yet the \\&quot;status\\&quot; light (a light that comes on to tell you to replace the soap cartridge) has yet to come on! With the Panasonic, it&#x27;s cut my shaving time down to half of what a Braun used to take me. The lithium ion battery really does take less than an hour to fully charge the unit and the Nickel Hydroxide batteries that come in Braun&#x27;s? Well, mine is dead and needs replacing but I could still use it while it was plugged into an AC receptacle. I found out that the Braun replacement battery would cost more than I paid for the razor initially. Before purchasing the Panasonic Nano Vortex razor I read complaints about the noise level from the cleaning/charging stand. I found this \\&quot;noise\\&quot; was the razor being turned on in the cleaning station when the soap and water mixture were in the bottom of it. Pretty good idea if you ask me that the razor is turned on to remove ALL residue from the shaver. Panasonic also has this razor set up for wet or dry shaves, in or out of the shower or bathtub, with or without shaving cream. I use it dry and am completely satisfied with it&#x27;s results but have heard that wet shaving will be even closer! Panasonic also sells cheaper razors of this design for women so they may shave their legs in the bathtub for the unit IS totally submersible. It comes with a 30 day Panasonic warranty that if you don&#x27;t like it, you can send it back for a full refund.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only Negative thing I have to say about this purchase is that I first saw it in a Target store, but really couldn&#x27;t tell much about it (with all the screws they put in their high tech razors so no one will steal parts...bad idea Target), yet when I went to Target to purchase the three soap cartridge packs, I found that they DON&#x27;T carry ANY parts for the Panasonic Razor line! You have to order it from Target online or another store in your area, whereas Target carries ALL the accessories for the Braun and Norelco line.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The best thing about the Panasonic Nano Vortex 8282s, is that they sell the foil and cutter block separately! The instruction manual says to replace the foil about once a year and the cutter block assembly, once every two years! Finally a company that sells the parts separately rather than in a package, but once again Target doesn&#x27;t carry the foil or cutter block in their stores and you would have to purchase it online. My recommendation is that should you purchase the razor, buy the three pack of cleaning \\&quot;solution\\&quot; with it for this is all you&#x27;ll need for I know you&#x27;ll fall in love with this item as I have and in the women&#x27;s line, it&#x27;s a great shaver for your wife or girlfriend.ve with this item as I have and in the women&#x27;s line, it&#x27;s a great shaver for your wife or girlfriend.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin on my neck, and until recently I couldn&#x27;t shave every day.  A few months ago I began trying different shaving products and techniques in hope of finding something that would work for me.  For the last three weeks, I&#x27;ve been wet-shaving with this shaver and Billy Jealousy Hydroplane shaving cream with no irritation to speak of.    No, this shaver doesn&#x27;t shave a close as a blade, but since for me the alternative was shaving every second day, it&#x27;s way closer than a blade on one day out of two.  It also doesn&#x27;t deal with long hair very well, so I feel like I can&#x27;t skip a day.  That&#x27;s the only reason I haven&#x27;t given it 5 stars.    If the Hydroplane seems too expensive, I&#x27;ve also used the shaver with inexpensive shaving oil with good results.  The shave is slightly less comfortable during the act, but doesn&#x27;t result in any lingering irritation.  The oil seems to leave a film on the blades and foil, so more frequent cleaning is needed.  It didn&#x27;t work well with any of the traditional shaving creams or gels that I tried.  They seem to clog the works and the shave, while comfortable, isn&#x27;t very close.    Used dry, this shaver wasn&#x27;t any better than the many others I&#x27;ve tried over the years.  I also can&#x27;t say that this model is any better than the less-expensive Panasonic wet-dry shavers on the market.  What I can say is that used in the shower with the right shaving lube it results in the least irritation of any method I&#x27;ve ever tried.</li>
            <li> This is my first electric razor (and I am over 50).  This item is as close as a blade yet does not cut me under the nose which my trusty blade does.  Waterproof?  Heck yes....I use it everyday in the shower with nothing more than the water of the shower.  When I step out I simply put it in its charging base and select dry and charge or clean. I do not have experience with other electrics but this has everything I wanted and does the job.  I can not ever see going back to the blade. Also the cleaning stuff can be purchased on Amazon or Ebay quite cheap so this is not a problem.</li>
            <li> Was my favorite shaver until the charging base stopped cleaning. Which naturally occurred when it was about 2 months out of warranty, and Panasonic wouldn&#x27;t budge. \\&quot;Buy our newer model for $220.\\&quot; Are you joking? Normally this failure might not have annoyed me so much (it was, after all, out of warranty) had I been using it exclusively, however I had been using it simultaneously with a Braun model during the exact same time period, trying to decide between the two. So technically the Panasonic was only used for half the warranty period. When you consider this, the foils literally outlasted the charging base. My Norelco costing less than half still works after 6 years. I typically have high regard for Panasonic products, however this experience left me disappointed in both the shaver&#x27;s reliability and especially in Panasonic customer service.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As I said it was my favorite shaver. It shaves closely and comfortably. It is a bit loud though. If someone was on the phone or listening closely to the TV, I leave the room as a courtesy. And if someone&#x27;s sleeping, I have to sequester myself in the bathroom and close the door to avoid waking them. But most of the time that&#x27;s no problem. The Braun I have shaves just as close in roughly the same amount of time, however this shaver somehow transmits better feedback to the user on closeness of the shave.  In other words with the Braun I have to frequently \\&quot;double check\\&quot; the closeness of the shave with my hand before moving on to the next area, whereas with the Panasonic I could usually tell much more easily just by sound and feel when I was finished with an area of my beard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One note about shaver preference: Some of the reviews you&#x27;ll find vary widely. I think it comes down to matching the type of foil on the shaver to the thickness of your particular hair. In my experience, the larger the holes in the foil, the quicker (and possibly closer) shave I&#x27;ll get, but at the expense of comfort due to razor burns. Thesmaller the holes in the foil, the more comfortable the shave, but it may take longer to complete, particularly if you have thicker diameter hair.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this razor for more than 6 months now. Can&#x27;t live without it any more. Easy to use and easy to clean. Very comfortable grip too.</li>
            <li> I have been using this shaver for the past 8 months or so and absolutely love it. I use it everyday without any problems, but I have to shave everyday. If i miss one day, this shaver doesn&#x27;t like it very much. If you shave everyday, it is great. Holds its charge for good period. I usually take it without the charger to trips and has worked great for me during the trip (usually week long trips). I have not replaced the detergent at all, so I  only wash it under hot water.</li>
            <li> GREAT, BETTER THEN I EXPECTED. SHAVER GAVE ME A SMOOTH,CLOSE AND A NO IRRITATION SHAVE. I WOULD PURCHASE AGAIN FROM AMAZON.COM, THEY DELIVERED MY SHAVER BEFORE MY DELIVERY DATE WITH NO PROBLEMS.</li>
            <li> The unit is well made but it takes forever to shave with. I&#x27;ve tried the wet shave a few times but mostly use it dry. This is my first foil shaver but I have used several rotary shavers in the past.  The cleaning system is a gimmick.  I&#x27;d much prefer if they gave us a car adapter instead.</li>
            <li> Shaving has always been an ordeal for me, untill I purchased this product.  The comfort of an electric shave in the shower solved all issues.  When I get out of the shower, I&#x27;m done!!  I love this product.  For what it&#x27;s worth, I&#x27;m over 60, and have tried every conceivable method,technique, product, and shortcut to shave grooming.  This is the only way to go!</li>
            <li> Works well, but not perfect. Sometimes have to go over the same spot multiple times, although this has been the case with other shavers as well.</li>
            <li> Great shaver and it even cleans it self.&lt;br /&gt;BOB</li>
            <li> The shaver works better than any other Panasonic that I have used before.  The cleaning and charging system is GREAT....It will shave you very close....\\&quot; IF \\&quot;.....you have the time..This is the only complaint that I have.....IT TAKES A LONG TIME IF YOU CHOOSE TO SHAVE CLOSE. I have found that using Lectric Shave works best before shaving.</li>
            <li> I bought this razor for my husband and he loves it for the no tugging and easy, smooth shave.  I love it because it is no mess! No more hairs all over the bathroom counter!!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had several electric razors in my lifetime (85 years) and this is by far, the best one I have ever had.  It recharges very easily and quickly and gives a smooth shave.  After disappointments with several other razors, this is a welcome relief.  I am extremely pleased with it.</li>
            <li> I reviewed ALL electric razors for my man, this one by far is the best purchase for your money. My man is \\&quot;Hairy\\&quot;, thick hair, he could probably grow a beard within a few days - He loves this razor and it doesn&#x27;t chaffe his face.  Highly recommended!  Not to mention that i purchased through Amazon and it was here within a few days, great job Amazon!</li>
            <li> I am 72 yrs old and have had a full beard for nearly 40 years and my wife decided it was time to shave it off.  The first shave with this razor was following a good \\&quot;clipping\\&quot; with my Wahl beard trimmer. I was amazed at the quality of the dry-shave and the closeness without razor burn for the &#x27;first time&#x27;. It also did a good job with the fine hairs around my \\&quot;turkey neck\\&quot; with only a minimal of fine hairs left behind.  However, after 2 weeks of every other day shaves I switched to the wet-shave mode and was even more pleased.  This did result in some razor bumps and infected hairs around my lower neck line but following another 2 weeks these went away and I am now shaving while getting my morning shower.    With a little patience this can be the best electric razor system for the money a young man, or old man, can expereince.      Amazon had the[[ASIN:B003U20HUS Panasonic ES8228 Men&#x27;s Linear Vortex Nano Arc Foil Shaving System]] best price and free shipping with extremely quick shipping time.  Amazon is my favorite e-shop.</li>
            <li> Only useful for regular moustache trimming</li>
            <li> My Husband does not have thick/coarse hair, he probably could never grow a \\&quot;Santa\\&quot; beard but he does have to shave on a regular basis. Probably about 10 years ago he tried an electric razor and looked like he was attacked by an angry Cat, that went back to the store.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From that time on he had only ever used a regular manual razor and MOST of the time he was bleeding all over his neck &amp; several places on his face &amp; the irritation would last for days making the next shave painful. It didn&#x27;t matter how careful he was, his skin was just sensitive to shaving.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;He finally decided to give an electric razor a try again because he was always in such a hurry in the mornings(he LOVES the snooze button a little too much) After much research by me, I showed him a few I thought would work best based on reviews, price &amp; features. We both liked this one best &amp; ordered it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Of course he had to try it out right away &amp; much to both our amazement he did NOT have a single nick &amp; his face was smooth. He uses this...in a very big Hurry normally, sometimes everyday or every other day &amp; MOST of the time he doesn&#x27;t have any irritation or nicks. Very rarely does he have irritation or nicks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And it really is a VERY close shave, I&#x27;m never pushing him away telling him his stubble is scratching me, his face is always smooth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have sensitive skin, always getting nicks or irritation, give this razor a try. My husband LOVES it!! He has never used it wet yet because it does such a good job dry.</li>
            <li> Listen up, I don&#x27;t write reviews, so when I do take note!  I been using various electric razors over the years to shave my face and head (norleco, remington, braun).  The best one before now was the Braun Series 7 pulsonic.  But even this great unit didnt match shaving with a blade for closes, and it didn&#x27;t like it if you took 1-2 days off from shaving.  But all of that is now in the past!    The bomb is this Pansonic unit!  The shave on my face truly feels like I shaved with a blade.  Its quick, no going over an area 5 times to get the cut.  I took a weekend off from shaving to give it the ultimate test, and it shaved the growth with ease.  I like the base cleaning unit, but have also found cleaning under the faceut works just as well.  The only dig I&#x27;ve read several times on this unit is you might be replacing the foils every 4-6 months.  For the quality of the shave I&#x27;m happy to do that even earlier!    Good luck to all you shavers on the electric shaver quest....I found mine!</li>
            <li> Bought this a little over a month ago. Good shave dry. Superb with shave cream. I recommend Burt&#x27;s Bees! Bought the Billy Jealousy, but it left me with neck burn, not so with the Burt&#x27;s Bees!  Felt so comfortable with this combo I shaved my head two days ago.. did not have much to loose anyway. Another great shave!</li>
            <li> This razor is the ultimate in portability and closeness of shave,and it can be used wet or dry.Perfect for my vacation razor,easier for me then my Braun to take along even though I do love the Braun.So this is my \\&quot;dynamic duo\\&quot;of razors.</li>
            <li> In all my years of buying electric razors and trying friends I had given up. I thought they were all garbage. My son did some research thru consumers and several sites and found out that of all the razors that  are out there the customers seemed to rate the Panasonic pretty high. Anyways I bought this and it&#x27;s great on my Italian beard. You can use it wet, dry, with or without shave cream. It works great in all settings. It seems to fully charge in less then 15 min. But holds a charge forever. Every once in a while you run into a product that is so outstanding that it improves the task of shaving, gives you a great deep shave  or a quick touch up. If you get this you&#x27;re not going to be disappointed!!</li>
            <li> I had high hopes for this product when I purchased it a year ago. I have now been using it for a while and I can tell you all of its faults. First off it gets loud, really loud. So loud in fact that I wear earplugs when I use it. I know, I know, time for a new shaver, but I&#x27;m cheap and I like to use a product until it dies. The shave really is not comfortable at all, it never has been. Replacing the blades doesn&#x27;t help, hell it makes it hurt worse. Worst of all, it doesn&#x27;t work when its plugged in. If it ran out of charge and you need to shave that next morning you are SOL. That to me is the worst feature of all and its one that no one really considers when choosing a razor. It&#x27;s only redeeming qualities are that it looks nice and it works in the shower. Its at its best in the shower and thats the only time that its not painful to use. I would advise buying a different razor.</li>
            <li> Holds the charge great. Couldn&#x27;t get a better shave.</li>
            <li> First impression :    Ist very good at shaving very close....lets see how ots going to bahave in future</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve owned a high-end Panasonic shaver before so when it was time for a new unit I wanted to go with Panasonic again. I didn&#x27;t care about the cleaning system but I did want a dock so the shaver had an uncluttered place for daily storage and charging. I did some research and the ES8228S looked like a good choice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This unit lived up to my expectations for an upper-level Panasonic shaver. It shaves quickly and does a great job. However, the constantly blinking lights on this device are driving me crazy! It&#x27;s enough to override my pleasure with how well it shaves.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When the shaver is charging it&#x27;s not bad. But as soon as it reaches 100% charge the orange backlight for the LCD display in the shaver&#x27;s handle begins blinking. I don&#x27;t know what they were thinking when they designed it this way. I have several other rechargeable devices that blink while charging. But they all stop any blinking at full charge. This just feels backwards. But even worse, the constant blinking is incredibly annoying at night.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My shaver is on a shelf in the bathroom adjoining our master bedroom. The blinking light is not super bright but it&#x27;s enough to light up the doorway with each blink. It feels like I&#x27;m in a cheap hotel with a flashing sign outside the window or something. And if you wander into the bathroom in the middle of the night it&#x27;s there blinking in your face. It&#x27;s not pleasant at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In addition, the cleaning / charging dock also has several indicator LEDs on the front. If you don&#x27;t install a cleaning cartridge then they all blink and you can&#x27;t turn them off. That was easy enough to fix by installing the cartridge. But something tells me the blinking will begin again when the cartridge needs changing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So now this beautifully designed, easy to hold shaver has those aesthetics ruined by hunks of ugly black tape covering all the lights.</li>
            <li> I bought this as a \\&quot;Deal of the Day\\&quot; item.  I&#x27;ve been shaving for years with a Norelco electric razor, but needed another one for a second home.  The Panasonic does a very good job.  It&#x27;s a bit loud, but you get used to the \\&quot;buzzing\\&quot; sound it makes.  The battery power doesn&#x27;t last too long, but you just plug it in and it&#x27;s ready to go.  Cleaning is simple:  just run under some water.  I haven&#x27;t used the Charger/Cleaning accessory that comes with it, so I can&#x27;t comment on that.  So far, I&#x27;m pleased with the purchase.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE:  I&#x27;m afraid this razor has found its way to my drawer.  The shave is a bit too rough for me.  Also, the hair falls from the blades and makes a mess on the countertop.  My Norelco holds most of the hair inside.  Each face is different, so obviously each person will have a different experience.  I&#x27;ve been using Norelco for decades; I guess I should stick with what I&#x27;m familiar with.</li>
            <li> I recently got fed up with the expense of replacement blades on traditional razors. I did the math and decided that even if it lasted only a year or so then a good electric razor would have been worth it. I did a lot of research and finally decided that this unit was the most suitable for my needs. It&#x27;s been almost 3 months now and I&#x27;m extremely pleased with this product.    I use this primarily for shaving in the shower and was amazed to find that I can get a shave that is as-good-as or better than I was getting with more traditional razors. Generally I can get a shave that is just as close but with less irritation than a regular razor would give me. The only issue that I have is that there are a couple of trouble spots under my jaw bone.  With enough patience I can usually even get a good shave on these spots, but most of the time I just shave with the Panasonic and then use my traditional razor to tidy up those two spots afterward.    After experiencing such an excellent wet shave I was expecting similar results when dry shaving, but was somewhat disappointed. It does an OK job, but my cheap travel Braun M60 works considerably better for dry shaves.    I opted for this model with the charging/cleaning base because our water has a lot of minerals in it. I felt that using pure water and the cleaning/lubrication cartridge is probably better for the longevity of the razor. Only time will tell if this was worth it, but so far I am optimistic.</li>
            <li> I have tried quite a few different electric shavers and this one most definitely tops them all!</li>
            <li> Quality product. Very quick and smooth shaves.  Battery life per charge is adequate for several shaves.  The foil and cutting head seems to last a long time.  I tried my old Braun shaver and I went right back to the Panasonic.  I am glad I bought it.</li>
            <li> I ordered this during Amazon Deals of the Day the other day and of course chose overnight for Prime members. I usually don&#x27;t write reviews after one use but this thing is just AWESOME. I&#x27;ve totally forgotten about my Braun after just one shave. I&#x27;ve been a Braun loyalist since i started shaving. The Panasonic just got a closer shave, a bit loud, but well worth it. I used it wet (sounds dirty) this morning and i feel no sense of facial burns or skin irritation that I got with my Braun from time to time. I am recommending this with 5 stars and will be ordering another for my dad.</li>
            <li> Love it so much, you can use it in the shower.  I highly recommend it using shaving cream with it due to closeness shave you get without irritating the face.  The best shaver money can buy!</li>
            <li> I am so pleased at how well this razor is able to clean up my face. It&#x27;s great for quick cleanup of the 5-o&#x27;clock shadow or after a few days of growth. The only issue I have is that it doesn&#x27;t seem to be able to get all areas of my neck or under my chin. Were it able to, I&#x27;d have rated it a 5.</li>
            <li> I have been using for long years Philips Shavers. but the quality and performance of Philips products have been decreasing for years unfortunately. I tried Broun before and it was ineffective and take so much time.   decided to buy this and this Panasonic is the same. So noisy and inefficient.</li>
            <li> I was a fan of Panasonics until I noticed they don&#x27;t last very long.  This expensive one should&#x27;ve lasted longer than 18 months...Using Braun now.  It&#x27;s pretty good.</li>
            <li> I believe in giving credit where credit is due, but I also believe in letting others know when I have a BAD EXPERIENCE. I tried to give it 0 stars, but the system here would not let me so I had to give it 1 star.  Amazon did a great job with the speed of the delivery and that part was flawless, however, the razor itself left much to be desired. For the record, this is the 4th Panasonic wet/dry razor I have purchased in the last 7 years and I expected this one to be equally as good as the others. Boy, was I wrong!  The razor did not shave my neck very well at all and I had to use a regular razor to get the stubble off every time. I could live with that, but after having this piece of garbage for only 5 weeks, the battery display on the unit went bad.   As per their instructions, I sent the whole unit back to panasonic with the charger to be repaired or replaced. They stated once received, it would take 48 hours to process my repair and I would have it back within 2 weeks. HA!!!!  It has taken panasonic 17 days to process my order and they finally returned my call after leaving them a pretty animated message. At this point I told them I did not care to get the razor back and that I would only accept a refund. They are going to give me a refund, but it is going to take 4-8 weeks to get my money back. In other words, it will take longer to get a refund that the time I was actually able to use the razor.  Shaving in the shower saves me time and until now panasonic had been the only company to offer a true wet/dry razor. Now that Norelco has introduced a line of wet/dry razors, I think its time to give them a try. I will NOT be buying a panasonic wet/dry razor again!</li>
            <li> This was to be my fifth Panasonic wet/dry shaver in about 18 years, and obviously I like them because I keep buying them. The ES8228 shaver itself is excellent. I have an average beard in terms of thickness and growth rate, although I do have a problem with other shavers and razors because I have curly hair and get ingrown hairs, a problem I do not have with Panasonic shavers used wet with Edge gel. Clean, close shaves with no irritation, and that&#x27;s what it&#x27;s all about. About 10 shaves per charge for me, less than the advertised 14. As a Gold Box special item, the price was great too. A five star product... so why only a four star rating?  The HydraClean base has been a feature that I&#x27;ve had my doubts about before--it does keep the shaver looking clean, but does it really do anything that using the turbo wash feature with a little soap doesn&#x27;t? Is it worth extra money to have this? Is this a weak link in the life of these shavers (five years on my last one, and with Lithium batteries, I can see the current models going even longer)?  While I&#x27;m still not sure about the effectiveness and value of HydraClean, unfortunately I am now convinced that this is a weak link. My new shaver was/is just fine, but the first time I used the cleaning base, it spit up cleaning solution all over the counter and promptly shorted out. Since it was going to be a pain to deal with Panasonic service (what, return the whole shaver for a defective base problem? how many weeks?), I have returned this to Amazon (thanks Amazon!) and will be replacing it with an ES8249 (yes, I know; trying again with another HydraClean base--hope it&#x27;s a different model with the later-generation shaver).  Highly recommend the shaver, but consider if you wouldn&#x27;t be better off buying one without HydraClean.</li>
            <li> [[VIDEOID:mo3HGGUDOWJ9XQX]]I wrote out my review and then decided to try a video review.  Some of the parts you can tell I&#x27;m reading my written review. Sorry if it seems scripted and not well done.</li>
            <li> I received this shaver approximately 6 years ago. A few months ago the cleaning system stopped working.&lt;br /&gt;Luckily, the shaver is very easy to clean manually. This shaver combined with Williams Lectric Shaver provides a very close shave. I have used many shavers including Braun Syncro, Norelco, and Remington. This Panasonic seems to provide a better shave compared to the others and it is also very fast. I have replace the foil and blades a few times.&lt;br /&gt;I did like the cleaning system, but it was not the greatest to use. Braun&#x27;s cleaning system seems to be the best, but the shave is not. I wish I could get the performance of the Panasonic with the cleaning system of the Braun.</li>
            <li> I have had this raiser for a few years now. The good news is that this razor gives you an excellent shave if you use it in the shower, but you will still get a good shave if you are using it dry. The docking station is a good place to keep your razor when it&#x27;s not in use and it also helps clean and charge your razor.my only problem and complaint is that the charging station broke after a few years and it would cost as much as a new razor to buy the station from Panasonic. In addition to that the display on the razor only partially works now and it is difficult to tell exactly how much charge is left on the razor and if I need to clean it or replace the blades. One thing to note is that if you do not clean the razor regularly you will have a fine powder from your trimmings all over the counter in your bathroom.</li>
            <li> Best Shaver I have ever owned. (purchased in 2008). The shaver works great, does a very close shave, the trimmer is a nice capability, useful unless you need very fine work done. And the thing is a work of art and craftsmanship with its wood accents.&lt;br /&gt;Hope to continue using it, but after 7 years the cleaner/recharger won&#x27;t &amp;#34;clean&amp;#34; any more, and I can&#x27;t find a replacement (still looking!). That said, you can still find blades, foils and even cleaning cartridges. And you can clean it with soap and water (instructions are included in the manual), but getting it dry (esp in hot humid whether) is a trick. I haven&#x27;t finished looking for a replacement cleaner.</li>
            <li> The clearance websites have been featuring this shaver, and the price was compelling so I gave it a try.  I&#x27;ve been using Norelco for the past 15 years, and before that, I was using a Remington Microscreen.  The remington had something that until recently, the other manufacturers just didn&#x27;t have - horsepower and rpm&#x27;s.  Norelco also has it&#x27;s niche - The lift and cut technology does wonders for a close shave when it works.  For me, I need more than a 2 day growth for the whiskers to be long enough for the lifters to be able to grab hold for a close shave.  So, I&#x27;ve been shaving every 2+ days.  I read the reviews that said the opposite for this panasonic - that it works best when you&#x27;ve shaven the day before.  I couldn&#x27;t agree more.  I&#x27;ve used the Panasonic both wet and dry, and I got a close irritation free shave.  I tried a panasonic wet/dry back in the 80&#x27;s, but it just didn&#x27;t have the power that the Remington did.  The old panasonic&#x27;s would give a close shave, but would miss a lot of the growth.  I&#x27;m glad to see that the extra horsepower/rpm&#x27;s, 3 blades and improved screen - have made this shaver so much better than the old panasonics.  Norelco will remain my Monday morning shaver, but for Tuesday thru Friday, I can now shave every day using this panasonic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update:  With extended use of other electric shavers - my skin would toughen and get irritated. the thinner hairs would get ingrown and or not get shaven closely because of the texture of the skin.  I would take a week off from shaving and the skin irritation would go away - then my face would be smooth as a baby&#x27;s and I&#x27;d be able to get an incredibly close shave.  With this panasonic, my skin is not tough or irritated even with daily use.  I don&#x27;t need to take a week (or any time at all) off from shaving anymore to let my skin heal.</li>
            <li> My husband loves this razor.  His face is very sensitive and he hasnt had any razor burns.  Bought this in 2013.</li>
            <li> I like this shaver in nearly every way, easy to clean, cuts well, good battery performance, etc. But beware, it is quite loud. I&#x27;m going to look for a replacement that doesn&#x27;t sound like a prop plane.</li>
            <li> this is really a great shaver. wet or dry. the linear head promotes a nice shaving movement.I&#x27;ve got a pretty thick beard and this is the best I&#x27;ve owned.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it for a month now, and while its much more convenient than a blade shaver, its clearly not as close.  Even when I use wet with a shaving foam, there&#x27;s still not enough close shave to get against the grain shaving done.  I&#x27;d still recommend to people wanting an electric razor.  Also definitely the best electric razor i&#x27;ve used thus far whether norelco or braun shavers.</li>
            <li> hadn&#x27;t purchased a new razor in years and this was a fantastic choice!  I am very pleased with the product and am extremely happy.</li>
            <li> I have never liked electric razors because of a bad experience I had with one many years ago (which was a high end Remington at the time). Now at the age of 59 I&#x27;ve been diagnosed with neck cancer and have to undergo radiation treatments for six weeks. The people at the cancer center told me I had to use a electric razor because I couldn&#x27;t afford nicks and cuts on my skin. The problem I had with that razor so many years ago was it caused a severe rash on my neck.  Well, with haveing no other alternative I did some research on the net and found the Panasonic Nano Arc Foil Shaver. I have been shaving with it for three weeks now without any problems. My radiation treatments begin tomorrow, I feel very confident and pleased with my purchase. Thanks Panasonic... you saved my skin on this one.  Bob Napiorski, Jersey City NJ  Update; It has been four months since I wrote my review of the razor, the radiation treatments ended two months ago. The treatments took quite a toll on my skin but the razor was not a problem, I shaved with it every day throughout the treatments and I still use it every morning. This is an outstanding product.  Bob N.</li>
            <li> Beautiful product.  Takes about two weeks to adjust to perfection.  My face is now oh so oh so smooth and fresh!</li>
            <li> This is my 3rd high end Panasonic shaver, and I will use nothing else.   I use it to shave my face and head, this is the smoothest shaver you will ever use. The cleaning unit of the last Panasonic I had didn&#x27;t last a year, the shaver itself lasted several years. I was a little leery of another unit with a cleaner, but at under $80 it seemed an easy choice.  Panasonic is making these units lighter, and more ergonomic, this model is weights less than half of my original Panasonic of 10+ years ago.</li>
            <li> it is a very good product. i enjoy using the vortex panasonic shaver. it does what it is advertised to do . it gives you a real close shave. i reccomend it highly. Randy</li>
            <li> My husband and I have been married 25 years and have been kinda looking for an electric razor.  I looked at the reviews and this one had the best review for the price.  He likes it and is much faster than shaving with cream and razor.</li>
            <li> Received promptly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Proved a nice, clean shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Can use with a wet or dry face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I use a hot rag to soften and raise the whiskers, this shaver provides a really smooth shave that lasts.</li>
            <li> Use at least for one month to get used to it.  Note: The sound is a bit too loud, so not everyone will like it.  Do not neglect this; you need to clean it often.  I am amazed at how I don&#x27;t cut myself any more. Love this product!</li>
            <li> Best razor I ever had.  This replaced a 4 year old Remington and the difference is night and day.  The only complaint is the grip is a little splippery as the plastic is smooth.  My old Remington has a rubber body.</li>
            <li> At a 1/3 to 1/2 the price of my other shaver, it dose a much better job, wow.  I bought this for my travel bag and it ended up in the bathroom. My high priced Braun ended up in the travel bag.  Every day it seems to shave closer and faster, I guess it is leveling out the rough spots.</li>
            <li> VERY GOOD SHAVER, WORTH THE MONEY. VERY CLOSE SHAVE AND EASY TO USE.  LOVE THE CLEANER, WOULD DEFENETLY RECOMEND TO ANYONE</li>
            <li> I purchased this exact shaver about 3 years ago and it is still working perfectly.  I have actually never used the cleaning system, I just run it under water and let it dry.  I have also never replaced the blade and it is still as sharp as ever.  Great QUALITY!  Oh ya and the charge still lasts a long time!</li>
            <li> This razor works well, holds a charge very well (I can easily get 5-6 shaves from it which saves you from packing any charging cables for short trips).  As with all electric razors, it won&#x27;t shave as close as a blade, at least not on my skin.  I shave with the electric, usually dry, and then wet shave with the blade in the shower, great combo.</li>
            <li> Decent but slow compared to the 4 cutter version.  Would not buy again.</li>
            <li> Only got 2 uses out of it then it broke.</li>
            <li> My sister recommended this razor to me over a year ago.  I got mine and then ordered three more for my adult daughters.  They were all thrilled and will really enjoy them.  I may be ordering more for my sons-in-law.  They were looking longingly at them Christmas Day!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve owned Panasonic Shavers previously and have always liked them. This shaver, by far, surpasses any shaver, of any brand that I have ever used.  It is lightweight, can be used wet or dry, shaves very closely, holds a charge for nearly 2 weeks!, has an automatic cleaning base, and is beautiful! I know two other guys who also got this shaver, and they feel exactly as I do... *****!</li>
            <li> i am useing panasonic shaver for last 4 years this is my 2nd one, this one is a much better perfomance and a new technologi saver this is the best in a market, also Amazon has the best price.</li>
            <li> ORDERED PRODUCT LAST MONTH IN OCTOBER TO REPLACE OLDER PANASONIC LINEAR SHAVER. GOT THE UNIT 2 DAYS EARLIER THAN POSTED DELIVERY DATE. CHARGED UNIT USING CORD WITHOUT CHARGING/CLEANING BASE, GREAT OPTION. SHAVES FACE AND HEAD SUPER CLOSE WITHOUT ANY SKIN IRRITATION. VERY HAPPY WITH PURCHASE AND RECOMMEND THIS PRODUCT TO ALL THAT WILL LISTEN.</li>
            <li> Excellent - use it for those &#x27;in-between&#x27; days when I really don&#x27;t want to break out the double-edge or if I just want a nice quick shave.  No irritation or pulling at the beard hairs, easy to clean and adjust, nice trimmer for ears and beard around the mouth.  --Rich</li>
            <li> I purchased this electric shaver since I can no longer use a straight edge shaver.  I have developed psoriasis in the past several months and bled like crazy when using the straight edge on my legs and \\&quot;YES\\&quot; I am a woman.  I didn&#x27;t want a Woman&#x27;s electric shaver since they \\&quot;PULL\\&quot; the hairs out when shaving ...(OUCH).  I did alot of research on ALL electric shavers and almost was convinced to purchase a Braun; however; realized they were too high maintenance and costly to maintain. I like the fact you can manually clean the Panasonic or use the solution provided. I&#x27;ll tell ya the Panasonic gives a pretty darn smooth shave; not as good as a straight edge but almost. I&#x27;m very happy with this purchase and would highly recommend to All.</li>
            <li> Very close shave, didn&#x27;t use the cleaning features yet. I just open it and rinse under the tap.  It was an awesome deal with the $30 discount, glad I grabbed it when it was available.</li>
            <li> Sorry to be repetitive, but I purchased the Panasonic ES8109 a year ago and this is my review. Since then, I purchased the ES8228 and is the same razor with a different outer foil and travel case (scroll to the end for more information). I am still very happy with Panasonic shavers. Since the wife sent mine through the washing machine (dont ask) I missed it until the new one showed up. My only disappointment was living in a city of 80,000 I could not find a replacement foil and blade in town. I had to order it on the internet. My suggestion is to buy a replacement foil and blade as backup should one break or fail...unless you are willing to go under the razor for a few days while you order one or track one down. But I digress, here is the review...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My 3+ year old Braun 7526 Syncro with Clean and Charge finally had enough. Prior to that was a blade preceeded by a Norelco.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lets jump back a few years and share my history...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have always broken out with razor burn and ingrown hairs on my neck for as long as I started growing facial hair. Cheap razors were terrable so I asked for an electric. The Norelco made it easier to shave but still had issues. Several months later it was back to the blade. Someone suggested a foil shaver and, after much hesitation, I purchased the Braun. Wow! What an improvement over the blade and rotory shavers. I have been happily using it daily for almost 4 years. Dare I say...almost enjoy shaving. Razor burn is almost non-existant unless you grind away in an area for too long a time (come back to the area 15 minutes later helps), ingrown hairs are 98% cured, and it shaved closer than a rotory with only a few passes. A win/win combination. The cleaning system is great except when away from home and you have to do it manually.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That brings us to the present...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Braun has hit the snooze button and no longer wants to get up in the morning with me. After many hours of research I thought I wanted another Braun...their top of the line Pulsonic model. Almost bought one based on a few blogs on the web. I did cringe at the asking price of $250 - $300 suggested retail. I have always enjoyed Panasonic products and noticed this razor at half the asking price of the Braun. It seemed too good to be true, but Panasonic products have never let me down yet. I gave it a try, knowing I could try it for 30 days and send it back if unhappy. I had nothing to lose.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have had it a week now and nobody is taking this shaver away from me. I dare you to compare the 2 razors back to back and honestly say the Braun is worth double the price. They are, in my opinion, in the same class. The Panasonic is quieter both shaving and in the cleaning stand. It shaves closer and cuts more hair on the first pass, eliminating a 3rd or 4th pass. The Braun would sometimes knick my adams apple or lip and I have tried to get the Panasonic to do it but it wont (call me stupid). Since I dont have to shave 3, 4, or 5 times on my neck, the razor burn is gone. The ingrown hairs are 99% gone (I have had only one this past week). The cleaning gets the blades cleaner and they smell soapy clean and not chemically clean. The best part, a bonus if you will, is the Panasonic is water-resistant. Not only can you rinse the head off underwater at home or on the road, but you can shave in the shower or use shaving creams or lotions (gels are not recommended). The top of the line Braun can be rinsed under water but not used \\&quot;wet\\&quot; or with creams or lotions. The only drawback I could find is the travel bag they supply. I was hoping they could have supplied a better case to hold the cord and shaver for extended trips. Not a big deal though, on a big trip...I will have a big suitcase so I&#x27;m sure there will be plenty of room in there for a cord.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In conclusion, a great shaver with all the current technology and features offered by the competition at a reasonable asking price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;EDIT -MONDAY JANUARY 21, 2008&lt;br /&gt;Since purchasing, this razor still continues to be my favorite. I have now started using it \\&quot;wet\\&quot; by warming my face with hot water, then applying a Neutragena shaving cream. The results are better. It shaves more hairs on the first pass, the cream eliminates any friction, and gives me the closest shave yet with an electric (some areas of the face feel like I shaved with a blade).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;EDIT - SUNDAY JANUARY 18, 2009&lt;br /&gt;Still loving it and using it everyday. However, the wife ran it through the front load washer tonight. It is now very clean. Still runs but needs a new set of blades. For added measure and the price of new blades and foil, I found a really good deal on the ES8228S shaver. The only difference between the two is the ES8228S adds a zippered vinyl travel case (vs cloth bag with draw strings) and the head has independent floating foil (each of the 3 foils is on their own suspension to track the curves of the face better).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;EDIT - TUESDAY APRIL 12, 2011&lt;br /&gt;Same as last edit. Still going strong. The first charging/cleaning stand finally started to leak from my original shaver that went thru the wash. 3 years on the original base, not bad. Now using the base that came with this razor....same unit, different color.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;EDIT - July 14, 2012&lt;br /&gt;Still using it. It just keeps going, still love it and have recommended it to many others.MONDAY JANUARY 21, 2008&lt;br /&gt;Since purchasing, this razor still continues to be my favorite.

            <li> I have had the ES8228S for about 4 months now and have to give it high marks for its performance although I have one serious misgiving about the device&#x27;s charging system. I have been using electric shavers for nearly four decades - starting with Norelcos, moving on to Braun, and recently a couple of Remingtons. Each of these shavers lasted a few years and then made its way to the landfill for various reasons. I have been quite dismayed over the past few years to see the adoption of all kinds of exorbitantly expensive features on better quality shavers. This one seems to fall nicely in the middle ground of high quality and good shave without extra gimmicks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I chose the Panasonic over many  others and have to say it shaves the best of any shaver I&#x27;ve owned. I have a fairly light beard, but have been plagued by other shavers missing neck hairs. Once they are missed, the hairs grow longer and can&#x27;t be shaved off with the regular foil and blade. The Panasonic shaves the closest I&#x27;ve experienced and almost never misses the neck hairs. I rate the shave quality as excellent. As a professional who sits with clients face to face all day, shave quality is the most important element I look for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Impressions: The design is comfortable in the hand, it&#x27;s well made, and fairly trim and compact. I probably will never use the liquid cleaning system because the supplies are expensive and I don&#x27;t believe it is necessary in any way. I&#x27;ve also not used it wet. As a dry shaver, it works well enough for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The sound of the shaver is different from others I&#x27;ve used - the high speed makes a whining sound as opposed to the familiar buzz. It&#x27;s not louder and I have gotten used to it, but would say it is slightly harsher on the ears first thing in the morning. For travel and bathroom drawer storage, the cord is less user-friendly than the Braun&#x27;s coiled, non-transformer type. It has a fairly large transformer and is stiff and long, making it harder to wind up and bring. So far I count on the battery to make it through trips. I don&#x27;t believe there is a way to lock the on/off switch for travel so it could turn on in the luggage if bumped wrong.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My main concern is a feature of the battery and charging system that I couldn&#x27;t know about before I bought the unit. The shaver doesn&#x27;t work with the cord plugged in. Most of my previous shavers have failed in 2-3 years due to batteries losing their storage capacity. I have been able to extend the life for a couple more years by using them with the cord attached. Can&#x27;t do that with this unit. I suspect when the battery gets to the point of needing a full charge to get through one shave, it will be useless. With the unbelievably high cost of replacement batteries and blades, expensive shavers like these are pretty much disposable items after way too short a life span.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall this is a very good product, well designed and executed. I&#x27;ll be looking for Panasonic shavers in the future.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE:  March, 2013  The battery still holds a full charge and I have no hesitation going on a 7 - 10 day trip without the charging cord. It is performing very well after about four years and I haven&#x27;t needed to change the blades or screen.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my husbands gift. He saw it on amazons deals and I the price was fantastic. I couldn&#x27;t pass it up and when knowing he wanted it that was perfect.</li>
            <li> Like other reviewers, I&#x27;ve been using Braun shavers for years, generally the 7526, 7570, and higher models. When a motor became loud and inefficient, sometimes I&#x27;d send it to a repair shop for $70 or more, but this time I applied that sum toward a Panasonic ES8228S, and I&#x27;m glad I did. I used it for the first time this morning, dry, and it does indeed shave closer and faster than my Brauns. Unlike the Brauns, the Panasonic shaver&#x27;s clipper folds down and out of the way during normal shaving. Following Amazon reviewer Charles Enfield&#x27;s advice on this page, I ordered a bottle of Billy Jealousy Hydroplane shaving cream for the silicone smoothing, and I expect my future shaves with this Panasonic to produce yet better results. One carryover from my Braun experience: instead of filling the cleaning receptacle with tap water per the user instructions, I used diluted ethyl rubbing alcohol for the disinfectant effect in order to prevent any contact dermatitis, which I got many years ago from buildup on a Remington shaver that I only brushed and oiled. I notice that another reviewer claims that the alcohol solution in his Braun Clean &#x27;n Charge stand caused a fire. I&#x27;ve never had that experience, but unplugging after cleaning and charging is probably a good idea, as the Panasonic indicator stays at 100% for at least 48 hours. And the Panasonic stand doesn&#x27;t have a locking arm, which on the Braun often stops locking, necessitating replacement. I note that Amazon&#x27;s price for the Panasonic ES8228S has risen about $50 in the past month. A popular auction site often features substantially lower offers. I suspect some are buying this item there and selling it here.&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:B000A5CPJ4 Billy Jealousy Hydroplane Shave Cream, 8-Ounce Bottle]]&lt;br /&gt;Eight moths later: The price for this item has risen substantially. I&#x27;ve found over this period of time that the unit does not shave closely, even after replacing the blade six months after first using the unit.</li>
