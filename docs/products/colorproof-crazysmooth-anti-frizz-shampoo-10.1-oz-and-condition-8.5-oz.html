            <li>Leaves hair feeling clean, smooth and shiny.</li>

            <li>I&#x27;m pretty sure this is a knock off, not the product advertised.</li>
            <li>This is the first shampoo and conditioner that I will spend this amount of money on since it has made my hair so healthy looking.  </li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re wondering if it&#x27;s worth the price, it is!</li>
            <li>My stylist said to make sure it is rinsed out very thoroughly.</li>
            <li>It leaves my hair full of body with no frizz.</li>
            <li>but my hair is in such good condition using this shampoo.</li>

            <li>You can&#x27;t beat the price and always receive quickly</li>
            <li>CrazySmooth Anti-Frizz Label - my new favorite &amp; go to shampoo &amp; conditioner</li>
            <li>When I do this, I run out the hot water for my household!</li>
            <li>My hair is soft and easy to detangle after using these products.</li>
            <li>It is much more runny and it does not smell the same.</li>
            <li>My hair dresser sells this product for more than double what I paid online.</li>
            <li>Highly concentrated, smells good, doesn&#x27;t weigh hair down and fights those frizzies!</li>
            <li>I have noticed it takes a bit more time to dry</li>
            <li>and my hair feels so soft and is very shiny!!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a huge fan of Color Proof products and was purchasing from a local hair salon.  </li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t notice much an improvement.  </li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t really like the smell and made my hair very greasy.</li>
            <li>I can use about a nickel sized amount of this product to wash my whole head.</li>
            <li>I use both UNITE and this brand, and if I want a &amp;#34;smooth&amp;#34; day - whether it be curly or straight - this is the shampoo / conditioner combo I&#x27;ll turn to.  </li>
            <li>Thanks so much</li>
            <li>It is very economical to use because I only need to use a dime sized dollop.  </li>
            <li>My color looks fabulous long after I get it done</li>
            <li>Presto - new hair care routine!</li>
            <li>After I started using these two products, my hair always turns out softer, and the dryness is significantly  improved; I do  add a high quality styling conditioner before drying and using  a flat iron to straighten the curls.</li>
            <li>love it....same as salon at half the cost</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this shampoo and conditioner.</li>
            <li>I have fine, naturally curly hair which tends to be dry.  </li>
            <li>leaves your hair conditioned and very soft.  </li>
            <li>It smells funny &amp; definitely doesn&#x27;t leave my hair as soft as the product I&#x27;m use to using.</li>
            <li>I should really thank my stylist for turning me on to it, but Amazon wins for pricing hands down.</li>
            <li>I love the Crazy Smooth oil</li>
            <li>Exactly what I expected.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m usually a Volumizing formula girl but for some reason the CrazySmooth was significantly cheaper</li>
            <li>It works decent, just not what I expected.</li>

            <li> Even though I leave it in my hair&#x27;s natural curliness show through without being frizzy unlike with any other shampoo and conditioner I have used.  </li>
            <li> I wash my hair every other day, and I&#x27;m pretty heavy handed.</li>
            <li> My hair has always been a nightmare to deal with (all at once fine - but a lot of it, frizzy, long, curl resistant, dull, limp)</li>
            <li> My hair is: Dry, wavy, coarse, color treated, and bleached.&lt;br /&gt;Pros</li>
            <li> I have very long, coarse very dry hair and usually let it dry naturally.  </li>
            <li> You only need a tiny amount I am told- the small bottles are meant to last for 3+ months.</li>
            <li> and when I go to blow dry my hair, it is still left feeling greasy and weighed down.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m breastfeeding &amp; nervous to actually continue to use b/c of the odd smell.</li>
            <li> I have chin length, medium-weight, THICK THICK THICK hair, so smooth is key for my hair or</li>
            <li> Expensive but worth it because you don&#x27;t need as much as other shampoos.</li>
            <li> This product is not consistent with what I have purchased in salons.</li>
            <li> It seems as if something other then the advertised product was put into this bottle.</li>
            <li> Lasts forever because it only requires a small amount per wash</li>
            <li> Will never buy any other brand, ever.</li>
            <li> Only a small amount of shampoo is required - even with hard water.  </li>
            <li> It leaves my hair dull &amp; frizzy.</li>
            <li> I have very thin hair</li>
            <li> Now it just feels like it is weighing down my hair terribly.</li>
            <li> Really disappointing.</li>
            <li> but nd I hate that I am required to write a set amount of words.</li>
            <li> but this the shampoo and conditioner are terrible!</li>

            <li> I used to like this system a great deal. Now it just feels like it is weighing down my hair terribly. My stylist said to make sure it is rinsed out very thoroughly. When I do this, I run out the hot water for my household! It never seems rinsed out enough and when I go to blow dry my hair, it is still left feeling greasy and weighed down. You only need a tiny amount I am told- the small bottles are meant to last for 3+ months. But I have yet to find that perfect balance of my hair feeling clean, yet not greasy.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this shampoo and conditioner. Best duo to tame frizz during those humid days. Highly concentrated, smells good, doesn&#x27;t weigh hair down and fights those frizzies!</li>
            <li> Love these productsâ™¡ I paid twice this price at the spa.</li>
            <li> Great shampoo and conditioner.</li>
            <li> Keeps your hair so smooth smells great gotta love this one!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pretty sure this is a knock off, not the product advertised. It smells funny &amp; definitely doesn&#x27;t leave my hair as soft as the product I&#x27;m use to using. I&#x27;m breastfeeding &amp; nervous to actually continue to use b/c of the odd smell. Definitely don&#x27;t recommend this purchase.</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t beat the price and always receive quickly</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think this is the same as salon product. It doesn&#x27;t smell or perform the same</li>
            <li> Love this set ! Makes your hair more manageable !!!</li>
            <li> I love the products.  It leaves my hair full of body with no frizz.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite shampoo and conditioner!!!</li>
            <li> leaves your hair conditioned and very soft.  I have noticed it takes a bit more time to dry but my hair is in such good condition using this shampoo.</li>
            <li> Love this! Service was fast and excellent!!</li>
            <li> This set is amazing.  I use this set with the treatment oil and plushlocks.  The scents all work together amazingly well and leave my hair shiny, smooth and smelling great!  I have chin length, medium-weight, THICK THICK THICK hair, so smooth is key for my hair or else it turns into a massive puffball.  No worries with this duo!!  Presto - new hair care routine!</li>
            <li> The best stuff and price ever for this product !!</li>
            <li> Best shampoo &amp; conditioner on the market for the ladies in my life : )</li>
            <li> This is the first shampoo and conditioner that I will spend this amount of money on since it has made my hair so healthy looking.  Not to mention that it smells and feels great.  Love these products!</li>
            <li> Wonderful shampoo and conditioner for color treated hair. No sulfates and a great fragrance. Leaves hair feeling clean, smooth and shiny.</li>
            <li> It leaves my hair dull &amp; frizzy. Really disappointing. I love the Crazy Smooth oil but this the shampoo and conditioner are terrible!</li>
            <li> I love these products. Super good for my hair but nd I hate that I am required to write a set amount of words. That is why I don&#x27;t want to rate things,</li>
            <li> My hair is: Dry, wavy, coarse, color treated, and bleached.&lt;br /&gt;Pros: Did not strip my color.&lt;br /&gt;Con:  strong scented, made my hair dryer, made my hair poufy, in the shower lost more hair than usual.&lt;br /&gt;Do not recommend for someone with my type of hair. Might work better for oily hair.&lt;br /&gt;Hope this helps :-)</li>
            <li> Yes I love it!! Thank you, Kristy M</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know what kind of magic they put in their products, but ColorProof is always spot-on. I&#x27;m usually a Volumizing formula girl but for some reason the CrazySmooth was significantly cheaper so I decided to give it a try. I&#x27;m glad I did - this stuff is great. My hair has always been a nightmare to deal with (all at once fine - but a lot of it, frizzy, long, curl resistant, dull, limp) but after using this (plus the conditioner, detangler, and serum) I&#x27;m now &amp;#34;the girl with good hair&amp;#34;. I should really thank my stylist for turning me on to it, but Amazon wins for pricing hands down. If you&#x27;re wondering if it&#x27;s worth the price, it is! It lasts FOREVER, your hair will never look better, and as a bonus it smells incredible.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I expected. Makes my hair so silky and helps keep color.</li>
