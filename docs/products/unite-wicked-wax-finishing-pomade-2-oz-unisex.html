    <ol>
            <li>it&#x27;s the best .</li>

            <li>I love this product!  </li>
            <li>This product is amazing.  </li>
            <li>I realized that if probably was defective (had &#x27;crystal-like&#x27; particles in it that kind of showed on hair like a piece of lint)</li>
            <li>but I still liked it</li>
            <li>I was grateful to find it still available on line!  </li>
            <li>I have not been able to find what that means, not even on the company website, but the product I ordered does  not work.  </li>
            <li>I love this wax</li>
            <li>so I ordered more on line (no &#x27;crystals&#x27;)</li>
            <li>so I was pleased to get it</li>
            <li>Fantastic product-</li>
            <li>I went tp many salons in my area where I live until I found it on Amazon!  </li>
            <li>It is sad a wonderful product like this will no longer be available!</li>
            <li>and I got it quickly.  </li>

            <li>Love this wax; it controls your hairstyle all day without being sticky or stiff and it washes out easily.  </li>
            <li>Unite asked me to furnish the names of these Amazon vendors because they are going to take legal action against them.  </li>
            <li>The first few containers that I got from my salon did not have this problem--only started when buying from Amazon.  </li>

            <li> I took it to my beautician and she says it looks like it is nothing but the wax minus the gritty ingredients.  </li>
            <li> I would advise others who like the product to be careful about buying it online because the advertisement for it does not say it is Brilliantine, it uses the same wording the locals product does.</li>

            <li> You have to be careful on the amount you use can make your hair greasy.</li>
            <li> So I have been wondering about this grainy stuff that other reviewers have noticed in the product as well.  </li>
            <li> Only complaint is that it doesn&#x27;t &#x27;blend&#x27; into my hair</li>

            <li> I love this product!  I am so disappointed that it is going to be discontinued!  I went tp many salons in my area where I live until I found it on Amazon!  I was grateful to find it still available on line!  It is sad a wonderful product like this will no longer be available!</li>
            <li> I use this product daily and had difficulty finding it as my salon stopped carrying it. Found it on Amazon without a problem.</li>
            <li> My purchases of this product have been from my local hair salon.  When they were out I ordered it online.  The outside of the jar had a word added that was not on the jars I purchased locally ~ it was Brilliantine.  I have not been able to find what that means, not even on the company website, but the product I ordered does  not work.  I took it to my beautician and she says it looks like it is nothing but the wax minus the gritty ingredients.  She would not use it, but found something else.  I paid $30.00 for 2 jars and I had to throw both of them away.  I would advise others who like the product to be careful about buying it online because the advertisement for it does not say it is Brilliantine, it uses the same wording the locals product does.</li>
            <li> Not what I had hoped.  The formulation has changed and the grittiness that used to be present and help hold the hair in place is gone!</li>
            <li> I have used this product for a number of years,  It gives me the look I want without looking greasy or wet.</li>
            <li> This product is amazing.  I have not put a curling iron to my hair since i began using Unite Wicked wax!</li>
            <li> So I have been wondering about this grainy stuff that other reviewers have noticed in the product as well.  The first few containers that I got from my salon did not have this problem--only started when buying from Amazon.  I recently contacted the company, Unite about this and they told me that they do not sell to anyone that is not a salon--you can only get this product through their website or an authorized salon.  That explains the difference in texture and performance--a third world counterfiet!  Unite asked me to furnish the names of these Amazon vendors because they are going to take legal action against them.  Rightfully so.</li>
            <li> I love this wax it&#x27;s the best .</li>
            <li> Excellent; came as promised; get price too.</li>
            <li> Lasts forever. Smells great. Only complaint is that it doesn&#x27;t &#x27;blend&#x27; into my hair that well and tends to leave little white specks everywhere (which isn&#x27;t cool since I have black hair... looks like dandruff)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for a year and it was great. However, the last two I purchased have been flaky and look like dandruff.</li>
            <li> The first time I tried this a stylist was selling it for $5. I realized that if probably was defective (had &#x27;crystal-like&#x27; particles in it that kind of showed on hair like a piece of lint) but I still liked it so I ordered more on line (no &#x27;crystals&#x27;) when I ran out and paid 4 times the price! I&#x27;ll probably continue to use it becuase it&#x27;s hard to find a product that doesn&#x27;t weigh down fine hair and a little of this goes a long way.</li>
            <li> Fantastic product- I&#x27;m sad to see the line end.</li>
            <li> You have to be careful on the amount you use can make your hair greasy.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think they make this anymore so I was pleased to get it and I got it quickly.  Very happy all around.</li>
            <li> Love this wax; it controls your hairstyle all day without being sticky or stiff and it washes out easily.  This wax rules.</li>
            <li> Leaves clumps of grainy white stuff in my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve purchased this from salons; no clumping, no graininess.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I believe this is a counterfeit product. Pretty sure that the REAL version of this product is only available in salons.</li>
