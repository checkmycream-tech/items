            <li> This bottle is actually a 2 oz bottle instead of the usual 1 oz you get from other companies.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also comes in a dark, glass&lt;br /&gt;bottle to preserve it&#x27;s freshness with a glass dropper for easy&lt;br /&gt;measuring and application.  </li>

            <li> Although the changes are subtle, they are there.</li>
            <li> I want to start taking care of my skin because going under the needle or having a skin peel or any of that other painful sounding stuff that people do to look like they are 20 again</li>
            <li> so I was a little bit scared about having a bad reaction to this product since it&#x27;s a clinical strength retinol serum</li>
            <li> She indicated that the prescription was very expensive and probably wouldn&#x27;t work, but I tried it anyway.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s not too bad</li>
            <li> Smells neutral and comes in a&lt;br /&gt;hylauronic acid base to transport the vitamin A where it is needed&lt;br /&gt;for</li>

            <li> I&#x27;m 41 years old and after using this eye serum I swear people say I look like I&#x27;m in my 20&#x27;s. No more harsh wrinkles! Leaves my skin smooth and soft!</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product. It is the least expensive product I have used with amazing results.  I have been using it for a few days and I already have seen results.  I have uneven skin tone and lots of dark spots on my face and hands.  The dark spots have almost diminished and my complection looks 100% better  I&#x27;am also using the 3-in-1 treatment and wrinkle treatment from puristica which I alternate for different aging problems I have.  I love the fact that It&#x27;s  all-Vegan 72% Organic non-GMO and does not contain alcohol, parabens, sulfates, mineral oils or any cheap &amp;#34;filler&amp;#34; ingredients.  It has a slight fragrance and absorbs very quickly.  It is not greasy or oily either.  I will continue to use this product.   I received this product at a discount for my honest review.</li>

I really didn&#x27;t think about using a retinol serum until reading the product information about this product. I&#x27;ve been using this product for two weeks and I have already noticed some results. The wrinkles around my eyes are becoming less noticeable, and the dark circles under my eyes are lightening a bit. Although the changes are subtle, they are there. The serum goes on smoothly and I haven&#x27;t felt the burning sensation that I felt with the prescription medicine. I apply this serum at night after cleansing my face, then I follow with a moisturizer. This product comes with a 100% money back guarantee and you get a double sized bottle. I would recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this Puristica Dark Spots Corrector for a little over a week now and can really see a difference. I have a few dark spots on my face next to my eye. They are definitely lightening and diminishing in size. This is very gentle and I didn&#x27;t experience any irritation or redness. It didn&#x27;t dry out my skin either. I look forward to seeing the results that I get with continued use. This is a great product which I would and have recommended to anyone that loves the sun but hates the dark spots that it causes. I received this product in exchange for my honest review.</li>
            <li> Puristica is wonderful.  I use this serum as a morning moisturizer instead of the regular creams or lotions because of the problem of absorption.  I put this on right after cleansing my face and it dries into my skin immediately without any residue.  My face and throat area are smooth and silky and I then apply my primer which goes on easy and also gets absorb into my skin.  Before when I used the cream or lotion, my primer did not set well on my skin because of the residue of the moisturizer.  My foundation goes on smoothly and looks great all day long.  I have gotten so many compliments on my skin since I&#x27;ve been using this serum.  I&#x27;m 64 years old.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my under eye circles, and I&#x27;ve seen an overall improvement in the last several weeks of usage.</li>
            <li> Great product, been using for couple of weeks at night, already seeing dark spots going away!</li>
            <li> Just purcased.Already like its texture.Thick small drops go a long way.</li>
            <li> Great dose of vitamin A at the right concentration.&lt;br /&gt;Been using this product for a little over a month now&lt;br /&gt;and the results are impressive.  Instantly retexturizes your skin&lt;br /&gt;without the irritation that comes with the use of retinols.&lt;br /&gt;Has greatly diminished my sun spots and evened out my&lt;br /&gt;skin, Bringing back a glow.  It&#x27;s also comes in a dark, glass&lt;br /&gt;bottle to preserve it&#x27;s freshness with a glass dropper for easy&lt;br /&gt;measuring and application.  Smells neutral and comes in a&lt;br /&gt;hylauronic acid base to transport the vitamin A where it is needed&lt;br /&gt;for proper skin repair and intense moisturization.  The other ingredients&lt;br /&gt;in this product are pure and wholesome as in no water or artificial&lt;br /&gt;preservatives added.  Which also contributes to the products quality&lt;br /&gt;and effectiveness.  This is a can&#x27;t live without product for me&lt;br /&gt;and highly recommended for all skin types and conditions.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin. I started with using it everyother day. Still made my face red and kinda burned. So i tried every three days. Less and less red but I do not see any results.</li>
            <li> This product has been really effective at removing the dark spots on my face.  I was close to having the removed by laser but really preferred a more natural alternative.  This one met all the criteria - vegan, GMO free - and even came at a great price.  Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I love this Retinol serum. As far as I know, this is the highest dose of retinol you can get over the counter. I use it every morning before my moisturizer. It absorbs quickly into my skin and does not leave any residue. There is no unpleasant smell either. I bought the larger size with a discount and I have had no problems with it so far. My face is starting to look and feel smoother already and I am having less acne. I look forward to more results with continued and consistent use.</li>
            <li> I have somewhat sensitive skin so I was a little bit scared about having a bad reaction to this product since it&#x27;s a clinical strength retinol serum but I really wanted to give it a try since clinical strength products usually give you the best results. I gave it a try and I use this product daily I apply it on my face and neck but my main problem areas are the dark areas around my mouth and eyes and under eye circles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This serum is very gentle on my skin and my skin absorbs it super fast. My skin looks smoother and so much brighter and it feels firmer and really soft after I apply the serum, the only thing I don&#x27;t like about this product is the smell it has a weird smell but it&#x27;s not too bad, also my dropper doesn&#x27;t work properly so I have to pour the serum on my palm and then apply it and sometimes too much serum comes out  which I hate but I just apply on my chest or somewhere else on my body. I can&#x27;t wait to see the final results!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**I received this product at a discounted price in exchange for my honest opinion.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for the past two weeks and can already see the difference.  I do have a dark spot underneath my eye and it is not completely gone just yet but it has lightened up quite a bit that my daughter noticed.  My face feels smoother and healthier.  Works great for the price.</li>
            <li> This product does seem to help with the fine lines.  I would definitely recommend it.  The size of the bottle, and strength of the retinol are a huge value!  It&#x27;s definitely worth trying!</li>
            <li> I like this stuff.  It is relatively affordable compared to similar products  I have noticed after about a month of using it my pores seem smaller and my skin tone is more even.  It actually had another benefit for me, I&#x27;m a guy BTW and I tend to get severe irritation from shaving my face and neck.  I had actually developed a rather stubborn irritation on my next that caused the skin in a small area to swell up and down and to crack.  It was very annoying and lasted for 2 months.  After I started using this it actually has gone away and the problem seems to be subsiding.  It does take time to work so I suggest getting the big 2oz bottle to save money.  Of course Hyaluronic acid can help plump and fill in skin and finding a vegan source is always a plus, most HA is derived from rooster comb. The only fault I found with it is that the directions or label do not indicate to avoid sunlight or UV exposure while using this.  Just FYI retinol can have great benefits for aging skin but exposure to direct sunlight or UV lights when it is fresh on your skin can actually cause damage to cells.  So use a sunscreen or use it at night.</li>
            <li> One thing I desire most in my food, drinks, supplements and body products is that they are organically derived.  Our body responds to and absorbs natural ingredients much more effectively than chemicals.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This bottle had a very generous portion of the retinol serum—2 ounces.  All the other serums I’ve tried are 1 ounce.  My chief goals in using the serum are to reduce fine lines and wrinkles, and to remove age spots on my hands and face.  I realize that there are no one day miracles, but I’m happy to say that the fine lines around my eye are less noticeable.  If I follow directions and rub the serum in gently where it’s needed the most, I see a plumping of my skin—under my eyes and on my hands.  If used routinely, I’m hoping this product does stimulate the production of collagen and elastin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I experienced no reaction to using this serum, and pairing it with a high quality moisturizer leaves my skin feeling hydrated and looking its best for the day.</li>
            <li> This helps with my fine lines and stretch marks. It is known as the best anti-aging serum to stimulate collagen and elastin.  This bottle is actually a 2 oz bottle instead of the usual 1 oz you get from other companies.  It is double the size without double the price.  I don&#x27;t have any dark circles, age spots or wrinkles yet but I have read where this serum works great to turn back the hands of time. for them too.  I want to start taking care of my skin because going under the needle or having a skin peel or any of that other painful sounding stuff that people do to look like they are 20 again is not in the cards for me.  Adding this to my skin care regimen is the way I choose to take care of myself.  *received for testing and review.</li>
