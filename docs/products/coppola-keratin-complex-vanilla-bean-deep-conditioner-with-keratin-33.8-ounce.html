            <li> I have very curly long hair</li>

            <li> My hair is now back to being long, soft and shiny.</li>
            <li> I use this near the end of my keratin treatments (when I am about due for another) it always extends my time by just a bit.  </li>
            <li> and it was a complete waste of money.  </li>
            <li> Needless to say, it&#x27;s super dry too.  </li>
            <li> It tends to be dry alot due to chemicals.</li>
            <li> I assumed this was like other deep conditioners where you just leave it in for a few minutes and then rinse it out.  </li>
            <li> My hairdresser recommended taking a little bottle of this to the beach; wet your hair and comb through a small amount of the conditioner before going in the sea and then rinse off when you get out - the trickle from the beach shower was enough to rinse off and then re-coat with a little conditioner.  </li>
            <li> So slight worry sets in when you&#x27;re off to the beach and planning to swim in the sea</li>
            <li> Unfortunately I cannot say the same for subsequent times</li>
            <li> But I HATE the way the deep conditioner makes my hair feel</li>
            <li> Not impressed.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m disappointed in this product.  </li>
            <li> I have nasty frizzy, curly hair that I color.  </li>

            <li> Love this conditioner...makes hair soft and prolongs keratin treatments...</li>
            <li> This conditioner leaves hair soft and shiny.  However, pump did not work so had to use pump from old bottle.</li>
            <li> It does condition your hair and keeps it from spoiling the cost and work that went into getting a keratin treatment, but the smell is not that nice and it&#x27;s kind of thin...it could do more to moisturize your hair from all of the processing.  I&#x27;ve found better, but to each his/her own!</li>
            <li> Smells wonderful, makes my fine 3b,c hair silky soft and smelling good, love it love it.</li>
            <li> You paid a lot of money to have your hair keratin treated and you want to make it last, right?!  So slight worry sets in when you&#x27;re off to the beach and planning to swim in the sea - waaah!  My hairdresser recommended taking a little bottle of this to the beach; wet your hair and comb through a small amount of the conditioner before going in the sea and then rinse off when you get out - the trickle from the beach shower was enough to rinse off and then re-coat with a little conditioner.  TaDa!!  It works!  I have the frizziest hair ever and this technique worked beautifully.  I thoroughly recommend.</li>
            <li> I really like this product. It works very well for my curly yet baby fine hair. It tends to be dry alot due to chemicals. But this product is what im looking for.</li>
            <li> After using it, my hair becomes more healthy and shiny! totally recommend it</li>
            <li> This is my favorite conditioner, hands down.  I have nasty frizzy, curly hair that I color.  Needless to say, it&#x27;s super dry too.  All the Coppola Keratin products are great.  My hair is more manageable now that I found Coppola...it&#x27;s not perfect, but better than the disaster it used to be.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m disappointed in this product.  The description says deep conditioner/deep conditioning treatment.  I wanted a daily use deep conditioner.  I assumed this was like other deep conditioners where you just leave it in for a few minutes and then rinse it out.  The instructions say to leave on for 20 minutes and put hair in shower cap...and also says you can sit under a hairdryer.  This is more for a salon, not home use to me.  I don&#x27;t have time to let it sit for 20 minutes every morning before work!  I wish that the description of the product mentioned this.  Now it&#x27;s kind of a waste to me as I need to now get a new conditioner.....</li>
            <li> Very good for my hair!</li>
            <li> Really love this conditioner. Smells great and adds much needed moisture to my hair which tends to be dry.</li>
            <li> I have only used it a couple of times so far but it leaves my hair soft and smells amazing!</li>
            <li> Not impressed. Waaay overpriced. This stuff didn&#x27;t do anything to my hair and smells kinda chemical-y. I have very curly long hair and this did nothing for me at all. Now I&#x27;m stuck with this huge bottle of stuff I don&#x27;t even like.</li>
            <li> Amazing Product! Great Seller!!!!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> I love the whole Coppola Keratin line.  My hairdresser suggested another product the last time I was in and it was a complete waste of money.  I will never try another Keratin line again.  This stuff is worth every penny.  It makes my hair look like it did when I was in my 20s (in my fab 40s now).  I would recommend you use the entire line to achieve maximum effect.</li>
            <li> I have been using this brand of shampoo and conditioners since 2010 and I love it.  I use the shampoo, regular conditioner and this deep conditioner.  I use the deep conditioner once a week.  I love how it smells and my hair is so soft and silky and super shiny.  You don&#x27;t need to use a lot for it to work.  And I love having the pump.  When I began using this my hair was very damaged from chemo medications and antibiotics that I had to use long term.  My hair looked like it had been zapped.  I began to get the Coppola Keratin Treatments and began to use the shampoos and conditioners and it did amazing things to my hair.  My hair is now back to being long, soft and shiny.</li>
            <li> Hands down the best conditioner for kinky curly hair. An excellent buy at this price. You&#x27;ll pay triple at stores.</li>
            <li> I use this near the end of my keratin treatments (when I am about due for another) it always extends my time by just a bit.  Love it..</li>
            <li> Love it, smells great, helps keep your Karatin treatment in hair longer. Love how much you get for the money!</li>
            <li> I love this product.  It was introduced to me by my stylist.  It smells very good and leaves my hair soft.</li>
            <li> I have been dying my hair blonde for almost a year now and after every color my ends especially my bangs would look like straw. My stylist used this on my hair and it felt like silk again. So I ordered it and apply it once every 2 weeks for 20 minutes. It works best if you apply the product to wet hair and I use a walmart bag and wrap it up and use my hair dryer as a heat source for best results. I use 1 pump as a daily conditioner. It smells heavenly and my boyfriend loves the vanilla smell. Drives him crazy lol.</li>
            <li> Garbage. I cannot tell the difference it has made to my ethnic hair. First time it seemed very smooth and wonderful. Unfortunately I cannot say the same for subsequent times</li>
            <li> I use this brand shampoo and conditioner and LOVE it! But I HATE the way the deep conditioner makes my hair feel and I feel like it stripped the keratin treatment out. I LOVE the smell tho...the vanilla is really nice. I wish I could love this product!</li>
