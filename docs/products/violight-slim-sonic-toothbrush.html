            <li>Love it!!</li>
            <li>I thought it was a good idea as a traveling toothbrush for a trip</li>
            <li>China makes some good products.  </li>
            <li>This is quite a good toothbrush.</li>
            <li>Love this toothbrush for traveling!  </li>
            <li>Comes in lots of cute colors too!  </li>
            <li>, this slim sonic one is great to use when you want to do a good job at making your teeth really clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I use an electric toothbrush at home, and this size was much more convenient to pack.  </li>
            <li>Much better than a manual or mechanical-action electric toothbrush.</li>
            <li>If you are used to using an electric toothbrush at home, you will love this one for traveling.  </li>
            <li>The smaller brush head is wonderful</li>
            <li>Glad I purchased them.  </li>
            <li>I love my sonic toothbrush and this portable model</li>
            <li>Love it</li>
            <li>My big battery brush is bulky for travel,but you get used to the power brush-so this is perfect!</li>
            <li>think if the brush head was curved like most brush heads it would work even better.</li>
            <li>This is a lovely and practical addition.</li>
            <li>The bristles are very gentle on your gums even on the fast cycle and it does a wonderful job at cleaning your teeth.</li>
            <li>However, if you put a good fresh battery in, it does a pretty nice job.</li>
            <li>Easy to pack for trips.  </li>
            <li>Would be easy to throw in purse for a day trip.</li>
            <li>Wish there were different settings but it works great and does what it is-a toothbrush.</li>
            <li>a big loudmouth LOL.</li>
            <li>I use one cheap battery about every 10 days brushing thoroughly two times a day.</li>
            <li>Perfect size to fit in pocket or small purse.  </li>
            <li>Also the color I got (purple) is a pretty matte metallic violet. :-)</li>
            <li>I just don&#x27;t feel like me teeth get clean</li>
            <li>They are really terrific and do a good job of cleaning.</li>
            <li>It really cleans your teeth, but maybe not as good as a Phillips brand, but its way eat better than a standard brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The battery worked fine but from the first brushing on, it lost bristles.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not constantly transferring my Sonicare back and forth from luggage to medicine cabinet and back--which I sometimes would forget to do and end up without a toothbrush at my destination; this is the perfect solution.</li>
            <li>I keep my toiletry back stocked and ready to fly.</li>
            <li>The batteries haven&#x27;t been replaced yet, and this little thing does a great job considering the price I paid.</li>
            <li>and i thought i&#x27;d just try this for fun.</li>
            <li>this is by far the most I have ever written about a toothbrush.</li>
            <li>I travel a lot for fun and profit.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used other mini-travel sonic toothbrushes, and this is as good as the others.</li>
            <li>While not as powerful as a regular sonic toothbrush, it&#x27;s still better than a non-electric toothbrush</li>
            <li>First of all it fell apart</li>
            <li>I wanted a slim, light, inexpensive sonic toothbrush that I could leave in my toiletry bag for frequent short-term trips that I take so</li>
            <li>Not bad, really, but have realistic expectations.</li>
            <li>Powerful enough to make you feel really clean without harm.</li>
            <li>I have decided to keep it but don&#x27;t waste your time or month just by a normal toothbrush or invest in a good electronic toothbrush you can travel with.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This is a very lightweight, compact, convenient design for traveling, and you certainly can&#x27;t beat the price.</li>
            <li>Fast delivery as always</li>
            <li>This one is extra soft bristles and just the right power to give me the familiar feeling when I am traveling.  </li>
            <li>I was really in need of a sonic toothbrush, that was not so expensive, not only does this fit the bill, it seems a lot more sturdy, and i love the color, thanks.</li>
            <li>Violive is less effective than manual brushing by far.  </li>
            <li>(I always brush longer with this particular toothbrush).</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>This feels tiny in the mouth with a &amp;#34;little kid&#x27;s buzz,&amp;#34; but a buzz it is, for whatever it&#x27;s worth.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not like a $100 electric toothbrush but for the 10 buck I spent it gives me more than a regular brush.</li>
            <li>Wow!</li>
            <li>The colors and compactness make them cool enough to actually use too!</li>
            <li>/&gt;So far I have gotten only positive feedback on these toothbrushes.</li>
            <li>although unfortunately it has more than doubled in price in the past year, it&#x27;s still a much better value and more practical than other Sonicare models since it uses AA batteries instead of a non-replaceable battery &amp; charger.</li>
            <li>Like other people I was a bit surprised at the small brush head, but after using it I found that the size actually allowed me to better reach some tricky places, and managed to do a much better job than the basic sonic oral-b brush I had used before.</li>
            <li>It is certainly not as powerful as my one at home, but it works far better than a standard toothbrush, is light, and takes up very little space.</li>
            <li>I bought one  because my old sonicare was worn out</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m an old geezer with a smaller mouth instead of</li>
            <li>: battery powered, small brush, not as powerful</li>

            <li> : battery powered, small brush, not as powerful</li>
            <li> Contrary to what I was expecting, the brush head is not very compact (not even as compact as my regular size Sonicare brush heads) and for me, this is a negative, since it&#x27;s already difficult for me to effectively get around my wisdom teeth; however, the brush head size may be a positive for some people.</li>
            <li> Tried it out when it arrived and sending it back; it is just a toothbrush - not powerful enough to be a sonic and get the job done.  </li>
            <li> But after several day&#x27;s use it was very rough on my gums.</li>
            <li> Every brush, I had to fish out bristles that got loose and fell out.  </li>
            <li> Second, it mearly vibrated, and mostly in the base, not the head of the toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> If I&#x27;m going to be gone for a while, I usually throw in an extra battery.</li>
            <li> Also like others have said, the sonic part of the toothbrush is simply a fairly gentle vibration, not the brushes madly twirling around, but the vibration seems to do the trick and left my teeth feeling even cleaner than other fancy brushes.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t even bother taking it home with me from my trip, it was a waste of space.</li>
            <li> It is definitely not as powerful or effective as a Sonicare, which I was disappointed by since another reviewer seemed to think that it is, though I guess that&#x27;s just unrealistic for .</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your $$$.</li>
            <li> I was missing my vibrating toothbrush used at home.  </li>
            <li> My teeth feel slick and shiney when through.</li>
            <li> it gets in all the hard to reach areas and in those gaps between teeth.</li>
            <li> Small and convenient!</li>
            <li> Seriously sometimes I feel like people</li>
            <li> Completely worthless toothbrush.  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> These touthbrushes are perfect for travel and every days use.  I use them for years.</li>
            <li> I personally like this product. It&#x27;s not like a $100 electric toothbrush but for the 10 buck I spent it gives me more than a regular brush. It&#x27;s a travel version of my Pulsar toothbrush. Since I started using Invisalign I carry this everywhere.</li>
            <li> We have a bunch of teenagers in our sphere of family and friends, and they all now have a toothbrush they can pack in their sports bag, take on an overnight or trip. The colors and compactness make them cool enough to actually use too!</li>
            <li> I thought it was a good idea as a traveling toothbrush for a trip I am taking soon.  Tried it out when it arrived and sending it back; it is just a toothbrush - not powerful enough to be a sonic and get the job done.  I&#x27;ll take my Philips Sonicare with me instead.</li>
            <li> I felt like it did an excellent job cleaning my teeth..  I use an electric toothbrush at home, and this size was much more convenient to pack.  But after several day&#x27;s use it was very rough on my gums.</li>
            <li> Bought this as a present for my daughter who just used it on a trip and while she was brushing her teeth the bristles were falling out!</li>
            <li> Completely worthless toothbrush.  First of all it fell apart everytime I tried to use it.  Second, it mearly vibrated, and mostly in the base, not the head of the toothbrush.  I didn&#x27;t even bother taking it home with me from my trip, it was a waste of space.</li>
            <li> I was really in need of a sonic toothbrush, that was not so expensive, not only does this fit the bill, it seems a lot more sturdy, and i love the color, thanks.</li>
            <li> Love this toothbrush for traveling!  I bought one for myself, a one for each of my friends!  Great gift!</li>
            <li> Perfect size to fit in pocket or small purse.  Powerful enough to make you feel really clean without harm. Especially great for folks wearing braces! Can&#x27;t imagine how I survived without it.</li>
            <li> Wish there were different settings but it works great and does what it is-a toothbrush. Perfect for traveling with. Hope the battery life is good!</li>
            <li> While not as powerful as a regular sonic toothbrush, it&#x27;s still better than a non-electric toothbrush and it&#x27;s great for traveling. If I&#x27;m going to be gone for a while, I usually throw in an extra battery. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this for everday home use, but I always take it when I&#x27;m away from home.</li>
            <li> This is a very lightweight, compact, convenient design for traveling, and you certainly can&#x27;t beat the price. It is definitely not as powerful or effective as a Sonicare, which I was disappointed by since another reviewer seemed to think that it is, though I guess that&#x27;s just unrealistic for . However, if you put a good fresh battery in, it does a pretty nice job. Much better than a manual or mechanical-action electric toothbrush. Contrary to what I was expecting, the brush head is not very compact (not even as compact as my regular size Sonicare brush heads) and for me, this is a negative, since it&#x27;s already difficult for me to effectively get around my wisdom teeth; however, the brush head size may be a positive for some people. I wanted a slim, light, inexpensive sonic toothbrush that I could leave in my toiletry bag for frequent short-term trips that I take so I&#x27;m not constantly transferring my Sonicare back and forth from luggage to medicine cabinet and back--which I sometimes would forget to do and end up without a toothbrush at my destination; this is the perfect solution. I wouldn&#x27;t use this for my day to day toothbrush; for that I enthusiastically recommend the Sonicare Xtreme (http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000FEIOHW/ref&#x3D;oh_aui_search_detailpage?ie&#x3D;UTF8&amp;psc&#x3D;1) although unfortunately it has more than doubled in price in the past year, it&#x27;s still a much better value and more practical than other Sonicare models since it uses AA batteries instead of a non-replaceable battery &amp; charger. But for short-term/travel situations I don&#x27;t think you could beat the Violife Slim Sonic. Also the color I got (purple) is a pretty matte metallic violet. :-)</li>
            <li> If you are used to using an electric toothbrush at home, you will love this one for traveling.  It&#x27;s compact but has a lot of \\&quot;oomph\\&quot; for being battery driven.  Comes in lots of cute colors too!  I&#x27;ve given lots of these as gifts and everyone loves them.</li>
            <li> China makes some good products.  This isn&#x27;t one of them.  How they got away from calling it a &amp;#34;Sonic Toothbrush&amp;#34; is a crime.&lt;br /&gt;  Phillips Sonicare mades a great electric toothbrush.  Violive is less effective than manual brushing by far.  Don&#x27;t waste your $$$.</li>
            <li> This is quite a good toothbrush. I have had it for not even a month yet and I can tell a great difference in the color and cleanliness of my teeth. The bristles are very gentle on your gums even on the fast cycle and it does a wonderful job at cleaning your teeth. It comes in a variety of colors and comes with 3 bristle heads plus the one on the toothbrush so it lasts you a year! Great toothbrush!</li>
            <li> The battery worked fine but from the first brushing on, it lost bristles.  Every brush, I had to fish out bristles that got loose and fell out.  I was in Europe so replacing it wasn&#x27;t an option. Think I&#x27;ll go back to regular toothbrush the next time I travel.</li>
            <li> I bought one  because my old sonicare was worn out and i thought i&#x27;d just try this for fun. Wow! Works great. I&#x27;m an old geezer with a smaller mouth instead of a big loudmouth LOL. The smaller brush head is wonderful it gets in all the hard to reach areas and in those gaps between teeth. My teeth feel slick and shiney when through. I use one cheap battery about every 10 days brushing thoroughly two times a day.</li>
            <li> Great item for travel or hand bag</li>
            <li> I order this Toothbrush because I needed a travel size electronic, I wasn&#x27;t too impressed even after reading the reviews. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this product to someone who uses an electronic toothbrush I just don&#x27;t feel like me teeth get clean (I always brush longer with this particular toothbrush). I have decided to keep it but don&#x27;t waste your time or month just by a normal toothbrush or invest in a good electronic toothbrush you can travel with.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros: comes in different colors, compact, and affordable&lt;br /&gt;Cons: battery powered, small brush, not as powerful</li>
            <li> Easy to pack for trips.  Glad I purchased them.  Would be easy to throw in purse for a day trip.</li>
            <li> Picked this up on a whim before a trip and am very happy. Like other people I was a bit surprised at the small brush head, but after using it I found that the size actually allowed me to better reach some tricky places, and managed to do a much better job than the basic sonic oral-b brush I had used before. Also like others have said, the sonic part of the toothbrush is simply a fairly gentle vibration, not the brushes madly twirling around, but the vibration seems to do the trick and left my teeth feeling even cleaner than other fancy brushes. It&#x27;s called a slim sonic toothbrush, not a rotating pulsating toothbrush of doom. Seriously sometimes I feel like people aren&#x27;t convinced their brushes will do the trick unless the have the same motion and power of a jackhammer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And this is by far the most I have ever written about a toothbrush.</li>
            <li> This is a great gift!  I love my sonic toothbrush and this portable model is perfect not just for traveling but the perfect size to carry with you all the time.  I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Perfect. Does the job and fits my purse.</li>
            <li> These toothbrushes make great gifts! Consider trying it.&lt;br /&gt;So far I have gotten only positive feedback on these toothbrushes. Love it</li>
            <li> Fast delivery as always and I have used these before.  This was for. Gift.  They are really terrific and do a good job of cleaning. Great for travel.</li>
            <li> This battery operated toothbrush is wonderful for travel. It is certainly not as powerful as my one at home, but it works far better than a standard toothbrush, is light, and takes up very little space. I am very happy with it for travel.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re used to a full-sizer and expect the same feel--like I am and did---it won&#x27;t happen. This feels tiny in the mouth with a &amp;#34;little kid&#x27;s buzz,&amp;#34; but a buzz it is, for whatever it&#x27;s worth. You can always combine it with stroke and compensate that way. Not bad, really, but have realistic expectations. I&#x27;ve used other mini-travel sonic toothbrushes, and this is as good as the others.</li>
            <li> Love it!! Great for vacation!! My big battery brush is bulky for travel,but you get used to the power brush-so this is perfect! Small and convenient!</li>
            <li> great travel item for my daughter who just got braces..</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m on a European trip and have been using this toothbrush for almost a month now. The batteries haven&#x27;t been replaced yet, and this little thing does a great job considering the price I paid. It really cleans your teeth, but maybe not as good as a Phillips brand, but its way eat better than a standard brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did bring along a standard brush I keep in my purse for after lunch it in the middle of the day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But, this slim sonic one is great to use when you want to do a good job at making your teeth really clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think if the brush head was curved like most brush heads it would work even better.</li>
            <li> I travel a lot for fun and profit.  I was missing my vibrating toothbrush used at home.  This one is extra soft bristles and just the right power to give me the familiar feeling when I am traveling.  I keep my toiletry back stocked and ready to fly. This is a lovely and practical addition.</li>
