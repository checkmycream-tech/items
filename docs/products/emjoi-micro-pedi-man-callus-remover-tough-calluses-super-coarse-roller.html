            <li>Amazing product!</li>
            <li>Great performance and a good value for the money.</li>
            <li>Works great and so easy!!  </li>
            <li>My husband is very pleased ,works great</li>
            <li>That made an impression on me that I should take care of them and that&#x27;s what this awesome Emjoi did with just 3 quick treatments!</li>
            <li>Very easy to  use!  </li>
            <li>as lightning and very easy to use at home or away !</li>
            <li>For a tool that runs on two penlight batteries it delivers a surprising amount of power.  </li>
            <li>Battery life is good, but I guess that depends on the batteries.</li>
            <li>so this is good but use often.  </li>
            <li>Good product but batteries die too soon</li>
            <li>I have been using a foot paddle for years and getting good results, but this takes all the work out of it.</li>
            <li>Awesome, fun to use, and makes a lot of chalky dust!  </li>
            <li>Super happy customer!!!</li>
            <li>Great, speedy accurate service!</li>
            <li>This was a gift for my wife &amp; she is very pleased.</li>
            <li>Very pleased.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve seen and it makes her feet look and feel TONS better!</li>
            <li>L.ove it, came real quick!</li>
            <li>I absolutely Love this product!</li>
            <li>From the first use I was impressed!</li>
            <li>I love it!</li>
            <li>When finished put on some lotion and cotton socks (overnight if you can)  Magic!  </li>
            <li>I ordered 3 more to give to my sisters and mother for Christmas!</li>
            <li>still love it!</li>
            <li>WORKED GREAT ON MY FEET, EASY TO USE</li>
            <li>first time using this pedi , it worked great use lotion afterwards , wife said feet feel great</li>
            <li>This tool is amazing.  </li>
            <li>It does an amazing job</li>
            <li>Effective, compact, not girly looking.</li>
            <li>but I honestly don&#x27;t think it mattered.</li>
            <li>Buffs them quite nicely as well as on my heels.</li>
            <li>Also I suggest after using the buffer apply some nice foot lotion.....</li>
            <li>Excellent, highly recommend !</li>
            <li>This product did a fairly good job removing my heel calluses,  but it just needs more power to be completely effective.  </li>
            <li>ok nothing exceptional</li>
            <li>I am super happy with this purchase.</li>
            <li>The buffer is very easy to use...</li>
            <li>I think my best bet is to get a professional pedicure &amp; then use this product for callus &amp;#34;maintenance&amp;#34; before the calluses have a chance to get out of hand again.</li>
            <li>Excellent upkeep after a professional pedicure.</li>
            <li>So far, I am impressed.</li>
            <li>This is by far the best callus remover I have ever tried.  </li>
            <li>I love love love it!  </li>
            <li>and I love, love, love it!</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>I love this product.  </li>
            <li>and I love it.</li>
            <li>I love it.  </li>
            <li>I bought it for my wife for Christmas and had to buy additional roller because I use it too:-).  </li>
            <li>much more convenient than the wired versions.</li>
            <li>My wife and I LOVE these things.</li>
            <li>Much better and faster alternative to using foot peeling masks.</li>
            <li>This buffer performs as advertised and am pleased with this purchase and recommend it to others.  </li>
            <li>Bought one for me, then 2 more as gifts.</li>
            <li>I LOVE this.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m so glad I went with the man.</li>
            <li>Just don&#x27;t know why this &amp;#34;man&amp;#34; version had to cost so much more than the &amp;#34;lady&amp;#34; version.  </li>
            <li>my feet nice and smooth.</li>
            <li>Work okay need to order rollers with coarsers roller</li>
            <li>Does the job, so glad I found you.  </li>
            <li>The Nano Micro-Pedi Foot Shaver/Buffer was ok.  </li>
            <li>Ok</li>
            <li>And frankly a heck of a lot better than everything</li>
            <li>Ok purple is over done too.</li>
            <li>I am so pleased with this product that I&#x27;ve told all my skanky-heeled brothers about it.  </li>
            <li>Takes a while to get, but I love it</li>
            <li>You can get corded options for more money.</li>
            <li>It is better than what they accomplish with a pedicure.</li>
            <li>I got this buffer and wasn&#x27;t sure what to expect.</li>
            <li>But it turns out it is like magic.  </li>
            <li>Love this buffer.</li>
            <li>Quite an enjoyable and efficient device to use.</li>
            <li>My heels have never looked better.  </li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m glad I did.  </li>
            <li>This is better.</li>
            <li>Love these.  </li>
            <li>:)  </li>
            <li>It does a ok job.</li>
            <li>Try it you will love it.</li>
            <li>I was expecting more power.</li>
            <li>version because I figured it might pack more power than what they give us women.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>Love it.  </li>
            <li>This works better than the one for women.</li>
            <li>Love this thing, I bought the toughest grain sanding attachments.</li>
            <li>The very best for keeping feet soft and callous free.</li>
            <li>I like this more.</li>
            <li>I think you get better control with it</li>
            <li>This works well for this and will help me manage my foot care during winter months when I dont do as many pedis.</li>
            <li>This is one of the best personal care products.</li>
            <li>This is the best little gadget I own love it</li>
            <li>and I love how smooth my feet are now.</li>
            <li>So far this is working great.</li>
            <li>so I can use it more often, but they stay smooth as a baby&#x27;s butt.</li>
            <li>So much more comfortable and convenient than a pumice or metal foot scrubber.  </li>
            <li>I know it&#x27;s for men but being a woman with rough feet, this is wonderful.</li>
            <li>My friend loved mine so much that I bought her this for Christmas.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to use, but more importantly, it does work.  </li>
            <li>I can honestly say the reviews are right on the money with this product.</li>
            <li>You just need to go easy.</li>
            <li>Works easily.</li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t purchase this product again since I&#x27;ve found that good old fashion elbow grease works better.</li>
            <li>Worked fine.</li>
            <li>So light and easy to use.</li>
            <li>He used it once and found a tremendous improvement!  </li>
            <li>Wonderful easy way to get off dead skin on feet</li>
            <li>Easy to use, fast, easy to clean, effective.  </li>
            <li>so.....this little gadget is GREAT!</li>
            <li>This little machine is AWESOME!</li>
            <li>The concept of this item is fantastic.</li>
            <li>The reality of how this item functions ... not so fantastic.</li>
            <li>After one use, my feet are as smooth as a baby&#x27;s butt.  </li>
            <li>My feet feel instantly smooth.  </li>
            <li>Great on my callused big toes.</li>
            <li>Will upgrade to electric model in the future but this is great to try out the system.</li>
            <li>Comfortable To hold.</li>
            <li>wish it was more powerful</li>
            <li>Well worth the price and more.  </li>
            <li>My feet are smooth as silk.</li>
            <li>Important.  </li>
            <li>I liked it so much</li>
            <li>and it makes my heels so smooth</li>
            <li>Do keep in mind that you will have to provide your own batteries, so have them ready if you would like to use this the minute it arrives.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m still considering a more powerful version for home.</li>
            <li>really works great, fast, no pain</li>
            <li>Very useful.</li>
            <li>It helps my feet feel smooth and clean.  </li>
            <li>This unit will serve me best when I travel as it&#x27;s lightweight and small (about the size of my palm).  </li>
            <li>My feet have significantly improved.</li>
            <li>It works great for my dry feet, makes them feel like silk.</li>
            <li>I use canned air to blow it clean.</li>
            <li>After this price, I&#x27;d expect to get something WAY more powerful and higher quality.</li>
            <li>After trying Emoj Micro-Pedi Man with coarsest roller for over a month, I can honestly say that no pedi-roller can compete with old fashioned blade on the handle.</li>
            <li>a true must if you like to get close-up and cuddly</li>
            <li>Consider safty issue,  it is powerful but also worry and damage free.</li>
            <li>Easy to use, fast and smooth.  </li>
            <li>My feet have never been smoother, it goes through batteries quick so but rechargeable batteries too or a plug in type.</li>
            <li>LOVE, LOVE, LOVE this little tool....</li>
            <li>I am so glad I read a review saying that it was much more powerful than the regular.</li>
            <li>So far it is really good, got this for myself and feel its better because it is stronger, cost a little more but worth it</li>
            <li>Read the mens device (this one) was significantly better, and that it out performs the new Clarisonic pedi device.</li>
            <li>He loves it because its easy to use and exfoliates very well.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m going shopping for my first pair of sandals in a decade!</li>
            <li>I used it, wife used it, my 27 year old son used it, and it still works fine, even the batteries!  </li>
            <li>It does make the dead skin fly.</li>
            <li>I was ready for my feet to feel like shiny, smooth satin.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s pretty powerful and not painful at all.</li>
            <li>It leaves your feet nice and smooth with minimal effort.</li>
            <li>Definitely worth the money.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a very durable product and definitely does the job more so than a spa pedi and for free!</li>
            <li>It really keeps my heels nice and soft after putting some lotion on.</li>
            <li>Not as powerful as advertised</li>
            <li>and it is well worth the money.  </li>
            <li>Well worth the money, but</li>
            <li>Now, I&#x27;m amazed that they feel soft and look so much better.</li>
            <li>I still have some deep cracks, but they are now smooth and I am confident that this remover will continue progress on them .</li>
            <li>I am so excited that this remover really works!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Great little gadget to have!</li>
            <li>You won&#x27;t get your heels smooth on one try unless you have normal feet.  </li>
            <li>The device is still as powerful as the day I first used it.</li>
            <li>The only thing I&#x27;ve found that works on my feet; the first few time i used it I was so impressed with how it works</li>
            <li>Easy to use and does a fantastic job of removing dry cracked</li>
            <li>Does exactly what it should.</li>
            <li>Love item, would definitely recommend.</li>
            <li>Sure wish I knew about this earlier.  </li>
            <li>Works exactly as advertised.</li>
            <li>Used regularly, the balls of my feet and heels are so smooth!</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t think i would like it at first, but it ended up being a pretty nifty piece of equipment.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I cannot believe how soft and smooth my feet are now.  </li>
            <li>My feet get completely smooth and soft after using it.  </li>
            <li>So much easier than manually exfoliating!  </li>
            <li>That is sadly not the case.  </li>
            <li>Functions exactly as described in the product description.</li>
            <li>I have used mine all summer and just replaced the roller for the first time.</li>
            <li>have to do a lot of mini sessions at first.</li>
            <li>So I turned to Amazon and not only found it cheaper, but another version that was a lot more inexpensive.</li>
            <li>This is a Christmas present, but I own one and cannot live without it.</li>
            <li>Works awesome no more dry skin on my feet</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a much coarser file which is exactly what I needed.</li>
            <li>The MAN does not mean it&#x27;s any more sturdy or stronger just a different color package ladies.</li>
            <li>I found the New Powerful Nano Micro Pedi Foot Buffer by Emjoi did the job I was hoping for.&lt;br /&gt;Left</li>
            <li>Many women who have terribly dry feet might be thrown off from buying.</li>
            <li>Make sure your feet are dry.  </li>
            <li>I have been trying to get rid of some rather large calluses that are caused by wearing work boots all day.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m using it to trim back my over-callused fingertips (guitar player), and it works just fine for that purpose.</li>
            <li>Nice little gizmo.  </li>
            <li>It really works well and is not abrasive to skin at all.</li>
            <li>Then it will be very tender.</li>
            <li>It really does the job.</li>
            <li>Really helped him.</li>
            <li>After only one use (couple of minutes each foot) his feet were so smooth you could run something silky over them without snagging.</li>
            <li>This smoothes rough heels better than the fancy Pedisonic one I just got rid of.</li>
            <li>Works well, and fast.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t really work that well.</li>
            <li>Really works well.  </li>
            <li>This  really works.  </li>
            <li>Really.  </li>
            <li>This really works.  </li>
            <li>I really like this foot buffer.  </li>
            <li>This is a definite if you want smooth feet.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t seem to really cut into your callousness</li>
            <li>This works very well.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li>I really like this unit.</li>
            <li>- it was basically a stainless steel grater.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t imagine anyone investing in this if their calluses aren&#x27;t a real issue.</li>
            <li>My husband absolutely loves it ...</li>
            <li>Only criticism is I would have liked to see this come with some extra refills.</li>
            <li>Only advice is don&#x27;t try to remove calluses completely the first time, take it easy and make it a once per week routine.</li>
            <li>Includes coarse roller, which is much gentler than I imagined (bought super-coarse replacements before the original wore out).</li>
            <li>Better than any other type of unit I have used on my feet.</li>
            <li>I am using it every other day now and completely satisfied with how it works.</li>
            <li>had originally bought a Pedi-egg, but this surpasses it big time.</li>
            <li>This product is great, appears to have a fairly long battery life, is gentle on my feet -does not need heavy pressure.</li>
            <li>Also, make sure you stock up on batteries, I really file mine down</li>
            <li>I think the whole process took 5 minutes (10 minutes if you count the time it took me to hunt down the 2 AA batteries required) :)</li>
            <li>Considering the cost of regular pedicures - sometimes with an extra charge of up to $10 for callus removal - this device will most certainly save me time and money.</li>
            <li>After 3-4 weeks you&#x27;ll feel like you have new feet!</li>
            <li>I also purchased the Refill Rollers (Super Coarse)</li>
            <li>The roller is so coarse that it shreds callous quickly.  </li>
            <li>The only problem I have is that it burns through batteries so quickly.  </li>
            <li>I am going to try the super coarse rollers.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>I think the replacement roller is too high.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>All the dead skin just files right off in tremendous amounts.</li>
            <li>Live and learn.</li>
            <li>I absolutely live this</li>
            <li>The only way you can tell is if the remover isn&#x27;t removing as well as it did when you first bought it.</li>
            <li>I wish it had a power adapter to ensure proper voltage for consistent performance.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used the hand buffers and never come anywhere near the results of this foot buffer!</li>
            <li>Leaves your skin soft like a baby !&lt;</li>
            <li>Wow!</li>
            <li>It does take time to get down to a callus free zone</li>
            <li>One month of devout sanding (twice a day for the first two weeks and then once a day for the next two weeks) along with the application of a fanTATIC heel wax, that you can get on Amazon, and my heels are as soft as a baby&#x27;s bottom.  </li>
            <li>once a week or more to keep my rough skin under control but it has not eliminated my dry skin problem on my feet.</li>
            <li>got this from my wife so far she loves it.</li>
            <li>My feet are so soft after using.</li>
            <li>If you are using it often or have really calloused feet, then you will need to have extra rollers.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t work nearly as well as the infomercial.</li>
            <li>Leaves the heel soft.</li>
            <li>My feet are so soft.</li>
            <li>I use the second from the most heavy duty refills.</li>
            <li>Although the product works fairly well I have found that I have to use it a few times a week in order to keep my feet from feeling dry, cracked and rough.  </li>
            <li>My feet are not terrible just a little dry on the heels.</li>
            <li>What a cool little tool.</li>
            <li>Thanks for making a grey one for men...</li>
            <li>Every other day for about one week, I used the Emjoi foot buffer  until I had soft, pretty heals.</li>
            <li>I have had years of hard callouses that this removed easily.</li>
            <li>WOW, this thing takes away rough edges &amp; smooths amazingly fast</li>
            <li>The dry skin on the top of my big toe is completely gone after a few uses and hasn&#x27;t returned.</li>
            <li>Then slathered feet in a good body butter and put on some thick cotton socks for a few hours.</li>
            <li>Appears quality, and holding up fine, as I said I tried to press it so hard so that the motor stops as I read, and....  </li>
            <li>Since it&#x27;s battery powered the rotations almost cease if I press down more than slightly.  </li>
            <li>i general</li>
            <li>so I was always in flip flops or barefoot and seem to be prone to calluses so its a constant battle to keep my feet callus-free let alone soft even.</li>
            <li>It rubs the rollers and so far I haven&#x27;t seen any damage to the rollers or even the back bar</li>
            <li>Then I went to work, careful not to do too much.  </li>
            <li>And heel stays soft longer than with a regular manually handled callus remover.</li>
            <li>I go bare foot quite a lot.  </li>
            <li>I honestly didn&#x27;t think I had that much dead skin on my feet till I used this and saw all the white, dead skin falling from my feet.</li>
            <li>so if you want a less yucky color with a little more sophistication to it...</li>
            <li>Highly recommend for dry cracked heels.  </li>
            <li>She&#x27;s diabetic, so this is a much safer alternative than blade-type callus cutters and other scraper-type removers.</li>
            <li>Not rough on your feet but does create a lot of \\&quot;white dust\\&quot;.</li>
            <li>Removes the rough dry skin but is gentle and does not cut the skin.  </li>

            <li> Great performance and a good value for the money.</li>
            <li> Works great and so easy!!  </li>
            <li> My husband is very pleased ,works great</li>
            <li> That made an impression on me that I should take care of them and that&#x27;s what this awesome Emjoi did with just 3 quick treatments!</li>
            <li> Very easy to  use!  </li>
            <li> as lightning and very easy to use at home or away !</li>
            <li> For a tool that runs on two penlight batteries it delivers a surprising amount of power.  </li>
            <li> Battery life is good, but I guess that depends on the batteries.</li>
            <li> so this is good but use often.  </li>
            <li> Good product but batteries die too soon</li>
            <li> I have been using a foot paddle for years and getting good results, but this takes all the work out of it.</li>
            <li> Awesome, fun to use, and makes a lot of chalky dust!  </li>
            <li> Super happy customer!!!</li>
            <li> Great, speedy accurate service!</li>
            <li> This was a gift for my wife &amp; she is very pleased.</li>
            <li> Very pleased.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve seen and it makes her feet look and feel TONS better!</li>
            <li> L.ove it, came real quick!</li>
            <li> I absolutely Love this product!</li>
            <li> From the first use I was impressed!</li>
            <li> I love it!</li>
            <li> When finished put on some lotion and cotton socks (overnight if you can)  Magic!  </li>
            <li> I ordered 3 more to give to my sisters and mother for Christmas!</li>
            <li> still love it!</li>
            <li> WORKED GREAT ON MY FEET, EASY TO USE</li>
            <li> first time using this pedi , it worked great use lotion afterwards , wife said feet feel great</li>
            <li> This tool is amazing.  </li>
            <li> It does an amazing job</li>
            <li> Effective, compact, not girly looking.</li>
            <li> but I honestly don&#x27;t think it mattered.</li>
            <li> Buffs them quite nicely as well as on my heels.</li>
            <li> Also I suggest after using the buffer apply some nice foot lotion.....</li>
            <li> Excellent, highly recommend !</li>
            <li> This product did a fairly good job removing my heel calluses,  but it just needs more power to be completely effective.  </li>
            <li> ok nothing exceptional</li>
            <li> I am super happy with this purchase.</li>
            <li> The buffer is very easy to use...</li>
            <li> I think my best bet is to get a professional pedicure &amp; then use this product for callus &amp;#34;maintenance&amp;#34; before the calluses have a chance to get out of hand again.</li>
            <li> Excellent upkeep after a professional pedicure.</li>
            <li> So far, I am impressed.</li>
            <li> This is by far the best callus remover I have ever tried.  </li>
            <li> I love love love it!  </li>
            <li> and I love, love, love it!</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>

            <li> and I love it.</li>
            <li> I love it.  </li>
            <li> I bought it for my wife for Christmas and had to buy additional roller because I use it too:-).  </li>
            <li> much more convenient than the wired versions.</li>
            <li> My wife and I LOVE these things.</li>
            <li> Much better and faster alternative to using foot peeling masks.</li>
            <li> This buffer performs as advertised and am pleased with this purchase and recommend it to others.  </li>
            <li> Bought one for me, then 2 more as gifts.</li>
            <li> I LOVE this.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m so glad I went with the man.</li>
            <li> Just don&#x27;t know why this &amp;#34;man&amp;#34; version had to cost so much more than the &amp;#34;lady&amp;#34; version.  </li>
            <li> my feet nice and smooth.</li>
            <li> Work okay need to order rollers with coarsers roller</li>
            <li> Does the job, so glad I found you.  </li>
            <li> The Nano Micro-Pedi Foot Shaver/Buffer was ok.  </li>
            <li> Ok</li>
            <li> And frankly a heck of a lot better than everything</li>
            <li> Ok purple is over done too.</li>
            <li> I am so pleased with this product that I&#x27;ve told all my skanky-heeled brothers about it.  </li>
            <li> Takes a while to get, but I love it</li>
            <li> You can get corded options for more money.</li>
            <li> It is better than what they accomplish with a pedicure.</li>
            <li> I got this buffer and wasn&#x27;t sure what to expect.</li>
            <li> But it turns out it is like magic.  </li>
            <li> Love this buffer.</li>
            <li> Quite an enjoyable and efficient device to use.</li>
            <li> My heels have never looked better.  </li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m glad I did.  </li>
            <li> This is better.</li>
            <li> Love these.  </li>
            <li> :)  </li>
            <li> It does a ok job.</li>
            <li> Try it you will love it.</li>
            <li> I was expecting more power.</li>
            <li> version because I figured it might pack more power than what they give us women.</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> Love it.  </li>
            <li> This works better than the one for women.</li>
            <li> Love this thing, I bought the toughest grain sanding attachments.</li>
            <li> The very best for keeping feet soft and callous free.</li>
            <li> I like this more.</li>
            <li> I think you get better control with it</li>
            <li> This works well for this and will help me manage my foot care during winter months when I dont do as many pedis.</li>
            <li> This is one of the best personal care products.</li>
            <li> This is the best little gadget I own love it</li>
            <li> and I love how smooth my feet are now.</li>
            <li> So far this is working great.</li>
            <li> so I can use it more often, but they stay smooth as a baby&#x27;s butt.</li>
            <li> So much more comfortable and convenient than a pumice or metal foot scrubber.  </li>
            <li> I know it&#x27;s for men but being a woman with rough feet, this is wonderful.</li>
            <li> My friend loved mine so much that I bought her this for Christmas.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to use, but more importantly, it does work.  </li>
            <li> I can honestly say the reviews are right on the money with this product.</li>
            <li> You just need to go easy.</li>
            <li> Works easily.</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t purchase this product again since I&#x27;ve found that good old fashion elbow grease works better.</li>
            <li> Worked fine.</li>
            <li> So light and easy to use.</li>
            <li> He used it once and found a tremendous improvement!  </li>
            <li> Wonderful easy way to get off dead skin on feet</li>
            <li> Easy to use, fast, easy to clean, effective.  </li>
            <li> so.....this little gadget is GREAT!</li>
            <li> This little machine is AWESOME!</li>
            <li> The concept of this item is fantastic.</li>
            <li> The reality of how this item functions ... not so fantastic.</li>
            <li> After one use, my feet are as smooth as a baby&#x27;s butt.  </li>
            <li> My feet feel instantly smooth.  </li>
            <li> Great on my callused big toes.</li>
            <li> Will upgrade to electric model in the future but this is great to try out the system.</li>
            <li> Comfortable To hold.</li>
            <li> wish it was more powerful</li>
            <li> Well worth the price and more.  </li>
            <li> My feet are smooth as silk.</li>
            <li> Important.  </li>
            <li> I liked it so much</li>
            <li> and it makes my heels so smooth</li>
            <li> Do keep in mind that you will have to provide your own batteries, so have them ready if you would like to use this the minute it arrives.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m still considering a more powerful version for home.</li>
            <li> really works great, fast, no pain</li>
            <li> Very useful.</li>
            <li> It helps my feet feel smooth and clean.  </li>
            <li> This unit will serve me best when I travel as it&#x27;s lightweight and small (about the size of my palm).  </li>
            <li> My feet have significantly improved.</li>
            <li> It works great for my dry feet, makes them feel like silk.</li>
            <li> I use canned air to blow it clean.</li>
            <li> After this price, I&#x27;d expect to get something WAY more powerful and higher quality.</li>
            <li> After trying Emoj Micro-Pedi Man with coarsest roller for over a month, I can honestly say that no pedi-roller can compete with old fashioned blade on the handle.</li>
            <li> a true must if you like to get close-up and cuddly</li>
            <li> Consider safty issue,  it is powerful but also worry and damage free.</li>
            <li> Easy to use, fast and smooth.  </li>
            <li> My feet have never been smoother, it goes through batteries quick so but rechargeable batteries too or a plug in type.</li>
            <li> LOVE, LOVE, LOVE this little tool....</li>
            <li> I am so glad I read a review saying that it was much more powerful than the regular.</li>
            <li> So far it is really good, got this for myself and feel its better because it is stronger, cost a little more but worth it</li>
            <li> Read the mens device (this one) was significantly better, and that it out performs the new Clarisonic pedi device.</li>
            <li> He loves it because its easy to use and exfoliates very well.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m going shopping for my first pair of sandals in a decade!</li>
            <li> I used it, wife used it, my 27 year old son used it, and it still works fine, even the batteries!  </li>
            <li> It does make the dead skin fly.</li>
            <li> I was ready for my feet to feel like shiny, smooth satin.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s pretty powerful and not painful at all.</li>
            <li> It leaves your feet nice and smooth with minimal effort.</li>
            <li> Definitely worth the money.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a very durable product and definitely does the job more so than a spa pedi and for free!</li>
            <li> It really keeps my heels nice and soft after putting some lotion on.</li>
            <li> Not as powerful as advertised</li>
            <li> and it is well worth the money.  </li>
            <li> Well worth the money, but</li>
            <li> Now, I&#x27;m amazed that they feel soft and look so much better.</li>
            <li> I still have some deep cracks, but they are now smooth and I am confident that this remover will continue progress on them .</li>
            <li> I am so excited that this remover really works!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Great little gadget to have!</li>
            <li> You won&#x27;t get your heels smooth on one try unless you have normal feet.  </li>
            <li> The device is still as powerful as the day I first used it.</li>
            <li> The only thing I&#x27;ve found that works on my feet; the first few time i used it I was so impressed with how it works</li>
            <li> Easy to use and does a fantastic job of removing dry cracked</li>
            <li> Does exactly what it should.</li>
            <li> Love item, would definitely recommend.</li>
            <li> Sure wish I knew about this earlier.  </li>
            <li> Works exactly as advertised.</li>
            <li> Used regularly, the balls of my feet and heels are so smooth!</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t think i would like it at first, but it ended up being a pretty nifty piece of equipment.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I cannot believe how soft and smooth my feet are now.  </li>
            <li> My feet get completely smooth and soft after using it.  </li>
            <li> So much easier than manually exfoliating!  </li>
            <li> That is sadly not the case.  </li>
            <li> Functions exactly as described in the product description.</li>
            <li> I have used mine all summer and just replaced the roller for the first time.</li>
            <li> have to do a lot of mini sessions at first.</li>
            <li> So I turned to Amazon and not only found it cheaper, but another version that was a lot more inexpensive.</li>
            <li> This is a Christmas present, but I own one and cannot live without it.</li>
            <li> Works awesome no more dry skin on my feet</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a much coarser file which is exactly what I needed.</li>
            <li> The MAN does not mean it&#x27;s any more sturdy or stronger just a different color package ladies.</li>
            <li> I found the New Powerful Nano Micro Pedi Foot Buffer by Emjoi did the job I was hoping for.&lt;br /&gt;Left</li>
            <li> Many women who have terribly dry feet might be thrown off from buying.</li>
            <li> Make sure your feet are dry.  </li>
            <li> I have been trying to get rid of some rather large calluses that are caused by wearing work boots all day.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m using it to trim back my over-callused fingertips (guitar player), and it works just fine for that purpose.</li>
            <li> Nice little gizmo.  </li>
            <li> It really works well and is not abrasive to skin at all.</li>
            <li> Then it will be very tender.</li>
            <li> It really does the job.</li>
            <li> Really helped him.</li>
            <li> After only one use (couple of minutes each foot) his feet were so smooth you could run something silky over them without snagging.</li>
            <li> This smoothes rough heels better than the fancy Pedisonic one I just got rid of.</li>
            <li> Works well, and fast.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t really work that well.</li>
            <li> Really works well.  </li>
            <li> This  really works.  </li>
            <li> Really.  </li>
            <li> This really works.  </li>
            <li> I really like this foot buffer.  </li>
            <li> This is a definite if you want smooth feet.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t seem to really cut into your callousness</li>
            <li> This works very well.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> I really like this unit.</li>
            <li> - it was basically a stainless steel grater.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t imagine anyone investing in this if their calluses aren&#x27;t a real issue.</li>
            <li> My husband absolutely loves it ...</li>
            <li> Only criticism is I would have liked to see this come with some extra refills.</li>
            <li> Only advice is don&#x27;t try to remove calluses completely the first time, take it easy and make it a once per week routine.</li>
            <li> Includes coarse roller, which is much gentler than I imagined (bought super-coarse replacements before the original wore out).</li>
            <li> Better than any other type of unit I have used on my feet.</li>
            <li> I am using it every other day now and completely satisfied with how it works.</li>
            <li> had originally bought a Pedi-egg, but this surpasses it big time.</li>
            <li> This product is great, appears to have a fairly long battery life, is gentle on my feet -does not need heavy pressure.</li>
            <li> Also, make sure you stock up on batteries, I really file mine down</li>
            <li> I think the whole process took 5 minutes (10 minutes if you count the time it took me to hunt down the 2 AA batteries required) :)</li>
            <li> Considering the cost of regular pedicures - sometimes with an extra charge of up to $10 for callus removal - this device will most certainly save me time and money.</li>
            <li> After 3-4 weeks you&#x27;ll feel like you have new feet!</li>
            <li> I also purchased the Refill Rollers (Super Coarse)</li>
            <li> The roller is so coarse that it shreds callous quickly.  </li>
            <li> The only problem I have is that it burns through batteries so quickly.  </li>
            <li> I am going to try the super coarse rollers.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I think the replacement roller is too high.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> All the dead skin just files right off in tremendous amounts.</li>
            <li> Live and learn.</li>
            <li> I absolutely live this</li>
            <li> The only way you can tell is if the remover isn&#x27;t removing as well as it did when you first bought it.</li>
            <li> I wish it had a power adapter to ensure proper voltage for consistent performance.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used the hand buffers and never come anywhere near the results of this foot buffer!</li>
            <li> Leaves your skin soft like a baby !&lt;</li>
            <li> Wow!</li>
            <li> It does take time to get down to a callus free zone</li>
            <li> One month of devout sanding (twice a day for the first two weeks and then once a day for the next two weeks) along with the application of a fanTATIC heel wax, that you can get on Amazon, and my heels are as soft as a baby&#x27;s bottom.  </li>
            <li> once a week or more to keep my rough skin under control but it has not eliminated my dry skin problem on my feet.</li>
            <li> got this from my wife so far she loves it.</li>
            <li> My feet are so soft after using.</li>
            <li> If you are using it often or have really calloused feet, then you will need to have extra rollers.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t work nearly as well as the infomercial.</li>
            <li> Leaves the heel soft.</li>
            <li> My feet are so soft.</li>
            <li> I use the second from the most heavy duty refills.</li>
            <li> Although the product works fairly well I have found that I have to use it a few times a week in order to keep my feet from feeling dry, cracked and rough.  </li>
            <li> My feet are not terrible just a little dry on the heels.</li>
            <li> What a cool little tool.</li>
            <li> Thanks for making a grey one for men...</li>
            <li> Every other day for about one week, I used the Emjoi foot buffer  until I had soft, pretty heals.</li>
            <li> I have had years of hard callouses that this removed easily.</li>
            <li> WOW, this thing takes away rough edges &amp; smooths amazingly fast</li>
            <li> The dry skin on the top of my big toe is completely gone after a few uses and hasn&#x27;t returned.</li>
            <li> Then slathered feet in a good body butter and put on some thick cotton socks for a few hours.</li>
            <li> Appears quality, and holding up fine, as I said I tried to press it so hard so that the motor stops as I read, and....  </li>
            <li> Since it&#x27;s battery powered the rotations almost cease if I press down more than slightly.  </li>
            <li> i general</li>
            <li> so I was always in flip flops or barefoot and seem to be prone to calluses so its a constant battle to keep my feet callus-free let alone soft even.</li>
            <li> It rubs the rollers and so far I haven&#x27;t seen any damage to the rollers or even the back bar</li>
            <li> Then I went to work, careful not to do too much.  </li>
            <li> And heel stays soft longer than with a regular manually handled callus remover.</li>
            <li> I go bare foot quite a lot.  </li>
            <li> I honestly didn&#x27;t think I had that much dead skin on my feet till I used this and saw all the white, dead skin falling from my feet.</li>
            <li> so if you want a less yucky color with a little more sophistication to it...</li>
            <li> Highly recommend for dry cracked heels.  </li>
            <li> She&#x27;s diabetic, so this is a much safer alternative than blade-type callus cutters and other scraper-type removers.</li>
            <li> Not rough on your feet but does create a lot of \\&quot;white dust\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> Removes the rough dry skin but is gentle and does not cut the skin.  </li>
            <li> Works fantastic, very small and nimble!</li>
            <li> This is a decent little gadget.</li>
            <li> ..had not pretty feet and now wow ... don&#x27;t hesitate to buy..</li>
            <li> I did not experience any problems with the roller being sensitive to pressure and thus turning off like some other reviewers have mentioned.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t push it down on your feet, just gently glide it over the rough areas.</li>
            <li> Batteries last a long time.  </li>
            <li> It is only sufficient for buffing or minor calluses.</li>
            <li> I suppose my only complaint would be that it is battery operated with a low powered motor that can stop easily when pressed again hard skin.</li>
            <li> Only thing is you use it on completely dry skin</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t wear sandals at all in public because of my dry, cracked, flaking heels.  </li>
            <li> Only use on DRY skin.</li>
            <li> You do have to remember to properly moisturize your feet after use (or you will be using it again in the same spots), but it has done wonders for my rough feet.</li>
            <li> The roller that comes on this one is very tough, I dont see it wearing out, its not paper with grit on it, its more of a hard substance that the skin sanding does not effect, so far!  </li>
            <li> does not have enough power to do what it is supposed to do, I do not not have rough feet</li>
            <li> I am using the refill that came with the pedi man which is a grey colour.</li>
            <li> I soaked my feet, pumiced and dried completely.</li>
            <li> Wish I had this a long time ago.  </li>
            <li> This thing really does less than an heavy duty nail filer would.</li>
            <li> But,  even though i am female,  I wouldn&#x27;t have wanted anything less coarse.  </li>
            <li> It is true what other reviews say that if you press down too hard, the roller stops.</li>
            <li> I get dry skin on my feet and this takes it away.</li>
            <li> Got this for my bf who had dry flaky heels.</li>
            <li> but they get dry and bought this for those days when feet are dry</li>
            <li> It smoothes dry cracked heels in seconds.  </li>
            <li> Ordered one for my sister at Christmas as she&#x27;s always had dry heels.</li>
            <li> Takes all dry skin off .</li>
            <li> I have one foot that always looks dry and is peeling.  </li>
            <li> Once you file away the dry skin</li>
            <li> For a old man&#x27;s heavy callus foot I needed to use it three time and be careful not to over do it.</li>
            <li> I was expecting a miracle product that would remove a complete layer of dead skin, this just seemed to buff my skin very lightly not really remove anything...</li>
            <li> Tough and very well made!</li>
            <li> Not powerful enough</li>
            <li> It will take it down past the dry skin, into the live skin.</li>
            <li> Would recommend to anyone with very dry heels.</li>
            <li> With all that time spent barefoot, I tend to have really rough, dry, cracked feet.</li>
            <li> There was a pile of white dust (dead, dry skin that was removed) on the floor after using it.</li>
            <li> I finally went looking for a solution and settled on this little callus remover.</li>
            <li> Not strong or durable enough for someone with cracked and dry feet.</li>
            <li> I also use it on my husband who has some really bad spots and it works ok-</li>
            <li> The only thing wrong with it is if you put to much pressure on it it stops spinning</li>
            <li> If you have rough feet</li>
            <li> I use it all the time, as my heels get so rough.</li>
            <li> Just glide it over the rough spots.</li>
            <li> I use to have callus&#x27; and rough cracked heels - did you catch that - USE</li>
            <li> so you have to keep buffering a few times a month, but there is instant feeling results after every use.</li>
            <li> Item arrived as expected.</li>
            <li> This works like a charm and takes care of the rough built up callouses my husband has on his feet.</li>
            <li> Suggest not overdoing, especially if you have deep cracks or thick calluses.</li>
            <li> The cheaper models and other brands do not have that annoyance.</li>
            <li> Pretty useless for my crusty man</li>
            <li> The batteries don&#x27;t last all that long though and it loses power as the batteries wear down.</li>
            <li> It does the stated job of removing dead, dry skin on the feet.  </li>
            <li> I just suggest you buy replacement barrels with your purchase because if you use it daily or every other day, or even every 3 days, they dull after a month.</li>
            <li> I keep hoping my feet will get get a little rough and chafed each week</li>
            <li> so your other half can use it as well.</li>
            <li> Personally, my only complaint is that I wish it would come with a battery dying led.</li>
            <li> However, as a result, I have icky calluses on my big toe and heels.</li>
            <li> Well, I took a risk, some said the motor was not powerful and stopped when pressed on the skin?  </li>
            <li> I am kicking myself that I didn&#x27;t spend the money to buy the corded unit,  or at least a bigger battery operated unit.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t apply pressure it slows it down.</li>
            <li> I placed a black towel under my feet as I buffed my feet and couldn&#x27;t believe what I was seeing.</li>
            <li> a sickly pink or worse puke pastel blue.</li>
            <li> When you apply a slight amount of pressure to touch the buffer roller to your foot, it stops.</li>
            <li> It makes a bit of a mess, but that just shows you it is working.</li>
            <li> I got a little carried away...</li>
            <li> This one does get rid of calloused skin on the feet, and it doesn&#x27;t shut off when you apply a little pressure.</li>
            <li> Never thought this little tool would work so well.  </li>
            <li> I purchased the green replacement pads (coarsest) to aid in this task</li>
            <li> It did remove the dead tissue but it was just the time factor that got me.</li>
            <li> but you should get a few replacement rollers with it</li>
            <li> This works but you need to use it a few times during the week.  </li>
            <li> I was worried it might be too harsh but it is not.  </li>
            <li> I use it a bit everyday.</li>
            <li> Within a few weeks had everything under control.</li>
            <li> , wasted money.</li>
            <li> So I got this and a few roller refills.</li>
            <li> Not really effective for thick caluses, but now that I&#x27;ve taken care of it this definitely helps with keeping them away.</li>
            <li> I feel the bar slow down after just a few minutes of use.  </li>
            <li> Unlike the usual file, this takes little effort.  </li>
            <li> Cannot believe how well this little buffer works!</li>
            <li> I had high hopes based on other reviews but am now sadly disappointed.</li>
            <li> Like having a small portable shaver, just need a piece of paper to hold underneath to collect the powdered skin flakes.</li>
            <li> Again, I use it heavily!</li>
            <li> But the overall effectiveness is mediocre.</li>
            <li> Then I read a review of the Emjoi Micro-Pedi that described it as a small belt sander for your feet.  </li>
            <li> No more torn socks; torn sheet;</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure why this is considered a product for men,  except maybe the not-pink color and the coarseness of the roller included.  </li>
            <li> In the past (meaning as soon as i started using this) I have used the egg shaped callus remover and others - no more.  </li>
            <li> No more pedicures because this does the job.  </li>
            <li> No more.  </li>
            <li> The refills are a bit expensive, and that would be the only negative.</li>
            <li> you don&#x27;t need to press hard..</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a bit hard to tell when you need the change the batteries.</li>
            <li> It was embarrassing and sometimes uncomfortable as my heels felt like rough sandpaper and snagged on socks.</li>
            <li> No more scratchy heels!  </li>
            <li> If you have tough, used feet like mine, this is the one for you.</li>
            <li> It requires a very delicate touch and then just polishes the skin rather than removing the tough skin.</li>
            <li> Otherwise this model is identical to the womens UGLY PINK version</li>
            <li> Why do we do such stupid things?</li>
            <li> I hate to wear shoes and avoid it whenever possible.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s a POOR DESIGN.</li>
            <li> My feet have decreased in age by 40 years.  </li>
            <li> Not happy with this product at all.</li>
            <li> It was disappointing to say the least.</li>
            <li> Depending on how bad your heels are it may take a few sessions.</li>
            <li> Works well if calluses and dried skin aren&#x27;t too bad.</li>
            <li> She has some of the worst hard calluses and rough feet</li>
            <li> It has a very weak Moyer.</li>
            <li> Smoothed out my terrible calluses in only two sessions</li>
            <li> You won&#x27;t be sorry you bought this thing.</li>
            <li> I am very disappointed in this callus remover as it stops working when hardly any pressure is applied to the callus.</li>
            <li> To bad they put the word &amp;#34;man&amp;#34; in the name.</li>
            <li> I went man grade because that is how bad my feet were.  </li>
            <li> and it was so bad</li>
            <li> If you have really bad feet</li>
            <li> I had seriously ugly calluses on my heels.  </li>
            <li> So disappointed 😔</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have very bad callouses</li>
            <li> My husband has the worst heels I&#x27;ve ever seen.</li>
            <li> I also tried to use it to remove a skin tag, of course, this was a very stupid thing to do.</li>
            <li> My massage therapist told me my foot calluses were the worst she has ever seen.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Incredible..had not pretty feet and now wow ... don&#x27;t hesitate to buy.. you don&#x27;t need to press hard.. It works</li>
            <li> What a cool little tool. I get dry skin on my feet and this takes it away. Thanks for making a grey one for men...lol. Effective, compact, not girly looking. I love it.</li>
            <li> Better than any other type of unit I have used on my feet. For a old man&#x27;s heavy callus foot I needed to use it three time and be careful not to over do it.</li>
            <li> The concept of this item is fantastic. The reality of how this item functions ... not so fantastic. I grew up swimming competitively so I was always in flip flops or barefoot and seem to be prone to calluses so its a constant battle to keep my feet callus-free let alone soft even. I had high hopes based on other reviews but am now sadly disappointed. Technically it will work on stubborn calluses if you have about an hour of your time you can donate to this task. I purchased the green replacement pads (coarsest) to aid in this task but I honestly don&#x27;t think it mattered. It is true what other reviews say that if you press down too hard, the roller stops. It did remove the dead tissue but it was just the time factor that got me. In all honesty I could&#x27;ve used a Ped Egg &amp; been done in 5 minutes but it was the concept that kept me hopeful. I think my best bet is to get a professional pedicure &amp; then use this product for callus &amp;#34;maintenance&amp;#34; before the calluses have a chance to get out of hand again.</li>
            <li> they make the best in the market</li>
            <li> Does exactly what it should. Not rough on your feet but does create a lot of \\&quot;white dust\\&quot;. Have something under your feet to catch the residue.  I love it. When using at night, I use petroleum jelly afterwards, add socks and sleep in them; perfect!</li>
            <li> I love this product.  After years of scrubbing away dead skin on my heels with a pedi-egg, I have found a much easier way.  This product works very good.  After one use, my feet are as smooth as a baby&#x27;s butt.  My Mom has a birthday in January and I am purchasing one for her.  I am super happy with this purchase.</li>
            <li> I got this for Christmas and I love it. It works great for my dry feet, makes them feel like silk.</li>
            <li> I love it.  It really works well and is not abrasive to skin at all.</li>
            <li> Awesome!!! To bad they put the word &amp;#34;man&amp;#34; in the name. Many women who have terribly dry feet might be thrown off from buying. I am so glad I read a review saying that it was much more powerful than the regular. You just need to go easy. It will take it down past the dry skin, into the live skin. Then it will be very tender. It really does the job.</li>
            <li> Works great but you should get a few replacement rollers with it so your other half can use it as well.</li>
            <li> Nice little gizmo.  I&#x27;m using it to trim back my over-callused fingertips (guitar player), and it works just fine for that purpose.</li>
            <li> Not really effective for thick caluses, but now that I&#x27;ve taken care of it this definitely helps with keeping them away.</li>
            <li> Gerat item. I bought it for my wife for Christmas and had to buy additional roller because I use it too:-).  If you have rough feet this is a must. much more convenient than the wired versions.</li>
            <li> Purchased for my husband. Works as described, very impressed. Only criticism is I would have liked to see this come with some extra refills.</li>
            <li> got this from my wife so far she loves it.</li>
            <li> Works well ..happy with purchase</li>
            <li> This item works great. My husband has the worst heels I&#x27;ve ever seen. Really helped him.</li>
            <li> Amazing!!!! Love it!!</li>
            <li> WORKED GREAT ON MY FEET, EASY TO USE</li>
            <li> My wife and I LOVE these things. Personally, my only complaint is that I wish it would come with a battery dying led. It&#x27;s a bit hard to tell when you need the change the batteries. The only way you can tell is if the remover isn&#x27;t removing as well as it did when you first bought it.</li>
            <li> Works as promised!!!  Love item, would definitely recommend.</li>
            <li> Got this for my bf who had dry flaky heels. After only one use (couple of minutes each foot) his feet were so smooth you could run something silky over them without snagging. It&#x27;s pretty powerful and not painful at all. Much better and faster alternative to using foot peeling masks. Only thing is you use it on completely dry skin so it creates a lot of &amp;#34;dust.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> This buffer performs as advertised and am pleased with this purchase and recommend it to others.  It leaves your feet nice and smooth with minimal effort.</li>
            <li> Sure wish I knew about this earlier.  I may have to purchase for gifts</li>
            <li> Great product. Worked fine. Just what I needed.</li>
            <li> This is AMAZING!  My feet feel instantly smooth.  The problem spots instantly gone.</li>
            <li> Bought one for me, then 2 more as gifts. Works perfectly.  Includes coarse roller, which is much gentler than I imagined (bought super-coarse replacements before the original wore out). Batteries seem to last forever. Like having a small portable shaver, just need a piece of paper to hold underneath to collect the powdered skin flakes.</li>
            <li> I hate to wear shoes and avoid it whenever possible. With all that time spent barefoot, I tend to have really rough, dry, cracked feet. Yuck. Fed up with it I finally went looking for a solution and settled on this little callus remover. I worried that it wouldn&#x27;t have enough power, since it just runs on batteries, but it has plenty of oomph. Smoothed out my terrible calluses in only two sessions and I love how smooth my feet are now. Definitely worth the money.</li>
            <li> This smoothes rough heels better than the fancy Pedisonic one I just got rid of. I give it 4 stars because the removed skin gets caught between the roller &amp; the device. I use canned air to blow it clean.</li>
            <li> Not enough power for a man&#x27;s heel.</li>
            <li> This callus remover has worked wonders for my feet. It&#x27;s easy to use, but more importantly, it does work.  Don&#x27;t push it down on your feet, just gently glide it over the rough areas.</li>
            <li> does not have enough power to do what it is supposed to do, I do not not have rough feet but they get dry and bought this for those days when feet are dry but i would rather buy those hand pumice stones instead I  would not buy again.</li>
            <li> Does what it says. I have had years of hard callouses that this removed easily. I suppose my only complaint would be that it is battery operated with a low powered motor that can stop easily when pressed again hard skin. Otherwise a welcome investment.</li>
            <li> purchased this for my husband for Christmas and he loves it and of course I use it also.  The pads are not too course.  It all depends on the amount of pressure you apply while using it</li>
            <li> Love this - my heels have never been softer!!</li>
            <li> Gave this as a guy gift.  It was perfect, he loves it.</li>
            <li> I LOVE this. I&#x27;m a barefoot baby. If I could go barefoot all the time I would. However, as a result, I have icky calluses on my big toe and heels. I read the reviews on the lady version vs the man&#x27;s version and I&#x27;m so glad I went with the man. It&#x27;s a much coarser file which is exactly what I needed. All the dead skin just files right off in tremendous amounts. If you have tough, used feet like mine, this is the one for you. My feet are so soft after using. I just suggest you buy replacement barrels with your purchase because if you use it daily or every other day, or even every 3 days, they dull after a month. Again, I use it heavily! Also, make sure you stock up on batteries, I really file mine down so I go through batteries often. It&#x27;s a very durable product and definitely does the job more so than a spa pedi and for free! My husband and brother uses it on their hands and my elderly mother loves it too! She has some of the worst hard calluses and rough feet I&#x27;ve seen and it makes her feet look and feel TONS better!</li>
            <li> Great, speedy accurate service! Super happy customer!!!</li>
            <li> Bought this from my son who is a sales manager, and gets callouses on his heels.  He used it once and found a tremendous improvement!  Very easy to  use!  I also purchased the Refill Rollers (Super Coarse)</li>
            <li> L.ove it, came real quick!</li>
            <li> Great on my callused big toes. Buffs them quite nicely as well as on my heels.</li>
            <li> For a tool that runs on two penlight batteries it delivers a surprising amount of power.  The roller is so coarse that it shreds callous quickly.  Great performance and a good value for the money.</li>
            <li> Wonderful easy way to get off dead skin on feet</li>
            <li> It does make the dead skin fly. Caution! Don&#x27;t get too aggressive with it. It will cause irritation if you do.</li>
            <li> I purchased this for my dad for Christmas. He loves it. He says it works great.</li>
            <li> Awesome, fun to use, and makes a lot of chalky dust!  Just don&#x27;t know why this &amp;#34;man&amp;#34; version had to cost so much more than the &amp;#34;lady&amp;#34; version.  They are the same device, with differing coloring and labelling.</li>
            <li> Works exactly as advertised. Smooths feet painlessly and effortlessly without schlepping to the nail salon and being embarrassed about scaley winter feet. Would buy again.</li>
            <li> Works well, and fast.</li>
            <li> This tool is amazing.  It helps my feet feel smooth and clean.  The only problem I have is that it burns through batteries so quickly.  I feel the bar slow down after just a few minutes of use.  I wish it had a power adapter to ensure proper voltage for consistent performance.</li>
            <li> The only thing I&#x27;ve found that works on my feet; the first few time i used it I was so impressed with how it works I got a little carried away... Only advice is don&#x27;t try to remove calluses completely the first time, take it easy and make it a once per week routine. After 3-4 weeks you&#x27;ll feel like you have new feet!</li>
            <li> I found the New Powerful Nano Micro Pedi Foot Buffer by Emjoi did the job I was hoping for.&lt;br /&gt;Left my feet nice and smooth.</li>
            <li> enough said.  Be prepared to buy refills, but they work perfectly.  You can find them inexpensively but take the time to search.</li>
            <li> So far it is really good, got this for myself and feel its better because it is stronger, cost a little more but worth it</li>
            <li> Works fantastic, very small and nimble!</li>
            <li> I absolutely Love this product! It works as described. I would definitely recommend the micro pedi to family and friends.</li>
            <li> Work okay need to order rollers with coarsers roller will continue to use it and tell my friends and family</li>
            <li> Works like a charm.  Wish I had had one years ago.</li>
            <li> Great product.  Does the job, so glad I found you.  Would recommend.</li>
            <li> VERY good product, smoothed out my GFs heels and she is ecstatic I got it for her, will purchase one for myself, can&#x27;t comment on battery life at the moment though</li>
            <li> The Nano Micro-Pedi Foot Shaver/Buffer was ok.  It does the stated job of removing dead, dry skin on the feet.  But the overall effectiveness is mediocre.</li>
            <li> Life changing.  No more scratchy heels!  It smoothes dry cracked heels in seconds.  I&#x27;ve bought six of them for friends because they are so great!!</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t really work that well. It somewhat eased the calluses but not enough to avoid bi-weekly pedicures.</li>
            <li> Ok so.....this little gadget is GREAT! it&#x27;s does what it says it will do- I honestly didn&#x27;t think I had that much dead skin on my feet till I used this and saw all the white, dead skin falling from my feet. I placed a black towel under my feet as I buffed my feet and couldn&#x27;t believe what I was seeing. I suggest you buy the replacement rollers sold here on Amazon and keep batteries always on hand....I&#x27;m addicted to keeping my feet smooth. Also I suggest after using the buffer apply some nice foot lotion.....your feet will thank you.</li>
            <li> Like everything EXCEPT the back side of thes that hits the roller when in use and may eventually need to somehow trim it out to prevent that. It rubs the rollers and so far I haven&#x27;t seen any damage to the rollers or even the back bar but it&#x27;s a POOR DESIGN. Actually a BIG DESIGN FLAW. The cheaper models and other brands do not have that annoyance. Otherwise this model is identical to the womens UGLY PINK version so if you want a less yucky color with a little more sophistication to it...this one was my choice. The MAN does not mean it&#x27;s any more sturdy or stronger just a different color package ladies. And frankly a heck of a lot better than everything a sickly pink or worse puke pastel blue. Ok purple is over done too.</li>
            <li> I am very disappointed in this callus remover as it stops working when hardly any pressure is applied to the callus. It requires a very delicate touch and then just polishes the skin rather than removing the tough skin. I am using the refill that came with the pedi man which is a grey colour.</li>
            <li> Save your money does not do anything. Not powerful enough</li>
            <li> Works as advertised, a needed product.</li>
            <li> This foot buffer works great for me. Don&#x27;t buy the Pedi Spin thing you see advertised on TV. I was sent 3 different ones, all of which didn&#x27;t even start up. I threw them away. This one does get rid of calloused skin on the feet, and it doesn&#x27;t shut off when you apply a little pressure. I purchased the extra coarse replacement rollers to try when the current one wears out.</li>
            <li> Worked well for me. If you are using it often or have really calloused feet, then you will need to have extra rollers. Battery life is good, but I guess that depends on the batteries. Will upgrade to electric model in the future but this is great to try out the system.</li>
            <li> first time using this pedi , it worked great use lotion afterwards , wife said feet feel great , she no longer calls me sand paper feet . I use it once a month with  lotion and its great</li>
            <li> Cannot believe how well this little buffer works! I&#x27;ve used the hand buffers and never come anywhere near the results of this foot buffer! After reading reviews of this one and a newer more expensive foot buffer, I ordered this one. From the first use I was impressed! Used regularly, the balls of my feet and heels are so smooth! I do use foot lotion at night. Ordered one for my sister at Christmas as she&#x27;s always had dry heels. She was amazed and is still talking about this buffer!  We&#x27;re both looking forward to sandal season!</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t think i would like it at first, but it ended up being a pretty nifty piece of equipment.&lt;br /&gt;The results after each use are amazing!</li>
            <li> Gift for my son, he loves it.</li>
            <li> After trying Emoj Micro-Pedi Man with coarsest roller for over a month, I can honestly say that no pedi-roller can compete with old fashioned blade on the handle.</li>
            <li> I had seriously ugly calluses on my heels.  I wouldn&#x27;t wear sandals at all in public because of my dry, cracked, flaking heels.  Then I read a review of the Emjoi Micro-Pedi that described it as a small belt sander for your feet.  A lightbulb clicked on in my brain and I bought the Micro-Pedi.  One month of devout sanding (twice a day for the first two weeks and then once a day for the next two weeks) along with the application of a fanTATIC heel wax, that you can get on Amazon, and my heels are as soft as a baby&#x27;s bottom.  I am so pleased with this product that I&#x27;ve told all my skanky-heeled brothers about it.  No more torn socks; torn sheet; sticking to carpet like hook and pile tape; or sparking fires walking barefoot on the sidewalk.  I&#x27;m going shopping for my first pair of sandals in a decade!</li>
            <li> Works like described.</li>
            <li> Takes a while to get, but I love it</li>
            <li> I bought this for my &#x27;Arizona&#x27; flip flop wearing feet!  I am a 60+ woman and my feet have never looked this good. :D  I am ALWAYS barefoot. Best purchase I have ever made regarding foot care!  HUGE thumbs up!!!</li>
            <li> OMG I bought this callus remover.  I went man grade because that is how bad my feet were.  Well, once you start, you cannot stop.  I woke up feeling like someone else had their feet in bed with me.  My feet have decreased in age by 40 years.  Unlike the usual file, this takes little effort.  It does take time to get down to a callus free zone but once you start you cannot stop.  The one I bought is battery operated.  You can get corded options for more money. You can also buy extra rollers. I cannot believe how soft and smooth my feet are now.  It is better than what they accomplish with a pedicure.</li>
            <li> Comfortable To hold. Gets the job done.</li>
            <li> actually works just eats batteries</li>
            <li> So far this is working great. You do have to remember to properly moisturize your feet after use (or you will be using it again in the same spots), but it has done wonders for my rough feet.</li>
            <li> This works great but need to buy heavier stronger roller.. Takes all dry skin off .</li>
            <li> Works well enough for the price.</li>
            <li> This works but you need to use it a few times during the week.  You won&#x27;t get your heels smooth on one try unless you have normal feet.  I get cracked heels so this is good but use often.  I am going to try the super coarse rollers.</li>
            <li> wish it was more powerful</li>
            <li> Never thought this little tool would work so well.  Well worth the price and more.  My feet are smooth as silk.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t work nearly as well as the infomercial. I was expecting a miracle product that would remove a complete layer of dead skin, this just seemed to buff my skin very lightly not really remove anything...It was disappointing to say the least. When you apply a slight amount of pressure to touch the buffer roller to your foot, it stops. Ineffective.</li>
            <li> I have dealt with cracked heels all my life.  I have tried every lotion and nothing works.  I got this buffer and wasn&#x27;t sure what to expect. But it turns out it is like magic.  My feet get completely smooth and soft after using it.  I am using it every other day now and completely satisfied with how it works.</li>
            <li> So much easier than manually exfoliating!  I was worried it might be too harsh but it is not.  Easy to use, fast, easy to clean, effective.  Would recommend to anyone with very dry heels.</li>
            <li> This thing really does less than an heavy duty nail filer would. I use the second from the most heavy duty refills. Still no bueno. It doesn&#x27;t even let you out pressure on it or it will stop spinning. Pretty useless for my crusty man feet</li>
            <li> ok nothing exceptional</li>
            <li> LOVE, LOVE, LOVE this little tool....so do all the folks I have passed it on too,</li>
            <li> Excellent, highly recommend !</li>
            <li> Highly recommend. So light and easy to use. Suggest not overdoing, especially if you have deep cracks or thick calluses. I soaked my feet, pumiced and dried completely. Then I went to work, careful not to do too much.  Then slathered feet in a good body butter and put on some thick cotton socks for a few hours. Every other day for about one week, I used the Emjoi foot buffer  until I had soft, pretty heals. When you do overuse in one sitting, you experience tender spots when walking. I am so happy with this product.</li>
            <li> Same as the women&#x27;s but more expensive, why?</li>
            <li> Love this buffer. I use it all the time, as my heels get so rough. It is great to use in between pedicures.</li>
            <li> Quite an enjoyable and efficient device to use. I love it!</li>
            <li> Really works well.  There was a pile of white dust (dead, dry skin that was removed) on the floor after using it.</li>
            <li> Works great and so easy!!  My heels have never looked better.  I choose this one because it had a course roller and I&#x27;m glad I did.  No problems with applying pressure.</li>
            <li> Leaves your skin soft like a baby !&lt;br /&gt;Fast as lightning and very easy to use at home or away !&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended !</li>
            <li> It takes awhile to remove the callouses, but it does the trick. I also tried to use it to remove a skin tag, of course, this was a very stupid thing to do. Please only use it per the instructions. Why do we do such stupid things? Live and learn.</li>
            <li> My friend loved mine so much that I bought her this for Christmas.  Inadvertently ordered this cordless model instead of the corded one that I have.  She&#x27;s diabetic, so this is a much safer alternative than blade-type callus cutters and other scraper-type removers.</li>
            <li> Both my husband and I need to buff off calluses that can cause foot pain, and this works just as described.  Very useful.</li>
            <li> This  really works.  Really.  Don&#x27;t get the rechargeable. I tried that and sent it back. This is better. Batteries last a long time.  Don&#x27;t apply pressure it slows it down. Just glide it over the rough spots. Only use on DRY skin. Important.  Make sure your feet are dry.  When finished put on some lotion and cotton socks (overnight if you can)  Magic!  Depending on how bad your heels are it may take a few sessions. After that occasional&lt;br /&gt;Maintenance.  You won&#x27;t be sorry you bought this thing.</li>
            <li> Love these.  This was for my husband who enjoys using it.</li>
            <li> I bought the Emjoi Micro-Pedi for men after reading 1/2 dozen reviews of pedi devices. Read the mens device (this one) was significantly better, and that it out performs the new Clarisonic pedi device. I can honestly say the reviews are right on the money with this product. I liked it so much I ordered 3 more to give to my sisters and mother for Christmas! Amazing product!</li>
            <li> Believe it or not, this actually works as described. My wife LOVES it!</li>
            <li> Wow! It does what it says. Easy to use and does a fantastic job of removing dry cracked heels.&lt;br /&gt;I had originally bought a Pedi-egg, but this surpasses it big time.</li>
            <li> Good product but batteries die too soon</li>
            <li> Gift for Hubby!  He&#x27;s very pleased with it!</li>
            <li> Satisfactory.  Excellent upkeep after a professional pedicure.</li>
            <li> When I purchased this product I think I had in mind that it would work like a belt sander :)  I was ready for my feet to feel like shiny, smooth satin.  That is sadly not the case.  Although the product works fairly well I have found that I have to use it a few times a week in order to keep my feet from feeling dry, cracked and rough.  I wouldn&#x27;t purchase this product again since I&#x27;ve found that good old fashion elbow grease works better.</li>
            <li> This was a gift for my wife &amp; she is very pleased.</li>
            <li> It has a very weak Moyer.Not happy with this product at all.</li>
            <li> this thing actually works. It&#x27;s awesome!!</li>
            <li> Well, I took a risk, some said the motor was not powerful and stopped when pressed on the skin?  They need a drill with a brush then.  It took a lot to make it stop spinning, an unreasonable amount as it was sanding.  Now on the cracked heals it does like a layer of skin (white powder falling shows it is working, but slower- just repeat it.  The roller that comes on this one is very tough, I dont see it wearing out, its not paper with grit on it, its more of a hard substance that the skin sanding does not effect, so far!  I used it, wife used it, my 27 year old son used it, and it still works fine, even the batteries!  Appears quality, and holding up fine, as I said I tried to press it so hard so that the motor stops as I read, and....  I cant find fault with it.</li>
            <li> Needed for calouses on big toes...really works great, fast, no pain.....made a bit heavier for a guys tougher skin...Very pleased.</li>
            <li> awesome product; wish I had purchased it in May!</li>
            <li> I have been trying to get rid of some rather large calluses that are caused by wearing work boots all day. I thought I would give this a try. I use it a bit everyday. Within a few weeks had everything under control.</li>
            <li> I love love love it!  This really works.  I have one foot that always looks dry and is peeling.  Problem is gone.  Once you file away the dry skin it&#x27;s easier for your skin to absorb moisturizer.</li>
            <li> I really like this foot buffer.  It really keeps my heels nice and soft after putting some lotion on.</li>
            <li> Works easily. Leaves the heel soft. And heel stays soft longer than with a regular manually handled callus remover.</li>
            <li> It does a ok job. I would spend the money a get a electric 1</li>
            <li> wife loves it . gave several as gifts and they were well received .</li>
            <li> I got this for my husband who has chronic heel splits.  This has been a lifesaver! I no longer need to coordinate visits to the podiatrist!  Highly recommend for dry cracked heels.  I&#x27;ll be getting replacement roller things...</li>
            <li> My feet have never been smoother, it goes through batteries quick so but rechargeable batteries too or a plug in type.</li>
            <li> This product is great. I had just bought another brand and it was so bad, wasted money. Not this one! It actually works, even if this is powered by battery.</li>
            <li> Works very good just as I was expecting.</li>
            <li> Greatest way to get rid of callouses. Saves me hundred in $$ at the nail Salon. Try it you will love it.</li>
            <li> AGAIN BEST ITEM CREATED. GIVING AS A PRESENT</li>
            <li> WOW, this thing takes away rough edges &amp; smooths amazingly fast</li>
            <li> This is the best little gadget I own love it and it makes my heels so smooth</li>
            <li> Works well if calluses and dried skin aren&#x27;t too bad. I was expecting more power.</li>
            <li> The only thing wrong with it is if you put to much pressure on it it stops spinning</li>
            <li> My wife bought this to use on her feet. She loves it. Tough and very well made!</li>
            <li> Great little gadget to have!</li>
            <li> So discouraging! Not strong or durable enough for someone with cracked and dry feet. Misleading. You will need a roller for every time you use it! After this price, I&#x27;d expect to get something WAY more powerful and higher quality. So disappointed 😔</li>
            <li> So far, I am impressed. Since I just got this yesterday, I cannot yet comment on the durability. The buffer is very easy to use...I did not need to apply any pressure, just moved it over my feet from section to section, and it did a terrific job. I think the whole process took 5 minutes (10 minutes if you count the time it took me to hunt down the 2 AA batteries required) :) Do keep in mind that you will have to provide your own batteries, so have them ready if you would like to use this the minute it arrives. Considering the cost of regular pedicures - sometimes with an extra charge of up to $10 for callus removal - this device will most certainly save me time and money.</li>
            <li> This little machine is AWESOME! I bought the &amp;#34;man&#x27;s&amp;#34; version because I figured it might pack more power than what they give us women. I have been using a foot paddle for years and getting good results, but this takes all the work out of it. It does an amazing job and I love, love, love it! I keep hoping my feet will get get a little rough and chafed each week so I can use it more often, but they stay smooth as a baby&#x27;s butt.</li>
            <li> Excellent product.  Functions exactly as described in the product description.</li>
            <li> This product did a fairly good job removing my heel calluses,  but it just needs more power to be completely effective.  Since it&#x27;s battery powered the rotations almost cease if I press down more than slightly.  I am kicking myself that I didn&#x27;t spend the money to buy the corded unit,  or at least a bigger battery operated unit.  I&#x27;m not sure why this is considered a product for men,  except maybe the not-pink color and the coarseness of the roller included.  But,  even though i am female,  I wouldn&#x27;t have wanted anything less coarse.  This unit will serve me best when I travel as it&#x27;s lightweight and small (about the size of my palm).  I&#x27;m still considering a more powerful version for home.</li>
            <li> This is an excellent way to remove callouses from your feet.  The refills are a bit expensive, and that would be the only negative.</li>
            <li> Does a goid job&lt;br /&gt;Especially for a senior</li>
            <li> OMG! In the past (meaning as soon as i started using this) I have used the egg shaped callus remover and others - no more.  Read all the reviews and articles on powered callus removers and gave this one a try.  I use to have callus&#x27; and rough cracked heels - did you catch that - USE TO.  This product is great, appears to have a fairly long battery life, is gentle on my feet -does not need heavy pressure. This is a definite if you want smooth feet.</li>
            <li> Did not work at all on my hubby&#x27;s callused feet.</li>
            <li> Not as powerful as advertised but I&#x27;ll keep it, it does work but be prepared to go over and over the same area to get any effect.</li>
            <li> Wish I had this a long time ago.  So much more comfortable and convenient than a pumice or metal foot scrubber.  Love it.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my Dad. He loves it because its easy to use and exfoliates very well.</li>
            <li> Awesome item.  Love it.  I don&#x27;t care if its for men.  This works better than the one for women.</li>
            <li> Great product just wish I would have bought an electric one. I know it&#x27;s for men but being a woman with rough feet, this is wonderful. Would recommend and when you order buy a refill on the rollers. I have used mine all summer and just replaced the roller for the first time.</li>
            <li> Works awesome no more dry skin on my feet</li>
            <li> Love this thing, I bought the toughest grain sanding attachments. It doesn&#x27;t seem to really cut into your callousness so you have to keep buffering a few times a month, but there is instant feeling results after every use. My feet are so soft.</li>
            <li> This is a Christmas present, but I own one and cannot live without it. The very best for keeping feet soft and callous free.</li>
            <li> This works very well.  Removes the rough dry skin but is gentle and does not cut the skin.  I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> I absolutely live this and it is well worth the money.  No more pedicures because this does the job.  I go bare foot quite a lot.  I was having a pedicure every two weeks.  No more.  Well worth the money, but I think the replacement roller is too high.  They may want to reconsider the price.</li>
            <li> I really like this unit. I was using a paddle type - it was basically a stainless steel grater. I like this more. I think you get better control with it and there is no need to buff afterward. The batteries don&#x27;t last all that long though and it loses power as the batteries wear down. I didn&#x27;t want the electric one because I like to use it outside when weather permits. The electric is limiting in that way. Put a towel or paper towel under your foot when you use it. It makes a bit of a mess, but that just shows you it is working. I don&#x27;t have very bad callouses but I can&#x27;t see how anyone uses the purple roller it comes with. It is only sufficient for buffing or minor calluses. I can&#x27;t imagine anyone investing in this if their calluses aren&#x27;t a real issue. I bought the courser  rollers and I am happy with them.</li>
            <li> a true must if you like to get close-up and cuddly</li>
            <li> This is a decent little gadget.My feet are not terrible just a little dry on the heels. This works well for this and will help me manage my foot care during winter months when I dont do as many pedis. I also use it on my husband who has some really bad spots and it works ok- have to do a lot of mini sessions at first. If you have really bad feet i general I dont think this will work for you.</li>
            <li> This is by far the best callus remover I have ever tried.  Easy to use, fast and smooth.  I am a pharmacist and will be recommending it to all who ask !!</li>
            <li> My husband is very pleased ,works great</li>
            <li> Very good product for price.</li>
            <li> Use this for my Crossfit calluses on my hands, works wonders</li>
            <li> My husband absolutely loves it ...</li>
            <li> This is one of the best personal care products. It changes my life, I have baby feet again. Of course,putting on lotion is nessecery.I will recommend it to my friends!&lt;br /&gt;People complains about the power. I disagree. Consider safty issue,  it is powerful but also worry and damage free.</li>
            <li> Item arrived as expected. Solved several problems. Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> My massage therapist told me my foot calluses were the worst she has ever seen. That made an impression on me that I should take care of them and that&#x27;s what this awesome Emjoi did with just 3 quick treatments! My calluses have been an issue for me for 7 years. It was embarrassing and sometimes uncomfortable as my heels felt like rough sandpaper and snagged on socks. Now, I&#x27;m amazed that they feel soft and look so much better. I would estimate that 80% of my callused skin is now gone. I have only used the remover 3 times for about 3 minutes each time. My feet have significantly improved. I still have some deep cracks, but they are now smooth and I am confident that this remover will continue progress on them . I did not experience any problems with the roller being sensitive to pressure and thus turning off like some other reviewers have mentioned. I am so excited that this remover really works!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: AFTER 10 MONTHS:&lt;br /&gt;I still love it! Only one caution, it is NOT a miracle worker. I still have to faithfully use it (plus foot cream) once a week or more to keep my rough skin under control but it has not eliminated my dry skin problem on my feet. It has improved my problem, but not solved it as I still have issues with dry/cracking skin and calluses. Regardless, I would still rate it an 8 out of 10. My feet are smoother to the touch when I use this remover. The dry skin on the top of my big toe is completely gone after a few uses and hasn&#x27;t returned. The device is still as powerful as the day I first used it. I have had to change the batteries only 3 times in 10 months and have used about 6 refill rollers with very regular usage.</li>
            <li> Excellent product for my purpose.  No discomfort and eliminates the callous as it says it will.</li>
            <li> Great machine for your feet&#x27;s</li>
            <li> I got one of these for my husband (and me) after I priced the more expensive one they are currently touting on TV (Amoped? spelling). They wanted over $50 for it at CVS. So I turned to Amazon and not only found it cheaper, but another version that was a lot more inexpensive. So I got this and a few roller refills. Got them both in about a week. This works like a charm and takes care of the rough built up callouses my husband has on his feet. It is also great for my heels. I&#x27;m very happy with this purchase.</li>
