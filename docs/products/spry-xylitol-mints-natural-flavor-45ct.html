    <ol>
            <li>Great mint!</li>
            <li>I would repurchase these as I need to use xylitol items and these are perfect size, shape and flavor.</li>
            <li>Great Price!</li>
            <li>these are great!</li>
            <li>but they came in great time and as described.</li>
            <li>Xylitol is good for restoring your mouth&#x27;s ph after eating.  </li>
            <li>#34;too much of a good thing&amp;#34; with these mints.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Also, good for your teeth.</li>
            <li>It is great when you have a breath that needs refreshing.</li>
            <li>This is a good handy item.</li>
            <li>and it is fine - but not these mints!</li>
            <li>The peppermint tabs take care of the problem so that I don&#x27;t have to take more meds that make me sleepy.</li>
            <li>I love this gum and the company that makes it</li>
            <li>I switched permanently to these when altoid cancelled all my favorite mints.</li>
            <li>so kids love them too.</li>
            <li>So, enjoy them!</li>
            <li>hope this is helpful to you! :)</li>
            <li>I love this gum,i suggest it to all my friends</li>
            <li>What&#x27;s not to love? :)</li>
            <li>Love this.</li>
            <li>Love the taste and the packaging.</li>
            <li>These are great to have on hand, and way cheaper than our local health food store!  </li>
            <li>But enjoy a couple of them, maybe even 10 of them -</li>
            <li>I love Spry peppermints - work to keep fresh breath, fight cavities and a nontoxic sugar substitute.</li>
            <li>Fortunately I found a nearby store that carries it.</li>
            <li>My one complailnt is the cost of shipping, more than twice as much as the cost of the product!</li>
            <li>tastes great and LOVE this little holder for my Spry gum to take in my purse.  </li>
            <li>These are better and better for your teeth, flavor not as extreme</li>
            <li>Very minty and sugarless!  </li>
            <li>Makes it easy to carry in your purse or in the kids back packs.  </li>
            <li>Arrived fast and packaged well by sender.</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>When usps misplaced the delivery, they worked very hard to make sure I got them and was happy with my service.  </li>

            <li> I have some problems with nausea due to some of the meds I take.</li>
            <li> We buy the small tubes and refill them from our big spry bottle.  </li>

            <li> But I had these in the car, I was really hungry, and sitting in bad traffic.</li>
            <li> but a bunch is just not a good idea!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I had dry mouth really bad and my dental hygienist recommended any xylitol products.</li>

            <li> So, maybe I am an idiot... But I had these in the car, I was really hungry, and sitting in bad traffic. So somehow I managed to eat a bunch of them - and boy did my tummy rebel - I was in pain for a couple of hours. So, enjoy them! But enjoy a couple of them, maybe even 10 of them - but a bunch is just not a good idea!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other types of mints you can eat a ton in one sitting and it is fine - but not these mints! So please let my over-indulgence in these mints be a warning... There is such a thing as &amp;#34;too much of a good thing&amp;#34; with these mints.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hope this is helpful to you! :)</li>
            <li> I keep a supply of these in my purse and in the car.</li>
            <li> Very minty and sugarless!  Also, good for your teeth.</li>
            <li> I love this gum,i suggest it to all my friends</li>
            <li> Prescribed for my son by his dentist.  He enjoys this flavor. Great Price!</li>
            <li> I love Spry peppermints - work to keep fresh breath, fight cavities and a nontoxic sugar substitute. What&#x27;s not to love? :)</li>
            <li> I didnt like the taste but they came in great time and as described. Thanks</li>
            <li> tastes great and LOVE this little holder for my Spry gum to take in my purse.  I had Aspertame/Asuflame toxicity so I cannot chew other gums....these are great!</li>
            <li> It is great when you have a breath that needs refreshing. I had dry mouth really bad and my dental hygienist recommended any xylitol products. It helped 100%! I also like the tube that it comes in. It is as user-friendly as it can be for me. I have a physical disability with not very good control or coordination.</li>
            <li> Love this. Compact to carry in a purse. Arrived on time and is alot cheaper than the Health Store</li>
            <li> Love the taste and the packaging. My one complailnt is the cost of shipping, more than twice as much as the cost of the product! Fortunately I found a nearby store that carries it.</li>
