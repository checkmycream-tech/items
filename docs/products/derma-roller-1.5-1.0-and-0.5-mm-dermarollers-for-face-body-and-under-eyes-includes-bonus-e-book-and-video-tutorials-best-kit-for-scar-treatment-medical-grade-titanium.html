            <li>The 1.5mm and the 0.5mm comes in their own case and the 1.0 is in the case with the handle.</li>
            <li>I was offered a 3 In 1 Interchangeable Derma Roller Kit by Puruskin for my honest feedback and review.</li>
            <li>I jumped at the chance to try this for myself in the comfort of my own home avoiding the hundreds of dollars associated with it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve really liked the product</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t use a numbing gel and kind of wish I did.</li>
            <li>As a blogger I received a complementary sample of this product in exchange for my honest &amp; unbiased opinion.</li>
            <li>Great product and great early results.</li>
            <li>Very strong and sturdy.</li>
            <li>It’s a safe and effective way to treat your skin.  </li>
            <li>This is by far the most best product I&#x27;ve ever purchased.&lt;br /&gt;My</li>
            <li>It is becoming a popular spa treatment</li>
            <li>It made my face feel very smooth</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re interested in one, this is a great one to choose and definitely the best price!</li>
            <li>thighs, I did notice a huge difference there!</li>
            <li>Love this company.</li>
            <li>scar&#x27;s, cellulite reduction, stretch mark removal, anti aging, sun and age spot repair, wrinkle elimination, collagen stimulation, and a lot more.</li>
            <li>I have addressed most of my skin problems except my issue with my pores.</li>
            <li>Ok I&#x27;m not gonna lie</li>
            <li>I decided I would use the 1.5mm head because it covered more area.&lt;br /&gt;After rolling on my arm</li>
            <li>I love the Derma Roller and would recommend it to anyone!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Love it and have seen results.</li>
            <li>Furthermore, Rachel Ray is a cook and talk show host, a lovely person, but no expert.</li>
            <li>I attempted to use the .5mm dermaroller which is the same excellent quality as the 1.0mm except</li>
            <li>Another good analogy is when you see a tiller being rolled across freshly laid dirt and sod.</li>
            <li>The roller pokes a bunch of holes all over the soil to aerate the ground and make it more receptive to the seeds.</li>
            <li>My thighs took longer to heal (still healing in some spots), and I’m sure I probably didn’t do it correctly, but I wouldn’t do that again without numbing cream.</li>
            <li>It is intended to cover more surface without having to roll for a longer period of time, which is nice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>As an Aesthetician I viewed many videos and read many reviews before buying it.  </li>
            <li>and you feel better in the process.</li>
            <li>Seeing results that&#x27;s for sure.</li>
            <li>It’s oddly satisfying to use.</li>
            <li>I heard of Derma roller, but I wasn&#x27;t sure if I could tolerate the needles.</li>
            <li>I received the derma roller and am extremely pleased with the item.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used it once on my face &amp; noticed more taughtness &amp; plumpness already.</li>
            <li>mostly so I had time to see if there were results.  </li>
            <li>I love this thing.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m working up the courage to use the body roller on more parts...</li>
            <li>When it comes to derma rolling, so many people do it incorrectly</li>
            <li>Hints That Helped Me Achieve Better Results</li>
            <li>Good price and useful</li>
            <li>The dermaroller combined with a high quality pharmaceutical grade serum is a great tool to have available for my clients and to keep my own skin in the greatest condition possible.</li>
            <li>Quality is amazing and you can clean with rubbing alcohol.  </li>
            <li>You also use it to clean the head by filling it with rubbing alcohol and water and letting it sit, which is nice since I don&#x27;t need to get another container or something</li>
            <li>Its pretty good, no complaints.</li>
            <li>but this idea here makes me really excited!</li>
            <li>I am excited to see the results after 10 uses!  </li>
            <li>skin feels so smooth and more elastic</li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;Edges around my scars are beginning to be more smooth and even&lt;br</li>
            <li>The 1.0mm head has 600 titanium needles and is ideal for the majority of the facial area, it treats wrinkles and acne scars.  </li>
            <li>(it included a special cleaner!).</li>
            <li>There are many brands to choose from &amp; Puruskin is unique because they have change heads for the derma roller.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Watched several you-tube videos and many do not follow guide lines, me happy to follow PURUSKIN suggestions.</li>
            <li>Easy to use,</li>
            <li>They are easily interchangeable and are color coded to make it easy to remember which is which.  </li>
            <li>You also need to make sure your skin is cleansed and your hands are clean.</li>
            <li>Again I made sure the area was clean and the product was sanitized before use.</li>
            <li>I feel like I should give this a full month to see if it gets any better.</li>
            <li>The first thing I learned during my research was why and how derm-rolling is effective.</li>
            <li>✮ Fine Lines</li>
            <li>Delivery was quick and aids to learn more are offered...</li>
            <li>Whoever decided to come up with this approach was really thinking with the customer in mind not their wallet in mind &amp; I for one love it!</li>
            <li>using this product, I realized I&#x27;m a huge baby.  </li>
            <li>Additionally, my pores (which are traditionally huge) seemed to shrink to me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Additionally, my pores (which are traditionally huge) seemed to shrink to me.  </li>
            <li>You get detailed instructions and videos emailed to you</li>
            <li>enjoy the time for yourself....</li>
            <li>However, I don&#x27;t like how the container is open, so dust or something could still fly</li>
            <li>The 1.5mm head which has 1200 titanium needles is great for use on larger body areas, like legs, stomach, arms, etc.</li>
            <li>I have seen people use this larger head on stretch marks or scars with really great results.  </li>
            <li>I received this product for free for my unbiased review.</li>
            <li>This way products can be absorbed at a greater rate.  </li>
            <li>started on my arm first as a test run, and I made sure my skin was clean and free of any lotions.</li>
            <li>Completely satisfied ;)</li>
            <li>; initiative we&#x27;ll teach you exactly what to do so you can feel confident every step of the way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I am excited to&lt;br /&gt;see</li>
            <li>/&gt;In order to better compare my results, let me share with you exactly what my &amp;#34;problem areas&amp;#34; were and what I was looking to see as a result of using this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Opened the 1.0mm immediately and followed the instructions as I was excited to see results.</li>
            <li>I noticed first time a refreshing cooling of my head after the lotion which I never felt before.</li>
            <li>You will never get it clean</li>
            <li>Clean the head by soaking in alcohol for 5 minutes.</li>
            <li>Some say that your regular skincare is more effective after using the derma roller.</li>
            <li>They also included a special offer for their virgin Argan oil.</li>
            <li>but it was corrected right away!</li>
            <li>I use personally and believe will be good for others.</li>
            <li>I filled a freshly cleaned glass jar with 3 parts alcohol and1 part water, as suggested, and sterilized each piece for 30 minutes.</li>
            <li>Apply a good skin treatment following the dermal session.</li>
            <li>I could even use it on the top of my nose, forehead, and temples without too much pain.</li>
            <li>really loved this idea because you don&#x27;t need to buy multiple rollers.</li>
            <li>It felt like more of a gentle massage or even just like it would if you were to scratch an itch.</li>
            <li>Do I think that it is a quick fix?</li>
            <li>Do I think that it is a quick fix?</li>
            <li>Taking Phytoceramides and using organic serums and creams have helped me tremendously.</li>
            <li>and I can admit that it wasn&#x27;t comfortable at first, but also not painful.</li>
            <li>I quickly determined that I would not be using that one again.</li>
            <li>far as the stretch marks are concerned, I think I would need a lot more time to see any significant change since those marks are a lot deeper.</li>
            <li>As far as the stretch marks are concerned, I think I would need a lot more time to see any significant change since those marks are a lot deeper.</li>
            <li>great back up, for me as this is all new...</li>
            <li>The handle is super ergonomic, the color differences in the different needle lengths/sizes are aesthetically appealing, the variability in sizes are awesome and weirdly hard to find elsewhere, and the lack of pain is mind blowing (for me.</li>
            <li>/&gt;All-in-all, I’ve seen some amazing results from others and would definitely try to make this a once a week</li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;Definitely worth buying</li>
            <li>In my own opinion , it is definitely doing something.</li>
            <li>In my own opinion , it is definitely doing something.</li>
            <li>I really liked how it made my skin improve, it looked healthier after several uses</li>
            <li>But the difference is TOTALLY WORTH IT.</li>
            <li>/&gt;so far, I am extremely pleased.</li>
            <li>It is best to use a hair dryer to speed the process, but the sink was directly over a heat vent, so they dried pretty quickly.</li>
            <li>right?</li>
            <li>I had an issue &amp; they corrected it right away.</li>
            <li>a difference in my skin right away</li>
            <li>as your skin&#x27;s absorption is heightened right after derma rolling).</li>
            <li>so it seemed like the right choice for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>so it seemed like the right choice for me.  </li>
            <li>After a quick text to my dermatologist, who stated it was likely safe, I decided to try it out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Ok now to the use on roller I read many reviews stating they were bleeding they had to be rolling to hard in the video as we&#x27;ll as ebook its stated to roll with light pressure 4 time up/</li>
            <li>so I&#x27;m not sure how well it works long-term, but I&#x27;ve heard great things about them.  </li>
            <li>Tried so many expensive ways, but none of them work as great as the drama roller.</li>
            <li>I roll it very gently and with face toner (The Thayers)</li>
            <li>The instructions were very detailed and helpful especially if you&#x27;ve never used one before.  </li>
            <li>red and feeling very smooth and nourished.</li>
            <li>This product supposedly helps with  fine lines and wrinkles, acne scars, cellulite reduction, collagen stimulation stretch mark removal, sun spots age spots (early signs of aging), collagen stimulation, etc.</li>
            <li>It looks intimidating when you&#x27;re using it for the first time but it DOES make a huge difference as far as my skin&#x27;s appearance goes.</li>
            <li>Also sitting snug in the back of my mind are those pesky stretchmarks from enjoying the miracle of life.&lt;br</li>
            <li>My first thought was pinhead.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I did not notice on my thighs at first.</li>
            <li>It is not intolerable, but it isn&#x27;t exactly pleasant.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>didn&#x27;t exactly have a plan when it came to my face</li>
            <li>Just sort of eh, not so pleased, but not in pain, mixed with a hot sensation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>received one or more of the products mentioned above for review purposes.</li>
            <li>It really works for scars!</li>
            <li>Nuskin&#x27;s first and apply Keihl&#x27;s Midnight Recovery Concentrate, also, serums can be doubled) then lotion and cream.</li>
            <li>I did my first dermaroll 2 days agao.  </li>
            <li>I was only able to dermaroll just part of the baggy eye area that is away from the bridge of my nose.  </li>
            <li>(I’m exaggerating) in order to stimulate repair without damaging it enough to leave scars and also making your skin accept 98% of the product you place on top of it.</li>
            <li>What I liked about the 1.5mm roller was how wide across it was compared to others I’d seen.</li>
            <li>I haven’t tried the smallest one made for your face (0.5mm), but I don’t have many facial issues.</li>
            <li>This was a MUCH higher quality product than I anticipated.  </li>
            <li>I really think this thing is working on me!  </li>
            <li>it gets better daily....</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t speak about the results yet since I just got it, but after trying this product for the first time, I felt like giving my thoughts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I got it, I first used the 1.0 mm head for my cheeks which have a lot of depressed/pitted/boxcar/pockmark acne scars.</li>
            <li>(though that kinda scared me at first since you need to use force to get it out</li>
            <li>I can see the pores opening up and feel how much more quickly my facial serum is absorbing!</li>
            <li>My skin also looks and feels younger, tighter, and more defined.  </li>

            <li>I have spider veins due to heredity (isn&#x27;t that wonderful) and from my previous jobs of 10+ hours on my feet.</li>
            <li>and I am not certain if I was aggressive enough, but did feel some&lt;br /&gt;tingling and experienced redness.</li>
            <li>Already see slight changes for better in my skin!  </li>
            <li>Okay, so I am approaching my mid thirties, and like most women out there, I am concerned about looking young.</li>
            <li>I could always be much less aggressive with my rolling, but I don’t know that it would be nearly as effective.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t have to keep a light hand like my old one, but use normal or even stronger force.</li>
            <li>I am a pretty tough chick, and I can handle more pain than most.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s certainly well made and seems sturdy.</li>
            <li>This product came with a coupon for Argan Oil which is fine, but I actually used a Vitamin C serum which I can say contributed to the results I saw on my face.</li>

            <li>The wheel for the eye area is too big to get under the eye easily, but the other 2 rollers are really easy to use and the right size.</li>

            <li>And it was really troubling since all these Youtube reviews and celebrity endorsements said it was just supposed to feel like pinching.</li>
            <li>But to my surprise, it really didn&#x27;t hurt.</li>

            <li>the face (sounds intense, but it&#x27;s not I promise).</li>
            <li>Like, no one really enjoys a kitten walking across the face, but you also aren&#x27;t screaming in pain because of it either.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li>and I appreciate reading and giving honest feedback about products that regular people like me use on a daily basis or consider buying.</li>
            <li>/&gt;After a 30 day period I can say that I have noticed some positive changes in my skin, particularly my face.</li>

            <li>Be sure to be extremely gentle the first sevearal sessions due to the skin is adapting to this new technology.</li>
            <li>But, while the small one isn&#x27;t that useful, the larger one is nice since it covers more surface area for bodily use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I plan on ordering more for my mom and other family members.</li>
            <li>Rolling every now and then will likely not produce any significant change.</li>
            <li>Rolling every now and then will likely not produce any significant change.</li>
            <li>To rehydrate my clean, rolled skin, I used a mixture of shea butter, coconut oil, jojoba oil and essential oils</li>
            <li>I had seen some people advertise it from a direct sales company for a MUCH higher cost, but didn&#x27;t know what it did, or really, what it even was.  </li>
            <li>The idea of derma rolling is very new to me.</li>
            <li>so it made me cringe a tad, but not painful enough to keep me from doing it</li>
            <li>It’s easy to do if you aren’t careful.</li>
            <li>But I do believe that with diligent and steady use, you will receive the results you are after.are not quite leveled out just yet either.</li>
            <li>But I do believe that with diligent and steady use, you will receive the results you are after.</li>
            <li>I had pimples for years and so many deep scares left on my face.</li>
            <li>Also, I noted a tingling sensation (particularly on the face) that lasted for up to 30 minutes.</li>
            <li>That Helped Me Achieve Better Results  - Stick to a rolling schedule: The only way you can begin to see results is if you set up a regular rolling schedule and stick to it.</li>
            <li>The requirements for dermatologists are also highly rigorous.</li>
            <li>, I was a little intimidated and scared to try this, but I&#x27;m glad</li>
            <li>My face is normally splotchy.</li>
            <li>It states that it is normal to see blood spots after use, which should go away soon and not be bothersome, but I did not experience that.  </li>
            <li>Yes, sometimes you bleed (when I&#x27;m rolling my shins, where I have several scars and spider veins), but IT IS WORTH IT.  </li>
            <li>this was a good company that stood behind its product.</li>
            <li>The forehead was a bit more sensitive because there&#x27;s less fat and tissue there</li>
            <li>I was excited until I open the box, it&#x27;s very intimidating, but once I started it was no big deal.  </li>
            <li>- Moisturize : It is recommended that you use a serum that is designed to deeply moisturize the skin (as your skin&#x27;s absorption is heightened right after derma rolling).</li>
            <li>If you do try derma rolling, be sure to get yours from a reputable company such as Puruskin, don’t ever share yours, disinfect properly, and often, and toss it after 6 months (the needles will get dull on you).</li>
            <li>It is painful (at first) for me, but I have super sensitive skin and surprisingly got used to it from just using weekly.</li>
            <li>Do protect your skin with sun screen as you will be getting new tender skin just like a baby&#x27;s skin...</li>
            <li>When I first received this product for free to review, I knew very little about it.  </li>
            <li>Derma Rollers help with the appearance of acne scars, stretch marks, wrinkles, fine lines, dark spots and hyper-pigmentation.</li>
            <li>Unlike a lot of other sellers, these guys care about you being able to actually USE it!</li>
            <li>, I got a tingly feeling followed by what I can describe as a very mild sunburn, and then a little bit of redness, nothing</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, besides the open containers and the less maneuverable 0.5 mm head which are easy to fix, I really like everything else.</li>
            <li>This is likely because there is more fat and tissue down there</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;d feel perfectly fine except a little agitation to show that it was working.</li>
            <li>more I use it, the less red</li>
            <li>I am in my mid thirties and all throughout my life, I have always struggled with large pores.</li>
            <li>The Puruskin team sent complete instructions and followed up with my purchase.</li>
            <li>It is too early to see any improvement in my skin</li>
            <li>When this one gets old or worn out I will be reordering.</li>
            <li>(my old derma roller didn&#x27;t have something like that since there were no detachable heads).</li>
            <li>so far-</li>
            <li>I have seen a noticeable improvement to the texture of my skin and the amount of old scars.</li>
            <li>I am a professional Esthetician trained in micro-needling &amp; I dec to give this device a try.</li>
            <li>No need to pay $100s for a professional to treat ✮</li>
            <li>These needles are penetrating your skin and if you aren&#x27;t cleaning them properly you very well could be helping dirt and bacteria go deeper into the skin.</li>
            <li>These needles are penetrating your skin and if you aren&#x27;t cleaning them properly you very well could be helping dirt and bacteria go deeper into the skin.</li>
            <li>I actually tried it first on my forehead on the first night to see any side effects but there was none, so I proceeded on my entire face and my balding head the next day.</li>
            <li>Red patches here and there, different skin tones in other places, now it seems more even toned.</li>
            <li>my face, the primary use of the roller was to aid in the healing of scars and dark spots left from old acne.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m seeing decent results even with short term use.</li>
            <li>particular derma roller comes with three different sized roller heads.</li>
            <li>When I woke up, I looked at my arm and everything was normal, except for the fact that my skin was glowing after only one use!</li>
            <li>Even when I smile, they are less noticeable.  </li>
            <li>The needles are much smaller and the under eye area is surprisingly very sensitive.</li>
            <li>I used the 1.0mm tool for my head and major portions of my face.  </li>
            <li>Furthermore, no  beauty authority endorses it and a quick look at the reviews show that most say it is ineffective and likely dangerous.</li>
            <li>First of all, let me point out that similar items sell for up to $200 for a single size roller!</li>
            <li>If you would like to improve your skins texture or get rid of acne scars, scars in general or stretch marks, give it a try.</li>
            <li>When I done with my whole face, I put on a thick layer of Aloe gel as facial mask to calm the redness.</li>
            <li>only used once so far...</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve only used to roller once so far, but I&#x27;m already seeing/</li>
            <li>: It is vital that you sanitize these roller heads and store them properly after every use.</li>
            <li>- Keep roller heads sanitized: It is vital that yousanitize these roller heads and store them properly after every use.</li>
            <li>, however I chalk that up to &amp;#34;it gets worse before it gets better.&amp;#34; My face also did that with proactive before it got better.</li>
            <li>I’m not sure this is true, but I do know that it did improve my skin texture.  </li>
            <li>I slacked a little after not seeing miraculous early results but now that I&#x27;ve noticed a positive change will begin using again.</li>
            <li>Assuming it does what a derma roller does, I&#x27;m sure the results will come in a few months, and with a lot less pain.</li>
            <li>I decided to get this set because there was variability in the needle lengths, so I could use the smaller 0.5 mm roller for my nose, temples, and other places that were was much, much, much too sensitive for the 1.0 mm roller</li>
            <li>plus, I was unable to roll the more sensitive parts of my face.</li>
            <li>Just that fact alone made me realize that maybe my old one was wrong and it was not supposed to hurt so badly--like most of the reviews had been saying.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>For the past few years I&#x27;ve been dealing with the most obnoxious adult acne - it didn&#x27;t seem to matter what lotions or potions I used; if it was a certain time of the month, my chin was a MESS.  </li>
            <li>Other than that, the real results have to be observed after  use over a specific length of time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>After the first few rolls I adjusted to it</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 48 male and trying to  lessen minor wrinkles and creases, reduce old acne scarring, and aid in reversing hair-loss.</li>
            <li>We can&#x27;t turn the hands of time back but, are able to slow it way down...</li>
            <li>I figured I should get a new one since I&#x27;d had the other for awhile</li>
            <li>Since I didn&#x27;t really have sensitive skin at least on my cheeks</li>
    </ol>

            <li> I was offered a 3 In 1 Interchangeable Derma Roller Kit by Puruskin for my honest feedback and review.</li>
            <li> I jumped at the chance to try this for myself in the comfort of my own home avoiding the hundreds of dollars associated with it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve really liked the product</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t use a numbing gel and kind of wish I did.</li>
            <li> As a blogger I received a complementary sample of this product in exchange for my honest &amp; unbiased opinion.</li>
            <li> Great product and great early results.</li>

            <li> thighs, I did notice a huge difference there!</li>
            <li> Love this company.</li>
            <li> scar&#x27;s, cellulite reduction, stretch mark removal, anti aging, sun and age spot repair, wrinkle elimination, collagen stimulation, and a lot more.</li>
            <li> I have addressed most of my skin problems except my issue with my pores.</li>
            <li> Ok I&#x27;m not gonna lie</li>
            <li> I decided I would use the 1.5mm head because it covered more area.&lt;br /&gt;After rolling on my arm</li>
            <li> I love the Derma Roller and would recommend it to anyone!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Love it and have seen results.</li>
            <li> Furthermore, Rachel Ray is a cook and talk show host, a lovely person, but no expert.</li>
            <li> I attempted to use the .5mm dermaroller which is the same excellent quality as the 1.0mm except</li>
            <li> Another good analogy is when you see a tiller being rolled across freshly laid dirt and sod.</li>
            <li> The roller pokes a bunch of holes all over the soil to aerate the ground and make it more receptive to the seeds.</li>
            <li> My thighs took longer to heal (still healing in some spots), and I’m sure I probably didn’t do it correctly, but I wouldn’t do that again without numbing cream.</li>
            <li> It is intended to cover more surface without having to roll for a longer period of time, which is nice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> As an Aesthetician I viewed many videos and read many reviews before buying it.  </li>
            <li> and you feel better in the process.</li>
            <li> Seeing results that&#x27;s for sure.</li>
            <li> It’s oddly satisfying to use.</li>
            <li> I heard of Derma roller, but I wasn&#x27;t sure if I could tolerate the needles.</li>
            <li> I received the derma roller and am extremely pleased with the item.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it once on my face &amp; noticed more taughtness &amp; plumpness already.</li>
            <li> mostly so I had time to see if there were results.  </li>
            <li> I love this thing.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m working up the courage to use the body roller on more parts...</li>
            <li> When it comes to derma rolling, so many people do it incorrectly</li>
            <li> Hints That Helped Me Achieve Better Results</li>
            <li> Good price and useful</li>
            <li> The dermaroller combined with a high quality pharmaceutical grade serum is a great tool to have available for my clients and to keep my own skin in the greatest condition possible.</li>
            <li> Quality is amazing and you can clean with rubbing alcohol.  </li>
            <li> You also use it to clean the head by filling it with rubbing alcohol and water and letting it sit, which is nice since I don&#x27;t need to get another container or something</li>
            <li> Its pretty good, no complaints.</li>
            <li> but this idea here makes me really excited!</li>
            <li> I am excited to see the results after 10 uses!  </li>
            <li> skin feels so smooth and more elastic</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;Edges around my scars are beginning to be more smooth and even&lt;br</li>
            <li> The 1.0mm head has 600 titanium needles and is ideal for the majority of the facial area, it treats wrinkles and acne scars.  </li>
            <li> (it included a special cleaner!).</li>
            <li> There are many brands to choose from &amp; Puruskin is unique because they have change heads for the derma roller.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Watched several you-tube videos and many do not follow guide lines, me happy to follow PURUSKIN suggestions.</li>
            <li> Easy to use,</li>
            <li> They are easily interchangeable and are color coded to make it easy to remember which is which.  </li>
            <li> You also need to make sure your skin is cleansed and your hands are clean.</li>
            <li> Again I made sure the area was clean and the product was sanitized before use.</li>
            <li> I feel like I should give this a full month to see if it gets any better.</li>
            <li> The first thing I learned during my research was why and how derm-rolling is effective.</li>
            <li> ✮ Fine Lines</li>
            <li> Delivery was quick and aids to learn more are offered...</li>
            <li> Whoever decided to come up with this approach was really thinking with the customer in mind not their wallet in mind &amp; I for one love it!</li>
            <li> using this product, I realized I&#x27;m a huge baby.  </li>
            <li> Additionally, my pores (which are traditionally huge) seemed to shrink to me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Additionally, my pores (which are traditionally huge) seemed to shrink to me.  </li>
            <li> You get detailed instructions and videos emailed to you</li>
            <li> enjoy the time for yourself....</li>
            <li> However, I don&#x27;t like how the container is open, so dust or something could still fly</li>
            <li> The 1.5mm head which has 1200 titanium needles is great for use on larger body areas, like legs, stomach, arms, etc.</li>
            <li> I have seen people use this larger head on stretch marks or scars with really great results.  </li>
            <li> I received this product for free for my unbiased review.</li>
            <li> This way products can be absorbed at a greater rate.  </li>
            <li> started on my arm first as a test run, and I made sure my skin was clean and free of any lotions.</li>
            <li> Completely satisfied ;)</li>
            <li> ; initiative we&#x27;ll teach you exactly what to do so you can feel confident every step of the way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I am excited to&lt;br /&gt;see</li>
            <li> /&gt;In order to better compare my results, let me share with you exactly what my &amp;#34;problem areas&amp;#34; were and what I was looking to see as a result of using this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Opened the 1.0mm immediately and followed the instructions as I was excited to see results.</li>
            <li> I noticed first time a refreshing cooling of my head after the lotion which I never felt before.</li>
            <li> You will never get it clean</li>
            <li> Clean the head by soaking in alcohol for 5 minutes.</li>
            <li> Some say that your regular skincare is more effective after using the derma roller.</li>
            <li> They also included a special offer for their virgin Argan oil.</li>
            <li> but it was corrected right away!</li>
            <li> I use personally and believe will be good for others.</li>
            <li> I filled a freshly cleaned glass jar with 3 parts alcohol and1 part water, as suggested, and sterilized each piece for 30 minutes.</li>
            <li> Apply a good skin treatment following the dermal session.</li>
            <li> I could even use it on the top of my nose, forehead, and temples without too much pain.</li>
            <li> really loved this idea because you don&#x27;t need to buy multiple rollers.</li>
            <li> It felt like more of a gentle massage or even just like it would if you were to scratch an itch.</li>
            <li> Do I think that it is a quick fix?</li>
            <li> Do I think that it is a quick fix?</li>
            <li> Taking Phytoceramides and using organic serums and creams have helped me tremendously.</li>
            <li> and I can admit that it wasn&#x27;t comfortable at first, but also not painful.</li>
            <li> I quickly determined that I would not be using that one again.</li>
            <li> far as the stretch marks are concerned, I think I would need a lot more time to see any significant change since those marks are a lot deeper.</li>

            <li> great back up, for me as this is all new...</li>
            <li> The handle is super ergonomic, the color differences in the different needle lengths/sizes are aesthetically appealing, the variability in sizes are awesome and weirdly hard to find elsewhere, and the lack of pain is mind blowing (for me.</li>
            <li> /&gt;All-in-all, I’ve seen some amazing results from others and would definitely try to make this a once a week</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;Definitely worth buying</li>
            <li> In my own opinion , it is definitely doing something.</li>
            <li> In my own opinion , it is definitely doing something.</li>
            <li> I really liked how it made my skin improve, it looked healthier after several uses</li>
            <li> But the difference is TOTALLY WORTH IT.</li>
            <li> /&gt;so far, I am extremely pleased.</li>
            <li> It is best to use a hair dryer to speed the process, but the sink was directly over a heat vent, so they dried pretty quickly.</li>
            <li> right?</li>
            <li> I had an issue &amp; they corrected it right away.</li>
            <li> a difference in my skin right away</li>
            <li> as your skin&#x27;s absorption is heightened right after derma rolling).</li>
            <li> so it seemed like the right choice for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> so it seemed like the right choice for me.  </li>
            <li> After a quick text to my dermatologist, who stated it was likely safe, I decided to try it out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Ok now to the use on roller I read many reviews stating they were bleeding they had to be rolling to hard in the video as we&#x27;ll as ebook its stated to roll with light pressure 4 time up/</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m not sure how well it works long-term, but I&#x27;ve heard great things about them.  </li>
            <li> Tried so many expensive ways, but none of them work as great as the drama roller.</li>
            <li> I roll it very gently and with face toner (The Thayers)</li>
            <li> The instructions were very detailed and helpful especially if you&#x27;ve never used one before.  </li>
            <li> red and feeling very smooth and nourished.</li>
            <li> This product supposedly helps with  fine lines and wrinkles, acne scars, cellulite reduction, collagen stimulation stretch mark removal, sun spots age spots (early signs of aging), collagen stimulation, etc.</li>
            <li> It looks intimidating when you&#x27;re using it for the first time but it DOES make a huge difference as far as my skin&#x27;s appearance goes.</li>
            <li> Also sitting snug in the back of my mind are those pesky stretchmarks from enjoying the miracle of life.&lt;br</li>
            <li> My first thought was pinhead.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I did not notice on my thighs at first.</li>
            <li> It is not intolerable, but it isn&#x27;t exactly pleasant.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> didn&#x27;t exactly have a plan when it came to my face</li>
            <li> Just sort of eh, not so pleased, but not in pain, mixed with a hot sensation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> received one or more of the products mentioned above for review purposes.</li>
            <li> It really works for scars!</li>
            <li> Nuskin&#x27;s first and apply Keihl&#x27;s Midnight Recovery Concentrate, also, serums can be doubled) then lotion and cream.</li>
            <li> I did my first dermaroll 2 days agao.  </li>
            <li> I was only able to dermaroll just part of the baggy eye area that is away from the bridge of my nose.  </li>
            <li> (I’m exaggerating) in order to stimulate repair without damaging it enough to leave scars and also making your skin accept 98% of the product you place on top of it.</li>
            <li> What I liked about the 1.5mm roller was how wide across it was compared to others I’d seen.</li>
            <li> I haven’t tried the smallest one made for your face (0.5mm), but I don’t have many facial issues.</li>
            <li> This was a MUCH higher quality product than I anticipated.  </li>
            <li> I really think this thing is working on me!  </li>
            <li> it gets better daily....</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t speak about the results yet since I just got it, but after trying this product for the first time, I felt like giving my thoughts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I got it, I first used the 1.0 mm head for my cheeks which have a lot of depressed/pitted/boxcar/pockmark acne scars.</li>
            <li> (though that kinda scared me at first since you need to use force to get it out</li>
            <li> I can see the pores opening up and feel how much more quickly my facial serum is absorbing!</li>
            <li> My skin also looks and feels younger, tighter, and more defined.  </li>

            <li> I have spider veins due to heredity (isn&#x27;t that wonderful) and from my previous jobs of 10+ hours on my feet.</li>
            <li> and I am not certain if I was aggressive enough, but did feel some&lt;br /&gt;tingling and experienced redness.</li>
            <li> Already see slight changes for better in my skin!  </li>
            <li> Okay, so I am approaching my mid thirties, and like most women out there, I am concerned about looking young.</li>
            <li> I could always be much less aggressive with my rolling, but I don’t know that it would be nearly as effective.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t have to keep a light hand like my old one, but use normal or even stronger force.</li>
            <li> I am a pretty tough chick, and I can handle more pain than most.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s certainly well made and seems sturdy.</li>
            <li> This product came with a coupon for Argan Oil which is fine, but I actually used a Vitamin C serum which I can say contributed to the results I saw on my face.</li>

            <li> And it was really troubling since all these Youtube reviews and celebrity endorsements said it was just supposed to feel like pinching.</li>
            <li> But to my surprise, it really didn&#x27;t hurt.</li>

            <li> Rolling every now and then will likely not produce any significant change.</li>
            <li> To rehydrate my clean, rolled skin, I used a mixture of shea butter, coconut oil, jojoba oil and essential oils</li>
            <li> I had seen some people advertise it from a direct sales company for a MUCH higher cost, but didn&#x27;t know what it did, or really, what it even was.  </li>
            <li> The idea of derma rolling is very new to me.</li>
            <li> so it made me cringe a tad, but not painful enough to keep me from doing it</li>
            <li> It’s easy to do if you aren’t careful.</li>
            <li> But I do believe that with diligent and steady use, you will receive the results you are after.are not quite leveled out just yet either.</li>
            <li> But I do believe that with diligent and steady use, you will receive the results you are after.</li>
            <li> I had pimples for years and so many deep scares left on my face.</li>
            <li> Also, I noted a tingling sensation (particularly on the face) that lasted for up to 30 minutes.</li>
            <li> That Helped Me Achieve Better Results  - Stick to a rolling schedule: The only way you can begin to see results is if you set up a regular rolling schedule and stick to it.</li>
            <li> The requirements for dermatologists are also highly rigorous.</li>
            <li> , I was a little intimidated and scared to try this, but I&#x27;m glad</li>
            <li> My face is normally splotchy.</li>
            <li> It states that it is normal to see blood spots after use, which should go away soon and not be bothersome, but I did not experience that.  </li>
            <li> Yes, sometimes you bleed (when I&#x27;m rolling my shins, where I have several scars and spider veins), but IT IS WORTH IT.  </li>
            <li> this was a good company that stood behind its product.</li>
            <li> The forehead was a bit more sensitive because there&#x27;s less fat and tissue there</li>
            <li> I was excited until I open the box, it&#x27;s very intimidating, but once I started it was no big deal.  </li>
            <li> - Moisturize : It is recommended that you use a serum that is designed to deeply moisturize the skin (as your skin&#x27;s absorption is heightened right after derma rolling).</li>
            <li> If you do try derma rolling, be sure to get yours from a reputable company such as Puruskin, don’t ever share yours, disinfect properly, and often, and toss it after 6 months (the needles will get dull on you).</li>
            <li> It is painful (at first) for me, but I have super sensitive skin and surprisingly got used to it from just using weekly.</li>
            <li> Do protect your skin with sun screen as you will be getting new tender skin just like a baby&#x27;s skin...</li>
            <li> When I first received this product for free to review, I knew very little about it.  </li>
            <li> Derma Rollers help with the appearance of acne scars, stretch marks, wrinkles, fine lines, dark spots and hyper-pigmentation.</li>
            <li> Unlike a lot of other sellers, these guys care about you being able to actually USE it!</li>
            <li> , I got a tingly feeling followed by what I can describe as a very mild sunburn, and then a little bit of redness, nothing</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, besides the open containers and the less maneuverable 0.5 mm head which are easy to fix, I really like everything else.</li>
            <li> This is likely because there is more fat and tissue down there</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;d feel perfectly fine except a little agitation to show that it was working.</li>
            <li> more I use it, the less red</li>
            <li> I am in my mid thirties and all throughout my life, I have always struggled with large pores.</li>
            <li> The Puruskin team sent complete instructions and followed up with my purchase.</li>
            <li> It is too early to see any improvement in my skin</li>
            <li> When this one gets old or worn out I will be reordering.</li>
            <li> (my old derma roller didn&#x27;t have something like that since there were no detachable heads).</li>
            <li> so far-</li>
            <li> I have seen a noticeable improvement to the texture of my skin and the amount of old scars.</li>
            <li> I am a professional Esthetician trained in micro-needling &amp; I dec to give this device a try.</li>
            <li> No need to pay $100s for a professional to treat ✮</li>
            <li> These needles are penetrating your skin and if you aren&#x27;t cleaning them properly you very well could be helping dirt and bacteria go deeper into the skin.</li>

            <li> I actually tried it first on my forehead on the first night to see any side effects but there was none, so I proceeded on my entire face and my balding head the next day.</li>
            <li> Red patches here and there, different skin tones in other places, now it seems more even toned.</li>
            <li> my face, the primary use of the roller was to aid in the healing of scars and dark spots left from old acne.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m seeing decent results even with short term use.</li>
            <li> particular derma roller comes with three different sized roller heads.</li>
            <li> When I woke up, I looked at my arm and everything was normal, except for the fact that my skin was glowing after only one use!</li>
            <li> Even when I smile, they are less noticeable.  </li>
            <li> The needles are much smaller and the under eye area is surprisingly very sensitive.</li>
            <li> I used the 1.0mm tool for my head and major portions of my face.  </li>
            <li> Furthermore, no  beauty authority endorses it and a quick look at the reviews show that most say it is ineffective and likely dangerous.</li>
            <li> First of all, let me point out that similar items sell for up to $200 for a single size roller!</li>
            <li> If you would like to improve your skins texture or get rid of acne scars, scars in general or stretch marks, give it a try.</li>
            <li> When I done with my whole face, I put on a thick layer of Aloe gel as facial mask to calm the redness.</li>
            <li> only used once so far...</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve only used to roller once so far, but I&#x27;m already seeing/</li>
            <li> : It is vital that you sanitize these roller heads and store them properly after every use.</li>
            <li> - Keep roller heads sanitized: It is vital that yousanitize these roller heads and store them properly after every use.</li>
            <li> , however I chalk that up to &amp;#34;it gets worse before it gets better.&amp;#34; My face also did that with proactive before it got better.</li>
            <li> I’m not sure this is true, but I do know that it did improve my skin texture.  </li>
            <li> I slacked a little after not seeing miraculous early results but now that I&#x27;ve noticed a positive change will begin using again.</li>
            <li> Assuming it does what a derma roller does, I&#x27;m sure the results will come in a few months, and with a lot less pain.</li>
            <li> I decided to get this set because there was variability in the needle lengths, so I could use the smaller 0.5 mm roller for my nose, temples, and other places that were was much, much, much too sensitive for the 1.0 mm roller</li>
            <li> plus, I was unable to roll the more sensitive parts of my face.</li>
            <li> Just that fact alone made me realize that maybe my old one was wrong and it was not supposed to hurt so badly--like most of the reviews had been saying.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> For the past few years I&#x27;ve been dealing with the most obnoxious adult acne - it didn&#x27;t seem to matter what lotions or potions I used; if it was a certain time of the month, my chin was a MESS.  </li>
            <li> Other than that, the real results have to be observed after  use over a specific length of time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> After the first few rolls I adjusted to it</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 48 male and trying to  lessen minor wrinkles and creases, reduce old acne scarring, and aid in reversing hair-loss.</li>
            <li> We can&#x27;t turn the hands of time back but, are able to slow it way down...</li>
            <li> I figured I should get a new one since I&#x27;d had the other for awhile</li>
            <li> Since I didn&#x27;t really have sensitive skin at least on my cheeks</li>
            <li> Needless to say, I was very excited when I was given the chance to use it.</li>
            <li> Redness and slight irritation are normal.</li>
            <li> At first there was a little irritation as my skin adapts to the roller, but there is really no pain or bruises.</li>
            <li> and you&#x27;ll get the results.imary use of the roller was to aid in the healing of scars and dark spots left from old acne.</li>
            <li> didn&#x27;t really care about the different width sizes, and it&#x27;s actually not all that helpful for the small one because the shaft of the roller is too long</li>
            <li> I first bought one set for myself and used for at least 10 times during a month.</li>
            <li> I opened my box and removed 3 very neatly sealed rollers of varying sizes — yellow for face at 0.5mm, teal for body at 1.00mm, and pink for larger coverage of the body at 1.5mm, one inside a hard case, fully assembled to the handle already.</li>
            <li> down then side to side  holding skin taunt and roll as would if playing a tic tac toe game area only should be pink to light red</li>
            <li> derma roller is a product that uses tiny high quality titanium needles to penetrate the hard epidermal layer of the skin.</li>
            <li> I think I have just saved myself a few hundred dollars by not having to have professional treatments, i.e. chemical peels or laser treatments.  </li>
            <li> I am going to break down my review of the product into various facets to ensure I am sharing with you my entire experience and all of the details.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> the product was packed properly in seal bags with other roller in separate boxes.</li>
            <li> The same for the other cheek and the chin area.</li>
            <li> After use I soak it for another 5 minutes in alcohol and then leave it to dry.  </li>
            <li> The sensation is pretty painful at first, but you do get to a point where it&#x27;s tolerable.</li>
            <li> Meanwhile, the 0.5mm head (the most painful) is to be used for tiny areas like under the eyes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My dark circles start from the corners of my inner eyes and go downward along my eye to the baggy eye area.  </li>
            <li> Once sterile, I carefully removed them to a plate where they were allowed to fully dry.</li>
            <li> , criss-cross the other way, criss-cross the other way several times.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> also really like how they have this small little container for all of the other heads, which locks onto the head so it won&#x27;t fall out if you knock it over</li>
            <li> With my old roller, it hurt after rolling it 3 or so times, and I couldn&#x27;t really roll it back and forth and so would pick it up and only roll one way because somehow it felt less chaotic and painful.</li>
            <li> The design of the dermaroller is such that the holder which holds the wheel in place extrudes to the sides too much, making it difficult to get to the under eye area without hitting my eye or eyelid.  </li>
            <li> read all directions carefully, downloaded the book and put on my determined face.</li>
            <li> Do no be rough and there should not be any bleeding.</li>
            <li> Item came faster than I expected .</li>
            <li> I used a combination of the pink 1.5mm roller and the teal 1.0mm roller.</li>
            <li> And after months of using it, I never really got accustomed to it, and my eyes still watered up.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s what I expected</li>
            <li> The benefits listed include  that it gently exfoliates unhealthy skin cells, stimulates blood flow to surface, massages the skin, cleans our pores, stimulates collagen re-growth, and increases skin absorption rate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Gentle exfoliation of unhealthy skin cells</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t put on makeup for at least 24 hours after using or you will be sorry :-)</li>
            <li> first handling the rollers to assemble them, I was probably a little careless and pricked my fingers several times.</li>
            <li> have been doing this in the same spot for the past week and a half.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not a magic wand where you rub here and there once or twice and instantly resemble what you did when you were 18.  </li>

            <li> /&gt;criss-cross the other way</li>
            <li> I do see this being helpful for stretch marks and cellulite, however, and even other skin issues.</li>
            <li> and no need to over due it..</li>
            <li> again, it can hurt, so it&#x27;s not exactly a joyful exercise.  </li>
            <li> It was extremely helpful and made&lt;br /&gt;my initial rolling experience a lot less stressful!!</li>
            <li> By this I simply mean fight the urge to roll harder on your skin than is necessary.</li>
            <li> I can also say that my skin has broken out less in the past 30 days which I attribute to the deep cleaning of the pores that the derma roller offers.</li>

            <li> and so even if I couldn&#x27;t see it, the needles could have worn down or something--</li>
            <li> I was the child who had to have 5 nurses hold her down just to get a shot, so</li>
            <li> The directions suggest rolling the derma roller 5 or six times in each direction (up &amp; down, side to side, and diagonally).</li>
            <li> /&gt;I will not lie, it states on the box that you will feel slight discomfort.</li>

            <li> I have less lines on my forehead and around my eyes.  </li>
            <li> It was a little less than a minute when I noticed a slight burn.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I was afraid at first.</li>
            <li> - Don&#x27;t go too hard: By this I simply mean fight the urge to roll harder on your skin than is necessary.</li>
            <li> The idea behind the product is that the needles penetrate the hard epidermal layer of the skin, and use of the product will create hundreds of new channels that break just below the skins surface.  </li>
            <li> A little intimidated as well.  </li>
            <li> a little wierd.  </li>
            <li> (if you said the nose, eye or forehead area where there&#x27;s little fat, then I&#x27;d understand)</li>
            <li> When I used the derma roller I had a little bit of redness after use, but nothing that lasted.</li>
            <li> I usually use it on my face while watching tv, and I start with my cheek area and then my chin, other cheek area, nose area, etc.</li>
            <li> I can say I&#x27;ve seen slight (very slight) lightening of the marks but that change wouldn&#x27;t be noticeable to anyone else.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li> Don&#x27;t go too hard:</li>
            <li> Rolling wasn&#x27;t painful and seriously compares to doing microdermabrasion on the sensitive parts of your face.  </li>
            <li> I had seen videos of people rolling their faces, tummies, legs, thighs, arms, breasts all with serious veracity</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I was introduced to a similar product by Rodan+Fields. ONE roller is $199. (it included a special cleaner!). I turned to Amazon and found this system to $19.99. For THREE rollers. Quality is amazing and you can clean with rubbing alcohol.  The Puruskin team sent complete instructions and followed up with my purchase. The instructions and cautionary advice were spot on. It&#x27;s a very different skincare tool. They also included a special offer for their virgin Argan oil. I paid under $10 and it is wonderfully u scented and pure luxury. Love this company. I am a customer for life.</li>
            <li> I had Derma Rollers before. This is by far the most best product I&#x27;ve ever purchased.&lt;br /&gt;My skin feels so smooth and more elastic&lt;br /&gt;Edges around my scars are beginning to be more smooth and even&lt;br /&gt;The more I use it, the less red I become each time&lt;br /&gt;Definitely worth buying</li>
            <li> Okay, so I am approaching my mid thirties, and like most women out there, I am concerned about looking young. Keeping the wrinkles at bay - maybe even erasing a few. Also sitting snug in the back of my mind are those pesky stretchmarks from enjoying the miracle of life.&lt;br /&gt;The product I am trying now, is supposed to help with all of those things and more!&lt;br /&gt;So imagine my excitement when I got chose on Tomoson to try this product free.&lt;br /&gt;I have never in my life been to the spa for face or treatments of the skin in any capacity.&lt;br /&gt;For those of you out there who have never heard of these sort of treatments or maybe just doesn&#x27;t know what this product does ...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is a Micro needling type therapy. Used to help&lt;br /&gt;acne scar&#x27;s, cellulite reduction, stretch mark removal, anti aging, sun and age spot repair, wrinkle elimination, collagen stimulation, and a lot more. All with the swift roll of a wand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have to admit that when the package arrived I was immediately impressed. A little intimidated as well.  The package comes with a wand, and three different sized heads- all in sterile plastic packaging.  I went with the 1.0mm needle size.&lt;br /&gt;It tells you on the box which sized head works best with what you are trying to accomplish.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was afraid at first. I am terrified of needles and this thing looked like it came strait out of the horror flick (Hellraiser) My first thought was pinhead.&lt;br /&gt;I read all directions carefully, downloaded the book and put on my determined face. I was going to try this no matter how scary it looked. I want those marks GONE!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will not lie, it states on the box that you will feel slight discomfort. I did not notice on my thighs at first. (My thighs have slight stretch marks due to weight gain during pregnancy.) Actually it just felt like I was lightly scratching my nails over my skin. I slapped on a combination of Vitamin C serum and Vitamin E oil, pulled up my pants and went about my day. It was a little less than a minute when I noticed a slight burn. (It feels like razor burn after shaving your legs.) Not intolerable, but definitely noticeable.&lt;br /&gt;I have been doing this in the same spot for the past week and a half.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also graduated from my thigh to my face. I noticed the discomfort instantly on my face. It is not intolerable, but it isn&#x27;t exactly pleasant.&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t exactly have a plan when it came to my face, my only thought was - if I did the whole thing, then maybe I will just look younger.&lt;br /&gt;The discomfort after you finish - feels a lot like the burn your ears feel after just getting them pierced. Just sort of eh, not so pleased, but not in pain, mixed with a hot sensation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The third place I have been using this is on my tummy (again) trying to rid myself of my baby battle wounds.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will start with my face: I didn&#x27;t have a lot of wrinkles yet to begin with, however - the ones I did have (crows feet) have lessened. Even when I smile, they are less noticeable.  I did break out really bad with acne after doing this, however I chalk that up to &amp;#34;it gets worse before it gets better.&amp;#34; My face also did that with proactive before it got better. Today, I have maybe two or three pimples (again) I believe that is just do to hormones for this time of month.  I notice a difference in my tone. My face is normally splotchy. Red patches here and there, different skin tones in other places, now it seems more even toned. The giant red dot I had left on my chin from a pimple I couldn&#x27;t resist, is almost non-see&#x27;able.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My thighs, I did notice a huge difference there! The stretch marks were pretty deep embedded, which is why I hated them. They are not gone, but its almost as if they leveled out with the rest of my skin. I feel like I should give this a full month to see if it gets any better. They are not gone, but there is a difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My tummy - again, the same as my thighs, although these onesare not quite leveled out just yet either. (My tummy however was the last place I started and I have been using it there for less time.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Does this work? In my own opinion , it is definitely doing something. Do I think that it is a quick fix? No, I think that this is something you are going to have to add to your routine. It is going to take time. It&#x27;s not a magic wand where you rub here and there once or twice and instantly resemble what you did when you were 18.  But I do believe that with diligent and steady use, you will receive the results you are after.are not quite leveled out just yet either.

            <li> I am in my mid thirties and all throughout my life, I have always struggled with large pores. I also noticed that for the past few years, I can&#x27;t seem to get my skin as hydrated as I want it to be. Taking Phytoceramides and using organic serums and creams have helped me tremendously. Understandably, our skin changes as we age - so I am taking precautionary measures and doing what I can to help my skin. I have addressed most of my skin problems except my issue with my pores. This product supposedly helps with  fine lines and wrinkles, acne scars, cellulite reduction, collagen stimulation stretch mark removal, sun spots age spots (early signs of aging), collagen stimulation, etc. Needless to say, I was very excited when I was given the chance to use it. It looks intimidating when you&#x27;re using it for the first time but it DOES make a huge difference as far as my skin&#x27;s appearance goes. Two thumbs up for this nifty beauty tool!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received one or more of the products mentioned above for review purposes. Regardless, I only recommend products or services I use personally and believe will be good for others. I refuse to review or endorse products that I have not or will not personally try. Needless to say, I may be a product reviewer but my thoughts are real and none of the things I say on my reviews are made up or fake - they are all based on my experience/s with whatever product I am reviewing. I’m just a regular consumer and I appreciate reading and giving honest feedback about products that regular people like me use on a daily basis or consider buying. My views and opinions are from a customer/end user’s standpoint.</li>
            <li> Ok I&#x27;m not gonna lie, I was a little intimidated and scared to try this, but I&#x27;m glad I did!&lt;br /&gt;It comes with 3 different sized micro-needle rollers. The 1.5mm and the 0.5mm comes in their own case and the 1.0 is in the case with the handle. They come in sealed sterile plastic wrap.&lt;br /&gt;I started on my arm first as a test run, and I made sure my skin was clean and free of any lotions. I decided I would use the 1.5mm head because it covered more area.&lt;br /&gt;After rolling on my arm, I got a tingly feeling followed by what I can describe as a very mild sunburn, and then a little bit of redness, nothing serious!&lt;br /&gt;After rolling, I massaged argan oil into my skin and went to bed. When I woke up, I looked at my arm and everything was normal, except for the fact that my skin was glowing after only one use! I couldn&#x27;t believe it!&lt;br /&gt;I tried it on my legs next. I have spider veins due to heredity (isn&#x27;t that wonderful) and from my previous jobs of 10+ hours on my feet. After 2 weeks of using the Derma Roller I have noticed a decrease in spider veins!! I have been trying to get rid of them for years and even did several painful treatments of sclerotherapy and something that costs a fraction of what I spent on that worked so well!! I love the Derma Roller and would recommend it to anyone!&lt;br /&gt;I received this product at a discount in exchange for my unbiased review.</li>
            <li> Love it and have seen results. Using my products with the derma roller has been more successful. Do no be rough and there should not be any bleeding.</li>
            <li> First of all, let me point out that similar items sell for up to $200 for a single size roller! This has THREE sizes! YES! Getting this done at the spa or dermatologist costs three times as much as this set so you can do it at home for a fraction of the cost. It helps with scars, hair growth, cellulite and making your skin completely absorb all those expensive products you buy to make yourself purty. Unlike a lot of other sellers, these guys care about you being able to actually USE it! You get detailed instructions and videos emailed to you so you don&#x27;t destroy your skin. Another YES!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Caveat- don&#x27;t put on makeup for at least 24 hours after using or you will be sorry :-) Let your skin heal properly and you will be amazed by the results. Video demo to come!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was sent this set for review purposes.</li>
            <li> Its pretty good, no complaints.</li>
            <li> It left scratches on my skin that did not heal and it hurts on the body. For the face it is good</li>
            <li> This product is not approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for any of the claimed benefits. Furthermore, no  beauty authority endorses it and a quick look at the reviews show that most say it is ineffective and likely dangerous. Poking holes in your skin opens up pathways for germs and infections. Keeping your skin constantly irritated is deliberately hurting yourself and is not at all like having a trained dermatologist or plastic surgeon oversee laser resurfacing. A $15 gadget does not equal eight years of university education or the additional two years of fellowship done under a licensed medical doctor. That is what it takes to be a plastic surgeon. The requirements for dermatologists are also highly rigorous. Resurfacing the skin is not a DIY project that can be done with a meat tenderizer and a glue gun. Furthermore, Rachel Ray is a cook and talk show host, a lovely person, but no expert.</li>
            <li> Fast delivered, as described, and you know what? It really works for scars! I had pimples for years and so many deep scares left on my face. Tried so many expensive ways, but none of them work as great as the drama roller. I first bought one set for myself and used for at least 10 times during a month. When my mom came and saw me, she could definitely see the improvement on my face! Then I bought three sets more! LOL!&lt;br /&gt;  I roll it very gently and with face toner (The Thayers) on my face for reducing the pain. And use repairing serum (I&#x27;m using Nuskin&#x27;s for this step) right after one area is done (don&#x27;t wait until you finish your whole face). When I done with my whole face, I put on a thick layer of Aloe gel as facial mask to calm the redness. Then wash it off and use my repairing serum again (Nuskin&#x27;s first and apply Keihl&#x27;s Midnight Recovery Concentrate, also, serums can be doubled) then lotion and cream. If I still want to use some Aloe gel I use it between serum and lotion. Hope this would help~</li>
            <li> Item arrived on time in a sealed package.  I did my first dermaroll 2 days agao.  I used the 1.0mm tool for my head and major portions of my face.  I attempted to use the .5mm dermaroller which is the same excellent quality as the 1.0mm except but I could not use it for the dark circles under my eyes as I had expected.  The design of the dermaroller is such that the holder which holds the wheel in place extrudes to the sides too much, making it difficult to get to the under eye area without hitting my eye or eyelid.  My dark circles start from the corners of my inner eyes and go downward along my eye to the baggy eye area.  I was only able to dermaroll just part of the baggy eye area that is away from the bridge of my nose.  The dermaroller could not access the rest of it. (see photo).  Other than that, I&#x27;m happy with it so far.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll update in a few months to show photos of my progress if I experience any.  I&#x27;m 48 male and trying to  lessen minor wrinkles and creases, reduce old acne scarring, and aid in reversing hair-loss.</li>
            <li> Item came faster than I expected . I appreciate that.</li>
            <li> I was offered a 3 In 1 Interchangeable Derma Roller Kit by Puruskin for my honest feedback and review. I did some research, got curious, and found  several different types, sizes and grades of derm rollers, the professional type used by physicians starting at 1.5mm. I jumped at the chance to try this for myself in the comfort of my own home avoiding the hundreds of dollars associated with it. The first thing I learned during my research was why and how derm-rolling is effective. It seems counter-intuitive to damage your skin in order to repair it, right? But think about a vaccine. When you get a flu shot, you’re actually being injected with the flu in order to train your body to fight off the infection and send healing antibodies to save the day. Another good analogy is when you see a tiller being rolled across freshly laid dirt and sod. The roller pokes a bunch of holes all over the soil to aerate the ground and make it more receptive to the seeds. Same with a derma roller. You poke a bazillion holes all over your skin (I’m exaggerating) in order to stimulate repair without damaging it enough to leave scars and also making your skin accept 98% of the product you place on top of it. This is great news for cellulite and stretch mark sufferers! But don’t feel you have to go out and buy a bunch of products. People see amazing results with Shea Butter, Olive Oil and even Jergen’s lotion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On to my personal experience with the Puruskin 3 In 1 Interchangeable Derma Roller Kit. I opened my box and removed 3 very neatly sealed rollers of varying sizes — yellow for face at 0.5mm, teal for body at 1.00mm, and pink for larger coverage of the body at 1.5mm, one inside a hard case, fully assembled to the handle already. I read the instructions thoroughly and reviewed the included cards as well. The packaging and presentation gave my confidence this was a good company that stood behind its product. I filled a freshly cleaned glass jar with 3 parts alcohol and1 part water, as suggested, and sterilized each piece for 30 minutes. Once sterile, I carefully removed them to a plate where they were allowed to fully dry. It is best to use a hair dryer to speed the process, but the sink was directly over a heat vent, so they dried pretty quickly. Do not use a towel or anything with lint. You will never get it clean again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Upon first handling the rollers to assemble them, I was probably a little careless and pricked my fingers several times. It’s easy to do if you aren’t careful. Upon even closer inspection, I realized this little device looked like something from a torture scene, but I decided it couldn’t be that bad. Boy was I wrong! I had seen videos of people rolling their faces, tummies, legs, thighs, arms, breasts all with serious veracity… I decided I’d start with my inner thighs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I read you are supposed to roll:&lt;br /&gt;up-down, up-down, up-down;&lt;br /&gt;left-right, left-right, left-right;&lt;br /&gt;criss-cross, criss-cross, criss-cross;&lt;br /&gt;criss-cross the other way, criss-cross the other way, criss-cross the other way several times.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I’ve seen that:&lt;br /&gt;turning red is expected.&lt;br /&gt;puncture holes are expected.&lt;br /&gt;even bleeding is expected.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But you are not trying to turn yourself into hamburger meat either. There is a line. I have also read that there may be some discomfort. This is the part I had found to be misleading. I am a pretty tough chick, and I can handle more pain than most. This downright hurt like crazy. I wanted to cry. And what’s worse, I had track marks all over my inner thighs and abdomen for days. Lotion burned. Sweat stung. Even soap hurt. But my abdomen healed up within a few days and seemed tighter after one rolling session. My thighs took longer to heal (still healing in some spots), and I’m sure I probably didn’t do it correctly, but I wouldn’t do that again without numbing cream. I used a combination of the pink 1.5mm roller and the teal 1.0mm roller. What I liked about the 1.5mm roller was how wide across it was compared to others I’d seen. It is intended to cover more surface without having to roll for a longer period of time, which is nice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All-in-all, I’ve seen some amazing results from others and would definitely try to make this a once a week or once every two weeks thing, but I wouldn’t suggest it without numbing cream. I could always be much less aggressive with my rolling, but I don’t know that it would be nearly as effective. I haven’t tried the smallest one made for your face (0.5mm), but I don’t have many facial issues. I do see this being helpful for stretch marks and cellulite, however, and even other skin issues. Puruskin guarantees results in 10 uses. I haven’t made it there yet, but when I do, I will update. To rehydrate my clean, rolled skin, I used a mixture of shea butter, coconut oil, jojoba oil and essential oils I whipped into a butter and it felt heavenly. If you do try derma rolling, be sure to get yours from a reputable company such as Puruskin, don’t ever share yours, disinfect properly, and often, and toss it after 6 months (the needles will get dull on you).</li>
            <li> a little wierd.  only used once so far...we&#x27;ll see</li>
            <li> very happy with my dermaroller</li>
            <li> This was a MUCH higher quality product than I anticipated.  I really think this thing is working on me!  Already see slight changes for better in my skin!  Can&#x27;t wait to see what changes have come in 6 months!</li>
            <li> Item as described ! I am very pleased with this product. I have used the 1.0 on my face a couple of times and it did not hurt at all. It is too early to see any improvement in my skin but I will continue to use it. If and when I see any results I will post my progress. When this one gets old or worn out I will be reordering. Prompt shipping !!</li>
            <li> Does just what it says.  Great E directions..</li>
            <li> Notice no improvements at all, however improvements take months..... Have only used it 3 times.</li>
            <li> I think it makes already a difference. I also do facial exercises. Great combination. Great price for what you get!</li>
            <li> Great, great, great, instant results. Be sure to be extremely gentle the first sevearal sessions due to the skin is adapting to this new technology. Redness and slight irritation are normal. Apply a good skin treatment following the dermal session. Awesome invention....♡♡♡</li>
            <li> Once I received my roller I was excited until I open the box, it&#x27;s very intimidating, but once I started it was no big deal.  Rolling wasn&#x27;t painful and seriously compares to doing microdermabrasion on the sensitive parts of your face.  I have set my calendar on my phone to let me know when it&#x27;s time to roll again, can&#x27;t wait to see results</li>
            <li> As an Aesthetician I viewed many videos and read many reviews before buying it.  The dermaroller combined with a high quality pharmaceutical grade serum is a great tool to have available for my clients and to keep my own skin in the greatest condition possible. Completely satisfied ;)</li>
            <li> Like the ease of use....Delivery was quick and aids to learn more are offered...great back up, for me as this is all new...As senior this is another fun toy am trying to look my best...We can&#x27;t turn the hands of time back but, are able to slow it way down...and you feel better in the process. Do protect your skin with sun screen as you will be getting new tender skin just like a baby&#x27;s skin...so protect it...Found it not to be painful at all and no need to over due it.. results follow your care! Will report back in time to update on my process. Watched several you-tube videos and many do not follow guide lines, me happy to follow PURUSKIN suggestions. Results take time but, also safer for me and you see your results in a fair amount of time. Recovery of 12 hours and you will see in morning how much fresher your skin looks...it gets better daily....Using it once a week for me as I am in no hurry....enjoy the time for yourself....Thanks for Derma Roller.</li>
            <li> I think the product is very good, although I have not seen any improvement in my skin yet, just started using it.</li>
            <li> Love this product! Seeing results that&#x27;s for sure. Had one small issue but it was corrected right away! Definitely a seller you can trust! 😊</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t speak about the results yet since I just got it, but after trying this product for the first time, I felt like giving my thoughts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had a 1.0 mm roller from a different prior to this one, and I&#x27;ve been using it for awhile. The needles didn&#x27;t look bent or anything, but it HURT. And it was really troubling since all these Youtube reviews and celebrity endorsements said it was just supposed to feel like pinching. Since I didn&#x27;t really have sensitive skin at least on my cheeks (if you said the nose, eye or forehead area where there&#x27;s little fat, then I&#x27;d understand), I thought that was odd. And after months of using it, I never really got accustomed to it, and my eyes still watered up. But I kept using it because my face was red and it felt like it was working, even though it hurt so much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But I figured I should get a new one since I&#x27;d had the other for awhile and so even if I couldn&#x27;t see it, the needles could have worn down or something--plus, I was unable to roll the more sensitive parts of my face. I decided to get this set because there was variability in the needle lengths, so I could use the smaller 0.5 mm roller for my nose, temples, and other places that were was much, much, much too sensitive for the 1.0 mm roller that I had.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I got it, I first used the 1.0 mm head for my cheeks which have a lot of depressed/pitted/boxcar/pockmark acne scars. But to my surprise, it really didn&#x27;t hurt. With my old roller, it hurt after rolling it 3 or so times, and I couldn&#x27;t really roll it back and forth and so would pick it up and only roll one way because somehow it felt less chaotic and painful. But with this Puruskin one, I could roll it like 10 times front and back, side to side, etc. etc., and I&#x27;d feel perfectly fine except a little agitation to show that it was working. I didn&#x27;t have to keep a light hand like my old one, but use normal or even stronger force. I could even use it on the top of my nose, forehead, and temples without too much pain. Just that fact alone made me realize that maybe my old one was wrong and it was not supposed to hurt so badly--like most of the reviews had been saying.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t really care about the different width sizes, and it&#x27;s actually not all that helpful for the small one because the shaft of the roller is too long and there&#x27;s not that much of a height difference with the needles and the end shaft holder, so the shaft holder ends wind up hitting things like your nose before the short needles can reach the skin crevice. It cancels out the usefulness. In the future, they need to make the shaft/shaft holder smaller, or the wheel diameter larger so that the shaft ends don&#x27;t prevent the needles from reaching crevices. But, while the small one isn&#x27;t that useful, the larger one is nice since it covers more surface area for bodily use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also really like how they have this small little container for all of the other heads, which locks onto the head so it won&#x27;t fall out if you knock it over (though that kinda scared me at first since you need to use force to get it out and I thought I&#x27;d break it). You also use it to clean the head by filling it with rubbing alcohol and water and letting it sit, which is nice since I don&#x27;t need to get another container or something (my old derma roller didn&#x27;t have something like that since there were no detachable heads). However, I don&#x27;t like how the container is open, so dust or something could still fly in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, besides the open containers and the less maneuverable 0.5 mm head which are easy to fix, I really like everything else. The handle is super ergonomic, the color differences in the different needle lengths/sizes are aesthetically appealing, the variability in sizes are awesome and weirdly hard to find elsewhere, and the lack of pain is mind blowing (for me. Who did not know it was not supposed to hurt that badly). Assuming it does what a derma roller does, I&#x27;m sure the results will come in a few months, and with a lot less pain.</li>
            <li> I have used this twice and love it! I can see the pores opening up and feel how much more quickly my facial serum is absorbing! It his is causing you pain, you are doing it wrong! Customer care is also amazing to work with and truly want  to have an ongoing relationship with you to ensure that you are getting the very best results in the safest manner!</li>
            <li> Very strong and sturdy. It&#x27;s what I expected</li>
            <li> I receive my order and follow the directions in the e book  from that the company rep sent and link to a You tube video also. Puruskin rep sent in an email and provided me with a note if I had any question I can follow up with her through the same email after a couple days she re email checking on how I like purchase. Ok now to the use on roller I read many reviews stating they were bleeding they had to be rolling to hard in the video as we&#x27;ll as ebook its stated to roll with light pressure 4 time up/down then side to side  holding skin taunt and roll as would if playing a tic tac toe game area only should be pink to light red (you know that area was done properly) I used emu oil as after using device (they do have products they recommend Argan oil and some product they offer for different uses on boy like Vit C (etc) I will do a update can say if it work because I only use 1 time (only have a week) the product was packed properly in seal bags with other roller in separate boxes.</li>
            <li> have had the opportunity to try the 3-in-1 Interchangeable Derma Roller by Puruskin. Derma Rollers help with the appearance of acne scars, stretch marks, wrinkles, fine lines, dark spots and hyper-pigmentation. It is becoming a popular spa treatment but it is quite expensive to have a single treatment at the spa or dermatologist.  With this Enhanced Total Body Kit you can use the rollers on your body, your face and around your eyes and nose areas with the interchangeable heads.  The 1.5mm head which has 1200 titanium needles is great for use on larger body areas, like legs, stomach, arms, etc. I have seen people use this larger head on stretch marks or scars with really great results.  The 1.0mm head has 600 titanium needles and is ideal for the majority of the facial area, it treats wrinkles and acne scars.  The .5 mm head which has 180 titanium needles is intended for use around the eyes and nose area, also to treat wrinkles and scars.  It’s very simple to use. Clean the head by soaking in alcohol for 5 minutes. Then roll on the skin in a vertical, horizontal and diagonal pattern, going back and forth about 10-15 times each direction. When I used the derma roller I had a little bit of redness after use, but nothing that lasted. It states that it is normal to see blood spots after use, which should go away soon and not be bothersome, but I did not experience that.  I really liked how it made my skin improve, it looked healthier after several uses and I will use as a regular part of my skin care routine. After use I soak it for another 5 minutes in alcohol and then leave it to dry.  This derma roller helps you to save time and money by using it at home and it gives you great results.  How does it feel? At first thought it sounds like it would be painful, but it is not. Of course you feel tiny pin pricks but I wouldn’t say it’s painful. It’s oddly satisfying to use. I usually use it on my face while watching tv, and I start with my cheek area and then my chin, other cheek area, nose area, etc. I did use it on my forehead and it was sore the next couple days, so I do not use it on my forehead anymore.  Some say that your regular skincare is more effective after using the derma roller. I’m not sure this is true, but I do know that it did improve my skin texture.  If you would like to improve your skins texture or get rid of acne scars, scars in general or stretch marks, give it a try. It’s a safe and effective way to treat your skin.  *I received this product for free for my unbiased review.</li>
            <li> Arrived promptly. I&#x27;ve really liked the product so far- it&#x27;s certainly well made and seems sturdy. Easy to use, and I&#x27;m seeing decent results even with short term use. Would recommend</li>
            <li> I heard of Derma roller, but I wasn&#x27;t sure if I could tolerate the needles. Instead of going to a medi spa, I opted to do it myself at home. I read the instructions that were sent to me as an ebook.  The instructions were very detailed and helpful especially if you&#x27;ve never used one before.  I didn&#x27;t use a numbing gel and kind of wish I did. The sensation is pretty painful at first, but you do get to a point where it&#x27;s tolerable. After I finished rolling my entire face, I put on a vitamin C serum I purchased from Amazon. It made my face feel very smooth and I could tell my skin was brighter already. I have seen a noticeable improvement to the texture of my skin and the amount of old scars. I would recommend this item to anyone!</li>
            <li> I received the derma roller and am extremely pleased with the item.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve only used to roller once so far, but I&#x27;m already seeing/feeling the&lt;br /&gt;results!  Thanks so much for the ebook.  It was extremely helpful and made&lt;br /&gt;my initial rolling experience a lot less stressful!!</li>
            <li> Love my derma rollers! Should have started doing this years ago. My skin looks and feels wonderful. Easy to do, must use good products before, during and after for best results.  I&#x27;ve been now trying on body areas and see improvements there too! This is exceptional!</li>
            <li> I am a professional Esthetician trained in micro-needling &amp; I dec to give this device a try. I&#x27;ve used it once on my face &amp; noticed more taughtness &amp; plumpness already. I also have 2 scars from mole removal done wrong :( I used it on both areas. It did improve the scar on my stomach but the one on my arm I have seen improvement yet. The customer service of this company is amazing!! I had an issue &amp; they corrected it right away. I feel well taken care of by them &amp; I intend to keep doing business with them.</li>
            <li> I waited to review this product (despite several emails from the company urging me to write a review mere days after receiving the roller) mostly so I had time to see if there were results.  And there are!  I love this thing.  Yes, it&#x27;s painful when you&#x27;re doing it.  Yes, sometimes you bleed (when I&#x27;m rolling my shins, where I have several scars and spider veins), but IT IS WORTH IT.  For the past few years I&#x27;ve been dealing with the most obnoxious adult acne - it didn&#x27;t seem to matter what lotions or potions I used; if it was a certain time of the month, my chin was a MESS.  Some of the zits resulted in scars from my constant picking.  I use the face roller once a week and I have not gotten zits in the two months I&#x27;ve been rolling.  TWO MONTHS ZIT-FREE.  My skin also looks and feels younger, tighter, and more defined.  I have less lines on my forehead and around my eyes.  My shins have started to show results, too.  They&#x27;re not perfect, but they look better.  I&#x27;m working up the courage to use the body roller on more parts...again, it can hurt, so it&#x27;s not exactly a joyful exercise.  But the difference is TOTALLY WORTH IT.</li>
            <li> Awesome product&lt;br /&gt;Saw a difference in my skin right away</li>
            <li> I received my roller a few days ago and used it today. The results were amazing. After the redness subsided (about and hour after I rolled) I noticed a difference in my skin and my family did too. It doesn&#x27;t hurt like one might think, it&#x27;s more of an annoying sensation than a painful one. I plan on ordering more for my mom and other family members.</li>
            <li> When I first received this product for free to review, I knew very little about it.  I had seen some people advertise it from a direct sales company for a MUCH higher cost, but didn&#x27;t know what it did, or really, what it even was.  After a quick text to my dermatologist, who stated it was likely safe, I decided to try it out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This roller comes with a user manual, the roller handle and three heads: one for the eye area, one for the face, and one for the body. The eye area has needles that are 0.5mm and 180 needles, the face one has 1.0mm needles and 600 needles and the body has 1.5mm and 1200 needles.  They are easily interchangeable and are color coded to make it easy to remember which is which.  The needles are titanium.  The idea behind the product is that the needles penetrate the hard epidermal layer of the skin, and use of the product will create hundreds of new channels that break just below the skins surface.  This way products can be absorbed at a greater rate.  The benefits listed include  that it gently exfoliates unhealthy skin cells, stimulates blood flow to surface, massages the skin, cleans our pores, stimulates collagen re-growth, and increases skin absorption rate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The uses manual gives instructions to prepare the roller, use the roller properly, after treatment care, cleaning, side effects, and safety.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In using this product, I realized I&#x27;m a huge baby.  This made my eyes water and I thought it stung quite a bit, however, the sting doesn&#x27;t last.  Almost as soon as you feel it, the sting is gone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve only been using this product for a short time so I&#x27;m not sure how well it works long-term, but I&#x27;ve heard great things about them.  If you&#x27;re interested in one, this is a great one to choose and definitely the best price!</li>
            <li> Dermarolling used to be thought of as a craze but now it&#x27;s well established as a valid skincare essential in the united states.

You buy one &amp; different sized heads are included in the box. You use what you need as you need it! Genius!!! Whoever decided to come up with this approach was really thinking with the customer in mind not their wallet in mind &amp; I for one love it! I&#x27;m already a derma rolling fan but this idea here makes me really excited! As a blogger I received a complementary sample of this product in exchange for my honest &amp; unbiased opinion. All thoughts &amp; opinions are mine &amp; mine alone.</li>
            <li> I finally had to opportunity to try my&lt;br /&gt;dermaroller for the first time yesterday. I am not sure what to expect, but&lt;br /&gt;so far, I am extremely pleased. I used the 1.0 head that was already&lt;br /&gt;attached and I am not certain if I was aggressive enough, but did feel some&lt;br /&gt;tingling and experienced redness. I immediately put on my regular facial&lt;br /&gt;products afterward and it felt as though it went deeply into my skin. I&lt;br /&gt;tried not to think about it but later on, I realized that my face was no&lt;br /&gt;longer red and feeling very smooth and nourished. Amazing! I am excited to&lt;br /&gt;see the end results. Unfortunately, I forgot to do a before picture, but I&lt;br /&gt;plan to start documenting my progression as of today.</li>
            <li> The idea of derma rolling is very new to me. I had briefly heard about it before I began the 30 day journey of testing this product for the company in exchange for an unbiased review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In order to best understand this product, how it worked for me, and how it may work for you I am going to break down my review of the product into various facets to ensure I am sharing with you my entire experience and all of the details.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What Is A Derma Roller And What Are Its Benefits?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A derma roller is a product that uses tiny high quality titanium needles to penetrate the hard epidermal layer of the skin. In doing so, hundreds of channels just below the skin&#x27;s surface are opened up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The benefits of this are:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Gentle exfoliation of unhealthy skin cells&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Stimulation of blood flow to the surface&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Deep cleans pores&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Stimulates collagen re-growth&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Increases skin&#x27;s absorption rate&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My First Use Of The Derma Roller&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So if you&#x27;re anything like me you read the word needles and you were immediately turned off. Anyone who knows me intimately knows that needles are not my thing. I was the child who had to have 5 nurses hold her down just to get a shot, so why on earth would I derma roll? Hold on, I&#x27;ll explain (and trust me it&#x27;s not as bad as it sounds!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Before using the product there are instructions to sterilize it (a 15-20 minute process). You also need to make sure your skin is cleansed and your hands are clean. Once that has been done you can begin the process.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This particular derma roller comes with three different sized roller heads. The 1.5mm head is supposed to be used for larger areas like the thighs. The 1.0mm head is to be used to smaller areas like the face. Meanwhile, the 0.5mm head (the most painful) is to be used for tiny areas like under the eyes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It came assembled with the 1.0mm head attached to the base so I started with that one. Visually the derma roller didn&#x27;t look that intimidating. The needles are tiny and so I wasn&#x27;t too turned off. The directions suggest rolling the derma roller 5 or six times in each direction (up &amp; down, side to side, and diagonally). So I started on my cheek and I can admit that it wasn&#x27;t comfortable at first, but also not painful. I&#x27;d describe it as having kitten claws casually glide across (not scratch or dig into, but glide across) the face (sounds intense, but it&#x27;s not I promise). Like, no one really enjoys a kitten walking across the face, but you also aren&#x27;t screaming in pain because of it either. After the first few rolls I adjusted to it and it didn&#x27;t feel bad at all. The same for the other cheek and the chin area. The forehead was a bit more sensitive because there&#x27;s less fat and tissue there so it made me cringe a tad, but not painful enough to keep me from doing it again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I then moved on to the 1.5mm derma roller head on my thigh/buns area. Again I made sure the area was clean and the product was sanitized before use. On that area I felt no pain at all. It felt like more of a gentle massage or even just like it would if you were to scratch an itch. This is likely because there is more fat and tissue down there so it absorbs the needles a bit better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I finally moved on the the 0.5mm derma roller head I quickly determined that I would not be using that one again. For me, incredibly painful. The needles are much smaller and the under eye area is surprisingly very sensitive. So I ceased to use this roller head for the remaining 30 days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Immediate Results After First Use&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Immediately after using the skin is red because it has been agitated by and penetrated by the needles. Also, I noted a tingling sensation (particularly on the face) that lasted for up to 30 minutes. Other than that, the real results have to be observed after  use over a specific length of time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Results I Was Looking To See&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In order to better compare my results, let me share with you exactly what my &amp;#34;problem areas&amp;#34; were and what I was looking to see as a result of using this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On my face, the primary use of the roller was to aid in the healing of scars and dark spots left from old acne. I was looking for the derma roller to help lighten those scars by exfoliating that dead skin and stimulating blood flow. On my hips buns, I have a series of stretch marks that I was hoping to see some fading of again my stimulating blood flow and collagen re-growth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Actual Results&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After a 30 day period I can say that I have noticed some positive changes in my skin, particularly my face. There is some lightening of dark spots and acne scars, with some of the lighter areas virtually gone after just 30 days. I can also say that my skin has broken out less in the past 30 days which I attribute to the deep cleaning of the pores that the derma roller offers. Additionally, my pores (which are traditionally huge) seemed to shrink to me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As far as the stretch marks are concerned, I think I would need a lot more time to see any significant change since those marks are a lot deeper. Because I know my body I can say I&#x27;ve seen slight (very slight) lightening of the marks but that change wouldn&#x27;t be noticeable to anyone else.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Helpful Hints That Helped Me Achieve Better Results&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Stick to a rolling schedule: The only way you can begin to see results is if you set up a regular rolling schedule and stick to it. Rolling every now and then will likely not produce any significant change. I chose 3 times a week (kind of an every other day schedule) and that worked well for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Moisturize : It is recommended that you use a serum that is designed to deeply moisturize the skin (as your skin&#x27;s absorption is heightened right after derma rolling). This product came with a coupon for Argan Oil which is fine, but I actually used a Vitamin C serum which I can say contributed to the results I saw on my face. The Vitamin C serum is designed to help brighten and even skin tone and moisturize as well so it seemed like the right choice for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Keep roller heads sanitized: It is vital that you sanitize these roller heads and store them properly after every use. These needles are penetrating your skin and if you aren&#x27;t cleaning them properly you very well could be helping dirt and bacteria go deeper into the skin. Not good!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Don&#x27;t go too hard: By this I simply mean fight the urge to roll harder on your skin than is necessary. The first time I used it on my thighs I went really hard (because it felt good to me) and I actually left scratches in my skin that took about a week to heal. All you have to do is roll (regularly) in various directions and you&#x27;ll get the results.imary use of the roller was to aid in the healing of scars and dark spots left from old acne.

The Vitamin C serum is designed to help brighten and even skin tone and moisturize as well so it seemed like the right choice for me.  - Keep roller heads sanitized: It is vital that yousanitize these roller heads and store them properly after every use. These needles are penetrating your skin and if you aren&#x27;t cleaning them properly you very well could be helping dirt and bacteria go deeper into the skin. Not good!  - Don&#x27;t go too hard: By this I simply mean fight the urge to roll harder on your skin than is necessary. The first time I used it on my thighs I went really hard (because it felt good to me) and I actually left scratches in my skin that took about a week to heal. All you have to do is roll (regularly) in various directions and you&#x27;ll get the results.</li>
            <li> Received the item in one box about three days after ordered. All items inside are sealed and without damages. Opened the 1.0mm immediately and followed the instructions as I was excited to see results. At first there was a little irritation as my skin adapts to the roller, but there is really no pain or bruises. I actually tried it first on my forehead on the first night to see any side effects but there was none, so I proceeded on my entire face and my balding head the next day. A temporary reddening was observed for a few hours after use but then it vanished.&lt;br /&gt;after using the roller, I placed hyaluronic acid and then a moisturizer n my face afterwards while I placed a hair lotion for my head. I noticed first time a refreshing cooling of my head after the lotion which I never felt before. While on my face, there was a tingling sensation after I placed the moisturizer. Seems working. After about 3 days I&#x27;m seeing good results. I will continue observing developments and will make a follow-up review after a few weeks. Great product and great early results.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great, I love my skin.</li>
            <li> Good price and useful</li>
            <li> Great customer service (5 star)!  I do think this is finally beginning to work to for me. It did take 3 months of weekly to use to see some results. It is painful (at first) for me, but I have super sensitive skin and surprisingly got used to it from just using weekly. No residual redness or irritation by the next morning. It has 3 cases to hold each head which is great and seems to be good quality. The wheel for the eye area is too big to get under the eye easily, but the other 2 rollers are really easy to use and the right size. I am going to keep using this. I slacked a little after not seeing miraculous early results but now that I&#x27;ve noticed a positive change will begin using again. 4 stars because the eye wheel is too akward</li>
            <li> I have used the rollers only twice &amp; I can see a difference around my eyes.  I am excited to see the results after 10 uses!  I think I have just saved myself a few hundred dollars by not having to have professional treatments, i.e. chemical peels or laser treatments.  I highly recommend this product!</li>
