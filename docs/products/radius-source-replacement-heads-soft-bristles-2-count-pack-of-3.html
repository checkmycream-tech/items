            <li> However, the heads do not last very long.</li>
            <li> Definitely not the same material from a few years back.</li>
            <li> As expected.</li>
            <li> The plastic material is fragile, it broke twice for the past 6 months.</li>
            <li> I have been using Radius tooth brushes for a few years.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m set for a year at least now!</li>

            <li> I bought a lot of replacement heads so I don&#x27;t have to think about it for a while. Love the toothbrush.</li>
            <li> I love the handle for this toothbrush, and have changed the heads a number of times.  The handle is rounded and has some heft to it, and the head can be inserted for lefties or righties.  It is a very soft bristle, with a nice, oval shape.  This last purchase was the best price yet.</li>

            <li> Awesome toothbrush. It massages your gums while you brush. I have been cavity free for 10 years now using the Radius toothbrush. My dentist says to just keep doing what I&#x27;m doing.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend getting the Radius toothbrush and replacements. The actual toothbrush lasts for years and all you have to do is replace the heads. It&#x27;s earth-friendly and economical.</li>
            <li> this is a very good product</li>
