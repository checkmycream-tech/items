            <li>Idk all I can say I&#x27;d it worked great for me</li>
            <li>/&gt;Personally, I haven&#x27;t experienced any skin darkening (bummer, I&#x27;d like to skip using eyeliner LOL) or sting/</li>
            <li>so it&#x27;s great to have an inexpensive product that I can use.</li>
            <li>In the morning I apply it before my mascara, and they work great</li>

            <li>you want thicker, longer, fuller, more voluminous lashes just give this a try!!</li>
            <li>The price was very nice, I have been using it for 2 weeks, and I can noticeable see longer lashes.  </li>
            <li>This product is actually very nice.</li>
            <li>For the money, a very nice product.</li>

            <li>For the price, I am impressed and will be ordering more.</li>
            <li>but 2 months my lashes grew in so lovely beautifully!!</li>
            <li>great product works good</li>
            <li>Yet after applying it twice a day for two weeks, I think this is really an effective products!</li>
            <li>The serum has a pleasant smell, and it does not irritate my eyes</li>
            <li>Otherwise it works great and the price couldn&#x27;t be better!</li>
            <li>Honestly I did see growth in my eyelashes and the length is noticeable, so I am happy about that.</li>
            <li>I just started this and it feels good on my lashes.&lt;br</li>
            <li>this was a good price</li>
            <li>All good comments are lie about it.</li>
            <li>Good moisturizer</li>
            <li>The two pack is a convenient way to purchase your serum @ a good price.</li>
            <li>Researched for a while to find a good product to restore and grow my lashes and came across this one on Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have to say that I absolutely loved it</li>
            <li>I returned from a 2 week vacation &amp; took a closer look &amp; noticed my eyelashes weren&#x27;t looking so good</li>
            <li>Good product.</li>
            <li>To me, the serum appears to be good for eyelashes.  </li>
            <li>but it does appear to be good for eyelashes.  </li>
            <li>Good value for the price.</li>
            <li>Considering the price, this was a good deal.</li>
            <li>I think it&#x27;s just good for your lashes.</li>
            <li>I should of known they were too good to be true for the awesome price.</li>
            <li>so I wanted them to be exceptional.</li>
            <li>Love love love!!!</li>
            <li>I am very satisfied with the product.</li>
            <li>I am very satisfied with my purchase.</li>
            <li>I was very pleased.</li>
            <li>I am so pleased and happy with this.</li>
            <li>Itu has a great price to match, you can&#x27;t find a better deal.</li>
            <li>Very nice product, Easy to apply, smells good</li>
            <li>To show you how good this stuff works, I was getting my makeup done by a celeb makeup artist and they did not want to add mascara because they thought my lashes looked so good :)</li>
            <li>I always purchase more because it does work!</li>
            <li>Ok!</li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>I love this stuff!</li>

            <li>I love this stuff!</li>
            <li>love it!</li>
            <li>I love that they are thicker!</li>
            <li>I love it!  </li>
            <li>but this product DOES work wonderfully and absolutely speeds up the process, and helps fill in your brows where you thought you couldn&#x27;t grow hair!</li>
            <li>Absolutely love this product!</li>
            <li>I could FOR SURE tell a difference!</li>
            <li>I love this stuff!</li>
            <li>I love this stuff!</li>
            <li>I LOVE IT!</li>
            <li>I am SUPER EXCITED!!!!</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s great and so easy to use.</li>
            <li>Amazing</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, this product is amazing and when it runs out (even though it comes alot in a tube and there were two in one order)</li>
            <li>- the results are amazing.  </li>
            <li>The price for it is amazing</li>
            <li>This is an AMAZING PRODUCT.</li>
            <li>(I wish I could afford Latisse because it works AMAZINGLY) as a conditioner at night.</li>
            <li>When I opened it I thought it was going to be like a liquid eyeliner kind of thing</li>
            <li>I also did not have any problems wearing the serum under my mascara, in fact, it seemed to enhance the look of my mascara, kind of like a primer.</li>
            <li>This honestly did not work for me.</li>
            <li>Honestly it looks like I have on lash extensions.</li>
            <li>The shipping arrived before the scheduled time which was nice.</li>
            <li>Honestly don&#x27;t know how they got it on the market.</li>
            <li>an the scent is really nice.</li>
            <li>My eyebrows are filling in nicely as well.</li>
            <li>It made my eye lashes grow a good amount but used more than recommended</li>
            <li>Love the product and loved the price.</li>
            <li>Love this stuff a the price is right it works!!!!</li>
            <li>Best they have looked since high school.</li>
            <li>They are full and look great</li>
            <li>Very pleased :)</li>
            <li>(it&#x27;s a very light scent), goes on smooth, and is great as a mascara primer-</li>
            <li>So I am definitely impressed with this thus far!</li>
            <li>Now I mst say my lashes are growing, much more noticeable and I am absolutely pleased with the product!</li>
            <li>This is a great product and even though I know I&#x27;ll have to basically use it for life to maintain the lash growth, at this price it&#x27;s entirely worth it.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t even use mascara in case the product would work better on its own, but that didn&#x27;t make a difference.</li>
            <li>like in the corner of your eyes and right on the edge of the cheek bone, which looks either like dirt or like a shadow, not an attractive look.</li>
            <li>Love love love this stuff!</li>
            <li>TRY IT and you&#x27;ll be glad you did! :) :)</li>
            <li>Overall it is a great product for a great price, and I will be ordering it again,</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t see a difference, I knew it was too good to be true...</li>
            <li>I gave it a 2 because it IS a good primer, and not a bad price for a primer.</li>
            <li>just been using for 2 weeks now, very cheap price</li>
            <li>and I can see a huge difference!</li>
            <li>I use it more as an eyelash conditioner than a lash grower.  </li>
            <li>No change in length or more lashes.</li>
            <li>Love this serum.  </li>
            <li>but I&#x27;ve heard that Castor oil works better.</li>
            <li>love it</li>
            <li>I LOVE LOVE this product.</li>
            <li>Rapidlash did seem to work a lot better.</li>
            <li>In the matter of 4 weeks my lashes grew longer and there was more volume to them.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think i need any more growth</li>
            <li>My eyelashes seem to be longer and pop out more.  </li>
            <li>I am really pleased.</li>
            <li>I got more and gave one to my mom and seeing how it works on her.</li>
            <li>not too sure that it works to thicken eyelashes, maybe works as a conditioner</li>
            <li>This is what I have learned from experience with many lash growth products..</li>
            <li>AND AFTER MAYBE A MONTH YOU WILL START NOTICING MORE AND</li>
            <li>AS WELL:)</li>
            <li>This stuff is fabulous!</li>
            <li>I do love the way it feels.</li>
            <li>I dont see any more length or thickness but the lashes appear to be more moisturized which helps somewhat with their appearance.  </li>
            <li>I would recommend this product as a beginning in the search for better eyelashes-</li>
            <li>so I don&#x27;t know if it takes 4 or more weeks</li>
            <li>I am glad I did.</li>
            <li>when using this the brush took it off and it was filled with mascara as time passed so watch out for that!</li>
            <li>I use this on my lashes mostly on weekends</li>
            <li>After seeing my eyelashes grow, I finally put on mascara after 1 month and my best friend noticed immediately.  </li>
            <li>I notice them more when I use mascara.</li>
            <li>Really love this lash conditioner.</li>
            <li>I have tried many lash growth products.  </li>
            <li>After 2 weeks of using it twice a day, the results weren&#x27;t as grand as the packaging says.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s just not as grand results as you would think it should be.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s inexpensive and works better than rapid lash in my opinion.</li>
            <li>you&#x27;ll be able to find this store and purchase this yourself instead of buying online.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love this...</li>
            <li>I purchased this product seeing all the great reviews but didnt expect much from it</li>
            <li>surely ordering it again.&lt;br /&gt;but</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll probably order more.</li>
            <li>Just had to get in the habit to put it on. :)</li>
            <li>My lashes are ok but this serum has given me more length.  </li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t noticed any thickening not that that was what I was hoping to achieve and that may happen after more time</li>
            <li>Btw, I&#x27;m buying more.</li>
            <li>At my age (over 60) I wanted more than the stubby ones I had.  </li>
            <li>Love this product and its price.  </li>
            <li>but mostly it did lengthen them.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great if you don&#x27;t want to wear much makeup, but want your eyelashes to Stand out some.</li>
            <li>am ordering 6 orders for Christmas gifts for my female friends - what a great find &amp; so inexpensive!!!</li>
            <li>so I wasnt sure it was working.</li>
            <li>Like I said I wasnt sure it was working until I put on mascara.</li>
            <li>Cheaper than most products on the market.</li>
            <li>My innermost top eyelashes and my lower eyelashes also seem to have grown a bit.</li>
            <li>The product is outstanding.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>i have already bought more just</li>
            <li>I love this product.  </li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m glad I did it.</li>
            <li>I just ordered two more bottles.</li>
            <li>It does make my lashes look longer and better conditioned.</li>
            <li>my eyelashes are more noticible</li>
            <li>and I absolutely love</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s okay - I suppose it nourishes the eyelashes somewhat but have seen no difference in length</li>
            <li>I will look much more closely at it.  </li>
            <li>OK for the price I suppose.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m glad about that.  </li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t sure what to expect.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s as cheap as it can be..worth a try!</li>
            <li>It really works great under mascara, it is better than my mascara primer.</li>
            <li>Just to be able to write this in this review, I stopped using the product.</li>
            <li>I never thought something that would be so cheap would work so well!</li>
            <li>I am going to purchase more and give my mom a bottle BC</li>
            <li>its so cheap!</li>
            <li>Great if it works for others as it&#x27;s reasonably priced.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s just make them healthy</li>
            <li>/&gt;Update: November 2, 2013.&lt;br /&gt;So I&#x27;ve been using this since April 2013 (just ordered three more bottles a month or so ago)</li>
            <li>I love tis product.</li>
            <li>I love this product</li>
            <li>After one week I saw more results than 4 months of latisse.</li>
            <li>(Will post more in about a month)</li>
            <li>I think its okay</li>
            <li>:)</li>
            <li>Truthfully.</li>
            <li>but I want more :) so I use the serum every day as a primer.</li>
            <li>but I would say this was the cherry on top.  </li>
            <li>will buy some more :)</li>
            <li>You also have to apply it twice a day instead of once a day like the Ardel, which I LOVE.</li>
            <li>I do too :)</li>
            <li>This is my second order from this seller and I am very happy.</li>
            <li>Since I had been using something else that seemed to work better, but then I ran out and figured I&#x27;d try this brand.</li>
            <li>This is just a conditioner nothing more.</li>
            <li>and i think i like it better .</li>
            <li>Make sure you take care of the edges.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>it ok, would not purchase it again</li>
            <li>OK, I love this stuff and use it on my eyebrows.  </li>
            <li>Budget friendly and effective.</li>
            <li>So far, so good!</li>
            <li>it was a pretty good purchase for the price and might be buying more if the results continue.</li>
            <li>Thanks for this amazing product!</li>
            <li>Maybe a good conditioner - don&#x27;t know exactly what it does</li>
            <li>So, order it and get excited!</li>
            <li>/&gt;Other people have experienced the burning or irritation, and me having very sensitive skin did not experience any of that.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s super easy and works better than Revitalash or Latisse!  </li>
            <li>It certainly doesn&#x27;t make your eyelashes magically grow, but it works as a good and cheap primer for masquera.</li>
            <li>They are straighter, which appears longer, and they are conditioned, so my mascara goes on more smooth, which looks longer.</li>
            <li>It is cheap, and I did notice more of a fullness to my lashes when I used it.</li>
            <li>But it does work great at lengthening them as a clear mascara of sorts.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m just glad it was cheap.</li>
            <li>; I feel I&#x27;ve overpaid for this one; specially after seeing it at the 99c store!</li>
            <li>It has the best applicator(mascara brush-like) of all the other lash enhancers.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m gonna keep using it til I finish the bottle &amp; see if there&#x27;s a more significant change.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The applicator is easy to use.  </li>
            <li>came very quickly.</li>
            <li>Easy to use and inexpensive.</li>
            <li>hey, i received the delivery very quickly but the product doesn&#x27;t work..</li>
            <li>I would strongly recommend this product!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And</li>
            <li>and there doesn&#x27;t seem to be any strong fragrance to be bothersome.</li>
            <li>Love love love really works my eye</li>
            <li>gel smells pretty nice</li>
            <li>The seem more full when I apply mascara then before using the product.</li>
            <li>Good product I do see some new growth</li>
            <li>But once a day is just fine.</li>
            <li>fine hair growing where they shouldn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s moisturizing with no irritation and it&#x27;s quick to put on!</li>
            <li>I am ordering more as soon as I am done with the first!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s cheap</li>
            <li>/&gt;It was really cheap, so you should give it a try to see if it works for you.</li>
            <li>It is fragrance free and did not bother my eyes or skin.  </li>
            <li>I just wanted to try because its cheap.</li>
            <li>the price for this was so cheap.</li>
            <li>This eyelash serum goes on smooth.  </li>
            <li>I needed something to my lashes because I use mascara everyday, this serum is perfect for nights because is vitamins for my lashes.</li>
            <li>For fun we have tried many.</li>
            <li>Prior to trying this I was using Rapid ash which worked great.  </li>
            <li>If you really want nice eyelashes and brows - just spend the money and buy some Careprost -</li>
            <li>This cheap stuff is a joke.</li>
            <li>May sound so cliche</li>
            <li>/&gt;Definitely a great product, especially for the price.  </li>
            <li>its cheap its made a difference and for 99 cent for 2 bottles hey cant beat that.&lt;br /&gt;used</li>
            <li>For a cheap price, I would continue to buy and use it.</li>
            <li>I also use it on my eyebrows and they have filled in.</li>
            <li>So happy something is finally working for me.  </li>
            <li>Fortunately I didn&#x27;t spend a lot of money</li>
            <li>I thought the price for this product was cheap</li>
            <li>Quite honestly, I didn&#x27;t expect much.</li>
            <li>I had such great results and so did my fam.</li>
            <li>I give this product 4 stars because it is very in-expensive and it works with my mascara nicely.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s cheap</li>
            <li>I tried it because it was cheap</li>
            <li>It gives a nice &#x27;wet look&#x27; to your eyelashes, and is a good price.</li>
            <li>I really wanted this eyelash serum to work----the price was great and shipping was fast.  </li>
            <li>A great product for a better price compared to other types on the market.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s that fast!!!</li>
            <li>Thank you so much!!!</li>
            <li>I swear I noticed a difference after the first day!!</li>
            <li>THIS SERUM REALLY DOES WORK!!!</li>
            <li>This stuff makes your eyelashes feel so soft and strong!!</li>
            <li>i bought the product because of too many positive reviews,it was cheap</li>
            <li>I had a coworker ask if I had started wearing mascara, so it was evident to others more than to me.  </li>
            <li>Even though I got 2 tube from my first order; I already ordered 6 more to give as gifts.</li>
            <li>and I am excited to see the results in 30 days</li>
            <li>I was so excited to receive my order.  </li>
            <li>I &#x27;m sure if I were to use it daily I would have even better results than I do!</li>
            <li>Just starting using it, it feels nice on the lashes!  </li>
            <li>and I have to say that now my lashes are getting thicker, as well as retaining the length increase I originally got.</li>
            <li>&quot; I have been using this for almost a month, and am excited to say that my lashes have grown long again, and are looking great.</li>
            <li>but I am a natural blonde who disguises it lol, so I need some thicker lashes!</li>
            <li>I liked this one the most because it stays clear even when dry, does not flake, can be worn during the day, and smells good.  </li>
            <li>So cheap for such a good product.</li>
            <li>Today, 5 weeks later, my lashes are looking gorgeous and the \\&quot;bald spots\\&quot; in my eyebrows have filled in.</li>
            <li>The formula is nice and it makes my lashes very soft.</li>
            <li>Surprisingly, this product worked better than all of the other pricier treatments.  </li>
            <li>and right away I noticed length and fullness to my eyelashes!</li>
            <li>But for the price I&#x27;m not mad at all as the price was fantastic</li>
            <li>My lashes are looking so Full.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t say enough good things.  </li>
            <li>I do recommend it and the price makes it a true bargain.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t say this product isn&#x27;t good, because everyone is different.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t been able to tell to much yet.  </li>
            <li>so it&#x27;s more like a cosmetic than something that really affects the growth of lashes.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I didn&#x27;t pay much for these, think it was just a couple of bucks</li>
            <li>so I decided to tear this package open to put it to good use.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t used this for the full 30 days yet, so I don&#x27;t know if it works to make my lashes look longer</li>
            <li>But when you apply this stuff.... as directed, your eyelashes are FULL.</li>
            <li>I love it so much I purchased it for my daughters</li>
            <li>This got really good reviews which is why I bought it, especially for the price</li>
            <li>Loved this product in combination with another eyelash growth my lashes are growing back after removing my lash extensions.</li>
            <li>But if you really want longer and thicker lashes I&#x27;d recommend something with better ingredients and a proven record.</li>
            <li>I love Rapid Lash, but if you don&#x27;t need actual new growth, Select Lash is a great, super economical alternative.</li>
            <li>But this product is great, it works fast, and there are no side effects; no brittle lashes, no dry lashes...</li>
            <li>Although the smell through me off at first, its easy to get used to...</li>
            <li>It feels good, and I do feel a little bit is working, I have to wait for additional 3 more weeks to give review</li>
            <li>Arrived quickly and as stated</li>
            <li>It came in fairly quickly.</li>
            <li>Product arrived quickly and well packaged.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I think it is too mild for my skin.</li>
            <li>I have SLE, I was hoping that this Eyelash Serum would provide me adequate lashes, which I have a shortage of...</li>
            <li>My lashes are now fuller and more vibrant.</li>
            <li>My eyebrows have grown back in and look very lovely.</li>
            <li>I barely comment on Amazon, but this time I feel the need to conduct a honest review of this product!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>They are easy to curl and make my mascara look very whispy.</li>
            <li>This product is pretty good, especially considering the price.</li>
            <li>I wear makeup once a week when I go out to unwind from work and school; last night when I put on my mascara my lashes looked so long and beautiful-the best I&#x27;ve seen in awhile.</li>
            <li>I am looking for strong grow fast as.</li>
            <li>I started noticing longer lashes within the first week!</li>
            <li>I think it&#x27;s pretty legit!</li>
            <li>(I&#x27;m still using my first one!)</li>
            <li>A great little product.</li>
            <li>I have been using this product for a little while now, and I don&#x27;t think I have experienced any growth.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t really see a huge difference in length to my lashes and eyebrows</li>
            <li>but when I put my mascara on the next day it went on so amazing that they appeared longer.</li>
            <li>I read the reviews others had posted and figured it was worth a try.  </li>
            <li>Worth to try.</li>
            <li>WORTH BUYING.</li>
            <li>It is so worth</li>
            <li>I was expecting a growth type serum, but I think this was more a clear mascara.</li>
            <li>You may get the same effect just by putting coconut oil or mineral oil on your lashes, but I liked this.</li>
            <li>Well worth the money and some.</li>
            <li>For the price, it is worth a try.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s well worth it</li>
            <li>AND IT IS WORTH</li>
            <li>lashes are longer wish it thickend them up or regrowth on bottoms were they are sparse but heck worth the money i&#x27;d say.</li>
            <li>For the review and price listed, I figured this was worth a try</li>
            <li>You&#x27;d probably be better off with clear mascara.</li>
            <li>Today is the 18th, got this product on the 15th, quarter of a tube already gone, but my eyelashes are nicely lubricated which I am doing 4 times daily.  </li>
            <li>I say its worth a try to c if it works for u BC</li>
            <li>Worth noting:</li>
            <li>Their pretty full already</li>
            <li>It was worth it.</li>
            <li>and I love the results so far.</li>
            <li>I will keep applying until my eyelashes really shows the significant growth.</li>
            <li>I put it on right after my Eyelash Serum dries.</li>
            <li>right??</li>
            <li>It also burns my eyes so I have to use it right when I plan on going to bed and not in the morning.</li>
            <li>I use it in the am right when i wake up, after I wash my face, &amp; again at night after washing my face.</li>
            <li>I Put on a coat every night after i take off my makeup right before bed.</li>
            <li>Everyone who wrote about it was right</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think it works right away.</li>
            <li>I was a little worried about using a product that was so cheap, but I&#x27;m really happy with the results thus far.</li>
            <li>I would definitely recommend this product for quick and healthy looking results.  </li>
            <li>but I felt the cost excessive albeit the results were great.</li>
            <li>MY EYELASHES ARE LONG AND NICE</li>
            <li>We all have our schedules, agendas and our to do lists jammed packed, trying to keep up with the fast paced world we live in and to be honest, eyelash serum is not at the top of the list.  </li>
            <li>But it will make your lashes soft and easy to curl.</li>
            <li>Great value at such a low cost, I couldn&#x27;t be happier.</li>
            <li>So far, it&#x27;s just a nice clear mascara.</li>
            <li>I gave it a fair trial of one and a half bottles</li>
            <li>The product arrived super fast and as described.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t really notice an improvement but in all fairness I gave it three stars because I wasn&#x27;t very consistent about using it.</li>
            <li>One other very notable difference for myself anyway, is I don&#x27;t have irritation like I did with Latisse.</li>
            <li>I know that castor oil is supposed to be good at making lashes grow, but I have never had success at using just plain castor oil alone.</li>
            <li>I think it is good to keep your lashes moisturized and to help eliminate breakage from them being dry, but honestly I dont notice a difference in length or volume, maybe a little in length</li>
            <li>I have been using Select Lash for twenty days and my lashes have grown very much already.</li>
            <li>The price is very reasonable.</li>
            <li>To my surprise this product is very gentle and</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not a crazy transformation but it certainly works and fir the price</li>
            <li>Wasn&#x27;t sure what to think about trying this, as the price is so low and tempting.</li>
            <li>But I decided to give it a try and let me just tell you the product came on the first due-date \\&quot;range\\&quot; which was really soon!</li>
            <li>I really thought it wasn&#x27;t going to work!</li>
            <li>and my lashes have really been growing!</li>
            <li>I first purchased the serum in February of this year</li>
            <li>To my surprise it really does work!</li>
            <li>I could tell the first day.</li>
            <li>It came exactly as ordered with the two bottles.</li>
            <li>The only think I wish was that it made my lashes more fuller.</li>
            <li>Overall,  I am completely satisfied.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m currently on my third week of using this product and I LOVE</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m just so happy that they have grown as much as they have in such a short period of time.  </li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t see any clear results, but I&#x27;m not too upset because the price was pretty cheap.</li>
            <li>This works much better, I try to apply a coat once a day before regular mascara.</li>
            <li>I am sure hers will be the same once she get into a routine.</li>
            <li>when reading reviews for this product, many reviewers had mentioned that they saw this lash serum at the 99 Cent Only store</li>
            <li>NOT so much with this one!  </li>
            <li>I definitely notice an increase in length on my bottom lashes for sure.</li>
            <li>In combination with Rapid Lash, this products gives lashes more definition and adds a darker tint to enhance lashes even without mascara - definitely a steal for the price!!</li>
            <li>I have used this faithfully for 3 months and it seems that there are more lashes on the bottom left outer corner of my eye.  </li>
            <li>Hey, for this price I was willing to try it</li>
            <li>Used this product consistently, but my eyelashes didn&#x27;t grow a bit.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve been using it pretty consistently for two months now.</li>
            <li>i did not like it because it is gooey, so i did not use it consistently.</li>
            <li>I have been using this for almost a month and am halfway through my first tube.</li>
            <li>As cheap as it is, I&#x27;m surprised how well it works.</li>
            <li>Seeing a difference will most likely make you want to continue using it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Try</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m feeling pleased to report after a short period of once/day use I&#x27;m noticing a difference in both length &amp; fullness.</li>
            <li>But we&#x27;ll see maybe next month it will be more of a difference</li>
            <li>and I could really the difference!</li>
            <li>Ok.... i read lots of mixed reviews on this product...</li>
            <li>I will admit I was a bit sceptic at first about the product.  </li>
            <li>and it really does work!  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t even know how to explain this, but it&#x27;s like I have more individual lashes growing in now.</li>
            <li>pretty quick..using now.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m amazed I have pretty eyelashes.</li>
            <li>I am still using the first tube.</li>
            <li>, i guess thats irritation, but it doesnt exactly hurt.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m gonna say it works, cause my lashes definitely look better.  </li>
            <li>Love this so much, looks natural, lashes are so much fuller, looks much better than regular mascara.</li>
            <li>My eyelashes were so short to a point I had to put on three coats or more of mascara.</li>
            <li>Let me just say that this works, and works fast!</li>
            <li>It worked pretty well.</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m noticing some more lashes growing in or growing back already.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using it for a week now, twice a day like instructed, and it has helped my eyelashes grow so much!</li>
            <li>I most definitely have longer fuller lashes.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t think too much of it at first..</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think they make them much longer, but they look longer right after you put it on.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t expect significant fullness-what I&#x27;ve seen is a growth in length not fullness so far.</li>
            <li>It is clear and I would apply at night when my eye lashes were clean</li>
            <li>They came very fast and it works wonders my eyelashes are already so much longer than they were before I started using it</li>
            <li>This product got here pretty fast.</li>
            <li>They are not thicker but there are more lashes and they are long.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t really tell too much of a difference without mascara, but one morning when I was applying mascara--- BAM!</li>
            <li>They were watery and sensitive for a full day after using this once.</li>
            <li>and I have a good mascara day everyday!</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product &amp; will use this stuff as long as it&#x27;s available &amp; affordable to me because even us poor folk deserve to look &amp; feel our very best!</li>
            <li>this product is amazing,  i had this product less than two weeks.</li>
            <li>easy to apply, using a simple mascara type</li>
            <li>This is really good deal, and the two bottles last a long time.</li>
            <li>it certainly cant hurt.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m two weeks into using it and I notice a difference already, my lashes are longer and straighter, can&#x27;t wait to see how they look in a few more weeks!</li>
            <li>My individual lashes are not thicker but there are new lashes making the most lashes I&#x27;ve ever had at one time.</li>
            <li>New layer of lashes are also visible, which makes it overall seem more \\&quot;bushy\\&quot;.</li>
            <li>get compliments on my eyebrows all the time now - they&#x27;re back to being FULL and flattering, shaping my face in just the right way.</li>
            <li>If you are only looking for a lash conditioner, this will work just fine.</li>
            <li>So I did a little test of my own.</li>
            <li>so I went for myself and believe it or not they sell the exact same product that I am reviewing about right now!</li>
            <li>it took me 2 months before i saw the difference, but when i put my regular mascara on i saw a huge difference.</li>
            <li>While the Select Lash is a great conditioner, I can definitely continue to see areas that have not filled in.  </li>
            <li>Volume, not so much, but</li>
            <li>I saw results really fast, noticed longer lashes in 2-3 weeks.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t expect too much for the price I paid.</li>
            <li>get the real stuff</li>
            <li>IT REALLY WORKS.</li>
            <li>I havn&#x27;t  really used it all that much to see a difference.</li>
            <li>However it did come in the mail very soon.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t really increase the fullness of lashes, nor does it make them darker, but if what you&#x27;re looking for is length</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend it to anyone who has lash and brow issues!  </li>
            <li>I apply a VERY generous amount</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t expecting much since I got it at the dollar store</li>
            <li>Will let you know in a couple of weeks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: I have been wearing this and this has been really softened my lashes.</li>
            <li>I put this on at night and in the morning my lashes are ready to go.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this for about 2 months now and don&#x27;t really see a difference in length or volume.</li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t add much volume but you can always use a volumizing mascara</li>
            <li>so I hope that it is working and not secretly harming me.</li>
            <li>I really need thicker,longer lashes</li>
            <li>This works really well.</li>
            <li>but I haven&#x27;t really noticed any thickening, longer or darkening of my eyelashes.  </li>
            <li>Fast delvery of product</li>
            <li>This product &#x27;flaked&#x27; too much and irritated my eyes, so I had to stop using it.</li>
            <li>I really like this product.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re Real mascara</li>
            <li>I used it months ago and it really seem to have made a difference.  </li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>I actually really like this.</li>
            <li>This stuff works really really well</li>
            <li>so much ......</li>
            <li>but it really works.</li>
            <li>This has grown my lashes but really made a difference in my brows.</li>
            <li>When I used a cheap eyelash curler, it literally ripped out an ENTIRE gap of lashes on my lash line!</li>
            <li>Each tube is 99 cents which is so much cheaper than what the sellers are selling online.</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t really tell a difference.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s really work.</li>
            <li>it was shipped out fast, comes with 2</li>
            <li>I found this product marginally helpful in restoring thinning eyebrows, but for eyelashes, not so much.  </li>
            <li>I can really tell a difference when I put on mascara.</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t really notice a difference.  </li>
            <li>I also use it on my eyebrows and now they&#x27;re very conditioned.</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t really tell...</li>
            <li>It helps my eyelashes grow more but not much.</li>
            <li>I also tried not to use make up as much as I could so the serum would have time to work.</li>
            <li>You really have to follow directions once in the morning and evening</li>
            <li>Just think how much thicker my lashes would be if I used it twice a day as suggested on the manufacturers packaging?</li>
            <li>The shipping was fast.</li>
            <li>and if it didnt work I wasnt really out anything.</li>
            <li>(I dont get out much.</li>
            <li>selectlash was very affordable and I have been using it for three weeks once a day</li>
            <li>Not irritating</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t really notice much of a growth on my lashes, but it does wonders for my mascara.</li>
            <li>I have decided that this product is used as mu eyelash primer and not so much as a growth stimulator.</li>
            <li>I really saw no difference after month of use...</li>
            <li>Hasn&#x27;t really done anything for me.</li>
            <li>I used up a whole bottle</li>
            <li>but this one really worked for me.</li>
            <li>This did absolutely NOTHING for my lashes.</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t do much for me.</li>
            <li>- I should have read more carefully -</li>
            <li>Because I really like this product and because I believe it works so well, I decided to upload 2 pics -</li>
            <li>it really makes a difference in your appearance.  </li>
            <li>Really nothing.&lt;br /&gt;Good</li>
            <li>didn&#x27;t spend too much..</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this product for two weeks twice a day as instructed..and it has really made my eyelashes look longer.</li>
            <li>It feels like I&#x27;m really getting it on my lashes.</li>
            <li>Regardless, it really does work.  </li>
            <li>so I guess that will b the real test.</li>
            <li>it is very inexpensive.</li>
            <li>i was very upset that it did not work AT ALLL on my lashes.</li>
            <li>haha didnt work too well for me</li>
            <li>It really works.</li>
            <li>After just using this for about 2 weeks, I really noticed a difference.</li>
            <li>this serum have really made my eyelashes longer and thicker</li>
            <li>I got it because I really needed something to help my lashes grow and seeing this was a reasonable price, I bought it.</li>
            <li>Have not experienced any thickening, but the change in length is great.</li>
            <li>so my eyelashes could grow and it really worked.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t really tell if my lashes have grown or not.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t understand how some people review a product that doesn&#x27;t really work.</li>
            <li>so you don&#x27;t have much to lose.</li>
            <li>it a try the whole tube ,</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t really give it a strike.</li>
            <li>thanks</li>
            <li>The broken lashes filled in quickly, even my husband noticed (so that means it works, lol) and they seem to be much fuller, and slightly longer.  </li>
            <li>For the price it works great, I have tried other drugstore brands and never really noticed any results.</li>
            <li>I only gave 4 stars because it does seem to very mildly irritate my eyes, which are very sensitive.</li>
            <li>I just wished I had better results like some of the other users did.</li>
            <li>the smell is a cheap perfume kind of smell which is not bad but artificial.</li>
            <li>:) Product came in early, which is an added bonus especially because I live in Hawaii where everything just takes longer to arrive.</li>
            <li>so I only wear mascara on special occasions)</li>
            <li>I will give it the full time however since I havent been using 2 x&#x27;s daily</li>
            <li>Oh, also I have pretty sensitive eyes, and wear contacts.  </li>
            <li>My eyes felt a tiny bit funny the first couple of times I applied the gel, but that was gone really</li>
            <li>It will dry quickly - sleep with it on, and if you ever have a day where you&#x27;re just at home, put it on then too!</li>
            <li>Are we sure that it&#x27;s not going to be causing a problem down the line?</li>
            <li>More money down the drain.</li>
            <li>Before purchasing, inform yourself (google chemical names and read articles at consumer-protection sites) on chemicals used in ALL cosmetic products including shampoos and childrens&#x27; products; many are not tested and lot listed as unsafe by FDA due to technicalities in laws that may favor manufacturers but may not protect consumers, as New York Times article (link below) explains.</li>
            <li>and I can see new eyelash growth!  </li>
            <li>I paid more money for my previous serum</li>
            <li>From the time I started using this product I had stop using mascara because I didn&#x27;t know if it would make the serum less potent.</li>
            <li>If you use this twice a day as recommended you will see dramatic results in a month and more than likely nice results in just a couple of days.</li>
            <li>I use the serum everyday and Iam very satisified with the length of my lashes :)</li>
            <li>I picked and plucked on the falsies which resulted in me nearly losing my lashes, but I am on my second bottle of this product and although I did not see any difference in thee length, I can confirm that my lashes have filled in gaps and volume.</li>
            <li>It is mainly made up of alcohol, conditioning?</li>
            <li>Pay money for something good &amp; don&#x27;t waste your time here with team short lashes.</li>
            <li>I only use it once a day (instructions say to use twice), but after about a month of consistent use I can really tell my lashes are much longer.</li>
            <li>HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>and I tried everything from drugstore to High end.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product, I plan to keep on using it for the longest time, as a maintenance strategy.</li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would highly suggest it.</li>
            <li>I guess my hopes were too high.  </li>
            <li>it also last a long time and is very cheap product</li>
            <li>Great product, got it referred from A friend and have only been using it for a few days but only time will tell.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t seen much of a change as far as growth</li>
            <li>I see no difference 3 weeks later but it was worth a try.  </li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t able to wear it long enough to ascertain if it works to improve growth.</li>
            <li>I have used this product off and on for about a year and within a few weeks of using it alwats notice more longer fuller lashes.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s really worth only spending about 5 dollars on this guys!</li>
            <li>price is well worth the fact that the product actually works.</li>
            <li>After 2 weeks of consistent use, twice a day, my bare lashes now look like I have on mascara.</li>
            <li>The liquid itself isn&#x27;t too watery, but it also doesn&#x27;t dry up like mascara, and it has an almost sweet smell to it.</li>
            <li>My lashes aren&#x27;t SUPER long but ppl around me have noticed a difference as well.</li>
            <li>and I wanted to mention that I&#x27;m asian having short fine lashes.</li>
            <li>so I will continue to use it until both tubes are going which should be about 2 or 3 months or so and will update then as to if I notice any new growth.</li>
            <li>but I feel like it help give it a boost in growing new hairs.</li>
            <li>and you live in those states</li>
            <li>but I have started to notice that new ones are growing.  </li>
            <li>Give it time &amp; look for new growth &amp; density.</li>
            <li>It accelerates the growth of new lashes.&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li>live and learn .win</li>
            <li>By the time I got half way through the second bottle the only good thing I had to say about it</li>
            <li>but so far seems decent.</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive eyes and skin etc</li>
            <li>And my lashes used to feel brittle, but now they are very soft.</li>
            <li>The gel is lightweight and does not burn or irritate my very sensitive eyes.</li>
            <li>I was very adamant about using this product as directed and allowing it ample time to work before writing a review.  </li>
            <li>Maybe extra fuel was that the hair and stuff on my body grows very fast anyway.</li>
            <li>and so far my eyelashes have been growing!</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t even have to get it in my eyes, the fumes make my eyes burn and water, and my eyes are not at all sensitive!</li>
            <li>For far I have noticed my eyelashes getting longer!</li>
            <li>This serum is more moderately priced then other serums.  </li>
            <li>I try to use it twice daily, first this in the morning and before retiring for bed.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;However, my lashes look exactly the same as they did before I bought them.</li>
            <li>After purchasing this item on Amazon , I also found this exact same item at the 99¢ store.</li>
            <li>(same exact kind/brand) on eBay.</li>
            <li>Anyway if you want a SUPER cheap serum that really slowly lengthens your lashes, this is the one for you!</li>
            <li>it made new eyelashes grow and old ones become longer, but did not make it thicker.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have extremely short lashes, and I don&#x27;t really have lashes that get compliments, so I think I am in the &#x27;normal&#x27; range.</li>
            <li>I bought this exact same product about a week ago at a 99Cents store near me.</li>
            <li>I would not recommend this simply because I used it more than average and still saw no results.</li>
            <li>I have discovered another brand I like better, but due to the low price of this, I think at least trying it out would be worthwhile.</li>
            <li>I would have never expected this, especially not from such a cheap product.</li>
            <li>My only gripe, is that the applicator brush doesn&#x27;t allow for a good eyelash saturation you will need apply, using several repetitive strokes per section of eyelashes.  </li>
            <li>My theory is that if one claim is true, then the other will come in time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;However, I also apply the Select Lash more like inner rim eyeliner, with the tip of the brush, than like in typical mascara application.</li>
            <li>I really wanted this to work, it&#x27;s cheap enough that any woman can buy it to try to grow long lashes, but it didn&#x27;t work for us, although other more pricey lash growth serums like Latisse did work, but too pricey and didn&#x27;t like side effects of dark circles under eyes.</li>
            <li>If you really want some flawless lashes bad than u gotta go awhile with no eye makeup!</li>
            <li>so I wanted to give it a try especially for all the reviews being more positive than negative.</li>
            <li>The serum is clear and jelly-like, comes in a clear tube and the applicator is like a mascara wand.</li>
            <li>I like the clear container.  </li>
            <li>but it came as a clear mascara</li>
            <li>I am not using that bottle and am using the clear serum one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I do not use mascara, and this acts like a clear one.</li>
            <li>my lashes thinned &amp; straightened &amp; being a natural blonde that doesn&#x27;t like to wear much makeup, I wanted my lashes to be noticeable again sans mascara</li>
            <li>So far I have only used it 2x/day for about 5 or 6 days, and what I notice is that my eyeslashes are not shedding as much when I wash my face.</li>
            <li>Just clear mascara....</li>
            <li>So I have been searching for a product that might help with my, nearly non-existant, lashes.</li>
            <li>I am still using this product so far I have not noticed any improvement but I will continue to try.</li>
            <li>you have short eyelashes, I really recommend the Rapidlash.</li>
            <li>But I was pleasantly surprised by it.</li>
            <li>The only reason I gave a 4 star instead of 5 is the wand that came with it doesn&#x27;t work very well.</li>
            <li>I can see a difference in my lashes as far as length goes.</li>
            <li>WOW.  </li>
            <li>product as far as I&#x27;m concerned.</li>
            <li>The only thing is you can&#x27;t really wear mascara with this</li>
            <li>The price cant be beat on this product but so far I have seen no results.</li>
            <li>Do not waste your money.</li>
            <li>I use it only at night, and my lashes aren&#x27;t much longer</li>
            <li>Really does work took about a month but definitely  works!</li>
            <li>I do prefer the types with a slim paint brush type applicator that instructs you to apply it to the roots of your lashes; this brand comes with a mascara bristle type brush for application directly on the lashes.</li>
            <li>but they are pretty long already.</li>
            <li>Remember, growing your eyebrows out and filling them in naturally WILL TAKE TIME -</li>
            <li>My eyes were always red &amp; I didn&#x27;t care for that too much.</li>
            <li>I pulled them off &amp; if youve had extensions you know by pulling them out you pull natural lashes out.</li>
            <li>I have extremely sensitive eyes and skin and severe allergies; Select Lash has caused me zero irritations....</li>
            <li>but so far a see an improvement in the length of my lashes.</li>
            <li>I notice no difference so far.  </li>
            <li>In fact I&#x27;d go as far as to say; I&#x27;ve noticed a decrease in length since I began using this.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive eyes, like OVERLY sensitive eyes, and it doesn&#x27;t bother me.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried this same product before and it worked very well.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>good price, I don&#x27;t want to buy expensive eyelash serum.</li>
            <li>I have used many other lash conditioners in the past but this is the first that&#x27;s irritated my eyes</li>
            <li>Especially with my mascara (which I did not which brands) they look super long!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not sure it added much length to my lashes, they weren&#x27;t short to begin with, but they definitely got thicker and have more curl to them.</li>
            <li>and I am actually seeing new eyelash growth!  </li>
            <li>i saw a big difference in my lashes length but the one thing i want to know is that if any one else had the problem of some of their lashes falling out more then usual?</li>
            <li>and now they really look long and lush.</li>
            <li>If you don&#x27;t actively condition your lashes, they will dry out and break for numerous reasons on top of the natural shed.</li>
            <li>I had high hopes for this product, especially after reading some reviews that compared the results to Latisse.  </li>
            <li>highly recommend this... actually have friends that have bought this since seeing my results!</li>
            <li>My lashes are super thick and super long now.</li>
            <li>The only positive I can think of sharing is that this brand won&#x27;t burn or itch your eyes and probably wont grow hair around your eyes and in the corners like Latisse;; which left me with an &amp;#34;under-brow&amp;#34;;</li>
            <li>My eyelashes are almost back to normal and longer than before</li>
            <li>But still, if it doesn&#x27;t work, then I&#x27;ve spent too much!</li>
            <li>Back to normal lashes.</li>
            <li>i used it for two full months, and applied it before my mascara everyday.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t really know what the active ingredient is in this serum, but it has certainly lengthened my lashes in a very short time.</li>
            <li>I thought the active ingredients had stopped working, it does get air exposure everyday, even thought the tube was more than half full.</li>
            <li>I use select lash daily &amp; castor oil too &amp; I have new growth, thicker lashes.</li>
            <li>have naturally full eyebrows but a little after high school I had plucked them a little too much.</li>
            <li>one being my eyebrows back when they were much thinner before I started using this product, and 5 months later.</li>
            <li>I have short, straight, Asian eyelashes, and I was looking for an affordable alternative to those 50-70$ eyelash serums.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The product doesn&#x27;t cost much so it&#x27;s not like I wasted money, really.</li>
            <li>Needless to say, my eyelashes look so much better!</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t attest for major growth in the length of my lashes, as I stopped using it after awhile.</li>
            <li>Select Lash seemed to make my eyelashes grow long and full whereas RapidLash only made them grow long.  </li>
            <li>on my eyelashes: I noticed a few new llashes and my old ones are much longer and prettier.</li>
            <li>Have only used one so far, but really like that it is clear serum and not milky like other brands.</li>
            <li>I hope this particular product will remain on the market for a very long time to come.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>At least it was cheap.</li>
            <li>have VERY blonde hair, thus my eyelashes are almost clear, so</li>
            <li>It dries clear and when I put mascara over it, my lashes did appear longer without a lot of extra layers of mascara and clumping.  </li>
            <li>I especially like that the tubes are clear</li>
            <li>my lashes had their natural curl back!</li>
            <li>and when I put on my mascara i actually said wow.</li>
            <li>My eyelashes were so sparse that even with mascara, you could barely see them.  </li>
            <li>I personally do not think they made my lashes much longer outside of the short run, though.</li>
            <li>As far as burning goes, I only felt the burning if I accidently got this stuff IN my eye....</li>
            <li>But I don&#x27;t think it actually grew my eyelashes so far.</li>
            <li>My lashes went back to normal after I stopped using as regularly, so you do have to keep it up.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t expect much, but because it has some of the ingredients of more expensive products with the same claims, I gave it a try.  </li>
            <li>Non irritating product, seems to be increasing eyelash fullness, have not been using more than a month so will see after amonth..</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m not sure if I&#x27;m seeing what I want or if its actually true.</li>
            <li>I was skeptical when I saw this and to be honest</li>
            <li>I am Asian with very fine thin lashes.</li>
            <li>I am glad that other people have had success with this product, but I sadly was not one of them.</li>
            <li>Seriously, I&#x27;d give this 10 stars if I could! :)</li>
            <li>I was a critic at first, but I was like its less than $3, I have tried&lt;br</li>
            <li>The other one was completely clear and normal.</li>
            <li>I was skeptical at first, but at the price it was worth a shot!  </li>
            <li>now 6 months later - my lashes are full and lush - and I hardly have to use it</li>
            <li>I have been using this for 3 weeks and have not noticed much of a change yet, other than I dont have any eyelashes falling out.  </li>
            <li>I can see on different areas of my eye that there is definite growth which is clearly obvious.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Saw nearly immediate results, but have to admit, I&#x27;ve been using Rapid Lash for several months prior, and now in conjunction with this product.  </li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t say I expected much for the low, low price, but since my Tarte was almost empty, I decided there wasn&#x27;t much to lose</li>
            <li>My eyelashes have always been long but not very thick.</li>
            <li>My lashes are pretty normal; not really long, not too thick.  </li>
            <li>My eylashes needed some major help after lash extensions totally damaged them.</li>
            <li>It makes my lashes really thick and full now.</li>
            <li>I usually don&#x27;t believe some reviews that I read on Amazon, but take it from a new mom who just wants to get her sass back, it works!</li>
            <li>It will take a little time to grow your eyebrows back out, but you should notice a difference by using this product within the FIRST 2 WEEKS.</li>
            <li>I decided to start growing them back (only plucking outside of my natural brow), brushing them out daily to stimulate growth, and then I landed on this product.</li>
            <li>I have tried other products in various prices, and gotten moderate results that took much longer.</li>
            <li>i love this, it actually orked better than the other expensive one i was using!!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve noticed that I don&#x27;t really have any &amp;#34;loose&amp;#34; lashes anymore (ones that fall out), and I think they are in fact slightly longer than when I started using the product.</li>
            <li>My eyelashes have always been a &#x27;medium&#x27; length, not short, but far from long.</li>
            <li>Because my natural lashes were barely long enough to \\&quot;brush\\&quot; when I started using Select Lash, the application process I used was required.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t expect much from this product because I paid so little</li>
            <li>I was a little leary about this product, but i found it to really work.</li>

            <li> I saw all the great reviews and thought I&#x27;d give it a try since it was so inexpensive, what do I have to lose?</li>

            <li> It is a great product for the price.</li>

            <li> I am using this on my brows as well and am happy.</li>
            <li> Idk all I can say I&#x27;d it worked great for me</li>
            <li> /&gt;Personally, I haven&#x27;t experienced any skin darkening (bummer, I&#x27;d like to skip using eyeliner LOL) or sting/</li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s great to have an inexpensive product that I can use.</li>
            <li> In the morning I apply it before my mascara, and they work great</li>
            <li> Great deal for 2x.</li>
            <li> but this one is awesome, cheap and works perfect</li>
            <li> I Love this stuff!!</li>
            <li> you want thicker, longer, fuller, more voluminous lashes just give this a try!!</li>
            <li> The price was very nice, I have been using it for 2 weeks, and I can noticeable see longer lashes.  </li>
            <li> This product is actually very nice.</li>
            <li> For the money, a very nice product.</li>

            <li> For the price, I am impressed and will be ordering more.</li>
            <li> but 2 months my lashes grew in so lovely beautifully!!</li>
            <li> great product works good</li>
            <li> Yet after applying it twice a day for two weeks, I think this is really an effective products!</li>
            <li> The serum has a pleasant smell, and it does not irritate my eyes</li>
            <li> Otherwise it works great and the price couldn&#x27;t be better!</li>
            <li> Honestly I did see growth in my eyelashes and the length is noticeable, so I am happy about that.</li>
            <li> I just started this and it feels good on my lashes.&lt;br</li>
            <li> this was a good price</li>
            <li> All good comments are lie about it.</li>
            <li> Good moisturizer</li>
            <li> The two pack is a convenient way to purchase your serum @ a good price.</li>
            <li> Researched for a while to find a good product to restore and grow my lashes and came across this one on Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have to say that I absolutely loved it</li>
            <li> I returned from a 2 week vacation &amp; took a closer look &amp; noticed my eyelashes weren&#x27;t looking so good</li>
            <li> Good product.</li>
            <li> To me, the serum appears to be good for eyelashes.  </li>
            <li> but it does appear to be good for eyelashes.  </li>
            <li> Good value for the price.</li>
            <li> Considering the price, this was a good deal.</li>
            <li> I think it&#x27;s just good for your lashes.</li>
            <li> I should of known they were too good to be true for the awesome price.</li>
            <li> so I wanted them to be exceptional.</li>
            <li> Love love love!!!</li>
            <li> I am very satisfied with the product.</li>
            <li> I am very satisfied with my purchase.</li>
            <li> I was very pleased.</li>
            <li> I am so pleased and happy with this.</li>
            <li> Itu has a great price to match, you can&#x27;t find a better deal.</li>
            <li> Very nice product, Easy to apply, smells good</li>
            <li> To show you how good this stuff works, I was getting my makeup done by a celeb makeup artist and they did not want to add mascara because they thought my lashes looked so good :)</li>
            <li> I always purchase more because it does work!</li>
            <li> Ok!</li>
            <li> Love it!</li>
            <li> I love this stuff!</li>
            <li> Love this product!</li>
            <li> LOVE THIS STUFF!  </li>
            <li> I love this product!</li>
            <li> I love this stuff!</li>
            <li> love it!</li>
            <li> I love that they are thicker!</li>
            <li> I love it!  </li>
            <li> but this product DOES work wonderfully and absolutely speeds up the process, and helps fill in your brows where you thought you couldn&#x27;t grow hair!</li>
            <li> Absolutely love this product!</li>
            <li> I could FOR SURE tell a difference!</li>
            <li> I love this stuff!</li>
            <li> I love this stuff!</li>
            <li> I LOVE IT!</li>
            <li> I am SUPER EXCITED!!!!</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s great and so easy to use.</li>
            <li> Amazing</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, this product is amazing and when it runs out (even though it comes alot in a tube and there were two in one order)</li>
            <li> - the results are amazing.  </li>
            <li> The price for it is amazing</li>
            <li> This is an AMAZING PRODUCT.</li>
            <li> (I wish I could afford Latisse because it works AMAZINGLY) as a conditioner at night.</li>
            <li> When I opened it I thought it was going to be like a liquid eyeliner kind of thing</li>
            <li> I also did not have any problems wearing the serum under my mascara, in fact, it seemed to enhance the look of my mascara, kind of like a primer.</li>
            <li> This honestly did not work for me.</li>
            <li> Honestly it looks like I have on lash extensions.</li>
            <li> The shipping arrived before the scheduled time which was nice.</li>
            <li> Honestly don&#x27;t know how they got it on the market.</li>
            <li> an the scent is really nice.</li>
            <li> My eyebrows are filling in nicely as well.</li>
            <li> It made my eye lashes grow a good amount but used more than recommended</li>
            <li> Love the product and loved the price.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff a the price is right it works!!!!</li>
            <li> Best they have looked since high school.</li>
            <li> They are full and look great</li>
            <li> Very pleased :)</li>
            <li> (it&#x27;s a very light scent), goes on smooth, and is great as a mascara primer-</li>
            <li> So I am definitely impressed with this thus far!</li>
            <li> Now I mst say my lashes are growing, much more noticeable and I am absolutely pleased with the product!</li>
            <li> This is a great product and even though I know I&#x27;ll have to basically use it for life to maintain the lash growth, at this price it&#x27;s entirely worth it.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t even use mascara in case the product would work better on its own, but that didn&#x27;t make a difference.</li>
            <li> like in the corner of your eyes and right on the edge of the cheek bone, which looks either like dirt or like a shadow, not an attractive look.</li>
            <li> Love love love this stuff!</li>
            <li> TRY IT and you&#x27;ll be glad you did! :) :)</li>
            <li> Overall it is a great product for a great price, and I will be ordering it again,</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t see a difference, I knew it was too good to be true...</li>
            <li> I gave it a 2 because it IS a good primer, and not a bad price for a primer.</li>
            <li> just been using for 2 weeks now, very cheap price</li>
            <li> and I can see a huge difference!</li>
            <li> I use it more as an eyelash conditioner than a lash grower.  </li>
            <li> No change in length or more lashes.</li>
            <li> Love this serum.  </li>
            <li> but I&#x27;ve heard that Castor oil works better.</li>
            <li> love it</li>
            <li> I LOVE LOVE this product.</li>
            <li> Rapidlash did seem to work a lot better.</li>
            <li> In the matter of 4 weeks my lashes grew longer and there was more volume to them.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think i need any more growth</li>
            <li> My eyelashes seem to be longer and pop out more.  </li>
            <li> I am really pleased.</li>
            <li> I got more and gave one to my mom and seeing how it works on her.</li>
            <li> not too sure that it works to thicken eyelashes, maybe works as a conditioner</li>
            <li> This is what I have learned from experience with many lash growth products..</li>
            <li> AND AFTER MAYBE A MONTH YOU WILL START NOTICING MORE AND</li>
            <li> AS WELL:)</li>
            <li> This stuff is fabulous!</li>
            <li> I do love the way it feels.</li>
            <li> I dont see any more length or thickness but the lashes appear to be more moisturized which helps somewhat with their appearance.  </li>
            <li> I would recommend this product as a beginning in the search for better eyelashes-</li>
            <li> so I don&#x27;t know if it takes 4 or more weeks</li>
            <li> I am glad I did.</li>
            <li> when using this the brush took it off and it was filled with mascara as time passed so watch out for that!</li>
            <li> I use this on my lashes mostly on weekends</li>
            <li> After seeing my eyelashes grow, I finally put on mascara after 1 month and my best friend noticed immediately.  </li>
            <li> I notice them more when I use mascara.</li>
            <li> Really love this lash conditioner.</li>
            <li> I have tried many lash growth products.  </li>
            <li> After 2 weeks of using it twice a day, the results weren&#x27;t as grand as the packaging says.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just not as grand results as you would think it should be.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s inexpensive and works better than rapid lash in my opinion.</li>
            <li> you&#x27;ll be able to find this store and purchase this yourself instead of buying online.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I love this...</li>
            <li> I purchased this product seeing all the great reviews but didnt expect much from it</li>
            <li> surely ordering it again.&lt;br /&gt;but</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll probably order more.</li>
            <li> Just had to get in the habit to put it on. :)</li>
            <li> My lashes are ok but this serum has given me more length.  </li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t noticed any thickening not that that was what I was hoping to achieve and that may happen after more time</li>
            <li> Btw, I&#x27;m buying more.</li>
            <li> At my age (over 60) I wanted more than the stubby ones I had.  </li>
            <li> Love this product and its price.  </li>
            <li> but mostly it did lengthen them.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great if you don&#x27;t want to wear much makeup, but want your eyelashes to Stand out some.</li>
            <li> am ordering 6 orders for Christmas gifts for my female friends - what a great find &amp; so inexpensive!!!</li>
            <li> so I wasnt sure it was working.</li>
            <li> Like I said I wasnt sure it was working until I put on mascara.</li>
            <li> Cheaper than most products on the market.</li>
            <li> My innermost top eyelashes and my lower eyelashes also seem to have grown a bit.</li>
            <li> The product is outstanding.</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> i have already bought more just</li>
            <li> I love this product.  </li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m glad I did it.</li>
            <li> I just ordered two more bottles.</li>
            <li> It does make my lashes look longer and better conditioned.</li>
            <li> my eyelashes are more noticible</li>
            <li> and I absolutely love</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s okay - I suppose it nourishes the eyelashes somewhat but have seen no difference in length</li>
            <li> I will look much more closely at it.  </li>
            <li> OK for the price I suppose.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m glad about that.  </li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure what to expect.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s as cheap as it can be..worth a try!</li>
            <li> It really works great under mascara, it is better than my mascara primer.</li>
            <li> Just to be able to write this in this review, I stopped using the product.</li>
            <li> I never thought something that would be so cheap would work so well!</li>
            <li> I am going to purchase more and give my mom a bottle BC</li>
            <li> its so cheap!</li>
            <li> Great if it works for others as it&#x27;s reasonably priced.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s just make them healthy</li>
            <li> /&gt;Update: November 2, 2013.&lt;br /&gt;So I&#x27;ve been using this since April 2013 (just ordered three more bottles a month or so ago)</li>
            <li> I love tis product.</li>
            <li> I love this product</li>
            <li> After one week I saw more results than 4 months of latisse.</li>
            <li> (Will post more in about a month)</li>
            <li> I think its okay</li>
            <li> :)</li>
            <li> Truthfully.</li>
            <li> but I want more :) so I use the serum every day as a primer.</li>
            <li> but I would say this was the cherry on top.  </li>
            <li> will buy some more :)</li>
            <li> You also have to apply it twice a day instead of once a day like the Ardel, which I LOVE.</li>
            <li> I do too :)</li>
            <li> This is my second order from this seller and I am very happy.</li>
            <li> Since I had been using something else that seemed to work better, but then I ran out and figured I&#x27;d try this brand.</li>
            <li> This is just a conditioner nothing more.</li>
            <li> and i think i like it better .</li>
            <li> Make sure you take care of the edges.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> it ok, would not purchase it again</li>
            <li> OK, I love this stuff and use it on my eyebrows.  </li>
            <li> Budget friendly and effective.</li>
            <li> So far, so good!</li>
            <li> it was a pretty good purchase for the price and might be buying more if the results continue.</li>
            <li> Thanks for this amazing product!</li>
            <li> Maybe a good conditioner - don&#x27;t know exactly what it does</li>
            <li> So, order it and get excited!</li>
            <li> /&gt;Other people have experienced the burning or irritation, and me having very sensitive skin did not experience any of that.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s super easy and works better than Revitalash or Latisse!  </li>
            <li> It certainly doesn&#x27;t make your eyelashes magically grow, but it works as a good and cheap primer for masquera.</li>
            <li> They are straighter, which appears longer, and they are conditioned, so my mascara goes on more smooth, which looks longer.</li>
            <li> It is cheap, and I did notice more of a fullness to my lashes when I used it.</li>
            <li> But it does work great at lengthening them as a clear mascara of sorts.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m just glad it was cheap.</li>
            <li> ; I feel I&#x27;ve overpaid for this one; specially after seeing it at the 99c store!</li>
            <li> It has the best applicator(mascara brush-like) of all the other lash enhancers.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m gonna keep using it til I finish the bottle &amp; see if there&#x27;s a more significant change.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The applicator is easy to use.  </li>
            <li> came very quickly.</li>
            <li> Easy to use and inexpensive.</li>
            <li> hey, i received the delivery very quickly but the product doesn&#x27;t work..</li>
            <li> I would strongly recommend this product!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And</li>
            <li> and there doesn&#x27;t seem to be any strong fragrance to be bothersome.</li>
            <li> Love love love really works my eye</li>
            <li> gel smells pretty nice</li>
            <li> The seem more full when I apply mascara then before using the product.</li>
            <li> Good product I do see some new growth</li>
            <li> But once a day is just fine.</li>
            <li> fine hair growing where they shouldn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s moisturizing with no irritation and it&#x27;s quick to put on!</li>
            <li> I am ordering more as soon as I am done with the first!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s cheap</li>
            <li> /&gt;It was really cheap, so you should give it a try to see if it works for you.</li>
            <li> It is fragrance free and did not bother my eyes or skin.  </li>
            <li> I just wanted to try because its cheap.</li>
            <li> the price for this was so cheap.</li>
            <li> This eyelash serum goes on smooth.  </li>
            <li> I needed something to my lashes because I use mascara everyday, this serum is perfect for nights because is vitamins for my lashes.</li>
            <li> For fun we have tried many.</li>
            <li> Prior to trying this I was using Rapid ash which worked great.  </li>
            <li> If you really want nice eyelashes and brows - just spend the money and buy some Careprost -</li>
            <li> This cheap stuff is a joke.</li>
            <li> May sound so cliche</li>
            <li> /&gt;Definitely a great product, especially for the price.  </li>
            <li> its cheap its made a difference and for 99 cent for 2 bottles hey cant beat that.&lt;br /&gt;used</li>
            <li> For a cheap price, I would continue to buy and use it.</li>
            <li> I also use it on my eyebrows and they have filled in.</li>
            <li> So happy something is finally working for me.  </li>
            <li> Fortunately I didn&#x27;t spend a lot of money</li>
            <li> I thought the price for this product was cheap</li>
            <li> Quite honestly, I didn&#x27;t expect much.</li>
            <li> I had such great results and so did my fam.</li>
            <li> I give this product 4 stars because it is very in-expensive and it works with my mascara nicely.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s cheap</li>
            <li> I tried it because it was cheap</li>
            <li> It gives a nice &#x27;wet look&#x27; to your eyelashes, and is a good price.</li>
            <li> I really wanted this eyelash serum to work----the price was great and shipping was fast.  </li>
            <li> A great product for a better price compared to other types on the market.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s that fast!!!</li>
            <li> Thank you so much!!!</li>
            <li> I swear I noticed a difference after the first day!!</li>
            <li> THIS SERUM REALLY DOES WORK!!!</li>
            <li> This stuff makes your eyelashes feel so soft and strong!!</li>
            <li> i bought the product because of too many positive reviews,it was cheap</li>
            <li> I had a coworker ask if I had started wearing mascara, so it was evident to others more than to me.  </li>
            <li> Even though I got 2 tube from my first order; I already ordered 6 more to give as gifts.</li>
            <li> and I am excited to see the results in 30 days</li>
            <li> I was so excited to receive my order.  </li>
            <li> I &#x27;m sure if I were to use it daily I would have even better results than I do!</li>
            <li> Just starting using it, it feels nice on the lashes!  </li>
            <li> and I have to say that now my lashes are getting thicker, as well as retaining the length increase I originally got.</li>
            <li> &quot; I have been using this for almost a month, and am excited to say that my lashes have grown long again, and are looking great.</li>
            <li> but I am a natural blonde who disguises it lol, so I need some thicker lashes!</li>
            <li> I liked this one the most because it stays clear even when dry, does not flake, can be worn during the day, and smells good.  </li>
            <li> So cheap for such a good product.</li>
            <li> Today, 5 weeks later, my lashes are looking gorgeous and the \\&quot;bald spots\\&quot; in my eyebrows have filled in.</li>
            <li> The formula is nice and it makes my lashes very soft.</li>
            <li> Surprisingly, this product worked better than all of the other pricier treatments.  </li>
            <li> and right away I noticed length and fullness to my eyelashes!</li>
            <li> But for the price I&#x27;m not mad at all as the price was fantastic</li>
            <li> My lashes are looking so Full.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say enough good things.  </li>
            <li> I do recommend it and the price makes it a true bargain.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say this product isn&#x27;t good, because everyone is different.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t been able to tell to much yet.  </li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s more like a cosmetic than something that really affects the growth of lashes.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad I didn&#x27;t pay much for these, think it was just a couple of bucks</li>
            <li> so I decided to tear this package open to put it to good use.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used this for the full 30 days yet, so I don&#x27;t know if it works to make my lashes look longer</li>
            <li> But when you apply this stuff.... as directed, your eyelashes are FULL.</li>
            <li> I love it so much I purchased it for my daughters</li>
            <li> This got really good reviews which is why I bought it, especially for the price</li>
            <li> Loved this product in combination with another eyelash growth my lashes are growing back after removing my lash extensions.</li>
            <li> But if you really want longer and thicker lashes I&#x27;d recommend something with better ingredients and a proven record.</li>
            <li> I love Rapid Lash, but if you don&#x27;t need actual new growth, Select Lash is a great, super economical alternative.</li>
            <li> But this product is great, it works fast, and there are no side effects; no brittle lashes, no dry lashes...</li>
            <li> Although the smell through me off at first, its easy to get used to...</li>
            <li> It feels good, and I do feel a little bit is working, I have to wait for additional 3 more weeks to give review</li>
            <li> Arrived quickly and as stated</li>
            <li> It came in fairly quickly.</li>
            <li> Product arrived quickly and well packaged.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I think it is too mild for my skin.</li>
            <li> I have SLE, I was hoping that this Eyelash Serum would provide me adequate lashes, which I have a shortage of...</li>
            <li> My lashes are now fuller and more vibrant.</li>
            <li> My eyebrows have grown back in and look very lovely.</li>
            <li> I barely comment on Amazon, but this time I feel the need to conduct a honest review of this product!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> They are easy to curl and make my mascara look very whispy.</li>
            <li> This product is pretty good, especially considering the price.</li>
            <li> I wear makeup once a week when I go out to unwind from work and school; last night when I put on my mascara my lashes looked so long and beautiful-the best I&#x27;ve seen in awhile.</li>
            <li> I am looking for strong grow fast as.</li>
            <li> I started noticing longer lashes within the first week!</li>
            <li> I think it&#x27;s pretty legit!</li>
            <li> (I&#x27;m still using my first one!)</li>
            <li> A great little product.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for a little while now, and I don&#x27;t think I have experienced any growth.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t really see a huge difference in length to my lashes and eyebrows</li>
            <li> but when I put my mascara on the next day it went on so amazing that they appeared longer.</li>
            <li> I read the reviews others had posted and figured it was worth a try.  </li>
            <li> Worth to try.</li>
            <li> WORTH BUYING.</li>
            <li> It is so worth</li>
            <li> I was expecting a growth type serum, but I think this was more a clear mascara.</li>
            <li> You may get the same effect just by putting coconut oil or mineral oil on your lashes, but I liked this.</li>
            <li> Well worth the money and some.</li>
            <li> For the price, it is worth a try.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s well worth it</li>
            <li> AND IT IS WORTH</li>
            <li> lashes are longer wish it thickend them up or regrowth on bottoms were they are sparse but heck worth the money i&#x27;d say.</li>
            <li> For the review and price listed, I figured this was worth a try</li>
            <li> You&#x27;d probably be better off with clear mascara.</li>
            <li> Today is the 18th, got this product on the 15th, quarter of a tube already gone, but my eyelashes are nicely lubricated which I am doing 4 times daily.  </li>
            <li> I say its worth a try to c if it works for u BC</li>
            <li> Worth noting:</li>
            <li> Their pretty full already</li>
            <li> It was worth it.</li>
            <li> and I love the results so far.</li>
            <li> I will keep applying until my eyelashes really shows the significant growth.</li>
            <li> I put it on right after my Eyelash Serum dries.</li>
            <li> right??</li>
            <li> It also burns my eyes so I have to use it right when I plan on going to bed and not in the morning.</li>
            <li> I use it in the am right when i wake up, after I wash my face, &amp; again at night after washing my face.</li>
            <li> I Put on a coat every night after i take off my makeup right before bed.</li>
            <li> Everyone who wrote about it was right</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think it works right away.</li>
            <li> I was a little worried about using a product that was so cheap, but I&#x27;m really happy with the results thus far.</li>
            <li> I would definitely recommend this product for quick and healthy looking results.  </li>
            <li> but I felt the cost excessive albeit the results were great.</li>
            <li> MY EYELASHES ARE LONG AND NICE</li>
            <li> We all have our schedules, agendas and our to do lists jammed packed, trying to keep up with the fast paced world we live in and to be honest, eyelash serum is not at the top of the list.  </li>
            <li> But it will make your lashes soft and easy to curl.</li>
            <li> Great value at such a low cost, I couldn&#x27;t be happier.</li>
            <li> So far, it&#x27;s just a nice clear mascara.</li>
            <li> I gave it a fair trial of one and a half bottles</li>
            <li> The product arrived super fast and as described.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t really notice an improvement but in all fairness I gave it three stars because I wasn&#x27;t very consistent about using it.</li>
            <li> One other very notable difference for myself anyway, is I don&#x27;t have irritation like I did with Latisse.</li>
            <li> I know that castor oil is supposed to be good at making lashes grow, but I have never had success at using just plain castor oil alone.</li>
            <li> I think it is good to keep your lashes moisturized and to help eliminate breakage from them being dry, but honestly I dont notice a difference in length or volume, maybe a little in length</li>
            <li> I have been using Select Lash for twenty days and my lashes have grown very much already.</li>
            <li> The price is very reasonable.</li>
            <li> To my surprise this product is very gentle and</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not a crazy transformation but it certainly works and fir the price</li>
            <li> Wasn&#x27;t sure what to think about trying this, as the price is so low and tempting.</li>
            <li> But I decided to give it a try and let me just tell you the product came on the first due-date \\&quot;range\\&quot; which was really soon!</li>
            <li> I really thought it wasn&#x27;t going to work!</li>
            <li> and my lashes have really been growing!</li>
            <li> I first purchased the serum in February of this year</li>
            <li> To my surprise it really does work!</li>
            <li> I could tell the first day.</li>
            <li> It came exactly as ordered with the two bottles.</li>
            <li> The only think I wish was that it made my lashes more fuller.</li>
            <li> Overall,  I am completely satisfied.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m currently on my third week of using this product and I LOVE</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m just so happy that they have grown as much as they have in such a short period of time.  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t see any clear results, but I&#x27;m not too upset because the price was pretty cheap.</li>
            <li> This works much better, I try to apply a coat once a day before regular mascara.</li>
            <li> I am sure hers will be the same once she get into a routine.</li>
            <li> when reading reviews for this product, many reviewers had mentioned that they saw this lash serum at the 99 Cent Only store</li>
            <li> NOT so much with this one!  </li>
            <li> I definitely notice an increase in length on my bottom lashes for sure.</li>
            <li> In combination with Rapid Lash, this products gives lashes more definition and adds a darker tint to enhance lashes even without mascara - definitely a steal for the price!!</li>
            <li> I have used this faithfully for 3 months and it seems that there are more lashes on the bottom left outer corner of my eye.  </li>
            <li> Hey, for this price I was willing to try it</li>
            <li> Used this product consistently, but my eyelashes didn&#x27;t grow a bit.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve been using it pretty consistently for two months now.</li>
            <li> i did not like it because it is gooey, so i did not use it consistently.</li>
            <li> I have been using this for almost a month and am halfway through my first tube.</li>
            <li> As cheap as it is, I&#x27;m surprised how well it works.</li>
            <li> Seeing a difference will most likely make you want to continue using it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Try</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m feeling pleased to report after a short period of once/day use I&#x27;m noticing a difference in both length &amp; fullness.</li>
            <li> But we&#x27;ll see maybe next month it will be more of a difference</li>
            <li> and I could really the difference!</li>
            <li> Ok.... i read lots of mixed reviews on this product...</li>
            <li> I will admit I was a bit sceptic at first about the product.  </li>
            <li> and it really does work!  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t even know how to explain this, but it&#x27;s like I have more individual lashes growing in now.</li>
            <li> pretty quick..using now.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m amazed I have pretty eyelashes.</li>
            <li> I am still using the first tube.</li>
            <li> , i guess thats irritation, but it doesnt exactly hurt.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m gonna say it works, cause my lashes definitely look better.  </li>
            <li> Love this so much, looks natural, lashes are so much fuller, looks much better than regular mascara.</li>
            <li> My eyelashes were so short to a point I had to put on three coats or more of mascara.</li>
            <li> Let me just say that this works, and works fast!</li>
            <li> It worked pretty well.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m noticing some more lashes growing in or growing back already.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for a week now, twice a day like instructed, and it has helped my eyelashes grow so much!</li>
            <li> I most definitely have longer fuller lashes.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t think too much of it at first..</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think they make them much longer, but they look longer right after you put it on.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t expect significant fullness-what I&#x27;ve seen is a growth in length not fullness so far.</li>
            <li> It is clear and I would apply at night when my eye lashes were clean</li>
            <li> They came very fast and it works wonders my eyelashes are already so much longer than they were before I started using it</li>
            <li> This product got here pretty fast.</li>
            <li> They are not thicker but there are more lashes and they are long.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t really tell too much of a difference without mascara, but one morning when I was applying mascara--- BAM!</li>
            <li> They were watery and sensitive for a full day after using this once.</li>
            <li> and I have a good mascara day everyday!</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product &amp; will use this stuff as long as it&#x27;s available &amp; affordable to me because even us poor folk deserve to look &amp; feel our very best!</li>
            <li> this product is amazing,  i had this product less than two weeks.</li>
            <li> easy to apply, using a simple mascara type</li>
            <li> This is really good deal, and the two bottles last a long time.</li>
            <li> it certainly cant hurt.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m two weeks into using it and I notice a difference already, my lashes are longer and straighter, can&#x27;t wait to see how they look in a few more weeks!</li>
            <li> My individual lashes are not thicker but there are new lashes making the most lashes I&#x27;ve ever had at one time.</li>
            <li> New layer of lashes are also visible, which makes it overall seem more \\&quot;bushy\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> get compliments on my eyebrows all the time now - they&#x27;re back to being FULL and flattering, shaping my face in just the right way.</li>
            <li> If you are only looking for a lash conditioner, this will work just fine.</li>
            <li> So I did a little test of my own.</li>
            <li> so I went for myself and believe it or not they sell the exact same product that I am reviewing about right now!</li>
            <li> it took me 2 months before i saw the difference, but when i put my regular mascara on i saw a huge difference.</li>
            <li> While the Select Lash is a great conditioner, I can definitely continue to see areas that have not filled in.  </li>
            <li> Volume, not so much, but</li>
            <li> I saw results really fast, noticed longer lashes in 2-3 weeks.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t expect too much for the price I paid.</li>
            <li> get the real stuff</li>
            <li> IT REALLY WORKS.</li>
            <li> I havn&#x27;t  really used it all that much to see a difference.</li>
            <li> However it did come in the mail very soon.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t really increase the fullness of lashes, nor does it make them darker, but if what you&#x27;re looking for is length</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend it to anyone who has lash and brow issues!  </li>
            <li> I apply a VERY generous amount</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t expecting much since I got it at the dollar store</li>
            <li> Will let you know in a couple of weeks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: I have been wearing this and this has been really softened my lashes.</li>
            <li> I put this on at night and in the morning my lashes are ready to go.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for about 2 months now and don&#x27;t really see a difference in length or volume.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t add much volume but you can always use a volumizing mascara</li>
            <li> so I hope that it is working and not secretly harming me.</li>
            <li> I really need thicker,longer lashes</li>
            <li> This works really well.</li>
            <li> but I haven&#x27;t really noticed any thickening, longer or darkening of my eyelashes.  </li>
            <li> Fast delvery of product</li>
            <li> This product &#x27;flaked&#x27; too much and irritated my eyes, so I had to stop using it.</li>
            <li> I really like this product.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re Real mascara</li>
            <li> I used it months ago and it really seem to have made a difference.  </li>
            <li> Thanks</li>
            <li> I actually really like this.</li>
            <li> This stuff works really really well</li>
            <li> so much ......</li>
            <li> but it really works.</li>
            <li> This has grown my lashes but really made a difference in my brows.</li>
            <li> When I used a cheap eyelash curler, it literally ripped out an ENTIRE gap of lashes on my lash line!</li>
            <li> Each tube is 99 cents which is so much cheaper than what the sellers are selling online.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t really tell a difference.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really work.</li>
            <li> it was shipped out fast, comes with 2</li>
            <li> I found this product marginally helpful in restoring thinning eyebrows, but for eyelashes, not so much.  </li>
            <li> I can really tell a difference when I put on mascara.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t really notice a difference.  </li>
            <li> I also use it on my eyebrows and now they&#x27;re very conditioned.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t really tell...</li>
            <li> It helps my eyelashes grow more but not much.</li>
            <li> I also tried not to use make up as much as I could so the serum would have time to work.</li>
            <li> You really have to follow directions once in the morning and evening</li>
            <li> Just think how much thicker my lashes would be if I used it twice a day as suggested on the manufacturers packaging?</li>
            <li> The shipping was fast.</li>
            <li> and if it didnt work I wasnt really out anything.</li>
            <li> (I dont get out much.</li>
            <li> selectlash was very affordable and I have been using it for three weeks once a day</li>
            <li> Not irritating</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really notice much of a growth on my lashes, but it does wonders for my mascara.</li>
            <li> I have decided that this product is used as mu eyelash primer and not so much as a growth stimulator.</li>
            <li> I really saw no difference after month of use...</li>
            <li> Hasn&#x27;t really done anything for me.</li>
            <li> I used up a whole bottle</li>
            <li> but this one really worked for me.</li>
            <li> This did absolutely NOTHING for my lashes.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t do much for me.</li>
            <li> - I should have read more carefully -</li>
            <li> Because I really like this product and because I believe it works so well, I decided to upload 2 pics -</li>
            <li> it really makes a difference in your appearance.  </li>
            <li> Really nothing.&lt;br /&gt;Good</li>
            <li> didn&#x27;t spend too much..</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for two weeks twice a day as instructed..and it has really made my eyelashes look longer.</li>
            <li> It feels like I&#x27;m really getting it on my lashes.</li>
            <li> Regardless, it really does work.  </li>
            <li> so I guess that will b the real test.</li>
            <li> it is very inexpensive.</li>
            <li> i was very upset that it did not work AT ALLL on my lashes.</li>
            <li> haha didnt work too well for me</li>
            <li> It really works.</li>
            <li> After just using this for about 2 weeks, I really noticed a difference.</li>
            <li> this serum have really made my eyelashes longer and thicker</li>
            <li> I got it because I really needed something to help my lashes grow and seeing this was a reasonable price, I bought it.</li>
            <li> Have not experienced any thickening, but the change in length is great.</li>
            <li> so my eyelashes could grow and it really worked.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t really tell if my lashes have grown or not.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t understand how some people review a product that doesn&#x27;t really work.</li>
            <li> so you don&#x27;t have much to lose.</li>
            <li> it a try the whole tube ,</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t really give it a strike.</li>
            <li> thanks</li>
            <li> The broken lashes filled in quickly, even my husband noticed (so that means it works, lol) and they seem to be much fuller, and slightly longer.  </li>
            <li> For the price it works great, I have tried other drugstore brands and never really noticed any results.</li>
            <li> I only gave 4 stars because it does seem to very mildly irritate my eyes, which are very sensitive.</li>
            <li> I just wished I had better results like some of the other users did.</li>
            <li> the smell is a cheap perfume kind of smell which is not bad but artificial.</li>
            <li> :) Product came in early, which is an added bonus especially because I live in Hawaii where everything just takes longer to arrive.</li>
            <li> so I only wear mascara on special occasions)</li>
            <li> I will give it the full time however since I havent been using 2 x&#x27;s daily</li>
            <li> Oh, also I have pretty sensitive eyes, and wear contacts.  </li>
            <li> My eyes felt a tiny bit funny the first couple of times I applied the gel, but that was gone really</li>
            <li> It will dry quickly - sleep with it on, and if you ever have a day where you&#x27;re just at home, put it on then too!</li>
            <li> Are we sure that it&#x27;s not going to be causing a problem down the line?</li>
            <li> More money down the drain.</li>
            <li> Before purchasing, inform yourself (google chemical names and read articles at consumer-protection sites) on chemicals used in ALL cosmetic products including shampoos and childrens&#x27; products; many are not tested and lot listed as unsafe by FDA due to technicalities in laws that may favor manufacturers but may not protect consumers, as New York Times article (link below) explains.</li>
            <li> and I can see new eyelash growth!  </li>
            <li> I paid more money for my previous serum</li>
            <li> From the time I started using this product I had stop using mascara because I didn&#x27;t know if it would make the serum less potent.</li>
            <li> If you use this twice a day as recommended you will see dramatic results in a month and more than likely nice results in just a couple of days.</li>
            <li> I use the serum everyday and Iam very satisified with the length of my lashes :)</li>
            <li> I picked and plucked on the falsies which resulted in me nearly losing my lashes, but I am on my second bottle of this product and although I did not see any difference in thee length, I can confirm that my lashes have filled in gaps and volume.</li>
            <li> It is mainly made up of alcohol, conditioning?</li>
            <li> Pay money for something good &amp; don&#x27;t waste your time here with team short lashes.</li>
            <li> I only use it once a day (instructions say to use twice), but after about a month of consistent use I can really tell my lashes are much longer.</li>
            <li> HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> and I tried everything from drugstore to High end.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product, I plan to keep on using it for the longest time, as a maintenance strategy.</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would highly suggest it.</li>
            <li> I guess my hopes were too high.  </li>
            <li> it also last a long time and is very cheap product</li>
            <li> Great product, got it referred from A friend and have only been using it for a few days but only time will tell.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t seen much of a change as far as growth</li>
            <li> I see no difference 3 weeks later but it was worth a try.  </li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t able to wear it long enough to ascertain if it works to improve growth.</li>
            <li> I have used this product off and on for about a year and within a few weeks of using it alwats notice more longer fuller lashes.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really worth only spending about 5 dollars on this guys!</li>
            <li> price is well worth the fact that the product actually works.</li>
            <li> After 2 weeks of consistent use, twice a day, my bare lashes now look like I have on mascara.</li>
            <li> The liquid itself isn&#x27;t too watery, but it also doesn&#x27;t dry up like mascara, and it has an almost sweet smell to it.</li>
            <li> My lashes aren&#x27;t SUPER long but ppl around me have noticed a difference as well.</li>
            <li> and I wanted to mention that I&#x27;m asian having short fine lashes.</li>
            <li> so I will continue to use it until both tubes are going which should be about 2 or 3 months or so and will update then as to if I notice any new growth.</li>
            <li> but I feel like it help give it a boost in growing new hairs.</li>
            <li> and you live in those states</li>
            <li> but I have started to notice that new ones are growing.  </li>
            <li> Give it time &amp; look for new growth &amp; density.</li>
            <li> It accelerates the growth of new lashes.&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li> live and learn .win</li>
            <li> By the time I got half way through the second bottle the only good thing I had to say about it</li>
            <li> but so far seems decent.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive eyes and skin etc</li>
            <li> And my lashes used to feel brittle, but now they are very soft.</li>
            <li> The gel is lightweight and does not burn or irritate my very sensitive eyes.</li>
            <li> I was very adamant about using this product as directed and allowing it ample time to work before writing a review.  </li>
            <li> Maybe extra fuel was that the hair and stuff on my body grows very fast anyway.</li>
            <li> and so far my eyelashes have been growing!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t even have to get it in my eyes, the fumes make my eyes burn and water, and my eyes are not at all sensitive!</li>
            <li> For far I have noticed my eyelashes getting longer!</li>
            <li> This serum is more moderately priced then other serums.  </li>
            <li> I try to use it twice daily, first this in the morning and before retiring for bed.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;However, my lashes look exactly the same as they did before I bought them.</li>
            <li> After purchasing this item on Amazon , I also found this exact same item at the 99¢ store.</li>
            <li> (same exact kind/brand) on eBay.</li>
            <li> Anyway if you want a SUPER cheap serum that really slowly lengthens your lashes, this is the one for you!</li>
            <li> it made new eyelashes grow and old ones become longer, but did not make it thicker.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have extremely short lashes, and I don&#x27;t really have lashes that get compliments, so I think I am in the &#x27;normal&#x27; range.</li>
            <li> I bought this exact same product about a week ago at a 99Cents store near me.</li>
            <li> I would not recommend this simply because I used it more than average and still saw no results.</li>
            <li> I have discovered another brand I like better, but due to the low price of this, I think at least trying it out would be worthwhile.</li>
            <li> I would have never expected this, especially not from such a cheap product.</li>
            <li> My only gripe, is that the applicator brush doesn&#x27;t allow for a good eyelash saturation you will need apply, using several repetitive strokes per section of eyelashes.  </li>
            <li> My theory is that if one claim is true, then the other will come in time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;However, I also apply the Select Lash more like inner rim eyeliner, with the tip of the brush, than like in typical mascara application.</li>
            <li> I really wanted this to work, it&#x27;s cheap enough that any woman can buy it to try to grow long lashes, but it didn&#x27;t work for us, although other more pricey lash growth serums like Latisse did work, but too pricey and didn&#x27;t like side effects of dark circles under eyes.</li>
            <li> If you really want some flawless lashes bad than u gotta go awhile with no eye makeup!</li>
            <li> so I wanted to give it a try especially for all the reviews being more positive than negative.</li>
            <li> The serum is clear and jelly-like, comes in a clear tube and the applicator is like a mascara wand.</li>
            <li> I like the clear container.  </li>
            <li> but it came as a clear mascara</li>
            <li> I am not using that bottle and am using the clear serum one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I do not use mascara, and this acts like a clear one.</li>
            <li> my lashes thinned &amp; straightened &amp; being a natural blonde that doesn&#x27;t like to wear much makeup, I wanted my lashes to be noticeable again sans mascara</li>
            <li> So far I have only used it 2x/day for about 5 or 6 days, and what I notice is that my eyeslashes are not shedding as much when I wash my face.</li>
            <li> Just clear mascara....</li>
            <li> So I have been searching for a product that might help with my, nearly non-existant, lashes.</li>
            <li> I am still using this product so far I have not noticed any improvement but I will continue to try.</li>
            <li> you have short eyelashes, I really recommend the Rapidlash.</li>
            <li> But I was pleasantly surprised by it.</li>
            <li> The only reason I gave a 4 star instead of 5 is the wand that came with it doesn&#x27;t work very well.</li>
            <li> I can see a difference in my lashes as far as length goes.</li>
            <li> WOW.  </li>
            <li> product as far as I&#x27;m concerned.</li>
            <li> The only thing is you can&#x27;t really wear mascara with this</li>
            <li> The price cant be beat on this product but so far I have seen no results.</li>
            <li> Do not waste your money.</li>
            <li> I use it only at night, and my lashes aren&#x27;t much longer</li>
            <li> Really does work took about a month but definitely  works!</li>
            <li> I do prefer the types with a slim paint brush type applicator that instructs you to apply it to the roots of your lashes; this brand comes with a mascara bristle type brush for application directly on the lashes.</li>
            <li> but they are pretty long already.</li>
            <li> Remember, growing your eyebrows out and filling them in naturally WILL TAKE TIME -</li>
            <li> My eyes were always red &amp; I didn&#x27;t care for that too much.</li>
            <li> I pulled them off &amp; if youve had extensions you know by pulling them out you pull natural lashes out.</li>
            <li> I have extremely sensitive eyes and skin and severe allergies; Select Lash has caused me zero irritations....</li>
            <li> but so far a see an improvement in the length of my lashes.</li>
            <li> I notice no difference so far.  </li>
            <li> In fact I&#x27;d go as far as to say; I&#x27;ve noticed a decrease in length since I began using this.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive eyes, like OVERLY sensitive eyes, and it doesn&#x27;t bother me.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried this same product before and it worked very well.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> good price, I don&#x27;t want to buy expensive eyelash serum.</li>
            <li> I have used many other lash conditioners in the past but this is the first that&#x27;s irritated my eyes</li>
            <li> Especially with my mascara (which I did not which brands) they look super long!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure it added much length to my lashes, they weren&#x27;t short to begin with, but they definitely got thicker and have more curl to them.</li>
            <li> and I am actually seeing new eyelash growth!  </li>
            <li> i saw a big difference in my lashes length but the one thing i want to know is that if any one else had the problem of some of their lashes falling out more then usual?</li>
            <li> and now they really look long and lush.</li>
            <li> If you don&#x27;t actively condition your lashes, they will dry out and break for numerous reasons on top of the natural shed.</li>
            <li> I had high hopes for this product, especially after reading some reviews that compared the results to Latisse.  </li>
            <li> highly recommend this... actually have friends that have bought this since seeing my results!</li>
            <li> My lashes are super thick and super long now.</li>
            <li> The only positive I can think of sharing is that this brand won&#x27;t burn or itch your eyes and probably wont grow hair around your eyes and in the corners like Latisse;; which left me with an &amp;#34;under-brow&amp;#34;;</li>
            <li> My eyelashes are almost back to normal and longer than before</li>
            <li> But still, if it doesn&#x27;t work, then I&#x27;ve spent too much!</li>
            <li> Back to normal lashes.</li>
            <li> i used it for two full months, and applied it before my mascara everyday.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really know what the active ingredient is in this serum, but it has certainly lengthened my lashes in a very short time.</li>
            <li> I thought the active ingredients had stopped working, it does get air exposure everyday, even thought the tube was more than half full.</li>
            <li> I use select lash daily &amp; castor oil too &amp; I have new growth, thicker lashes.</li>
            <li> have naturally full eyebrows but a little after high school I had plucked them a little too much.</li>
            <li> one being my eyebrows back when they were much thinner before I started using this product, and 5 months later.</li>
            <li> I have short, straight, Asian eyelashes, and I was looking for an affordable alternative to those 50-70$ eyelash serums.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The product doesn&#x27;t cost much so it&#x27;s not like I wasted money, really.</li>
            <li> Needless to say, my eyelashes look so much better!</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t attest for major growth in the length of my lashes, as I stopped using it after awhile.</li>
            <li> Select Lash seemed to make my eyelashes grow long and full whereas RapidLash only made them grow long.  </li>
            <li> on my eyelashes: I noticed a few new llashes and my old ones are much longer and prettier.</li>
            <li> Have only used one so far, but really like that it is clear serum and not milky like other brands.</li>
            <li> I hope this particular product will remain on the market for a very long time to come.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> At least it was cheap.</li>
            <li> have VERY blonde hair, thus my eyelashes are almost clear, so</li>
            <li> It dries clear and when I put mascara over it, my lashes did appear longer without a lot of extra layers of mascara and clumping.  </li>
            <li> I especially like that the tubes are clear</li>
            <li> my lashes had their natural curl back!</li>
            <li> and when I put on my mascara i actually said wow.</li>
            <li> My eyelashes were so sparse that even with mascara, you could barely see them.  </li>
            <li> I personally do not think they made my lashes much longer outside of the short run, though.</li>
            <li> As far as burning goes, I only felt the burning if I accidently got this stuff IN my eye....</li>
            <li> But I don&#x27;t think it actually grew my eyelashes so far.</li>
            <li> My lashes went back to normal after I stopped using as regularly, so you do have to keep it up.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t expect much, but because it has some of the ingredients of more expensive products with the same claims, I gave it a try.  </li>
            <li> Non irritating product, seems to be increasing eyelash fullness, have not been using more than a month so will see after amonth..</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m not sure if I&#x27;m seeing what I want or if its actually true.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical when I saw this and to be honest</li>
            <li> I am Asian with very fine thin lashes.</li>
            <li> I am glad that other people have had success with this product, but I sadly was not one of them.</li>
            <li> Seriously, I&#x27;d give this 10 stars if I could! :)</li>
            <li> I was a critic at first, but I was like its less than $3, I have tried&lt;br</li>
            <li> The other one was completely clear and normal.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical at first, but at the price it was worth a shot!  </li>
            <li> now 6 months later - my lashes are full and lush - and I hardly have to use it</li>
            <li> I have been using this for 3 weeks and have not noticed much of a change yet, other than I dont have any eyelashes falling out.  </li>
            <li> I can see on different areas of my eye that there is definite growth which is clearly obvious.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Saw nearly immediate results, but have to admit, I&#x27;ve been using Rapid Lash for several months prior, and now in conjunction with this product.  </li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say I expected much for the low, low price, but since my Tarte was almost empty, I decided there wasn&#x27;t much to lose</li>
            <li> My eyelashes have always been long but not very thick.</li>
            <li> My lashes are pretty normal; not really long, not too thick.  </li>
            <li> My eylashes needed some major help after lash extensions totally damaged them.</li>
            <li> It makes my lashes really thick and full now.</li>
            <li> I usually don&#x27;t believe some reviews that I read on Amazon, but take it from a new mom who just wants to get her sass back, it works!</li>
            <li> It will take a little time to grow your eyebrows back out, but you should notice a difference by using this product within the FIRST 2 WEEKS.</li>
            <li> I decided to start growing them back (only plucking outside of my natural brow), brushing them out daily to stimulate growth, and then I landed on this product.</li>
            <li> I have tried other products in various prices, and gotten moderate results that took much longer.</li>
            <li> i love this, it actually orked better than the other expensive one i was using!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve noticed that I don&#x27;t really have any &amp;#34;loose&amp;#34; lashes anymore (ones that fall out), and I think they are in fact slightly longer than when I started using the product.</li>
            <li> My eyelashes have always been a &#x27;medium&#x27; length, not short, but far from long.</li>
            <li> Because my natural lashes were barely long enough to \\&quot;brush\\&quot; when I started using Select Lash, the application process I used was required.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t expect much from this product because I paid so little</li>
            <li> I was a little leary about this product, but i found it to really work.</li>
            <li> worth it, the effects are slow but it does work, using it for 3 months</li>
            <li> that was black Castro oil and coconut oil mixed and everyone who looked into my eyes thought I was either intoxicated or high from the redness, do not try that technique</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little more expensive than this, but there&#x27;s no doubt when you&#x27;re using it that you&#x27;re getting new growth.  </li>
            <li> I have thin, light brown eyelashes and have long wished for longer thicker ones.</li>
            <li> I am 22 years old, with Japanese blood and have those short, thin, straight downward type of lashes.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I think after about 1 - 2 months I will see a more dramatic difference!  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t usually write reviews  on Amazon (although I rely so much on reviews when I&#x27;m buying a product)</li>
            <li> Not sure if I like this product all that much.</li>
            <li> The bottle is a tiny thing, about 2 inches long.</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t used it long enough to see a difference</li>
            <li> I have been using it for one month, and I haven&#x27;t seen any new lashes or thicker ones, but I&#x27;m going to wear it for another month or a little longer</li>
            <li> only down to this is it does NOT make your eyelashes thick and full</li>
            <li> I used to rarely leave the house without mascara, and now I hardly ever wear it!  </li>
            <li> Previously I tried Rapid Lash and saw some good reviews for this much less expensive product.</li>
            <li> far my eyelashes are slowly getting longer with the clear bottle.</li>
            <li> I just use the very tip of the brush &amp; dab it in between the lashes at the base of them, like where they&#x27;re growing out from, both on top &amp; bottom.</li>
            <li> I bought Select Lash on a whim, lured by the exceptionally low price - at $1.99, my expectations were not high.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve notice a small difference in length, but I mainly see how conditioned my lashes are.</li>
            <li> lashes were weak and short, this product has really grown them back.</li>
            <li> I can tell a difference the next day if I miss even a single night!</li>
            <li> Honestly I don&#x27;t even need to wear mascara anymore, I still do and get a dramatic effect I achieved only before with false lashes, and after only 1 coat!</li>
            <li> I was a little skeptical on buying this product because you never really know what you&#x27;re going to get with these kind of products whether you buy them in store or not.</li>
            <li> Which is disappointing since I wanted it more for the thickness than the length, but I guess I&#x27;ll see after a month how it looks.</li>
            <li> I already had long lashes before I bought this product but just wanted to see if they could grow even longer using select lash</li>
            <li> Since you get two to a package it lasts a long time.  </li>
            <li> They are long and evenly distributed again, and I no longer have to curl them before putting on mascara!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I saw noticeable results overnight, and after a few weeks of using it (not everyday)</li>
            <li> now my lashes are noticeably long</li>
            <li> When i use mascara they are really really long.</li>
            <li> My lashes are wickedly long.</li>
            <li> I think I see a difference, but I&#x27;ve not been using it long.</li>
            <li> We dont have long lashes as some people do.</li>
            <li> I have normal lashes that I consider short and not that thick.</li>
            <li> How can an eyelash serum that only cost less than one dollar can possibly work?</li>
            <li> product actually works but it does take time (for me, I started seeing results after a month a half) and you have to be religious and generous when applying the lash serum.</li>
            <li> My nieces eyelashes are growing so long that you&#x27;d think she has the most dutifully fake eyelashes!</li>
            <li> or maybe not because my lashes would already be long!</li>
            <li> So I got this stuff after reading several reviews on other products and also looking at costs.</li>
            <li> I went from using it twice a day to once every night before bed because my lashes were getting so long!</li>
            <li> I am using daily along with Latisse on the other eye.&lt;br /&gt;</li>
            <li> definitely recommend this product, especially given how little it costs.</li>
            <li> I only used this product for about three weeks, about every other day.</li>
            <li> I had very long lashes, but now in my 50&#x27;s, they had become noticeably shorter  and sparser.</li>
            <li> I put it on before mascara, let it dry and then apply mascara.</li>
            <li> Maybe you could use it after you apply Latisse and let it dry</li>
            <li> My eyelashes do look thicker and fuller after I apply this serum and let it dry.</li>
            <li> i know that when i apply this i let it dry</li>
            <li> Not sure if it is my imagination, but I saw the lengthening within the first few days</li>
            <li> I left it on overnight as it stated and in only a few uses, I saw results.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical of such an inexpensive product, but it had enough positive reviews to make me buy it</li>
            <li> I had little to no lashes due to wearing falsies for years, and now I want to rock my natural lashes</li>
            <li> As with everything, nothing works for every single person.</li>
            <li> I used it for 3 months every single day as directed.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical for the cheap price that this would actually work on lengthening my lashes but after a few weeks of use i have noticed a difference.</li>
            <li> But it&#x27;s slow , not as fast as some other people said.</li>
            <li> I tried this product after reading the reviews and figured at the price what could I loose.</li>
            <li> some loose  </li>
            <li> so I giving it a BIG O two thumbs DOWN</li>
            <li> I think I&#x27;m going to stop using it here soon because my lashes are so long and voluminous!!</li>
            <li> Lashes seemed like they lenghtened but only just slightly</li>
            <li> I had been using Tarte Eyelash Enhancer with definite results in volume and less noticeable length growth.</li>
            <li> It gives my lashes a slightly fuller and longer appearance, but there is no actual change.  </li>
            <li> I personally think this product has made a slight difference, but I am of course not 100% on that</li>
            <li> Less than a week later my lashes are noticeably longer (not just noticable to me, but everyone started commenting)</li>
            <li> Slightly longer eyelashes, waiting for it to ACTUALLY work.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only been using for a week an a half.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use the applicator because I think that would  waste the liquid on the dead part of the lash instead of the new growth closest to the lid.</li>
            <li> I am one of those people that were born with thin and short eyelashes that go straight down even when curled.</li>
            <li> Sometimes there would be a little bit of mascara left on my eyes at night and</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s only been a little over a week since I&#x27;ve been using this twice a day as recommended</li>
            <li> It did seem to condition my lashes but it just didn&#x27;t make them thicker and only made them a little longer.</li>
            <li> My lashes haven&#x27;t really gotten very thick</li>
            <li> I was a bit skeptical at getting this product because most of the reviews were negative.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t had it for long, so maybe it takes longer for results, but so far no good.</li>
            <li> Maybe because I was using a serum before this and never really stopped in between (3-4 days).</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for 2 months, &amp; I see absolutely no</li>
            <li> After 5 weeks, I noticed absolutely no difference in my lashes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> (so they look sopping wet when I go to bed).</li>
            <li> I am kind of skeptical about this brand though because i looked up secret lash online and not much came up</li>
            <li> total waste of my time and money.</li>
            <li> /&gt;This is getting a four star review because it is taking a bit longer than I expected for the product to work</li>
            <li> Total waste of money.</li>
            <li> My lashes are longer, but like everyone else mentioned, not much thicker.</li>
            <li> I SPENT.</li>
            <li> I can tell absolutely no difference.  </li>
            <li> then I expected.</li>
            <li> My lashes seem thicker, but not much longer.</li>
            <li> 35 years old, my lashes have always been short but they have started to thin.  </li>
            <li> , I mean it&#x27;s only a dollar at our local dollar store</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money on more expensive eyelash serums, this one works just as well, and I have used them all!</li>
            <li> I also notice slight burning effect, not every time and it last for about a half an hour.</li>
            <li> It helped a little with a few bare areas on my lower lashes.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The only negative was the 2nd bottle seemed to be alot less in it than the 1st tube.</li>
            <li> did not irritate my eyes (contact wearer) or make lashes fall out like some other serums.</li>
            <li> I have noted, along with other reviewers, that the lashes do not thicken, but they do not seem &amp;#34;healthier&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li> I was really skeptical at first, thinking nothing was going to do the trick.</li>
            <li> When I first ordered this item, I was skeptically</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure it actually works.</li>
            <li> This product does not exactly make eyelashes look longer, but they do look fuller.</li>
            <li> Not sure how well it actually works though.</li>
            <li> I agree with other buyers that this product won&#x27;t make your eyelashes fuller or look thicker.</li>
            <li> It comes with 2 tubes, the other one was not even opened &amp; I had thrown it away.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s pretty lame.</li>
            <li> I expected one, but it comes as it is in the picture!</li>
            <li> have to be very careful around the eyes.</li>
            <li> Dont waste your money though if you&#x27;re not going to do it every single night and apply a generous amount.</li>
            <li> really wanted this to work wonders since it is so affordable, unfortunately it doesn&#x27;t seem to work on me as well has it has on other reviewers.</li>
            <li> This inexpensive little bottle has seemed to help slightly thicken and definetly lengthen my weak little eyelashes, where other more expensive products could not.</li>
            <li> However, this salon took my lovely thick eyebrows (think of the actress Julianna Margulies&#x27;s eyebrows) down to thin, narrow Cruella DeVille eyebrows!!!  </li>
            <li> i would like to add it does not thicken or make your lashes dark .</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, I had no change whatsoever, and in addition it really irritated my eyes.</li>
            <li> I have been thinking about getting Latisse, but I hated to spend that kind of money.</li>
            <li> I have not used it long, but I am not impressed with it so far.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Thank goodness this product brought back my thick eyebrows and helped with lengthening my lashes.  </li>
            <li> The gel is plentiful and makes your lashes thick initially, but it dries and then no difference.  </li>
            <li> Hands down, NEVER sleep in your mascara if you want to prevent lash loss.</li>
            <li> One little secret I have is that I apply this to my eyebrows and WOW.</li>
            <li> I have tried a few other lash treatments that were more expensive and was not impressed.  </li>
            <li> didn&#x27;t see any dramatic results as far as length all over, but that could just be me.</li>
            <li> They have gotten slightly longer.</li>
            <li> I applied this product lashishly morning and night for a month and a half.</li>
            <li> but I did see slight results.  </li>
            <li> I used this continually for months and didn&#x27;t notice a difference in my eyelashes, but it did seem to slightly improve my brows.</li>
            <li> I just got this product-been using it twice a day for a about a week and a half now and have already seen a difference in my lashes.</li>
            <li> So I had totally bald spots, most awful ever!!</li>
            <li> I read from previous reviews you get what you pay for.</li>
            <li> I use less mascara every day, and when I take off my make-up</li>
            <li> Longer, less fall out and breakage.  </li>
            <li> It did itch/tingle slightly, but then I&#x27;m allergic to everything.</li>
            <li> Are filling in  where they had previously been.</li>
            <li> Have noticed a slight increase in lash volume.</li>
            <li> my lashes were about twice as thick, and about 1/3rd as long as when I started.</li>
            <li> Not fantastic results, but you do see a slight difference.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Negative - It burns a little bit.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product every morning and night, I put it on before applying mascara which adds a little boost to the length.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for a little over a month</li>
            <li> and it has made my lashes a little longer but not thicker.</li>
            <li> The product is chip ,and help a little be , don&#x27;t grow a lot but help a see difference in 3 weeks.</li>
            <li> It costs little and works well.</li>
            <li> It seemed to make my lashes a little bit longer, but did nothing for the thickness.</li>
            <li> It made my lashes grow a little longer and thicker.  </li>
            <li> I have super sensitive eyes and did not want to spend a lot of money on a product that would make my eyes worst.</li>
            <li> This product does burn like like hell if you accidently let any drip down into your eye or whatever!</li>
            <li> Even OTHER PEOPLE NOTICED! !</li>
            <li> so I decided to try it since my lashes are thin and short.  </li>
            <li> I applied it to my eyelashes so that they wouldn&#x27;t be dried out.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste the money.  </li>
            <li> I wasted money on this.</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t waste your time</li>
            <li> I dont wear mascara everyday</li>
            <li> forget this waste of $</li>
            <li> Waste of money and time.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t seem to work at all after using it for 2 months.my Eyes gets sting feeling when i use it and the brush was too harsh.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t work, so don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> I take Biotin everyday instead.</li>
            <li> WASTE OF MONEY</li>
            <li> I did waste time though.</li>
            <li> Anyhow, after applying serum in morning and at night for a few nights my eyelashes regained their length.  </li>
            <li> I give this a 5 star rating because my mother,niece and I use this everyday.</li>
            <li> A person gets tired of constantly putting the stuff on the eyebrows.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t usually write reviews before using a product for less than thirty days but for this I must make an exception.</li>
            <li> I wear eye glasses and have noticed that i must wear them a little lower on my nose than usual since i can feel my lashes now lightly brush across the lenses and it gets to be a bit annoying.</li>
            <li> I am a 65 year old woman - and my lashes were very thin.</li>
            <li> few week little slow grow.</li>
            <li> As a teen I was always accused of wearing false lashes when I wasn&#x27;t but as a mom in her late twenties</li>
            <li> (I mean for less than $5 you get 2 tubes, so what did I have to lose?)</li>
            <li> (My eyelashes usually don&#x27;t grow as fast)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I bought a few of them for the price, and the serum lasts a bit!</li>
            <li> So really not sure how I feel about it.</li>
            <li> The opening seems too small that a lot of the liquid gets wiped off the brush when pulling it out.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for about 3 weeks so not sure</li>
            <li> She actually thought I had fake eyelashes on.</li>
            <li> Overall, I&#x27;m not upset, but I&#x27;m certainly not impressed.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, this chain store is only found in CA, NV, TX, and AZ.</li>
            <li> Just didn&#x27;t work with me comparing to another product I&#x27;ve used in the past.</li>
            <li> Not sure if it works or not.</li>
            <li> Not sure if tis working...</li>
            <li> perhaps everyone else, I was skeptical of the this serum because of the low price.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never had extensions before, so I&#x27;m not sure how it compares to those.  </li>
            <li> Not a huge amount, but definatly noticeable!</li>
            <li> The were short, weak, and thin.</li>
            <li> r long n thick, eyebrows r thicker!!</li>
            <li> I even apply some to my eyebrows because they had become so thin due to over plucking.  </li>
            <li> Mascara is easily the worst thing for your lashes when it comes to drying them out.</li>
            <li> Rapid Lash doesn&#x27;t have this, and it&#x27;s hard to know when I need to re-order it.  </li>
            <li> but I havent gotten desperate enough to spend hundreds of dollars to get them as my budget wont allow that.  </li>
            <li> I use it at least once a day and on days I remember, twice.</li>
            <li> all the lashes I had gained from Rapid Lash and by the time you figure it out, it is too late to return.&lt;br /&gt;Scam</li>
            <li> it about 6 wks at least once a day</li>
            <li> Duh- under my bathroom sink.</li>
            <li> With an inconvenient brush like that, I have to put in extra efforts for my lashes to fully be covered by the serum.&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li> You have to use it at least twice a day on the eyebrows and they will grow but the minute you stop using it, the eyebrows stop growing out.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not totally amazing and will work miracles, but does help grow your eyelashes.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;The serum also uses slowly.</li>
            <li> Well after reading the reviews I took a chance, I mean what did I have to lose for the delivery fee</li>
            <li> So I am Asian which means I wasn&#x27;t bored with ooh-la-la look at me lashes!</li>
            <li> IT DOESN&#x27;T MEAN I FORGET</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve wasted my money in the past on expensive products that don&#x27;t deliver.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The product isn&#x27;t bad, I myself believe it&#x27;s worked for me, and so I recommend going to your local 99Cents store, heading over to the beauty section, and grabbing yourself one of these.</li>
            <li> This might work for me, but I&#x27;ll never know because it irritated my eyes so badly that I only used it once.</li>
            <li> My eyes were red, puffy, painful, and irritated.</li>
            <li> Certainly not as good as rapid lash.  </li>
            <li> My lashes were just dull!</li>
            <li> I have been using this for months, and was thoroughly disappointed that they stopped carrying it at my local 99 Cents store.  </li>
            <li> Thick lashes will soon be yours!</li>
            <li> think it horrible to require a certain amount of words from us to describe whether we like a product or not.</li>
            <li> and the tips are extremely thin.</li>
            <li> and I was confused.</li>
            <li> I had been on some migraine medication that was making my hair thin and fall out.</li>
            <li> Also, out of curiosity, I applied it to my thin eyebrows to see if it would do anything, and it didn&#x27;t.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have naturally thin brows</li>
            <li> Dont waste your money on the expensive stuff!</li>
            <li> I had a HORRIBLE experience at a new salon which was offer brow shaping by using the &amp;#34;threading&amp;#34; process.</li>
            <li> and I have NEW eyelashes growing out from the base of my eyelids!!</li>
            <li> and I see a bit of a difference nothing dramatic.</li>
            <li> I like that this product adds a very subtle, but noticeable, &#x27;oomph&#x27; to my eyes without using mascara.  </li>
            <li> I had a lot of broken eyelashes, that made gaps and just made my eye lashes look weird.  </li>
            <li> cause that was getting expensive.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical to try this product since I read the reviews.</li>
            <li> fact that you receive 2pks for mere pennies is a plus too.</li>
            <li> Sadly, I didn&#x27;t see a difference at all.</li>
            <li> I use to wear fake lashes but now that I am using this I have found that they are no longer needed.</li>
            <li> It was way too expensive for my wallet.</li>
            <li> For this price you cant go wrong.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t go wrong for that price.</li>
            <li> Anyways, I came across this lash serum because I wanted to fill in the gaps I got for getting fake lashes glued to my lashes.</li>
            <li> I was kinda sad to read that it didn&#x27;t work for some people BC</li>
            <li> its does work alittle but the price is wrong</li>
            <li> Sorry I was hoping it would.</li>
            <li> For the price on this I was really skeptical to see if this would work or not.</li>
            <li> It might not give you some crazy result, and it takes time to see the difference, but it does work, and does make your lashes stronger and thicker.</li>
            <li> I have been using this for a week and needless to say this items works!  </li>
            <li> And when I do apply mascara they look fake!</li>
            <li> SINCE MY EYELASHES BECAME THIN AFTER HAVING MY SON!!</li>
            <li> The brush is not designed for eye lashes and thus is unpleasant.</li>
            <li> I was very skeptical, and I am now a believer.</li>
            <li> It burns really bad.</li>
            <li> I get the price isn&#x27;t bad on here (even with S&amp;H), but why wait a couple days?</li>
            <li> this badly.</li>
            <li> (pollen has been really bad</li>
            <li> If I could give it a bad mark on anything, it would probably have to be...</li>
            <li> I was shocked to see results in just over a week.</li>
            <li> For the price I was rather shocked.</li>
            <li> I had purchased these specifically for my sister and my mom because they are sick of paying $120 a month for the both of them for eyelash extensions.</li>
            <li> Very disappointing product.  </li>
            <li> CANT GO WRONG!!</li>
            <li> Using it as a base coat for mascara is probably</li>
            <li> I hate to say I did not see any results...</li>
            <li> I was shocked, utterly shocked that something so inexpensive could work!!!</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> i bought 4 of them and i&#x27;ve been using them for 3 months or more, but i haven&#x27;t seen any difference, so sad....</li>
            <li> I use it more as an eyelash conditioner than a lash grower.  For me it maintains my length and thickness.  And the price can&#x27;t be beat!</li>
            <li> Works great! This is the second time I have ordered this and I will order again, especially for the price</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s cheap so I wanted to give it a try especially for all the reviews being more positive than negative. What do I have to lose.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s been atleast over 2 months using this product, and it has done nothing for me. No change in length or more lashes. It has not shown any difference at all for me and I wanted to mention that I&#x27;m asian having short fine lashes. My lashes this day looks the same as always. I just wanted to write a review and its not often that I do so to show that it didnt work for me.</li>
            <li> Wasn&#x27;t sure what to think about trying this, as the price is so low and tempting. I read the reviews others had posted and figured it was worth a try.  My lashes are pretty normal; not really long, not too thick.  I&#x27;d say within 2 weeks of using this twice daily, I noticed an increase in my lash length.  Volume, not so much, but that&#x27;s what mascara is for! Especially with my mascara (which I did not which brands) they look super long! I put it on right after my Eyelash Serum dries. It acts as a primer.  I will be continuing to use this product as I am very happy with its results :)</li>
            <li> I was looking for a replacement for Rapidlash cause that was getting expensive. I saw results really fast, noticed longer lashes in 2-3 weeks. Maybe because I was using a serum before this and never really stopped in between (3-4 days). My lashes looked longer but didn&#x27;t seem thicker. Then the growth seemed to stop. I thought the active ingredients had stopped working, it does get air exposure everyday, even thought the tube was more than half full. I opened up the second tube. Lashes seemed like they lenghtened but only just slightly and the tips are extremely thin. Plus side: did not irritate my eyes (contact wearer) or make lashes fall out like some other serums. The serum is clear and jelly-like, comes in a clear tube and the applicator is like a mascara wand.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for 2 months, &amp; I see absolutely no results.&lt;br /&gt;I gave one to my sister &amp; she said it made her eye itch a bit.&lt;br /&gt;There were no results at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It was really cheap, so you should give it a try to see if it works for you.</li>
            <li> This thing gave me an eye infection!</li>
            <li> this has NO color.  It is not a mascara, it is a conditioner.  I use to twice a day, morning and night when I wash my face, and also under mascara to protect my lashes.  Mascara also looks thicker and washes off easier.</li>
            <li> Saw nearly immediate results, but have to admit, I&#x27;ve been using Rapid Lash for several months prior, and now in conjunction with this product.  Thought I saw immediate lengthening. I like the clear container.  Rapid Lash doesn&#x27;t have this, and it&#x27;s hard to know when I need to re-order it.  I won&#x27;t have that problem with this product.  Price can&#x27;t be beat.</li>
            <li> I have been thinking about getting Latisse, but I hated to spend that kind of money. So I have been searching for a product that might help with my, nearly non-existant, lashes. I have been using this product for 12 days now. My lashes are already 50% longer. I am SUPER EXCITED!!!! I can&#x27;t wait to see what my lashes look like after 30days of continuous use!! I haven&#x27;t noticed them getting any thicker, just longer. For the price, I am impressed and will be ordering more.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t expect too much for the price I paid. But after 2 weeks of using it twice a day I start seen some results. I also notice slight burning effect, not every time and it last for about a half an hour. Worth to try.</li>
            <li> It does lengthen my eye lash! Amazing</li>
            <li> Worked like a charm ! ! ! !</li>
            <li> Makes my eyes itch. Don&#x27;t see a difference, I knew it was too good to be true...get the real stuff</li>
            <li> Love this serum.  Use it over and over an over.  Lengthens and thickens lashes and brows.</li>
            <li> I used it for a while. Did not notice a difference. Its conditioning and I paid $5 for it but I&#x27;ve heard that Castor oil works better. My lashes did not get longer..</li>
            <li> I paid more money for my previous serum but this one is awesome, cheap and works perfect&lt;br /&gt;I recommend this  product. I actually just use it at night time as it leaves white residue once it dries out. love it</li>
            <li> Hasn&#x27;t done a thing for me.</li>
            <li> I LOVE LOVE this product. IT REALLY WORKS. The only dislike I have is that it doesnt make my lashes thicker.I use the serum everyday and Iam very satisified with the length of my lashes :)</li>
            <li> I was a bit skeptical at getting this product because most of the reviews were negative. But I decided to give it a try and let me just tell you the product came on the first due-date \\&quot;range\\&quot; which was really soon! When I opened it I thought it was going to be like a liquid eyeliner kind of thing but it came as a clear mascara and I was confused. I really thought it wasn&#x27;t going to work! So I tried it because I wanted to see if it would or wouldn&#x27;t and so far my eyelashes have been growing! Reviews have said it stings,... I still haven&#x27;t felt it stinging yet. Reviews have said it seperates your lashes,... when you apply it, it does. I have had this for about a week now, I don&#x27;t even use it twice a day like it says I should and my lashes have really been growing! (My eyelashes usually don&#x27;t grow as fast)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, this product is amazing and when it runs out (even though it comes alot in a tube and there were two in one order) I am definitely rebuying! .....or maybe not because my lashes would already be long!</li>
            <li> I havn&#x27;t  really used it all that much to see a difference. However it did come in the mail very soon.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t tell if it works yet, all I know is they have to minimize the burning effect. I don&#x27;t even have to get it in my eyes, the fumes make my eyes burn and water, and my eyes are not at all sensitive! What the heck is in this stuff?? UPDATE: Does not seem to be working well. Rapidlash did seem to work a lot better. It does however, work a tiny bit.</li>
            <li> Well after reading the reviews I took a chance, I mean what did I have to lose for the delivery fee right?? Well I been using this product as directed and nothing has changed so I giving it a BIG O two thumbs DOWN didn&#x27;t work for me!!!</li>
            <li> I am still using this product so far I have not noticed any improvement but I will continue to try.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for MONTHS now! I always purchase more because it does work! I first purchased the serum in February of this year and I have used it ever since, my lashed were falling out and were longer/shorter in different areas. In the matter of 4 weeks my lashes grew longer and there was more volume to them. I use it twice a day, morning and again at night. I think I&#x27;m going to stop using it here soon because my lashes are so long and voluminous!! I don&#x27;t think i need any more growth but I will keep the product around just in case i ever need it again. I would recommend this product; it does work you just have to stay committed to using it and you will see results.</li>
            <li> My daughter lovesthis stuff!</li>
            <li> I have tried a few other lash treatments that were more expensive and was not impressed.  I bought Select Lash on a whim, lured by the exceptionally low price - at $1.99, my expectations were not high.  Surprisingly, this product worked better than all of the other pricier treatments.  I have been using it twice daily for 3 months and my lashes are noticeably longer.  I used to rarely leave the house without mascara, and now I hardly ever wear it!  It doesn&#x27;t really increase the fullness of lashes, nor does it make them darker, but if what you&#x27;re looking for is length this product is awesome.</li>
            <li> When the package arrived, one of the serums was not sealed in the package. I have not used it long, but I am not impressed with it so far. And DONT GET THIS STUFF IN YOUR EYES!!!  It burns really bad. I have not used it since it got in my eye. I used it fo two weeks before that but I did not see a difference with my lashes or brow.</li>
            <li> I had been using Tarte Eyelash Enhancer with definite results in volume and less noticeable length growth. About halfway through my second tube, my results plateaued. My lashes never reached an impressive length. I saw Select Lash Eyelash Serum here on Amazon as I was ordering another skin care product. I can&#x27;t say I expected much for the low, low price, but since my Tarte was almost empty, I decided there wasn&#x27;t much to lose and I ordered the Select Lash. I was shocked to see results in just over a week. I applied the serum twice daily as instructed. I did not experience any burning or stinging even when I accidently got too close to my eye. I also did not have any problems wearing the serum under my mascara, in fact, it seemed to enhance the look of my mascara, kind of like a primer. I also noticed I was no longer experiencing smearing of my mascara under my eyes by the end of the day as had been a daily problem for me. I don&#x27;t really know what the active ingredient is in this serum, but it has certainly lengthened my lashes in a very short time. Budget friendly and effective.</li>
            <li> I cannot believe that this product - which I have been purchasing for $1.00 a pop - has worked so well.  I apply it in the morning and in the evening.  My eyelashes seem to be longer and pop out more.  I have noted, along with other reviewers, that the lashes do not thicken, but they do not seem &amp;#34;healthier&amp;#34;.  I have been using this for months, and was thoroughly disappointed that they stopped carrying it at my local 99 Cents store.  I just placed an order from Amazon for a two-pack.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have VERY blonde hair, thus my eyelashes are almost clear, so I like that this product adds a very subtle, but noticeable, &#x27;oomph&#x27; to my eyes without using mascara.  GREAT deal for the price!</li>
            <li> Been using this product for 5 days now and I use it twice a day like reccommened. For far I have noticed my eyelashes getting longer!</li>
            <li> I have been using this for a week and needless to say this items works!  I don&#x27;t believe in wearing the falsies so I tried a DIY from YouTube that was black Castro oil and coconut oil mixed and everyone who looked into my eyes thought I was either intoxicated or high from the redness, do not try that technique, it&#x27;s horrible!!&lt;br /&gt;Select Lash serum works wonders and I see a difference in my lashes and brows in just 1 week of use and I have NO irritation to this product.  I would highly recommend it to anyone who has lash and brow issues!  For someone who has minimum to no lashes this is my proof of the product.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t work just buy latisse</li>
            <li> I tried this stuff faithfully, twice a day for 8 weeks. No change. However, it seemed to help as a \\&quot;primer\\&quot;--making my lashes look fuller after putting mascara on.</li>
            <li> I used this product now for weeks and see no change whatsoever. I will order Mavala[[ASIN:B002IS553Y Mavala Double-Lash - lengthens and thickens lashes (.3 oz)]] Double Lash next time again. It gave me visible results in just one week. Again I tried to save money and went with something cheaper, and somehow it never works out. Will never buy this product again.</li>
            <li> This honestly did not work for me. I used the two bottles and still my eyelashes did not grow. wouldn&#x27;t buy it again.</li>
            <li> Honestly I did see growth in my eyelashes and the length is noticeable, so I am happy about that. Saw no results in eyebrow growth despite using this for probably 8 months now. So not buying this again.</li>
            <li> Definitely have noticed a difference! My lashes arent fuller but they are longer. And for the price you just cant beat it.</li>
            <li> I see no difference 3 weeks later but it was worth a try.  It also made my eyes itch. But considering the price,idon&#x27;t feel ripped off.</li>
            <li> I was really skeptical at first, thinking nothing was going to do the trick. To my surprise it really does work! I bought a few of them for the price, and the serum lasts a bit! I am really pleased. I started noticing longer lashes within the first week!</li>
            <li> Ok! So I got this stuff after reading several reviews on other products and also looking at costs. This got awesome ratings and the cost is unbeatable! I have been using said product now for 2 weeks and I can already tell a difference. My individual lashes are not thicker but there are new lashes making the most lashes I&#x27;ve ever had at one time. They have gotten slightly longer. Again it&#x27;s only been two weeks. I got more and gave one to my mom and seeing how it works on her. Excellent product!</li>
            <li> not too sure that it works to thicken eyelashes, maybe works as a conditioner but I am a natural blonde who disguises it lol, so I need some thicker lashes! But for a penny and shipping I can&#x27;t complain! I will continue to use and see how it goes.</li>
            <li> I gave this a try because it was so inexpensive.  After 5 weeks, I noticed absolutely no difference in my lashes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Positive - It does make my mascara go on well.  It gives my lashes a slightly fuller and longer appearance, but there is no actual change.  Using it as a base coat for mascara is probably it&#x27;s best use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Negative - It burns a little bit.  It didn&#x27;t actually improve my lashes.</li>
            <li> THIS STUFF IS AWESOME. I am a daily mascara wearer. I don&#x27;t have extremely short lashes, and I don&#x27;t really have lashes that get compliments, so I think I am in the &#x27;normal&#x27; range. This is what I have learned from experience with many lash growth products.. Lashes are literally hair. If you don&#x27;t actively condition your lashes, they will dry out and break for numerous reasons on top of the natural shed. Mascara is easily the worst thing for your lashes when it comes to drying them out. Hands down, NEVER sleep in your mascara if you want to prevent lash loss. This product is GREAT. I can tell a difference the next day if I miss even a single night! They are straighter, which appears longer, and they are conditioned, so my mascara goes on more smooth, which looks longer. I can see on different areas of my eye that there is definite growth which is clearly obvious.&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t see any dramatic results as far as length all over, but that could just be me. I have had ZERO shedding that I have noticed. One little secret I have is that I apply this to my eyebrows and WOW. MASSIVE DIFFERENCE. I apply a VERY generous amount (so they look sopping wet when I go to bed). I wanted to reshape my brows and I could regrow hairs in about a week and it was like shaping them from scratch. WORTH BUYING. Period. Dont waste your money though if you&#x27;re not going to do it every single night and apply a generous amount.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this before my mascara for months. I could tell the first day. And I can tell of I skip a day.</li>
            <li> I applied this product lashishly morning and night for a month and a half. By the time I got half way through the second bottle the only good thing I had to say about it was the alcohol in it did not irritate my eyes.</li>
            <li> I already had long lashes before I bought this product but just wanted to see if they could grow even longer using select lash, I mean it&#x27;s only a dollar at our local dollar store so it wouldn&#x27;t hurt to try. I wasn&#x27;t expecting much since I got it at the dollar store but I&#x27;ve been using it for about 2 weeks and I&#x27;ve definitely seen a difference!</li>
            <li> I purchased this product just to see what it might do.  I didn&#x27;t expect much, but because it has some of the ingredients of more expensive products with the same claims, I gave it a try.  I have very sensitive eyes and skin etc, I wear no mascara and have sparse eyelashes and eyebrows.  I used it twice a day for a week, and was a bit concerned that the product in the tube became cloudy.....but I did see slight results.  I had a coworker ask if I had started wearing mascara, so it was evident to others more than to me.  It is fragrance free and did not bother my eyes or skin.  I will continue to use it to see if with time the results will improve.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for about a month and I haven&#x27;t noticed a difference. It also burns my eyes so I have to use it right when I plan on going to bed and not in the morning. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I think it actually works ! My eye lashes got longer I can feel it through wearing  glasses. But it&#x27;s slow , not as fast as some other people said.</li>
            <li> I have used it for  two weeks and it just doesn&#x27;t seem to work, want else can i say. i don&#x27;t like it</li>
            <li> I just received this in the mail 2 days ago. I had purchased these specifically for my sister and my mom because they are sick of paying $120 a month for the both of them for eyelash extensions. I bought these for them and they have used them for 2 DAYS now and they are already seeing results!!! It&#x27;s that fast!!! Best product I&#x27;ve ever purchased as gifts!!</li>
            <li> HIGHLY RECOMMENDED. BE CONSISTANT MORNING AND BEDTIME. AND AFTER MAYBE A MONTH YOU WILL START NOTICING MORE AND FULLER LASHES AND I EVEN PUT ON MY BROWS AS WELL:)</li>
            <li> Did not see any difference. So really not sure how I feel about it. Do not think I will try it again.</li>
            <li> This product is great and was represented as it is. I would recommend it to anyone.I am very satisfied with the product.</li>
            <li> Do buy this!!! This stuff is fabulous! I can&#x27;t believe this stuff is this affordable. It should be sold out everywhere. It works just Like latesse without the side effects. Takes a few weeks to really get results so don&#x27;t give up after a week or two. It is so worth the wait I promise. After 6 weeks the result is nothing short of miraculous! My lashes are super thick and super long now. Honestly it looks like I have on lash extensions. I love it!!!!</li>
            <li> I have been using Rapidlash and it is Awesome! I just started this and it feels good on my lashes.&lt;br /&gt;If you have short eyelashes, I really recommend the Rapidlash. 1 container of that and my lashes were almost&lt;br /&gt;hitting my eyebrows. I won&#x27;t stop using that, but I am trying this serum for a break. Will let you know in a couple of weeks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: I have been wearing this and this has been really softened my lashes. I like the way it feels and it doesn&#x27;t burn. Don&#x27;t put this on before you put on your mascara or after, it will make your mascara smear. I put this on at night and in the morning my lashes are ready to go. I do love the way it feels.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for about 2 months now and don&#x27;t really see a difference in length or volume. I saw all the great reviews and thought I&#x27;d give it a try since it was so inexpensive, what do I have to lose? The opening seems too small that a lot of the liquid gets wiped off the brush when pulling it out. I just wished I had better results like some of the other users did.</li>
            <li> Very nice product, Easy to apply, smells good and I&#x27;m eager to see the results.&lt;br /&gt;Did not hurt my eyes.</li>
            <li> I was a little skeptical on buying this product because you never really know what you&#x27;re going to get with these kind of products whether you buy them in store or not. But I was pleasantly surprised by it. It did add length to my eyelashes. It didn&#x27;t add much volume but you can always use a volumizing mascara</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve notice a small difference in length, but I mainly see how conditioned my lashes are. They are easy to curl and make my mascara look very whispy. For the low price, you get what you pay for. But it will make your lashes soft and easy to curl.</li>
            <li> I received it probably a week after I ordered it. It came exactly as ordered with the two bottles. However one bottle had a yellowish tinge in the serum with a frothy substance in it. The other one was completely clear and normal. I don’t know what it is. I can’t get it out of the bottle without dumping the entire contents out. I am not using that bottle and am using the clear serum one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So far my eyelashes are slowly getting longer with the clear bottle. the smell is a cheap perfume kind of smell which is not bad but artificial. All in all it was a pretty good purchase for the price and might be buying more if the results continue. It made my eyelashes longer, but not thicker like it claimed on the packaging. I am kind of skeptical about this brand though because i looked up secret lash online and not much came up so I hope that it is working and not secretly harming me. Anyway if you want a SUPER cheap serum that really slowly lengthens your lashes, this is the one for you!</li>
            <li> Contrary to what it says it will do, my lashes did not get longer or thicker.  However, it does make a great base for mascara.  It dries clear and when I put mascara over it, my lashes did appear longer without a lot of extra layers of mascara and clumping.  Since you get two to a package it lasts a long time.  I doubt I&#x27;d buy it again.</li>
            <li> this was a good price so I decided to try it since my lashes are thin and short.  I dont see any more length or thickness but the lashes appear to be more moisturized which helps somewhat with their appearance.  I might or might not purchase again- I just  havent decided yet... I really need thicker,longer lashes but I havent gotten desperate enough to spend hundreds of dollars to get them as my budget wont allow that.  I will continue to research and maybe try something else but I dont think I will find anything else for this price.I would recommend this product as a beginning in the search for better eyelashes- it certainly cant hurt.</li>
            <li> I just wanted to try because its cheap. I doesnt work. All good comments are lie about it. It is just wasting time and money.</li>
            <li> I been using this product for 3 months and I don&#x27;t see any difference jet in my eye lashes I don&#x27;t know if these work only for some people</li>
            <li> This works really well. My eyelashes are growing the serum has the basic ingredients such as castor oil and such without the hassle of grabbing all 3 bottles at once just to put one serum.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for about 3 weeks so not sure if I see any difference in anything just yet so I don&#x27;t know if it takes 4 or more weeks but I haven&#x27;t really noticed any thickening, longer or darkening of my eyelashes.  But for the price I&#x27;m not mad at all as the price was fantastic so I will continue to use it until both tubes are going which should be about 2 or 3 months or so and will update then as to if I notice any new growth.</li>
            <li> Fast delvery of product and it was as promised. I does work and I would order it again. Very Happy</li>
            <li> I was skeptical to try this product since I read the reviews. There was 50-50 chance and the price for this was so cheap. I decided to give it a try. I am glad I did. My lashes were short and stubby. With the help of select lash, they are now longer and fuller. I am very satisfied with my purchase. The only reason I gave a 4 star instead of 5 is the wand that came with it doesn&#x27;t work very well. It doesn&#x27;t pick up the product well enough. That is the only thing I dislike about this product. And there was no stinging or anything.</li>
            <li> I noticed results quicker when I used it twice a day. It&#x27;s moisturizing with no irritation and it&#x27;s quick to put on! Sometimes there would be a little bit of mascara left on my eyes at night and when using this the brush took it off and it was filled with mascara as time passed so watch out for that! Otherwise it works great and the price couldn&#x27;t be better!</li>
            <li> All the women in my family are allergic to this. It makes our eyes burn and water and our lids swell. I recommend purchasing from Ardell if you want an eyelash serum</li>
            <li> 35 years old, my lashes have always been short but they have started to thin.  I use this on my lashes mostly on weekends although if I wash my face before bed I will use it then too.  Eyelashes are thicker and longer but not freakishly so.  Love it!</li>
            <li> I think I will stick to castor oil. Its Cheaper and you do see results. This serum also caused my eyes to burn a bit. I would not recommend it to anyone and I would not repurchase.</li>
            <li> I was expecting a growth type serum, but I think this was more a clear mascara. After layering this solution with regular mascara, my eyelashes do appear to be longer. Not thicker, just longer. It works well for an immediate result.</li>
            <li> When I first ordered this item, I was skeptically but I figured &amp;#34; why not&amp;#34; because the item was so inexpensive. How can an eyelash serum that only cost less than one dollar can possibly work? The shipping arrived before the scheduled time which was nice. I started using the serum as instructed. After about 3 weeks I notice my lashed were getting longer. I am Asian with very fine thin lashes. Anything would be an improvement. I went from using it twice a day to once every night before bed because my lashes were getting so long! I even apply some to my eyebrows because they had become so thin due to over plucking.  My eyebrows have grown back in and look very lovely. From the time I started using this product I had stop using mascara because I didn&#x27;t know if it would make the serum less potent. After seeing my eyelashes grow, I finally put on mascara after 1 month and my best friend noticed immediately.  She actually thought I had fake eyelashes on.My daughter gave me compliments as well. The only think I wish was that it made my lashes more fuller. Overall,  I am completely satisfied. I would recommend this product to anybody. Even though I got 2 tube from my first order; I already ordered 6 more to give as gifts. Thanks for this amazing product!</li>
            <li> The directions say to use morning and night, but I only use it in the mornings on my lashes and my brows. I can see a difference in my lashes as far as length goes. I don&#x27;t think for me it adds thickness. Also I can see growth in my brows, and it is a great brow tamer.&lt;br /&gt;The fact that you receive 2pks for mere pennies is a plus too.</li>
            <li> This product &#x27;flaked&#x27; too much and irritated my eyes, so I had to stop using it. It gives a nice &#x27;wet look&#x27; to your eyelashes, and is a good price. I wasn&#x27;t able to wear it long enough to ascertain if it works to improve growth.</li>
            <li> I really like this product. When I was in my twenties I had very long lashes, but now in my 50&#x27;s, they had become noticeably shorter  and sparser. I had to curl them before putting on mascara in order to even get them to show up.  I started using this and after only about two weeks my lashes looked the way they did in my 20&#x27;s. They are long and evenly distributed again, and I no longer have to curl them before putting on mascara!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would have given this five stars if they had also become thicker and darker as some products claim to do, but for the price, this stuff is terrific.</li>
            <li> Maybe it is my imagination but since I have been using this product, my lashes are thicker and  longer. I notice them more when I use mascara.</li>
            <li> Non irritating product, seems to be increasing eyelash fullness, have not been using more than a month so will see after amonth..but so far seems decent.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m currently on my third week of using this product and I LOVE IT.&lt;br /&gt;I never had those &amp;#34;eyelashes to die for&amp;#34; and now I use this WITH Sephora&#x27;s Benefit They&#x27;re Real mascara&lt;br /&gt;and oh my goodness, I think my eyelashes look fantastic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other people have experienced the burning or irritation, and me having very sensitive skin did not experience any of that. I put it on two times a day for best results&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only down to this is it does NOT make your eyelashes thick and full, it just grows the ones you already have.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t work for me!&lt;br /&gt;No growth or fullness noticed after mints of use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think it horrible to require a certain amount of words from us to describe whether we like a product or not.</li>
            <li> I used this product faithfully for months but never saw a difference in my eyelashes. I would not buy or advise anyone to purchase this product.  It seems to just have mineral oil in it.</li>
            <li> I bought this exact same product about a week ago at a 99Cents store near me. The bottle is a tiny thing, about 2 inches long. I personally think this product has made a slight difference, but I am of course not 100% on that (might just be my brain making me think there&#x27;s been improvement). The liquid itself isn&#x27;t too watery, but it also doesn&#x27;t dry up like mascara, and it has an almost sweet smell to it. The product isn&#x27;t bad, I myself believe it&#x27;s worked for me, and so I recommend going to your local 99Cents store, heading over to the beauty section, and grabbing yourself one of these. I get the price isn&#x27;t bad on here (even with S&amp;H), but why wait a couple days?</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t really see a huge difference in length to my lashes and eyebrows but I feel like it help give it a boost in growing new hairs.</li>
            <li> I used it months ago and it really seem to have made a difference.  I just bought another tube today and i am going to continue for 16 weeks to get the maximum and permanent results. That is what I read that the manufacturer had stated. Thanks</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t really notice an improvement but in all fairness I gave it three stars because I wasn&#x27;t very consistent about using it. As a matter of fact, I still have an unused vial and I plan on finishing what I started</li>
            <li> I actually really like this. It is cheap, and I did notice more of a fullness to my lashes when I used it. It was noticeable to the point that my best friend and boyfriend commented. My lashes went back to normal after I stopped using as regularly, so you do have to keep it up. You may get the same effect just by putting coconut oil or mineral oil on your lashes, but I liked this.</li>
            <li> Not fantastic results, but you do see a slight difference. For this price, I would definitely recommend trying it though!</li>
            <li> My eyelashes have always been a &#x27;medium&#x27; length, not short, but far from long. This stuff makes your eyelashes feel so soft and strong!! It also makes them grow quite a bit. Once I had about 1/4 left in one tube I added my homemade eyelash serum (coconut oil, castor oil, olive oil, &amp; vitamin E) and used it at night. Needless to say, my eyelashes look so much better! Love this!!!</li>
            <li> This product did not do what it said it would.  Very disappointing product.  Have been using it for four weeks and nothing.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t comment yet. on results. I am using daily along with Latisse on the other eye.&lt;br /&gt; I don&#x27;t use the applicator because I think that would  waste the liquid on the dead part of the lash instead of the new growth closest to the lid. Instead I use my Latisse brushes to dip into the serum. Latisse says to apply only to the lash at the eyelid, so I&#x27;m doing the same with this serum.</li>
            <li> i love this, it actually orked better than the other expensive one i was using!! i ordered a second one!!</li>
            <li> Good moisturizer but don&#x27;t expect to see any eyebrows or eyelashes growth. Great conditioner though. Will probably not buy again</li>
            <li> Really love this lash conditioner. It makes mascara easier to apply. Well worth the money and some. Will order this product again.</li>
            <li> I bought these to help enhance the eyelashes, But they didn&#x27;t help, AT ALL. There was no fullness, or growth with the lashes</li>
            <li> This had great reviews so I bought several and now I realize I shouldn&#x27;t have.  It didn&#x27;t help my eyelashes at all.  Some products bother my eyes.  Although this did nothing for my eyelashes, it didn&#x27;t hurt my eyes or eyelashes either...</li>
            <li> This eyelash serum goes on smooth.  It primes the lashes before I apply my mascara.  I especially like that the tubes are clear so I can tell when I run low.  This serum is more moderately priced then other serums.  The two pack is a convenient way to purchase your serum @ a good price.</li>
            <li> This might work for me, but I&#x27;ll never know because it irritated my eyes so badly that I only used it once. My eyes were red, puffy, painful, and irritated. They were watery and sensitive for a full day after using this once. I have used many other lash conditioners in the past but this is the first that&#x27;s irritated my eyes this badly.</li>
            <li> I saw growth using this stuff. It wasn&#x27;t freakish or anything like that but it definitely made a difference.  It is clear and I would apply at night when my eye lashes were clean, I don&#x27;t recommend putting it on under mascara because it will cause racoon eyes!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t usually write reviews before using a product for less than thirty days but for this I must make an exception. I have been using Select Lash for twenty days and my lashes have grown very much already. My lashes haven&#x27;t really gotten very thick but I don&#x27;t mind because mascara will do that. I have used eye lash serums before and they don&#x27;t even come close to these results  I&#x27;m just so happy that they have grown as much as they have in such a short period of time.  Great value at such a low cost, I couldn&#x27;t be happier.</li>
            <li> This product got here pretty fast. Overall, kudos to the seller.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product itself... I&#x27;m not sure it actually works. I was advised by my dermatologist to buy some eyelash serum for my eyebrows. I didn&#x27;t see any clear results, but I&#x27;m not too upset because the price was pretty cheap. Overall, I&#x27;m not upset, but I&#x27;m certainly not impressed.</li>
            <li> This stuff works really really well, I had to write a review on it. I saw noticeable results overnight, and after a few weeks of using it (not everyday) my lashes were about twice as thick, and about 1/3rd as long as when I started. Also, I have gone about 1 or 2 months without using any at all and my lashes have remained in the same improved condition. Honestly I don&#x27;t even need to wear mascara anymore, I still do and get a dramatic effect I achieved only before with false lashes, and after only 1 coat! The name brand mascara that has built in lash boosters does not work at all, they only keep your eyelashes from getting weaker from using the mascara. This works much better, I try to apply a coat once a day before regular mascara. If you use this twice a day as recommended you will see dramatic results in a month and more than likely nice results in just a couple of days. I don&#x27;t think it would hurt to use it 3 times a day and would even improve results, as each time you use it you see an improvement that stays. Great stuff! One of my best buys of 2012. I should make a youtube video on it but I&#x27;m not getting endorsed. To show you how good this stuff works, I was getting my makeup done by a celeb makeup artist and they did not want to add mascara because they thought my lashes looked so good :)</li>
            <li> This is an awesome product, if you are looking for eyelash growth...this is it!!&lt;br /&gt;My lashes were weak and short, this product has really grown them back.</li>
            <li> I have tried many lash growth products.  I liked this one the most because it stays clear even when dry, does not flake, can be worn during the day, and smells good.  The applicator is easy to use.  My eyelashes did grow longer, but not fuller.  My eyebrows did not change though.</li>
            <li> I have thin, light brown eyelashes and have long wished for longer thicker ones. This inexpensive little bottle has seemed to help slightly thicken and definetly lengthen my weak little eyelashes, where other more expensive products could not. Plus, I&#x27;ve been only using once daily instead of twice as recommended. I only gave 4 stars because it does seem to very mildly irritate my eyes, which are very sensitive. A great little product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m usin this product with rivitalash eyelash growing serum ,,,I noticed my eyelashes became longer .....&lt;br /&gt;thx so much ......</li>
            <li> Use this product religiously every morning and in the evening before I went to bed until I used it all...I hate to say I did not see any results...on to the next product!</li>
            <li> This product is not only the cheapest but it really works. It has the best applicator(mascara brush-like) of all the other lash enhancers.</li>
            <li> This has grown my lashes but really made a difference in my brows. They are full and look great</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t improve length at all!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m two weeks into using it and I notice a difference already, my lashes are longer and straighter, can&#x27;t wait to see how they look in a few more weeks!</li>
            <li> I think the stuff works, only thing is, you don&#x27;t notice that big of a transformation. After 2 weeks of using it twice a day, the results weren&#x27;t as grand as the packaging says. Like I said, it works. It&#x27;s just not as grand results as you would think it should be.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff! It&#x27;s inexpensive and works better than rapid lash in my opinion. The results are noticeable within a week</li>
            <li> I ordered this project and received it on time. It&#x27;s only been a little over a week since I&#x27;ve been using this twice a day as recommended and I am already seeing growth with my lashes. I had little to no lashes due to wearing falsies for years, and now I want to rock my natural lashes and I am excited to see the results in 30 days</li>
            <li> My sister and I both are using this.  I can tell a difference with my lashes already and it has been 3 weeks I think.  I use it both am and pm, every day.  My sister uses it when she remembers, so my lashes are reacting quicker than hers.  I am sure hers will be the same once she get into a routine.</li>
            <li> I guess when you use Latisse you can&#x27;t compare to anything else. Sadly, I didn&#x27;t see a difference at all.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t work in a short period of time, but after trying it for 2 months (used up both bottles), the differences are visible. It is definitely a product that I will keep buying!</li>
            <li> I am one of those people that were born with thin and short eyelashes that go straight down even when curled. When I used a cheap eyelash curler, it literally ripped out an ENTIRE gap of lashes on my lash line! Researched for a while to find a good product to restore and grow my lashes and came across this one on Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product actually works but it does take time (for me, I started seeing results after a month a half) and you have to be religious and generous when applying the lash serum. Every morning, every night, and even when I came out of the pool or the ocean I applied it to my eyelashes so that they wouldn&#x27;t be dried out. My eyelashes are almost back to normal and longer than before now!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also when reading reviews for this product, many reviewers had mentioned that they saw this lash serum at the 99 Cent Only store so I went for myself and believe it or not they sell the exact same product that I am reviewing about right now! Each tube is 99 cents which is so much cheaper than what the sellers are selling online. Unfortunately, this chain store is only found in CA, NV, TX, and AZ. Hopefully if you are reading this and you live in those states you&#x27;ll be able to find this store and purchase this yourself instead of buying online.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Definitely recommend this product to anyone, especially for the price.</li>
            <li> Arrived quickly and as stated</li>
            <li> Loved it! Made my eyelashes longer</li>
            <li> I love this...I use to wear fake lashes but now that I am using this I have found that they are no longer needed. You will see growth in 2 weeks, it makes eyelashes fuller and thicker. I also use this to help grow out my eyebrows. Only thing is after I ordered this I found it at the dollar store -_- .... LoL</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t really tell a difference.</li>
            <li> I have been using it for one month, and I haven&#x27;t seen any new lashes or thicker ones, but I&#x27;m going to wear it for another month or a little longer and then I&#x27;ll write how I&#x27;m doing -</li>
            <li> came very quickly. I have been using the serum for about 2 weeks now and I actually see a difference in the length of my eyelashes! Will definitely continue to use this product.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product seeing all the great reviews but didnt expect much from it seeing how inexpensive it is.&lt;br /&gt;but it worked wonderfully. i used it for two full months, and applied it before my mascara everyday. by the end of one month itself i saw the results!! now my lashes are noticeably long and i get ton of compliments. surely ordering it again.&lt;br /&gt;but i would like to add it does not thicken or make your lashes dark .</li>
            <li> I was hoping this would do something to help my (practically non-existent) eyelashes to grow longer and thicker as the product claimed but it did nothing.</li>
            <li> this will break your face out  and the owner doesnt care they dont contact u dont order it everyone else is lying this doesnt work trust me</li>
            <li> NOT so much with this one!  Don&#x27;t waste the money.  I use generic latisse!  This does nothing at all.  Spend your money on something else.</li>
            <li> For the price, I guess that it is an eyelash conditioner. I put it on before mascara, let it dry and then apply mascara. It seems to enhance the look of the mascara. I&#x27;ll probably order more.</li>
            <li> I needed something to my lashes because I use mascara everyday, this serum is perfect for nights because is vitamins for my lashes.</li>
            <li> I bought 2 sets one for me and one for my daughter and tried it and  I saw some diffrence but my daughter ran out  and it was gone. She loves it.</li>
            <li> I had been on some migraine medication that was making my hair thin and fall out. once I stopped the medication and still had sparse lashes I ordered this product. I put it on after the shower in the morning and after I was my face at night, use it on my lashes and eyebrows. For the price it works great, I have tried other drugstore brands and never really noticed any results. With this my lashes look fuller and are definitely longer- I would say I noticed some growth and thickening within 6-8 weeks. I also like to use it to help hold the curl in my eyelashes before I apply mascara. I can tell a difference when I don&#x27;t apply it under my mascara. Overall it is a great product for a great price, and I will be ordering it again,</li>
            <li> I had high hopes for this product, especially after reading some reviews that compared the results to Latisse.  Unfortunately, I had no change whatsoever, and in addition it really irritated my eyes.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really work. My eyelash is getting longer everyday.&lt;br /&gt;Also good price, I don&#x27;t want to buy expensive eyelash serum.</li>
            <li> Not sure if it is my imagination, but I saw the lengthening within the first few days and I have now been using it for almost 3 weeks and they are looking fuller.</li>
            <li> i saw a big difference in my lashes length but the one thing i want to know is that if any one else had the problem of some of their lashes falling out more then usual?</li>
            <li> I have been using this for 3 weeks and have not noticed much of a change yet, other than I dont have any eyelashes falling out.  I use it at least once a day and on days I remember, twice. I will give it the full time however since I havent been using 2 x&#x27;s daily and I have read reviews that say it can take time.  I like it was shipped out fast, comes with 2 (I gave one to my neice) and it is so affordable.  I want this to work.  I will update this in another 3 weeks or so.  For the price, it is worth a try.  Oh, also I have pretty sensitive eyes, and wear contacts.  I put this on after I put in the contacts and there is no problem!  I like that.</li>
            <li> What is it made of? Are we sure that it&#x27;s not going to be causing a problem down the line?</li>
            <li> After two weeks of RELIGIOUS use I definatly noticed my lashes were longer! Not a huge amount, but definatly noticeable! For the price I was rather shocked. I will continue using it. And my lashes used to feel brittle, but now they are very soft. Very pleased :)</li>
            <li> Hi,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used this for 3 weeks and I didn&#x27;t see a difference in the growth of my eyelashes. I wasted money on this.</li>
            <li> I was so excited to receive my order.  I read all the reviews and I was convinced this will work on me.  its been over a month now, I can see some changes on my lashes.  I will keep applying until my eyelashes really shows the significant growth.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for about 3 &amp; 1/2 weeks now, and I think it&#x27;s actually working! I use it in the am right when i wake up, after I wash my face, &amp; again at night after washing my face. I just use the very tip of the brush &amp; dab it in between the lashes at the base of them, like where they&#x27;re growing out from, both on top &amp; bottom. I&#x27;ve noticed that I don&#x27;t really have any &amp;#34;loose&amp;#34; lashes anymore (ones that fall out), and I think they are in fact slightly longer than when I started using the product. I definitely notice an increase in length on my bottom lashes for sure. I&#x27;m gonna keep using it til I finish the bottle &amp; see if there&#x27;s a more significant change.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**its been about another week, and my friend made a comment to me: &amp;#34;do you have mascara on?&amp;#34; (I didn&#x27;t)&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#34;Your lashes are long!&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;So, it MUST be working!!👍🏼😁😆&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve also been using it on my eyebrows and I DEFINITELY notice a difference already. I think it&#x27;s pretty legit!</li>
            <li> I do not use mascara, and this acts like a clear one.</li>
            <li> Have been using this for about a month and now when I put my mascara on, my eyelashes show up. Before using this, my eyelashes were VERY short and now they really look long and lush. Love this product!</li>
            <li> It worked. My lashes are looking so Full. And at that price. WOW.  Just had to get in the habit to put it on. :)</li>
            <li> I found this product marginally helpful in restoring thinning eyebrows, but for eyelashes, not so much.  I used this continually for months and didn&#x27;t notice a difference in my eyelashes, but it did seem to slightly improve my brows.</li>
            <li> I have been using this as directed for a couple of weeks now and I can see a difference in the length of my lashes. The gel is lightweight and does not burn or irritate my very sensitive eyes. I can really tell a difference when I put on mascara. My lashes are longer because I only need one coat, as I used to use two. I can say that if you put this on before your makeup, it will cause your mascara to smudge. The price is very reasonable. I will continue to use and will also suggest this to others.</li>
            <li> I wanted to wait till I used for a while to write a review...disappointing in my case... it&#x27;s been like a month, not even the smallest change...I&#x27;ll keep using it to see it if will do something with longer time...I bought 4 of them because I read wonders, I guess it works for some...not for me...</li>
            <li> Used both bottles no difference in my lashes .Wouldn&#x27;t  recommend. total waste of my time and money. don&#x27;t waste your time</li>
            <li> Omg it actually works as well as my gf $100.00 stuff!. For fun we have tried many. She&#x27;s in the biz</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t really notice a difference.  At least it was cheap.</li>
            <li> Thick lashes will soon be yours! I also use it on my eyebrows and now they&#x27;re very conditioned. A great product for a better price compared to other types on the market.</li>
            <li> I have used this product off and on for about a year and within a few weeks of using it alwats notice more longer fuller lashes. It&#x27;s not a crazy transformation but it certainly works and fir the price I think it&#x27;s a great deal and recomend it.</li>
            <li> Two for the price of one. Awesome product!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only been using this for 2 weeks but I can tell you that it works.  I try to use it twice daily, first this in the morning and before retiring for bed.  What I&#x27;m seeing is length. My lashes are ok but this serum has given me more length.  I haven&#x27;t noticed any thickening not that that was what I was hoping to achieve and that may happen after more time, I&#x27;ll see. My only gripe, is that the applicator brush doesn&#x27;t allow for a good eyelash saturation you will need apply, using several repetitive strokes per section of eyelashes.  Btw, I&#x27;m buying more.</li>
            <li> It certainly doesn&#x27;t make your eyelashes magically grow, but it works as a good and cheap primer for masquera.</li>
            <li> Prior to trying this I was using Rapid ash which worked great.  Because of the price I decided to try this.&lt;br /&gt;Lost all the lashes I had gained from Rapid Lash and by the time you figure it out, it is too late to return.&lt;br /&gt;Scam product as far as I&#x27;m concerned.</li>
            <li> As a teen I was always accused of wearing false lashes when I wasn&#x27;t but as a mom in her late twenties my lashes thinned &amp; straightened &amp; being a natural blonde that doesn&#x27;t like to wear much makeup, I wanted my lashes to be noticeable again sans mascara so I read the reviews &amp; tried this. It didn&#x27;t burn/irritate at all &amp; the very next day my lashes had their natural curl back! Less than a week later my lashes are noticeably longer (not just noticable to me, but everyone started commenting) &amp; I don&#x27;t need to curl my lashes anymore! I highly recommend this product &amp; will use this stuff as long as it&#x27;s available &amp; affordable to me because even us poor folk deserve to look &amp; feel our very best! Seriously, I&#x27;d give this 10 stars if I could! :)</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t really tell...they &amp;#34;seem&amp;#34; longer but I&#x27;m not sure if I&#x27;m seeing what I want or if its actually true. Definitely no shedding though.</li>
            <li> it took over 2 -3 months before I see the results. It helps my eyelashes grow more but not much. I don&#x27;t see it help for longer lashes though.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical at first, but at the price it was worth a shot!  I had a lot of broken eyelashes, that made gaps and just made my eye lashes look weird.  The broken lashes filled in quickly, even my husband noticed (so that means it works, lol) and they seem to be much fuller, and slightly longer.  I will admit I only put it on a couple times a week, so I &#x27;m sure if I were to use it daily I would have even better results than I do!</li>
            <li> I had been looking at and pricing Latisse.  It was way too expensive for my wallet. I still wanted longer lashes.  I tried this Eye Lash Serum.  The price was very nice, I have been using it for 2 weeks, and I can noticeable see longer lashes.  Not fuller lashes, longer.  At my age (over 60) I wanted more than the stubby ones I had.  I now have longer lashes.  One coat of mascara and I am set.  Love this product and its price.  I will reorder soon.</li>
            <li> I bought 2 of these eye lash serums. It came in fairly quickly. I began using it immediately, and used it morning and night as directed. I also tried not to use make up as much as I could so the serum would have time to work. I saw results as soon as 5 days. I&#x27;ve used it probably 3 weeks now and have dramatically longer lashes. They are not thicker but there are more lashes and they are long. They even curl up at the outside edges. When i use mascara they are really really long. Best they have looked since high school. I&#x27;m ecstatic over this product and will continue to use it. The only negative was the 2nd bottle seemed to be alot less in it than the 1st tube. highly recommend this... actually have friends that have bought this since seeing my results!</li>
            <li> I got this for 2 reasons.&lt;br /&gt;First, I heard Latese (sp?) was put on someone&#x27;s head and their hair grew. So I thought maybe this would do the same and if it did I&#x27;d try my eyelashes.&lt;br /&gt;I saw no signs on my head so thought I&#x27;d try my lashes anyways and no signs. I haven&#x27;t had it for long, so maybe it takes longer for results, but so far no good.</li>
            <li> In combination with Rapid Lash, this products gives lashes more definition and adds a darker tint to enhance lashes even without mascara - definitely a steal for the price!!</li>
            <li> I had a HORRIBLE experience at a new salon which was offer brow shaping by using the &amp;#34;threading&amp;#34; process. I have had &amp;#34;threading&amp;#34; done at another location so I knew the process.  However, this salon took my lovely thick eyebrows (think of the actress Julianna Margulies&#x27;s eyebrows) down to thin, narrow Cruella DeVille eyebrows!!!  Imagine the shock when I looked into the mirror!!! THE HORROR, THE HORROR!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank goodness this product brought back my thick eyebrows and helped with lengthening my lashes.  On that note, the product did not thicken my lashes but mostly it did lengthen them. It helped a little with a few bare areas on my lower lashes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You do have to use this product EVERY DAY and you will probably have to use some sort of eyelash product to maintain the thickness and length forever.</li>
            <li> Love love love really works my eye lashes r long n thick, eyebrows r thicker!! Recommend will keep buyin awesome n gud price!!!!</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t attest for major growth in the length of my lashes, as I stopped using it after awhile. But it does work great at lengthening them as a clear mascara of sorts. It&#x27;s great if you don&#x27;t want to wear much makeup, but want your eyelashes to Stand out some.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t think it thickens, but I do like the fact that I&#x27;m moisturizing my lashes. Imagine everybody gets a different result</li>
            <li> This product is actually very nice. I&#x27;ve been using it for about 4 weeks, and I can already see some difference in my lashes. I&#x27;m not sure it added much length to my lashes, they weren&#x27;t short to begin with, but they definitely got thicker and have more curl to them. I gave the second tube to my mom, and she says her lashes got longer though.&lt;br /&gt;The gel smells pretty nice (it&#x27;s a very light scent), goes on smooth, and is great as a mascara primer- I didn&#x27;t have any smudging or flaking. My eyes felt a tiny bit funny the first couple of times I applied the gel, but that was gone really soon.&lt;br /&gt;I definitely recommend this product, especially given how little it costs. It might not give you some crazy result, and it takes time to see the difference, but it does work, and does make your lashes stronger and thicker.</li>
            <li> I have used this faithfully for 3 months and it seems that there are more lashes on the bottom left outer corner of my eye.  I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s my imagination because even my husband said he can tell the difference.  Highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t work for me.</li>
            <li> Yucky and gunky - did nothing for my eyelashes or eyebrows.  If you really want nice eyelashes and brows - just spend the money and buy some Careprost - it&#x27;s well worth it - the results are amazing.  This cheap stuff is a joke.</li>
            <li> Product arrived quickly and well packaged.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, my lashes look exactly the same as they did before I bought them.</li>
            <li> I Love this stuff!! You really have to follow directions once in the morning and evening but 2 months my lashes grew in so lovely beautifully!! The only thing is you can&#x27;t really wear mascara with this and I tried everything from drugstore to High end. But I&#x27;d still use it again! If you really want some flawless lashes bad than u gotta go awhile with no eye makeup!</li>
            <li> Just didn&#x27;t work with me comparing to another product I&#x27;ve used in the past. But it keeps your eyebrows and eyelashes healthier, reducing the number of eyelash falling out.</li>
            <li> LOVE THIS STUFF!  Took about 3 weeks for me to notice it was already working!  It&#x27;s super easy and works better than Revitalash or Latisse!  I can&#x27;t say enough good things.  Not to mention  it&#x27;s a FRACTION of the cost!!</li>
            <li> I have been using this item for about three weeks off and on and I am happy with the results. I can see my lashes getting thicker, it actually works!! Just think how much thicker my lashes would be if I used it twice a day as suggested on the manufacturers packaging? Hmmm...food for thought.</li>
            <li> This eyelash serum has worked to grow lashes on my friends and myself. You must use it every night before bed. The shipping was fast. This is always a plus too. Thank you so much!!!</li>
            <li> Smells like shampoo.  Not seeing any thickness but my lashes look longer.  I&#x27;m only using once a day so that may be why.</li>
            <li> I am a 65 year old woman - and my lashes were very thin. I used this product and had immediate results within a month!&lt;br /&gt;And now 6 months later - my lashes are full and lush - and I hardly have to use it anymore.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am ordering 6 orders for Christmas gifts for my female friends - what a great find &amp; so inexpensive!!!</li>
            <li> The price cant be beat on this product but so far I have seen no results. Nothing, zero, zilch. I applied it two or three times per day, every day. I applied it on naked lashes, skipping mascara all this time.&lt;br /&gt;Its easy to apply, using a simple mascara type wand.&lt;br /&gt;It didnt sting my eyes either but then again no pain no gain. I would not recommend this simply because I used it more than average and still saw no results.</li>
            <li> MY EYELASHES ARE LONG AND NICE BUT THIS PRODUCT ENHANCE THEM AND KEEP THEM SHINING, LONGER AND HYDRATED ALL DAY.</li>
            <li> As with everything, nothing works for every single person. I dont wear mascara everyday so I wasnt sure it was working. Well, I was going out to dinner one night and when I put on my mascara i actually said wow. My lashes where definitely longer. I was very pleased. Like I said I wasnt sure it was working until I put on mascara. ( I work as a vet tech so I only wear mascara on special occasions) Hey, for this price I was willing to try it and if it didnt work I wasnt really out anything. I did use it for about 6 weeks before I had mascara on and saw the difference. (I dont get out much. Lol) So give it a try. For this price you cant go wrong.</li>
            <li> forget this waste of $</li>
            <li> Do not waste your money. It doesnt work at all.</li>
            <li> I think it is too mild for my skin.</li>
            <li> Have only used one so far, but really like that it is clear serum and not milky like other brands.</li>
            <li> IVE NOTICED A BIG CHANGE IT DOES WORK,I DO  NOT EVEN WEAR MAKE-UP I TRIED IT JUST TO SEE IF IT WORKS ,BELIEVE ME IT DOES WORK ,I WILL ALWAYS CONTINUE ON BUYING IT AND IT IS WORTH THE PRICE THAT I HAD PAID,IF YOUR WANTING LONGER EYELASHES THIS IS THE WAY TO GO SO GIVE IT A TRY AND YOU WILL SEE A CHANGE I WILL RECOMAND IT TO ANYONE FOR APPEARANCE LOOKS</li>
            <li> I love this product! May sound so cliche but it actually works. Used it for about 2 weeks now and I can see a difference. Even my friends, too. :) Product came in early, which is an added bonus especially because I live in Hawaii where everything just takes longer to arrive.</li>
            <li> Before purchasing, inform yourself (google chemical names and read articles at consumer-protection sites) on chemicals used in ALL cosmetic products including shampoos and childrens&#x27; products; many are not tested and lot listed as unsafe by FDA due to technicalities in laws that may favor manufacturers but may not protect consumers, as New York Times article (link below) explains. Caveat emptor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;cosmeticsandtoiletries.com/regulatory/claims/120476614.html&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;NYT article: Think Those Chemicals Have Been Tested?&lt;br /&gt;nytimes.com/2013/04/14/sunday-review/think-those-chemicals-have-been-tested.html</li>
            <li> No effect at all after 2 months. I wanted it to work, but I wasn&#x27;t holding my breath.  I gave it a 2 because it IS a good primer, and not a bad price for a primer.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product every morning and night, I put it on before applying mascara which adds a little boost to the length. Its been four months of using and still no growth results. After purchasing this item on Amazon , I also found this exact same item at the 99¢ store.</li>
            <li> They came very fast and it works wonders my eyelashes are already so much longer than they were before I started using it</li>
            <li> I was skeptical for the cheap price that this would actually work on lengthening my lashes but after a few weeks of use i have noticed a difference. I wear eye glasses and have noticed that i must wear them a little lower on my nose than usual since i can feel my lashes now lightly brush across the lenses and it gets to be a bit annoying. So yup, it seems to work.  I Put on a coat every night after i take off my makeup right before bed. It&#x27;s not glumpy or clumpy, and it doesn&#x27;t smell like some serums do. I ordered a second package for my bff after i saw results, i will buy it again in the future when mine runs out.  Grab it in Go, fits in your pocket, your bra, and of course your purse.</li>
            <li> selectlash was very affordable and I have been using it for three weeks once a day and I can see new eyelash growth!  I think after about 1 - 2 months I will see a more dramatic difference!  Not irritating and you can&#x27;t beat the price!</li>
            <li> This product is pretty good, especially considering the price. I don&#x27;t really notice much of a growth on my lashes, but it does wonders for my mascara. I have decided that this product is used as mu eyelash primer and not so much as a growth stimulator. I would recommend this product to anyone not wanting to spend a fortune on the name brand lash primer.</li>
            <li> eyelashes grew thicker and 1/8 &amp;#34; longer after using for 1 month. Can&#x27;t go wrong for that price. Would buy it again</li>
            <li> Used this product consistently, but my eyelashes didn&#x27;t grow a bit. I&#x27;m just glad it was cheap. But still, if it doesn&#x27;t work, then I&#x27;ve spent too much!</li>
            <li> Apply every morning. This product does not exactly make eyelashes look longer, but they do look fuller. For the money, a very nice product.</li>
            <li> I do recommend it and the price makes it a true bargain. Give it 2 weeks and you will see stronger longer fuller lashes. I will buy this product again.</li>
            <li> Certainly not as good as rapid lash.  I really saw no difference after month of use...&lt;br /&gt;I will stick to Rapid lash as I know that works</li>
            <li> Easy to use and inexpensive. Would purchase again and recommend it to friends.  Cheaper than most products on the market.</li>
            <li> Hasn&#x27;t really done anything for me. My lashes are the same length and I&#x27;ve been using it pretty consistently for two months now. So far, it&#x27;s just a nice clear mascara.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t notice any effect .</li>
            <li> I have been using this for 6 weeks and I am actually seeing new eyelash growth!  I use it only at night, and my lashes aren&#x27;t much longer but I have started to notice that new ones are growing.  I expect that in a few weeks my lashes will be much thicker.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is getting a four star review because it is taking a bit longer than I expected for the product to work and I can&#x27;t wear it under mascara.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Definitely a great product, especially for the price.  Don&#x27;t waste your money on more expensive eyelash serums, this one works just as well, and I have used them all!</li>
            <li> its cheap its made a difference and for 99 cent for 2 bottles hey cant beat that.&lt;br /&gt;used it about 6 wks at least once a day lashes are longer wish it thickend them up or regrowth on bottoms were they are sparse but heck worth the money i&#x27;d say.</li>
            <li> I have been using select lash serum two times per day for about one month &amp; have seen no change.</li>
            <li> So I am Asian which means I wasn&#x27;t bored with ooh-la-la look at me lashes! Anyways, I came across this lash serum because I wanted to fill in the gaps I got for getting fake lashes glued to my lashes. I picked and plucked on the falsies which resulted in me nearly losing my lashes, but I am on my second bottle of this product and although I did not see any difference in thee length, I can confirm that my lashes have filled in gaps and volume. For a cheap price, I would continue to buy and use it.</li>
            <li> Did not work at all !</li>
            <li> So far I have only used it 2x/day for about 5 or 6 days, and what I notice is that my eyeslashes are not shedding as much when I wash my face. I bought it because I was losing a lot of eyelashes when removing my mascara and it was starting to show in terms of overall lash volume. My innermost top eyelashes and my lower eyelashes also seem to have grown a bit. So far, so good!</li>
            <li> Waste of money and time. Did not see any improvement.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t expect much from this product because I paid so little but I figured I would give it a shot. The product is outstanding. My lashes are wickedly long. Do use it daily morning and night. I also use it on my eyebrows and they have filled in. Love it.</li>
            <li> I normally have average lenght eyelashes, but I&#x27;m trying to become a model so I wanted them to be exceptional. When I saw this on amazon for such a low price, I decided to give it a try and see if it would actually work for me. I noticed results within a week, and now after using it for around two months they are starting to touch my eyebrows! This is really good deal, and the two bottles last a long time. (I&#x27;m still using my first one!)</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for a little while now, and I don&#x27;t think I have experienced any growth. It may work for some people, but it has not worked for me.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say this product isn&#x27;t good, because everyone is different. I have discovered another brand I like better, but due to the low price of this, I think at least trying it out would be worthwhile.</li>
            <li> Not sure if it works or not. i did not like it because it is gooey, so i did not use it consistently.</li>
            <li> I bought a bunch of these. I should of known they were too good to be true for the awesome price. I used up a whole bottle and I see no difference at all so I just gave the rest away. Hopefully it&#x27;ll work for them.</li>
            <li> Really does work took about a month but definitely  works!</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t been able to tell to much yet.  It goes on well and I will keep using it for results.</li>
            <li> I wanted to wait to write my review to see if this stuff works and it does. Everyone who wrote about it was right my eyelashes are much longer then what they were a few months ago. The price for it is amazing i have already bought more just so i can stock up. If ou want longer eyelashes this is the stuff..... it does not make them fuller but longer and if length is what your looking for buy this. It doesnt grow over night it took me 2 months before i saw the difference, but when i put my regular mascara on i saw a huge difference.</li>
            <li> I love this product.  I use it daily and my eyelashes are beginning to grow, finally.  Don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s age-related, but I began losing my eyelashes about two years or so ago. I couldn&#x27;t even use a lash curler to help the lash appearance.  My eyelashes were so sparse that even with mascara, you could barely see them.  I decided to try this serum to see if it would help the lashes growth.  I&#x27;ve been using in for over a month and I can visibly see the changes in the amount of lashes I have.  So happy something is finally working for me.  I can use an eyelash curler and mascara now.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for about 3-4 weeks now and have not noticed any effects yet, I&#x27;ll keep trying it. I do prefer the types with a slim paint brush type applicator that instructs you to apply it to the roots of your lashes; this brand comes with a mascara bristle type brush for application directly on the lashes.</li>
            <li> Used religiously twice a day for 4 weeks and there is no difference lashes.  Fortunately I didn&#x27;t spend a lot of money</li>
            <li> I was very adamant about using this product as directed and allowing it ample time to work before writing a review.  That said, I am on my 5th week of use (twice a day) on both my eyelashes as well as an area of my eyebrow that has no hair.  I see ZERO improvement on my eyebrow.  As for my lashes - there is no obvious visible difference; however, since I began use, I have been inspecting them as never before and there may be a TEENY bit of improvement.  Again this is only after scrutinizing them with a magnifying mirror (and maybe applying a bit of wishful thinking?)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really wanted this to work wonders since it is so affordable, unfortunately it doesn&#x27;t seem to work on me as well has it has on other reviewers.</li>
            <li> I only used this product for about three weeks, about every other day. I left it on overnight as it stated and in only a few uses, I saw results. My lashes grew so much I actually had to stop using it. I know every product is different for everyone but this one really worked for me. Maybe extra fuel was that the hair and stuff on my body grows very fast anyway. For the review and price listed, I figured this was worth a try and I&#x27;m glad I did it.</li>
            <li> I used this product only on ONE eye for 6 weeks and there was no change in the thickness or length or condition of my lashes.  I am glad that other people have had success with this product, but I sadly was not one of them.</li>
            <li> I really wanted this eyelash serum to work----the price was great and shipping was fast.  I gave it a fair trial of one and a half bottles and I don&#x27;t truly see any difference in my lashes.  They look a tad longer after just applying it, but if I wash my face, the effect is gone.....so it&#x27;s more like a cosmetic than something that really affects the growth of lashes.  You&#x27;d probably be better off with clear mascara.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff! I just ordered two more bottles. I used it twice a day; it keeps my eyelashes from clumping and works as a perfect mascara primer, preventing smudging in the end of the day. It does make my lashes look longer and better conditioned. It is a great product for the price. I used it in the morning and night. Try it for yourself!</li>
            <li> great product works good my eyelashes are more noticible it also last a long time and is very cheap product</li>
            <li> I just got this product-been using it twice a day for a about a week and a half now and have already seen a difference in my lashes. I wear makeup once a week when I go out to unwind from work and school; last night when I put on my mascara my lashes looked so long and beautiful-the best I&#x27;ve seen in awhile. Don&#x27;t expect significant fullness-what I&#x27;ve seen is a growth in length not fullness so far.</li>
            <li> Trust me this works!!!!!!! love it! Dont waste your money on the expensive stuff! This stuff totally works! Used it for 1 week and right away I noticed length and fullness to my eyelashes!</li>
            <li> After using the Eye Lash Serumt, this product did not lengthen my lashes and could not tell that it helped them at all.</li>
            <li> eyelash its not growing faster or take few week little slow grow. I am looking for strong grow fast as.</li>
            <li> I like to put this on my lashes just as a conditioner. I don&#x27;t think they make them much longer, but they look longer right after you put it on. It&#x27;s very good to put this on and then put on your mascara. The formula is nice and it makes my lashes very soft. I personally do not think they made my lashes much longer outside of the short run, though.</li>
            <li> Today is the 18th, got this product on the 15th, quarter of a tube already gone, but my eyelashes are nicely lubricated which I am doing 4 times daily.  I can finally see my eyelashes look fuller, longer and healthier.  Thank you seller!</li>
            <li> This did absolutely NOTHING for my lashes. Did not help them grow, didn&#x27;t help with lash loss. Total waste of money.</li>
            <li> I have been using this for almost a month and am halfway through my first tube. I use it twice a day. I am noticing my eyelashes are thicker. I don&#x27;t see anything in the length but they are pretty long already. I love that they are thicker!</li>
            <li> I thought I would give this product a try. My lashes  have gotten a lot longer.&lt;br /&gt;I wish it would thicken but for the price I will take what I can get.</li>
            <li> I thought the price for this product was cheap so i bought and tried it. It doesn&#x27;t seem to work at all after using it for 2 months.my Eyes gets sting feeling when i use it and the brush was too harsh.</li>
            <li> I love it!  I am seeing results already!  I knew I would and I absolutely love it.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you!&lt;br /&gt;Connie</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for 2 weeks. I can&#x27;t believe something at this price actually works. My lashes are longer, but like everyone else mentioned, not much thicker. Which is disappointing since I wanted it more for the thickness than the length, but I guess I&#x27;ll see after a month how it looks. BUT there is a result, and nowhere can you get such a product for a price like this!</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t do much for me.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical when I saw this and to be honest it was an impulse buy. I&#x27;m so glad I purchased this!!! I only use it once a day (instructions say to use twice), but after about a month of consistent use I can really tell my lashes are much longer. I would have never expected this, especially not from such a cheap product. Needless to say I am extremely pleased I purchased this and will definitely repurchase once I use mine up!</li>
            <li> Bought this for me and my dtr and we used it faithfully morning and night, no mascara for 30 days, no change!  The gel is plentiful and makes your lashes thick initially, but it dries and then no difference.  I really wanted this to work, it&#x27;s cheap enough that any woman can buy it to try to grow long lashes, but it didn&#x27;t work for us, although other more pricey lash growth serums like Latisse did work, but too pricey and didn&#x27;t like side effects of dark circles under eyes.</li>
            <li> There is no color.  It&#x27;s a serum for healthier lashes.  Not sure how well it actually works though.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s okay - I suppose it nourishes the eyelashes somewhat but have seen no difference in length - I should have read more carefully - so next time I purchase a like product I will look much more closely at it.  OK for the price I suppose.</li>
            <li> i bought the product because of too many positive reviews,it was cheap so i thought id give it a try,I used the product for i believe four months, day and night,then I stopped,i was thinking I was just wasting my time, i&#x27;ve never seen any changes. at all. It may work for some people but it didn&#x27;t work for me.</li>
            <li> Because I really like this product and because I believe it works so well, I decided to upload 2 pics - one being my eyebrows back when they were much thinner before I started using this product, and 5 months later. Remember, growing your eyebrows out and filling them in naturally WILL TAKE TIME - but this product DOES work wonderfully and absolutely speeds up the process, and helps fill in your brows where you thought you couldn&#x27;t grow hair! And if anyone has questions, send me a message!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think I wrote a review a while back on this product when I had just started to use it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve wasted my money in the past on expensive products that don&#x27;t deliver.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have naturally full eyebrows but a little after high school I had plucked them a little too much. I decided to start growing them back (only plucking outside of my natural brow), brushing them out daily to stimulate growth, and then I landed on this product. As cheap as it is, I&#x27;m surprised how well it works. I don&#x27;t use anything else now. I use this product to help stimulate growth - it does what it claims to do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This eyelash serum will not only thicken your lashes/eyebrows (I use it for my eyebrows), but it will help grow hair where you used to have it, if you&#x27;ve ever overplucked your brows in the past.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I get compliments on my eyebrows all the time now - they&#x27;re back to being FULL and flattering, shaping my face in just the right way. It will take a little time to grow your eyebrows back out, but you should notice a difference by using this product within the FIRST 2 WEEKS. So, order it and get excited! Seeing a difference will most likely make you want to continue using it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Try to apply every night after washing your face/moisturizing it (or whatever your night time routine is). It will dry quickly - sleep with it on, and if you ever have a day where you&#x27;re just at home, put it on then too! But once a day is just fine.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for a little over a month and it has made my lashes a little longer but not thicker.</li>
            <li> awesome product- thank you</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad I didn&#x27;t pay much for these, think it was just a couple of bucks and I&#x27;m glad about that.  It doesn&#x27;t work, so don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> Just starting using it, it feels nice on the lashes!  I will have to give it a couple of days to review it!</li>
            <li> I have to say that I absolutely loved it my eyelashes grew and now I can curl them it really makes a difference in your appearance.  I highly recommend it</li>
            <li> This stuff works, I promise. I had short eyelashes and by applying the product multiple times a day, I could see results in 2 weeks.. it made new eyelashes grow and old ones become longer, but did not make it thicker. I made coconut oil + EVOO and put it in one of the mascara containers after I used it all up make it thicker. It&#x27;s really worth only spending about 5 dollars on this guys!</li>
            <li> Love this stuff a the price is right it works!!!!</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure what to expect. I&#x27;d used Latisse before but I felt the cost excessive albeit the results were great. I purchased this 2 pack in April 2013. I returned from a 2 week vacation &amp; took a closer look &amp; noticed my eyelashes weren&#x27;t looking so good so I decided to tear this package open to put it to good use. Quite honestly, I didn&#x27;t expect much. I&#x27;m feeling pleased to report after a short period of once/day use I&#x27;m noticing a difference in both length &amp; fullness. I&#x27;ve not chosen to use it during the day under my mascara because I feared it would smudge &amp; I wear contacts. One other very notable difference for myself anyway, is I don&#x27;t have irritation like I did with Latisse. My eyes were always red &amp; I didn&#x27;t care for that too much. They also burned somewhat using Latisse. I don&#x27;t experience any of that using this product. Overall given the price &amp; now the results I&#x27;m already noticing after 10 days of use, I&#x27;m feeling perhaps I should stock up. Everyone&#x27;s experience is different but for me, this works &amp; the bonus is the price!</li>
            <li> This did nothing for my eyelashes. Really nothing.&lt;br /&gt;Good thing was that when it ran out, I used the brush to comb my eye brows.&lt;br /&gt;Works great, lol.</li>
            <li> hey, i received the delivery very quickly but the product doesn&#x27;t work.. I&#x27;m glad didn&#x27;t spend too much..so, i call it as lesson learned but not costly.. overall 2 thumbs down..not a keeper..</li>
            <li> Iv&#x27;e been using the serum for about a month now and I see a bit of a difference nothing dramatic. But we&#x27;ll see maybe next month it will be more of a difference</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t usually write reviews  on Amazon (although I rely so much on reviews when I&#x27;m buying a product)..I felt obliged to write a review about this product because it actually, 100% works! I&#x27;ve been using this product for two weeks twice a day as instructed..and it has really made my eyelashes look longer. I agree with other buyers that this product won&#x27;t make your eyelashes fuller or look thicker. Out of curiosity, I applied mascara to one eyelash and I could really the difference! I would strongly recommend this product!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And don&#x27;t forget the price as well..it&#x27;s as cheap as it can be..worth a try!</li>
            <li> Previously I tried Rapid Lash and saw some good reviews for this much less expensive product. I think I see a difference, but I&#x27;ve not been using it long. I like that it has a mascara type tube and brush rather than eyeliner-type brush of the Rapid Lash. It feels like I&#x27;m really getting it on my lashes.</li>
            <li> I WANT TO UNDERSTAND WHY TILL NOW NO ONE HAVE DELIVERED IT TO ME?&lt;br /&gt;WHEN I NEED TO PAY FOR ALL THE FEE I HAVE ALREADY DID IN YOUR WEBSITE, SO WHY DOES THE PEOPLE NOT GETTING THEIR JOB DONE? I AM WORKING ALL DAY AND HAVE NO TIME TO GET BACK TO YOU, ALWAYS FORGET, BUT IT DOESN&#x27;T MEAN I FORGET OR I DON&#x27;T CARE ABOUT MONEY I SPENT. I WILL SIMPLY STOP SHOPPING ON YOUR WEB.</li>
            <li> Great price. I was a little leary about this product, but i found it to really work. I would recomment.</li>
            <li> The product is chip ,and help a little be , don&#x27;t grow a lot but help a see difference in 3 weeks.</li>
            <li> Absolutely love this product! I don&#x27;t even use it often and I can see a huge difference! It makes me so happy to see my eyelashes like this! 💕</li>
            <li> I had lash extensions done &amp; they were beautiful but after a wk they were poking &amp; driving me nuts so... I pulled them off &amp; if youve had extensions you know by pulling them out you pull natural lashes out. So I had totally bald spots, most awful ever!! I searched for lash serum in panic. I came across this product here &amp; all the reviews &amp; thought I remember seeing it somewhere before. Duh- under my bathroom sink. I had used this before for a yr on &amp; off. Its been 2 months since I got bald holes in my lashes-- not anymore. I use select lash daily &amp; castor oil too &amp; I have new growth, thicker lashes. Back to normal lashes. I purchased mine elsewhere but it&#x27;s a great product!! Give it time &amp; look for new growth &amp; density.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used this for the full 30 days yet, so I don&#x27;t know if it works to make my lashes look longer but it doesn&#x27;t bother my eyes at all, which almost every mascara does. So I am definitely impressed with this thus far!</li>
            <li> I was shocked, utterly shocked that something so inexpensive could work!!! This works. I have been applying this for about 1 month, 2 times a day and I am amazed. My lashes are fuller, thicker, darker, and longer. It really works great under mascara, it is better than my mascara primer. It makes my lashes really thick and full now. I am so pleased and happy with this. It costs little and works well. I have tried other products in various prices, and gotten moderate results that took much longer. But this product is great, it works fast, and there are no side effects; no brittle lashes, no dry lashes...no side effects at all. I am using this on my brows as well and am happy. I will be buying this again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you want thicker, longer, fuller, more voluminous lashes just give this a try!!</li>
            <li> Ok.... i read lots of mixed reviews on this product... So I did a little test of my own. I used this product for 2 weeks.... twice a day. I could FOR SURE tell a difference! Just to be able to write this in this review, I stopped using the product. My lashes went back to being &amp;#34;lazy&amp;#34; ..... My lashes were just dull! But when you apply this stuff.... as directed, your eyelashes are FULL. I did not noticing any curling tho. But I use an eyelash curler anyway. As far as burning goes, I only felt the burning if I accidently got this stuff IN my eye.... which I did a couple of times while putting on my bottom lashes! I will be buying this product again! Hope this helps!</li>
            <li> My eyelashes had grown very short and scarce as I aged (I&#x27;m in my early forties). The Select Lash Eyelash Serum does work. I noticed results within a couple of days, my eyelashes were getting visible thicker. I highly recommend this product, I plan to keep on using it for the longest time, as a maintenance strategy. The price is unbeateable, and the deliverery quite quite.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff! I am on my second order....I never thought something that would be so cheap would work so well!</li>
            <li> I will admit I was a bit sceptic at first about the product.  However, I have had it for quite some time now and it really does work!  I did not use it daily as directed; I would forget.  We all have our schedules, agendas and our to do lists jammed packed, trying to keep up with the fast paced world we live in and to be honest, eyelash serum is not at the top of the list.  Regardless, it really does work.  Thank you!</li>
            <li> I did not purchase this on amazon but I did buy 4  of them (same exact kind/brand) on eBay. It worked for me. I swear I noticed a difference after the first day!! Its obvious that after one day it didn&#x27;t make them grow but when I put my mascara on the next day it went on so amazing that they appeared longer. After about a week of use night n day they were definitely longer, not thicker but yes they were longer. I am not upset they weren&#x27;t thicker BC hey I can just use mascara for that. I gave my aunt n sister a bottle n it worked for them as well. I am going to purchase more and give my mom a bottle BC she SD her lashes r non existent so I guess that will b the real test. I will update when she gives me her feed back. I was kinda sad to read that it didn&#x27;t work for some people BC I had such great results and so did my fam. so maybe it is just different for everyone. I say its worth a try to c if it works for u BC its so cheap! Idk all I can say I&#x27;d it worked great for me and I have a good mascara day everyday!</li>
            <li> I have generously used this product twice a day for a month on lashes &amp; eyebrows.  I can tell absolutely no difference.  I don&#x27;t wear mascara so my lashes are not abused.  I just wish my lashes &amp; brows were fuller.  Great if it works for others as it&#x27;s reasonably priced.</li>
            <li> it is very inexpensive. it has castor oil in it. for me it&#x27;s just a conditioner for lashes that I use after mascara comes off or during weekend when don&#x27;t use any.  but it did /does not make them grow.  it&#x27;s just make them healthy</li>
            <li> Seems to work for me. I have longer lashes than I have ever had. Itu has a great price to match, you can&#x27;t find a better deal.</li>
            <li> Great product, got it referred from A friend and have only been using it for a few days but only time will tell.</li>
            <li> Have not yet found one that actually brings any results. I take Biotin everyday instead. Working well.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t do a thing. Just clear mascara....</li>
            <li> i was very upset that it did not work AT ALLL on my lashes. but i would still give it a try because it was reallllly inexpensive. it might work for you.</li>
            <li> worth it, the effects are slow but it does work, using it for 3 months and im seeing a diff.</li>
            <li> I HAVE NOT SEEN ANY DIFFERENCE IN THREE WEEKS AFTER MORNING AND NIGHT USE. WOULDNT BUY THIS AGAIN. WASTE OF MONEY</li>
            <li> I read from previous reviews you get what you pay for. Understatement! It does nothing! Nada! It is mainly made up of alcohol, conditioning? I think not! The product burns. Honestly don&#x27;t know how they got it on the market. It comes with 2 tubes, the other one was not even opened &amp; I had thrown it away.</li>
            <li> I ordered this about 20 days ago, and started using it \\&quot;as directed\\&quot; on April 1. It is now April 19, and my lashes are noticeably longer. They are not getting thicker yet, but if I keep using this product, I have a feeling they will become thicker as well. My theory is that if one claim is true, then the other will come in time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, I also apply the Select Lash more like inner rim eyeliner, with the tip of the brush, than like in typical mascara application. I only use the regular mascara brush approach for the ends of my lashes. Because my natural lashes were barely long enough to \\&quot;brush\\&quot; when I started using Select Lash, the application process I used was required. Even though I can use the brush now, I&#x27;ll stick to my method because it&#x27;s obviously working.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Personally, I haven&#x27;t experienced any skin darkening (bummer, I&#x27;d like to skip using eyeliner LOL) or sting/burn.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The price is well worth the fact that the product actually works. I was very skeptical, and I am now a believer. I hope this particular product will remain on the market for a very long time to come.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: November 2, 2013.&lt;br /&gt;So I&#x27;ve been using this since April 2013 (just ordered three more bottles a month or so ago) and I have to say that now my lashes are getting thicker, as well as retaining the length increase I originally got. I don&#x27;t even know how to explain this, but it&#x27;s like I have more individual lashes growing in now. And even if I skip a day or two, or apply only once a day instead of two times, they are still growing and filling out. This is a great product and even though I know I&#x27;ll have to basically use it for life to maintain the lash growth, at this price it&#x27;s entirely worth it.</li>
            <li> I have used the eyelash serum daily since I received it, and while I see a difference in the mornings when I put mascara on after applying it, I&#x27;ve not seen any change in my lashes before mascara.</li>
            <li> I have short, straight, Asian eyelashes, and I was looking for an affordable alternative to those 50-70$ eyelash serums. I purchased the 2-pack eye serum (totaling 5$, including shipping) which was a steal! The product did not work for me though. I&#x27;ve been using it for over 2 weeks now, and I do not see a difference. Not even the slightest bit difference. I religiously applied it once in the morning and once before I go to bed and nothing! I didn&#x27;t even use mascara in case the product would work better on its own, but that didn&#x27;t make a difference. Also, out of curiosity, I applied it to my thin eyebrows to see if it would do anything, and it didn&#x27;t.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product doesn&#x27;t cost much so it&#x27;s not like I wasted money, really. I did waste time though. Now, I have to purchase a different serum and wait weeks for results that Select Lash couldn&#x27;t deliver.</li>
            <li> haha didnt work too well for me but it might for you so id give it a try&lt;br /&gt;maybe it i use it longer though</li>
            <li> This stuff works &amp; helps your eyelashes grow in length. The value for the price is incredible. So cheap for such a good product.</li>
            <li> Love love love this stuff! It really works. I seen results sooner then I expected. My lower lashes were almost non existing. After just using this for about 2 weeks, I really noticed a difference. This is must have. It&#x27;s affordable and it works!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this serum for 1 year now and won&#x27;t go a day without using it. My eyelashes shed regularly so it&#x27;s great to have an inexpensive product that I can use. I wish it grew in hair where there wasn&#x27;t any but that&#x27;s not how it works. It only works on lengthening existing ones&#x27;.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t believe this stuff work! I&#x27;ve been using ut daily and have been seeing results. It doesn&#x27;t make your lashes thicker but it does make your lashes longer and stand out.</li>
            <li> I love tis product. My eyelashes have always been long but not very thick. I saw results in about a week and am still using it, but I only apply it a couple times a week now. You should use it morning and night until desired results are met. M. Monroe</li>
            <li> I love this stuff! I try to use it twice a day but I always use it in the morning! People have complimented me multiple times and even asked if I had eyelash extentions.</li>
            <li> this serum have really made my eyelashes longer and thicker I love this product</li>
            <li> Good product. Ordered the second time</li>
            <li> pretty quick..using now.</li>
            <li> This product doesn&#x27;t work.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s pretty lame.Pay money for something good &amp; don&#x27;t waste your time here with team short lashes.</li>
            <li> Love love love!!! on my eyelashes: I noticed a few new llashes and my old ones are much longer and prettier. On my eyebrows, my eyebrows have never been thicker! I have naturally thin brows and this is helping me grow them back after YEARS of trying!</li>
            <li> O-K, I literally have tried it all, from Latisse, lash md, etc. I tried this product after reading the reviews and figured at the price what could I loose. OMG this stuff actually works and works well. After one week I saw more results than 4 months of latisse. I love it so much I purchased it for my daughters and they too are amazed. If you&#x27;re on the fence to buy this, take my word, GET it, it&#x27;s great and so easy to use. I use less mascara every day, and when I take off my make-up I&#x27;m amazed I have pretty eyelashes.</li>
            <li> lengthening now after 4 weeks but no thickness improvement.</li>
            <li> For price paid, this is an excellent item. I can see a difference in length but not thickness. I am still using the first tube. (Will post more in about a month)</li>
            <li> This got really good reviews which is why I bought it, especially for the price but I didn&#x27;t see any difference in my lashes at all</li>
            <li> i bought this for my aunt. She loves it.... she asked me to buy like 20 of those for her... so i did...</li>
            <li> its does work alittle but the price is wrong I can buy this for a dollar. And that&#x27;s what price it should be for the way it works</li>
            <li> does not work in any way shape or form. Sorry I was hoping it would.</li>
            <li> Not sure if tis working...</li>
            <li> For the price on this I was really skeptical to see if this would work or not. I have normal lashes that I consider short and not that thick. I used this literally once a day for a week while applying my makeup and my lashed were fuller and longer. I usually don&#x27;t believe some reviews that I read on Amazon, but take it from a new mom who just wants to get her sass back, it works!</li>
            <li> Slightly longer eyelashes, waiting for it to ACTUALLY work. Im gonna start using it religiously. It makes me tear up alot, i guess thats irritation, but it doesnt exactly hurt. Just makes me tear alot. I think its okay</li>
            <li> This stuff is a joke!  Nothing but a conditioner at best...do not even think it has done that.  Oh well...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m gonna say it works, cause my lashes definitely look better.  Longer, less fall out and breakage.  But for actual growth and filling in, I think I prefer Rapid Lash.  It&#x27;s a little more expensive than this, but there&#x27;s no doubt when you&#x27;re using it that you&#x27;re getting new growth.  While the Select Lash is a great conditioner, I can definitely continue to see areas that have not filled in.  I love Rapid Lash, but if you don&#x27;t need actual new growth, Select Lash is a great, super economical alternative.</li>
            <li> My sister pays one hundred dollars a bottle. We dont have long lashes as some people do. I have tried this and I have NEW eyelashes growing out from the base of my eyelids!! Even OTHER PEOPLE NOTICED! ! I am quite amazed, actually.  Now I do not have to have \\&quot;spider eyes\\&quot; playing with my mascara.  This item I&#x27;d GOOD! trust me.</li>
            <li> I have SLE, I was hoping that this Eyelash Serum would provide me adequate lashes, which I have a shortage of...It just did not work.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t seen much of a change as far as growth but I think my lashes are not as brittle an the scent is really nice.</li>
            <li> my lashes didnt grow at all</li>
            <li> My lashes seem thicker, but not much longer. The seem more full when I apply mascara then before using the product. It did itch/tingle slightly, but then I&#x27;m allergic to everything.</li>
            <li> I was in the market for a lash enhancing product and came across the Select Lash Eyelash Serum. I was skeptical of such an inexpensive product, but it had enough positive reviews to make me buy it (I mean for less than $5 you get 2 tubes, so what did I have to lose?)... My purchase was made on March 1, 2013. (Side note: I received my order in record time, 2 days later from this seller!!) I use the serum once daily on my eyelashes and eyebrows. Today, 5 weeks later, my lashes are looking gorgeous and the \\&quot;bald spots\\&quot; in my eyebrows have filled in. Both my lashes and brows are fuller, thicker, longer and healthier. This is an AMAZING PRODUCT. I just ordered my second set today! :) Worth noting: I have extremely sensitive eyes and skin and severe allergies; Select Lash has caused me zero irritations.... TRY IT and you&#x27;ll be glad you did! :) :)</li>
            <li> So no miracle product here but it is doing something because my brows. Are filling in  where they had previously been. Kinda sparse.  As for the eyelashes... Truthfully. Their pretty full already but I want more :) so I use the serum every day as a primer. They don&#x27;t seem  longer yet but I&#x27;ll post pictures to compare when the bottle runs out . For four bucks. It was worth it.</li>
            <li> It is another tool in my beauty tool chest it protects and conditions my lashes as I apply my mascara.</li>
            <li> I have only been using product for about a week but have noticed a difference.  Serum seems to be helping them regain their health.  I bought this product because my eyelashes had recently looked shorter.  As if something was breaking them off.  I don&#x27;t know if it was allergies (pollen has been really bad and I had been doing alot of yard work) or if it was my daughter&#x27;s mascara that I had used a occassionally.  Anyhow, after applying serum in morning and at night for a few nights my eyelashes regained their length.  To me, the serum appears to be good for eyelashes.  Maybe a good conditioner - don&#x27;t know exactly what it does but it does appear to be good for eyelashes.  Good value for the price.</li>
            <li> This was definitely a steal.  I bought RapidLash on amazon a month before I started using this brand.  RapidLash definitely gave me a head start on growing my eyelashes but I would say this was the cherry on top.  Select Lash seemed to make my eyelashes grow long and full whereas RapidLash only made them grow long.  I would definitely recommend this product for quick and healthy looking results.  It&#x27;s not totally amazing and will work miracles, but does help grow your eyelashes.  Considering the price, this was a good deal.</li>
            <li> just been using for 2 weeks now, very cheap price i think it does something for my eyelashes i think they look alittle longer. will buy some more :)</li>
            <li> So I read all the great reviews and was like yay it will work! Then I&#x27;ve been using it for months and it still isn&#x27;t doing anything to my lashes!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> AMAZING!! Love this so much, looks natural, lashes are so much fuller, looks much better than regular mascara.</li>
            <li> Have noticed a slight increase in lash volume.</li>
            <li> Good product I do see some new growth</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this twice a day for a month and see no difference. Save your money and try something else.</li>
            <li> It actually works! I got it because I really needed something to help my lashes grow and seeing this was a reasonable price, I bought it. My eyelashes were so short to a point I had to put on three coats or more of mascara. Now I mst say my lashes are growing, much more noticeable and I am absolutely pleased with the product!</li>
            <li> I have used this product every night for a month.  I think it is good to keep your lashes moisturized and to help eliminate breakage from them being dry, but honestly I dont notice a difference in length or volume, maybe a little in length I guess because they dont break and are healthier.  I would buy this product if you want to see if this will help with moisturizing them but not for trying to grow them longer or thicker.</li>
            <li> After using both bottles i have seen a visible difference. My lashes aren&#x27;t SUPER long but ppl around me have noticed a difference as well.</li>
            <li> This product helped some but not like I wanted it to. It seemed to make my lashes a little bit longer, but did nothing for the thickness. I used it for 3 months every single day as directed. You also have to apply it twice a day instead of once a day like the Ardel, which I LOVE. It did seem to condition my lashes but it just didn&#x27;t make them thicker and only made them a little longer. If you are only looking for a lash conditioner, this will work just fine. I think it&#x27;s just good for your lashes. Maybe you could use it after you apply Latisse and let it dry (I wish I could afford Latisse because it works AMAZINGLY) as a conditioner at night. I would recommend it for that.</li>
            <li> I have only been using this product for about a week but so far a see an improvement in the length of my lashes. You can&#x27;t beat the price and will definitely order this again as I gave one to my daughter.</li>
            <li> So for a buck I thought, why not? If it does not work oh well. Let me just say that this works, and works fast! I know that castor oil is supposed to be good at making lashes grow, but I have never had success at using just plain castor oil alone. After 2 weeks of consistent use, twice a day, my bare lashes now look like I have on mascara. And when I do apply mascara they look fake! Have not experienced any thickening, but the change in length is great. My eyebrows are filling in nicely as well. No irritation with my contacts either. Will be repurchasing.</li>
            <li> I give this product 4 stars because it is very in-expensive and it works with my mascara nicely. My eyelashes do look thicker and fuller after I apply this serum and let it dry. But I don&#x27;t think it actually grew my eyelashes so far. I have used it for only  2 weeks. I will continue for one month to see if it will make any difference.</li>
            <li> I am 22 years old, with Japanese blood and have those short, thin, straight downward type of lashes.&lt;br /&gt;I got this two weeks after purchasing it. I LOVE IT! I was a critic at first, but I was like its less than $3, I have tried&lt;br /&gt;everything else, why not this?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My lashes are longer, thicker and it has only been a week. After using this, I stopped clumping up my mascara and&lt;br /&gt;just used this. It makes your lashes shiny, lite, and cleaner than a mascara. My husband loves it! I do too :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would highly suggest it. I expected one, but it comes as it is in the picture! Two for the price of one! I am ordering more as soon as I am done with the first! RECOMMENDED!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Happy Lashes Ladies!</li>
            <li> It made my lashes grow a little longer and thicker.  It worked pretty well.</li>
            <li> I ordered this product after reading the reviews on Amazon. I have super sensitive eyes and did not want to spend a lot of money on a product that would make my eyes worst. To my surprise this product is very gentle and it works.&lt;br /&gt;I use it on my eyebrows and sometimes on my lashes. You will not see an immediate result but after several months you will! The product arrived super fast and as described. This is my second order from this seller and I am very happy.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve started using this product.  I haven&#x27;t noticed any appreciable difference as yet; bu, I&#x27;ll continue. Hope this one works.</li>
            <li> Been using faithfully since purchased.  I notice no difference so far.  I also use it as a primer for my mascara.  It seems to make my mascara stay put all day.  For the price I paid, not to concerned.</li>
            <li> Loved this product in combination with another eyelash growth my lashes are growing back after removing my lash extensions. Recommending to friends.</li>
            <li> I tried this eyelash serum so my eyelashes could grow and it really worked. My eyelashes got longer, they did not get that fuller but they grew</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried several grow lash  products over the last couple of years; I feel I&#x27;ve overpaid for this one; specially after seeing it at the 99c store! I&#x27;ve been using this conditioner for the last 3 weeks and have not noticed any growth or thickening yet. In fact I&#x27;d go as far as to say; I&#x27;ve noticed a decrease in length since I began using this. Since I had been using something else that seemed to work better, but then I ran out and figured I&#x27;d try this brand. If it works for you; great! You can go and load up on it for peanuts. But if you really want longer and thicker lashes I&#x27;d recommend something with better ingredients and a proven record. This is just a conditioner nothing more.The only positive I can think of sharing is that this brand won&#x27;t burn or itch your eyes and probably wont grow hair around your eyes and in the corners like Latisse;; which left me with an &amp;#34;under-brow&amp;#34;; fine hair growing where they shouldn&#x27;t. like in the corner of your eyes and right on the edge of the cheek bone, which looks either like dirt or like a shadow, not an attractive look.</li>
            <li> I give this a 5 star rating because my mother,niece and I use this everyday. My nieces eyelashes are growing so long that you&#x27;d think she has the most dutifully fake eyelashes!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only been using for a week an a half. Not religiously like I should , but I&#x27;m noticing some more lashes growing in or growing back already.</li>
            <li> THIS SERUM REALLY DOES WORK!!! I USE IT ALL THE TIME SINCE MY EYELASHES BECAME THIN AFTER HAVING MY SON!! IT WORKS ON EYEBROWS TOO!! CANT GO WRONG!!</li>
            <li> It made my eye lashes grow a good amount but used more than recommended</li>
            <li> I bought this stuff hoping for a miracle. I guess my hopes were too high.  I can&#x27;t really tell if my lashes have grown or not.</li>
            <li> Another product that I tried that doesn&#x27;t work. I can&#x27;t understand how some people review a product that doesn&#x27;t really work. More money down the drain.</li>
            <li> I give this item a 5 star not because my eyelashes have grown, (havent seen that) but because my eyelashes do look thicker and and fuller. i know that when i apply this i let it dry then i apply my mascara and my eyelashes do look longer. but i use to wear l&#x27;oreal lash serum and i think i like it better . would i buy this product again maybe. but then i again i have only used this item for 2 weeks will see how it goes.</li>
            <li> My eylashes needed some major help after lash extensions totally damaged them. The were short, weak, and thin. I saw the price and thought \\&quot;what is there to lose?\\&quot; I have been using this for almost a month, and am excited to say that my lashes have grown long again, and are looking great. This product does not thicken or darken lashes; it simply adds length. I only use it at night. I don&#x27;t like it under my mascara. It makes my lashes clump together. Anyway, if you simply need length, give this a try. It&#x27;s cheap so you don&#x27;t have much to lose.</li>
            <li> I barely comment on Amazon, but this time I feel the need to conduct a honest review of this product!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Like perhaps everyone else, I was skeptical of the this serum because of the low price. Yet after applying it twice a day for two weeks, I think this is really an effective products! My lashes are now fuller and more vibrant. New layer of lashes are also visible, which makes it overall seem more \\&quot;bushy\\&quot;. The serum has a pleasant smell, and it does not irritate my eyes (I used to apply Vitamin E oil on my lashes; my vision blurs afterwards). In the morning I apply it before my mascara, and they work great together.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;- The brush is not designed for eye lashes and thus is unpleasant. It&#x27;s not like a brush you find in your mascara. With an inconvenient brush like that, I have to put in extra efforts for my lashes to fully be covered by the serum.&lt;br /&gt;- The serum turns turbid as the brushes goes on my lashes and back into the tube. However, it does not affect my usage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tips:&lt;br /&gt;-  I discover that in order to achieve the maximum effect, you should try to apply the serum not only on your lashes but also at the root of your lashes! It accelerates the growth of new lashes.&lt;br /&gt;- Make sure you take care of the edges.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The serum also uses slowly. As you see, I used a lot, and yet I used only 1/3 a bottle after two weeks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would definitely buy this again, and I recommend everyone give it a try!</li>
            <li> live and learn .win some loose  some .&lt;br /&gt;give it a try the whole tube , no result .&lt;br /&gt;so i gave the rest to friend .</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think it works right away. I think you have to use it for 2 years before you can actually see any difference,  but that&#x27;s only what I feel. It didn&#x27;t do anything for mine. I used this for 4 months, I haven&#x27;t seen any difference.</li>
            <li> This arrived in time. Haven&#x27;t used it long enough to see a difference but I&#x27;ve had no allergic reaction either and there doesn&#x27;t seem to be any strong fragrance to be bothersome. Great deal for 2x. Am using one for my eyebrows.</li>
            <li> Did not notice any change and gave them away.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for about 3 weeks now and can definetly tell that my eyelashes have gotten longer, they however have not gotten any fuller yet.... This product does burn like like hell if you accidently let any drip down into your eye or whatever! have to be very careful around the eyes.</li>
            <li> I will give you the pros and cons! Pros- Well.... IT WORKS! I&#x27;ve been using it for a week now, twice a day like instructed, and it has helped my eyelashes grow so much! I was a little worried about using a product that was so cheap, but I&#x27;m really happy with the results thus far. Cons- If I could give it a bad mark on anything, it would probably have to be... I can&#x27;t really give it a strike. Although the smell through me off at first, its easy to get used to... It smells like a scented soap that you could get from Bath and Body works or something. I have sensitive eyes, like OVERLY sensitive eyes, and it doesn&#x27;t bother me. I also wear contacts and I put this on in the morning after I put my contacts in and it doesn&#x27;t bother me at all. So GREAT product and for 2 that&#x27;s a great deal!</li>
            <li> I have been using this every day for ten days. I wash it off at night and then apply the Ardell Brow and Lash Accelerator. I most definitely have longer fuller lashes. I would recommend using the two together because that is what is working for me and I love the results so far.</li>
            <li> No joke! I tried it because it was cheap and I&#x27;ve been looking to get me some longer lashes.  I&#x27;ve never had extensions before, so I&#x27;m not sure how it compares to those.  I put it on after removing makeup at night, and then put it on in the morning before putting make up back on.  I didn&#x27;t think too much of it at first.. couple days went by.  I can&#x27;t really tell too much of a difference without mascara, but one morning when I was applying mascara--- BAM! I recommend to use in conjunction with mascara obviously; definitely works!</li>
            <li> Not sure if I like this product all that much. I didn&#x27;t like that I had to put it on my eye lashes versus on my lash line. Didn&#x27;t put it on consistently enough to see if it works.</li>
            <li> It feels good, and I do feel a little bit is working, I have to wait for additional 3 more weeks to give review</li>
            <li> it ok, would not purchase it again</li>
            <li> I have reviewed and submitted this item before and for some reason, it&#x27;s not published.  OK, I love this stuff and use it on my eyebrows.  You have to use it at least twice a day on the eyebrows and they will grow but the minute you stop using it, the eyebrows stop growing out.  A person gets tired of constantly putting the stuff on the eyebrows.</li>
            <li> this product is amazing,  i had this product less than two weeks. and already i see a difference in my lashes. thanks</li>
            <li> I believe the product was expired. It didn&#x27;t do anything for my eyelashes. I&#x27;ve tried this same product before and it worked very well.&lt;br /&gt;I won&#x27;t be ordering this product from the vendor.</li>
            <li> I could see a big difference when using this product with double lash. Love the product and loved the price.</li>
