            <li>I&#x27;ve never been able to cut my nails as easily and as perfectly as I can with this nail clipper!</li>
            <li>Went to a drug store and bought a higher priced Denco toenail clipper (model 3405) which works perfectly.  </li>
            <li>I love these clippers!</li>
            <li>Order a pair, you&#x27;ll love them!</li>

            <li>The quality of this is AMAZING, I could rave about it forever.</li>
            <li>AT A DISCOUNTED PRICE FOR AN HONEST REVIEW.</li>
            <li>There&#x27;s one end which is kind of duller than the rest of the metal part even on the nails.  </li>
            <li>The holes cut into the handles are stylish as well as providing good grip.</li>
            <li>Still they will come in handy for my husband to help me.</li>
            <li>When I saw these SpinSnips Best Precision Nail Trimmers, I was very intrigued.</li>

            <li>I received this product in exchange for my honest, unbiased opinion.</li>
            <li>Really nice clippers.</li>
            <li>Nice idea</li>
            <li>They have a nice curve in the handle that helps with handling them easier along with longer handles on them.</li>
            <li>I received these nail clippers at a discounted rate for my honest unbiased review.</li>
            <li>My hubby does not approve of much, but even he was impressed.</li>
            <li>Maybe not $15 nice, but close.</li>
            <li>I keep it handy</li>
            <li>I was offered these clippers to try for a great deal to share my honest opinion and experience and was excited to do it.</li>
            <li>I can rotate the handles to just the right angle for best leverage and easily trim fingernails.  </li>
            <li>Clipper size  is good and they are easy to hold.</li>
            <li>Great product - quick delivery</li>
            <li>The swivel design makes it easy to approach from any angle, the longer handles give good leverage, and most impressively, the cuts it makes are clean and smooth.  </li>
            <li>The best way I can describe it is that it didn&#x27;t &amp;#34;clip&amp;#34; so much as require you to &amp;#34;pinch and rip&amp;#34; off your nail most of the time.  </li>
            <li>Very easy to use.</li>

            <li>There are the best nail clipper ever, nice size, very sharp and with the turning head it makes a great nail clipper.</li>
            <li>Since these spin, I can get the right angle I need without having to twist and turn a thousand ways lol.</li>
            <li>I also knew these were going to be easy to use !</li>
            <li>LOVE LOVE LOVE these clippers!</li>
            <li>the swivel head is awesome for my ability to only use them in one hand effectively.</li>
            <li>The clippers fit my hand perfectly and the rotating head makes it so much easier to clip your finger nails and toe nails.</li>
            <li>They are longer than most pairs of clippers which makes it very easy to hold.</li>
            <li>They are very comfortable to hold onto and use.</li>
            <li>Nice and strong.</li>
            <li>I love how it swivels.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love it</li>
            <li>HAD I LOVE THE ROTATING HEAD</li>
            <li>they fit nicely in my hand and do not slip out like others.</li>
            <li>My favorite feature of course is the that is spins.</li>
            <li>An adjustable blade gap would put these over the top.  </li>
            <li>I recommend going for the product feedback; I suspect that will sell more units.).    </li>
            <li>I am in love with this nail clipper and I reconmend it for the entire family, it is the best one I&#x27;ve ever owned and I plan on ordering more for my family.</li>

            <li>If they had one he would have one in the snap of his fingers:)))have one in the snap of his fingers:)))</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t exactly sure why I would need swivel head clippers</li>
            <li>I think they would be great for an elderly parent who wants to still clip there nails..</li>
            <li>Am so glad I was able to review these.</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t ask for anything more in a nail clipper.</li>
            <li>we&#x27;ve tried many.  </li>
            <li>I like wife doesn&#x27;t needs greater mouth opening</li>
            <li>I was searching for longer clippers that would provide more leverage and chose these.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The metal also seemed thinner and more flexible</li>
            <li>The Spin Snips is definately an interesting design for a nail clipper.</li>
            <li>so I&#x27;m pleased.</li>
            <li>I have never seen a pair of clippers with a swivel head and wasn&#x27;t really sure what the advantage would be, but, after having used them myself, I LOVE them.</li>
            <li>I was also very happy that they arrived before the shipping date of Dec. 29th and actually arrived the day before Christmas Eve.</li>
            <li>These clippers are fantastic!</li>
            <li>Love it.  </li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>Love it and its everything It said it would be.</li>

            <li>Fantastic nail clipper!</li>
            <li>Will definitely order again and tell friends about them, they&#x27;re GREAT!!</li>
            <li>I love these nail clippers.</li>
            <li>These are quality clippers that has a ingenious mechanism of rotating.</li>
            <li>So easy to use Love Love Love it.</li>
            <li>The swiveling cutter head is fantastic &amp; very easy to change position.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend these trimmers for anyone who is looking for a great nail clipper.</li>
            <li>The handles are longer than most clippers and easy to control.</li>
            <li>I thought I&#x27;d love them and they are easy to squeeze</li>
            <li>Some clippers you have to be extremely strong to be able to use them.  </li>
            <li>The rectangular shape gives my hand much more relief and is a lot more comfortable to the touch.</li>
            <li>Ordered a pair for myself right away and LOVE THEM!  </li>
            <li>So far, they work great.</li>
            <li>The clippers are strong and cut easily, and easily move into a variety of helpful positions.  </li>
            <li>The swivel makes them really easy to use and sanitize.</li>
            <li>Makes easy work of it.  </li>
            <li>I CAN EASILY SEE EVERYTHING THAT I&#x27;M DOING .</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s extremely easy to use, and cuts through the thickest of nails.</li>
            <li>Easy to use.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to use and the swivel helps reach my toes easily.</li>
            <li>Moto E has no focus of ANY kind so way to get cleaner pictures but is good enough to show the differences.)</li>
            <li>If you are right or left handed... perfect and easy to use.”</li>
            <li>exceeded expectations, this was first time in years i could cut my own toenails without assistance.&lt;br</li>
            <li>They are very sharp and will cut your nails perfectly.</li>
            <li>It would also be nice if it had a file/digger tool built in like other, cheaper clippers, but they are still very nice at what they do.  </li>
            <li>(Although one fine point:  If you&#x27;re going to request feedback, make it for the product OR for the seller.  </li>
            <li>And this cutter will work fine with my fingernails.</li>
            <li>Until they do, these work fine.</li>
            <li>Wonderful little invention.</li>
            <li>and then I stumbled upon THIS little GEM, and it is wonderful!!</li>
            <li>THIS WAS MORE THAN WHAT I HAVE EXPECTED , ALSO HELPS GREATLY WHEN USING IT FOR MY TOES</li>
            <li>After a clipping, it didn&#x27;t leave my nail as smooth or clean-cut as it could be.</li>
            <li>I needed to file to make the nail smooth.</li>
            <li>Instead of the smooth surface between the lower handle and the clipper assembly, locking teeth would help maintain the angle of the clipper to the handle.  </li>
            <li>It cuts smoothly.</li>
            <li>While they were neat to look at, and conceptually sound, they did indeed fall apart.</li>
            <li>I can never seem to get them to a position that is comfortable and yet still does the job, until now that is.  </li>
            <li>Just having an angle of any kind (as seen in the product photo) makes it MUCH easier to clip nails.</li>
            <li>the head swivels so you can comfortably cut your nails and see what you are doing.  </li>
            <li>The mechanism cuts precise as it&#x27;s described and name implies.</li>
            <li>and they don&#x27;t work cheap.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;These have beautifully fit the bill.  </li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t receive this for free or a discounted price like some reviews.  </li>
            <li>so I could fit the nail into it.</li>
            <li>So useful to be able to swivel the clipper head around.</li>
            <li>Good for old fingers that have lost some strength.</li>
            <li>So far so good with it and recommend it.</li>
            <li>These clippers are very well designed and look very strong.  </li>
            <li>And the swivel feature is wonderful and fits even my small hands.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s worth the money to invest in the clippers!</li>
            <li>What a wonderful idea for the swivel head, would have never thought just a small change like that would make all of the difference.  </li>
            <li>It makes it possible for me to now clip my own fingernails, which I have not been able to do for almost a year.</li>
            <li>Your nails will have a clean cut and they don&#x27;t even need to be filed.</li>
            <li>...needs to have a nail file clean it up.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend it to those who want to be able to easily clip their nails in a shorter time.</li>
            <li>and I must say it was a huge success.  </li>
            <li>smaller jaw opening I truly find a problem as most of my nails just barely fit where even a centimeter more gap would make a world of difference.</li>
            <li>Cool idea.</li>
            <li>One of the most unusual nail clippers I&#x27;ve ever seen.</li>
            <li>I am trilled that I got the opportunity to try these because they absolutely wonderful for a nail fanatic like me.</li>
            <li>Another great thing is that you can cut in more of a rounded tip instead of straight across like other clippers.</li>
            <li>Pretty easy to use</li>
            <li>They are sharp and clip my nails great and with ease.</li>
            <li>These are Great, super sharp.  </li>
            <li>Quick delivery.</li>
            <li>These allow you to clip off the ends quickly</li>
            <li>Super fat shipping.</li>
            <li>To use it as a standard toe nail clipper with out the spin works even better because it&#x27;s stronger and has more control.</li>
            <li>I can honestly say that these are the only clippers that will allow me to use both hands comfortably to trim my nails.</li>
            <li>and he liked that they cut the nail evenly and left a smooth finish.</li>
            <li>The act of clipping is very easy compared with my old, shorter, clippers.  </li>
            <li>They are good for left and right handed use.  </li>
            <li>The SnipSnips clipper creates a painless and hassle free nail clipping environment that I&#x27;m sure will be well appreciated among those who really care for their nails.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Great, sharp clipper!</li>
            <li>“A thoughtful design, easy to use, and SHARP cutter, which is most important to me.</li>
            <li>Easy to operate and very effective and much easier than using conventional nail scissors.</li>
            <li>My order just arrived and it took me about 3 minutes to cut my toes nails and these really made it easy.</li>
            <li>Very sturdy and strong.  </li>
            <li>The clippers clip strong and my husband says that he really likes that the clipping end seems to hold the clipped nails for you when you&#x27;ve clipped, so you dont have them flying around.</li>
            <li>these would be good for a person with limited finger strength and/or hand control.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s is large enough for easy handling and control and it has a nice swivel head to clip.</li>
            <li>I like those better than regular nail clipper cuz easy for me to hold the handle.</li>
            <li>, it cut my nails precisely and fast.  </li>
            <li>The rotating makes it much easier to handle and to see precisely what you&#x27;re doing.</li>
            <li>It cuts very neatly and precisely.</li>
            <li>This modern design makes a huge difference.</li>
            <li>Everythingvtried so far is top notch.</li>
            <li>My old drugstore cheapie does a better job and opens wider.</li>
            <li>you can not even imagine how useful that is until you have it in your hands.</li>
            <li>Its such a nice clipper to have, im</li>
            <li>I am very satisfied with these nail trimmers, they are very sharp and precise.</li>
            <li>And the shipping was super fast!</li>
            <li>I just gave these as a gift tonight and when showing how they work they fell apart right in my hand.</li>
            <li>right</li>
            <li>they went right through them no problem.</li>
            <li>Fabulous and clever nail clipper.  </li>
            <li>I found the blade plenty sharp for a nice clean cut and this clipper appears to be sufficiently rugged to outlast my lifetime.</li>
            <li>These won&#x27;t work for me, but a great product if you nails aren&#x27;t super thick.</li>
            <li>Fun for the whole house!</li>
            <li>From the reviews I read I was all excited about this clever looking gadget.</li>
            <li>They are very sharp and have good leverage.</li>
            <li>This clipper is very sharp and has a good quality feel.  </li>
            <li>They are everything they promised to be, and a smart solution to my problem!</li>
            <li>When you get to your toe nails, you have to use considerable force to cut them, and the top handle really cuts into your palm.</li>
            <li>It works for my smaller toes, not 100 percent happy with cut of big toes because of the curve.</li>
            <li>The swivel head is so easy to use specially for left handed people like me.</li>
            <li>Other than that I am very pleased.  </li>
            <li>I like these clippers very much.</li>
            <li>I am able to get a firm grasp on the nail clippers while being assured I won&#x27;t cut too far or too little.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, the ability for it to rotate is the most important design of this clipper.</li>
            <li>You are able to quickly and easily convert your clipping activity from your left hand to your right hand with a simple rotation of the clippers business end.</li>
            <li>They work well and offer a new capability for clippers that is unique.</li>
            <li>Thanks SpinSnips!</li>
            <li>nice wide cutter.  </li>
            <li>so I will probably order more in the future to give as gifts.</li>
            <li>Thanks!”</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great for trimming fingernails but not for thick toe nails.  </li>
            <li>Does not work any better than regular nail clipper.</li>
            <li>It really works!</li>
            <li>Exactly as advertised.</li>
            <li>The only thing that I would love to see added is the file/nail cleaner.</li>
            <li>Now with these clippers I can turn the head of the clippers and cut in many different directions.</li>
            <li>I can see exactly what I&#x27;m doing without having to make repeated clips.  </li>
            <li>But the Spin Snips does it&#x27;s job pretty well</li>
            <li>I will definitely be ordering a couple more of these, as I think several people in my family would love them.</li>
            <li>I would recommend to a friend or relative, for sure.”</li>
            <li>My initial impression, that I love these clippers, has not altered as I&#x27;ve used them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>These are not only a fantastic device they are fully functional in design!</li>
            <li>This clipper came in a pretty box with foam.</li>
            <li>It broke apart immediately on first use.</li>
            <li>With the ability to move the Clippers in different angles I was able to cut even the tiniest of nails.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend these clippers for pregnant mothers and people overweight.</li>
            <li>All I can say is WOW!!!!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so much easier to cut my right hand nails.</li>
            <li>Right now I&#x27;m not worried he&#x27;ll make off with it because he prefers the straight cutters and that is how I found this for me.</li>
            <li>The clipping edges are easy to rotate right or left.</li>
            <li>Great Product, as one gets older it becomes more difficult to keep you toe nails trimmed, this clipper makes it so much easier.</li>
            <li>I was able to use them on the three smaller toes on each foot and they worked very well.  </li>
            <li>The swivel action is extremely handy, especially for toenails.</li>
            <li>The nail clipper is able to swivel well while getting a tight grasp on my nail in order to cut it off cleanly.</li>
            <li>These are super sharp, allow a more precision cut and much easier for my hands to hold and operate.</li>
            <li>The clippers are exactly as described and work reasonably well, even on my behemoth toe nails.  </li>
            <li>I used these clippers for the first time today and found their angular trajectory and increased leverage power much easier to use on thicker toenails.</li>
            <li>After I received my pair, I immediately ordered a pair for my employer, as she is handicapped and has difficulty using regular  &amp;#34;straight on&amp;#34; nail clippers, due to hand dexterity, and she is able to use these just fine!</li>
            <li>I found out out that the swivel head portion of it really clips the smaller toenails the best because on the big hard toenail it didn&#x27;t want to clip easily.</li>
            <li>Very clever design.</li>
            <li>Finally clippers that work easy no matter</li>
            <li>But putting the proper curve on finger nails proved to be easy.</li>
            <li>This clipper is as ideal to helping clip them close and get a clean cut across the nail and the leverage and control the mechanism gives you helps with this as much as the cutting edge itself does.</li>
            <li>I have what is known as hammer thumbs, and am a senior citizen, which means my nails are becoming more brittle and thick.</li>
            <li>The money I am saving in manicures will certainly be a boon.  </li>
            <li>package came in a clear box with a small cushion underneath, almost with a &amp;#34;cloud 9&amp;#34; feel haha, and I can honestly say, the unique design is the one fact that first strikes you when you get it.</li>
            <li>The clippers fold back up together for easy storage and does not take up much space at all.</li>
            <li>I was expecting them to be weak, but they are very strong and cut through finger and toe nails easily.  </li>
            <li>The swivel makes it easier and the large lightweight handles makes it much easier to hold.</li>
            <li>SO MUCH EASIER AND FASTER.</li>
            <li>This really works as advertised.</li>
            <li>This is a very well made clipper</li>
            <li>Very sturdy grip.</li>
            <li>I like because my nails are really thick/tough and this product cuts with ease.  </li>
            <li>and it was shipped to me in a very timely manner.</li>
            <li>This makes it so much easier with the tilting tip.</li>
            <li>I am really thankful that I got to review this product.</li>
            <li>Very sturdy and well made.</li>
            <li>It might cut very well</li>
            <li>Works very well.</li>
            <li>Once you try these you will never go back to cheap drugstore clippers.  </li>
            <li>These clippers work very well.  </li>
            <li>Very Good!&lt;br</li>
            <li>Thanks for this one though.&lt;br</li>
            <li>but he does prefer the straight edge to the curved ones.</li>
            <li>so if you wanted to give them as a gift they are ready to wrap...</li>
            <li>It is so much easier to cut both finger and toe nails now.  </li>
            <li>It has made clipping mine and my son&#x27;s nails much easier.</li>
            <li>I really like these  clippers.  </li>
            <li>Thanks for the chance to try these at a reduced price.  </li>
            <li>Thought it had a straight edge.</li>
            <li>Was looking specfically for a straight edge toe nail clipper.</li>
            <li>Bought as a gift, so can&#x27;t really rate the performance.</li>
            <li>but I didn&#x27;t like them as much as I thought I would</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t think the ability to swivel would change much.</li>
            <li>This thing works very well.  </li>
            <li>The bending head is pretty cool too and definitely helps with angles.  </li>
            <li>doesn&#x27;t produce clean edges, blade must not be clean or sharp enough for a clean cut.</li>
            <li>Cuts nails easily with the long levers.  </li>
            <li>They also turn 360 degrees, so you can get a good clean cut every time, and not be uncomfortable while trying to do it.</li>
            <li>The clipper is very sharp and cuts concisely, it is not heavy at all, very easy to use and very well made!</li>
            <li>These clippers are very sharp and will cut easily through even my husbands thick toe nails leaving a nice even clean cut edge.</li>
            <li>The clippers could be a bit more sharp, but all in all the design works well.</li>
            <li>Very useful little clippers, I am impressed with the cutting abilities of these, they seem to do great with fingernails or thick toenails.</li>
            <li>Very well made and clever design.</li>
            <li>A good idea but not really worth the extra money.</li>
            <li>Easy to use even with my fat fingers and limited flexibility.</li>
            <li>because I am a diabetic and have neuropathy it is so important that I have a nail clipper that is easy to use and very clean cutting.</li>
            <li>Sharp, precise, easy wielding and solidly built.</li>
            <li>You can use them on either toenails or fingernails, and either right or left-handed, since the tip swivels to either side, and it kind of &amp;#34;locks&amp;#34; into place when you get to the angle you want (it&#x27;s not just left or right, as it looks like in the pictures, there are notches in between straight left and top center and straight right and top center, if you get what I mean!).</li>
            <li>I suffer from carpal tunnel and diabetic neuropathy especially in my right hand and working with the small clippers you get at drug stores or discount places became a real nuisance.</li>
            <li>By turning the jaw to an angle I need I am able to clip my nails much easier and the handle is slightly longer allowing a better amount of leverage thus less effort.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The large holes on the handle make it MUCH easier for these old hands to clip nails.</li>
            <li>I ordered him a new straight cut one when I searched this</li>
            <li>I purchased these clippers because of my problems with arthritis (more leverage &amp; less slip).</li>
            <li>First of all I received the nail clipper in less than two days, super fast shipping!  </li>
            <li>but it wasn&#x27;t in my particular situation.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s decent.</li>
            <li>A clever design that allows for easier clipping.</li>
            <li>Clever.</li>
            <li>and they cost several times more than a regular clipper.  </li>
            <li>This is a high quality, cleverly designed product.  </li>
            <li>I wish somebody would invent a toenail clipper with a larger opening so that we, with very thick nails, can trim them more easily!</li>
            <li>If I would improve them I would make the jaws open just a little more and add another inch to the handles for more leverage but such an animal doesn&#x27;t exist.  </li>
            <li>HIGHLY RECOMMEND THESE..  </li>
            <li>but I honestly highly recommend these.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend them.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>The cool steel feels nice against my hand, even when sweaty - and the length gives me much more room to relax my arm instead of holding it at an awkward angle for too long.</li>
            <li>what was wrong with it, but I sent it back and got a new one that works GREAT!  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Usually, I take almost a half hour trying to my own nails because I really like to cut my nails all off, to the smallest spec of white I can see.</li>
            <li>they come in a cute little box</li>
            <li>I love this little implement.  </li>
            <li>Now, I&#x27;m able to clip evenly around each nail without any distress and with the length of the handle, there&#x27;s little effort in clipping toe nails.</li>
            <li>After many years of regular clippers it felt odd to use these at a right angle.  </li>
            <li>and wow now I can use my whole hand</li>
            <li>Who wants to ask for help as an adult? 2)</li>
            <li>the one&#x27;s normally seen in drug stores.  </li>
            <li>I normally used the Revlon brand clippers</li>
            <li>I love how they swivel and there is a long enough handle to hold them with.  </li>
            <li>I rarely review products since I personally feel I am not paid to help advertise or otherwise promote them.</li>
            <li>However my husband who does have thick nails found these to do a nice job</li>
            <li>Wish I had invented these years ago - great for older folks with weak hands AND younger adults who are not ambidextrous!</li>
            <li>They are also not hard to press.  </li>
            <li>Who knew one would feel like singing praises of such a pedestrian item, but these are far superior to any clippers I&#x27;ve used in the past.  </li>
            <li>so I could compare this new one with the others.  </li>
            <li>It has sharp easy action clippers that meet and snip the nail as you want.</li>
            <li>Very sharp and easy to manipulate.</li>
            <li>Quality is good, design is good, and the cutting edges are sharp (clipped thick toe nails easily).</li>
            <li>they need to make a straight edged clipper that&#x27;s identical in every way to this one but instead of the traditional curved clipper blades it needs to be straight across.</li>
            <li>sharp enough to cut my nail prefect... very comfortable to use</li>
            <li>Purchased these to replace some very old clippers my son had been using.  </li>
            <li>I am going to address why I rate these only 4 star first.</li>
            <li>Wow!</li>
            <li>I normally like to buy cheap clippers but never last long at all.</li>
            <li>Surprised that these clippers worked as promised!</li>
            <li>Awesome clippers for cutting toe nails, at any angle!</li>
            <li>WOW !</li>
            <li>I actually received a defective unit first, though.  </li>
            <li>The scissor style are too easy to grab a little flesh in the gap.</li>
            <li>The ability to swivel the head on these is perfect to get in the right position but since the jaw does not open as wide as my regular clippers I can not get the nail in the jaws therefore they are useless for one of the main reasons I bought them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have thoracic outlet syndrome caused by an extra rib squeezing a nerve near my neck; this has caused a significant loss of muscle in my left hand.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have trouble with my hands but could see these clippers being easy to use for someone who does.</li>
            <li>I have no concern about how long these will last, but I am confident they will last me a lifetime.</li>
            <li>Once I saw them, I was fascinated at such a clever invention!  </li>
            <li>I learned the hard way, after suffering a life threatening toe infection, that diabetics must leave foot care to a skilled podiatric surgeon.</li>
            <li>They are super sharp</li>
            <li>I still wish there longer ones available, because it&#x27;s hard for me to reach my feet very well.</li>
            <li>These nail clippers are great for cutting nails at an angle.</li>
            <li>These are curved rather than straight, I was looking for wide, straight cut clippers.</li>
            <li>I will be greatly sad if these ever come up missing, they are the best clippers I have owned yet.</li>
            <li>It does work well on hands the the swivel makes is far easier to trim someone elses hand.</li>
            <li>Snip Snips have solved that problem completely.</li>
            <li>I am 72 years old and have a bit of an agility issue.  </li>
            <li>I have tried numerous clippers and own at least 3 of the &#x27;old fashion&#x27; like</li>
            <li>So maybe a soft cover over the part that unfolds would be a fix.</li>
            <li>I took the soft cover off my old clippers and slipped it on these</li>
            <li>I will be returning this because the opening is too narrow to allow my toenail to fit in.  </li>
            <li>When I was a young kid on a farm some 70 years ago, (I&#x27;m 84 now)</li>
            <li>For different angels, you can leave the head straight or you can rotate it in any direction.</li>
            <li>Buy it you and you will throw your old clippers away.</li>
            <li>On a fixed income I can&#x27;t always take advantage of things I&#x27;d like to try</li>
            <li>These r very helpful- only wish they were about an inch longer</li>
            <li>THE JOB.&lt;br /&gt;IT&#x27;S BY FAR</li>
            <li>, SO FAR, SO GOOD.&lt;br /&gt;DAVID DEL CONTE</li>
            <li>Thanks again for contacting us and also for leaving a product review.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received the replacement SpinSnips along with an additional smaller SpinSnips.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;After decades of trimming my nails without a rotating head on the clipper, I am plenty used to that, so I don&#x27;t actually use the spin feature as much as I thought I would.  </li>
            <li>Oddly, the full metal handle is comfortable to hold and the holes allow for a firm grip so the clipper doesn&#x27;t slip while in use.  </li>
            <li>A little pricey, but WELL worth the money!</li>
            <li>I am very impressed with how sharp the blade is, and how I had no difficulty cutting through my nails.  </li>
            <li>Purchased this because it stated it could trim the thickest nails, however, it is exactly the same capacity as standard drugstore issue, and did not come close to being able to trim thick nails.</li>
            <li>This makes the new toe nails come in with a very hard and close area to clip because the nail hugs the toe more closely than the old nail did.</li>
            <li>I dont&#x27; know how many clippers I&#x27;ve purchased only to discover that I could barely get my toenails into the narrow gap...</li>
            <li>A removable clipping catcher would bring these in line with a lot of other new, higher quality clippers on the market.    </li>
            <li>It has worked well, with the only drawback being strong, healthy nails that were uncomfortable to cut with regular nail clippers.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t open wide enough but the turning feature makes it easy to use with arthritis.</li>
            <li>Second, the cut isn&#x27;t a clean cut; maybe the blades aren&#x27;t sharp.  </li>
            <li>The long handle are also very helpful.</li>
            <li>but they are very sharp and worth the money.  </li>
            <li>Nothing will ever make the experience easy, but these at least get the job done well.</li>
            <li>Requesting seller feedback, then later coming back for product feedback, was a bit much.  </li>
            <li>So if you run into the same problem, give it at least one more</li>
            <li>Cuts thick nails easily.”</li>
            <li>While I was told by customer service I would receive a replacement pair due to the first pair literally falling apart (to which I was told that some have defects) I have never received them.</li>
            <li>Even with a broken middle finger I was able to get enough pressure to comfortably clip my other hand and toes.</li>
            <li>help me cut my tough toe nails better than anything else I&#x27;ve tried.  </li>
            <li>I received these nail clippers at a reduceded price for my unbiased and honest opinion and would highly recommend to anyone with small kids or even with those hard to reach ingrown nails.</li>
            <li>Lol These nail clippers helped me accomplish this painful task in a breeze.</li>
            <li>I generally don&#x27;t post reviews but this item deserves it.</li>
            <li>and I will never go back to my old ones.</li>
            <li>I have tried a lot of similar products, and this one is by far the best.&lt;br /&gt;As</li>
            <li>They kept slipping out of my hand and made nail trimming a real chore.  </li>
            <li>first thing I have to say about this nail clipper is that it&#x27;s rectangular in shape and a lot longer than your average nail clipper.</li>
            <li>We will gladly send you another set of SpinSnips to replace the broken ones.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had many clippers that either stop clipping or get broken.</li>
            <li>I was delighted to find I could grasp the handles on these clippers with my whole hand, like a pair of pliers, adjust the cutting angle and cut my nails!</li>
            <li>IT&#x27;S LONG ENOUGH, STRONG ENOUGH, AND SHARP ENOUGH TO DO</li>
            <li>Swivel feature is nice, and the clipper cuts well, but it just doesn&#x27;t open wide enough for my thick toenails or my cat&#x27;s claws.</li>
            <li>It has a modern design and doesn&#x27;t look like any other.</li>
            <li>Longer handles give more leverage so cutting my nails much easier to do</li>
            <li>Aside from that, the unit frequently popped apart and could only be put back together with a pair of pliers and a lot of patience.</li>
            <li>When I first received this product, I didn&#x27;t think it would be much different from your average nail clipper.</li>
            <li>They definitely are not cheap and are well worth the money.</li>
            <li>My nails are harder now that I am older and these clippers are a God send for me.  </li>
            <li>The older one gets the harder it get to trim toe nails.  </li>
            <li>Since I have no other way to review but with my initial experience, I would not recommend these.</li>
            <li>I have had major back surgery, and since then, it just seems that I have difficulty trying to clip my toenails.  </li>
            <li>They cut off my nails in a snap due to the slightly curved ends of the clipper, and I didn&#x27;t even need to file them (or if I did, it was very minimal to achieve a more apparent curve on my nails).</li>
            <li>A slightly longer cutting surface with a more finely finished cutting edge would be nice (see the aforementioned Seki clippers).  </li>
            <li>Putting my re-engineering hat on:  I do have a few minor queeps (unsure if the seller has any feedback into the design/manufacturing workflow, but it&#x27;s worth a shot...):    </li>
            <li>I gave the clipper a 4 only because the clipper opening was not wide enough to accommodate the larger two toes on each foot.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li>I have only used them 3 times so far, and will let all know how long they last!</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re more expensive than the typical drugstore nail clippers, but the benefits make the outlay very reasonable.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>So easy to use and sharp enough to go through my thick toe nails.</li>
            <li>Good for fingers, bad for toes.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> AT A DISCOUNTED PRICE FOR AN HONEST REVIEW.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s one end which is kind of duller than the rest of the metal part even on the nails.  </li>
            <li> The holes cut into the handles are stylish as well as providing good grip.</li>
            <li> Still they will come in handy for my husband to help me.</li>

            <li> I received these nail clippers at a discounted rate for my honest unbiased review.</li>
            <li> My hubby does not approve of much, but even he was impressed.</li>
            <li> Maybe not $15 nice, but close.</li>
            <li> I keep it handy</li>
            <li> I was offered these clippers to try for a great deal to share my honest opinion and experience and was excited to do it.</li>

            <li> Clipper size  is good and they are easy to hold.</li>
            <li> Great product - quick delivery</li>
            <li> The swivel design makes it easy to approach from any angle, the longer handles give good leverage, and most impressively, the cuts it makes are clean and smooth.  </li>
            <li> The best way I can describe it is that it didn&#x27;t &amp;#34;clip&amp;#34; so much as require you to &amp;#34;pinch and rip&amp;#34; off your nail most of the time.  </li>

            <li> LOVE LOVE LOVE these clippers!</li>
            <li> the swivel head is awesome for my ability to only use them in one hand effectively.</li>
            <li> The clippers fit my hand perfectly and the rotating head makes it so much easier to clip your finger nails and toe nails.</li>
            <li> They are longer than most pairs of clippers which makes it very easy to hold.</li>
            <li> They are very comfortable to hold onto and use.</li>

            <li> they fit nicely in my hand and do not slip out like others.</li>
            <li> My favorite feature of course is the that is spins.</li>
            <li> An adjustable blade gap would put these over the top.  </li>
            <li> I recommend going for the product feedback; I suspect that will sell more units.).    </li>

            <li> I wasn&#x27;t exactly sure why I would need swivel head clippers</li>
            <li> I think they would be great for an elderly parent who wants to still clip there nails..</li>
            <li> Am so glad I was able to review these.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t ask for anything more in a nail clipper.</li>
            <li> we&#x27;ve tried many.  </li>
            <li> I like wife doesn&#x27;t needs greater mouth opening</li>
            <li> I was searching for longer clippers that would provide more leverage and chose these.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The metal also seemed thinner and more flexible</li>
            <li> The Spin Snips is definately an interesting design for a nail clipper.</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m pleased.</li>
            <li> I have never seen a pair of clippers with a swivel head and wasn&#x27;t really sure what the advantage would be, but, after having used them myself, I LOVE them.</li>
            <li> I was also very happy that they arrived before the shipping date of Dec. 29th and actually arrived the day before Christmas Eve.</li>
            <li> These clippers are fantastic!</li>
            <li> Love it.  </li>
            <li> Love it.</li>

            <li> I love these nail clippers.</li>
            <li> These are quality clippers that has a ingenious mechanism of rotating.</li>
            <li> So easy to use Love Love Love it.</li>
            <li> The swiveling cutter head is fantastic &amp; very easy to change position.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend these trimmers for anyone who is looking for a great nail clipper.</li>
            <li> The handles are longer than most clippers and easy to control.</li>
            <li> I thought I&#x27;d love them and they are easy to squeeze</li>
            <li> Some clippers you have to be extremely strong to be able to use them.  </li>
            <li> The rectangular shape gives my hand much more relief and is a lot more comfortable to the touch.</li>
            <li> Ordered a pair for myself right away and LOVE THEM!  </li>
            <li> So far, they work great.</li>
            <li> The clippers are strong and cut easily, and easily move into a variety of helpful positions.  </li>
            <li> The swivel makes them really easy to use and sanitize.</li>
            <li> Makes easy work of it.  </li>
            <li> I CAN EASILY SEE EVERYTHING THAT I&#x27;M DOING .</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s extremely easy to use, and cuts through the thickest of nails.</li>
            <li> Easy to use.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to use and the swivel helps reach my toes easily.</li>
            <li> Moto E has no focus of ANY kind so way to get cleaner pictures but is good enough to show the differences.)</li>
            <li> If you are right or left handed... perfect and easy to use.”</li>
            <li> exceeded expectations, this was first time in years i could cut my own toenails without assistance.&lt;br</li>
            <li> They are very sharp and will cut your nails perfectly.</li>
            <li> It would also be nice if it had a file/digger tool built in like other, cheaper clippers, but they are still very nice at what they do.  </li>
            <li> (Although one fine point:  If you&#x27;re going to request feedback, make it for the product OR for the seller.  </li>
            <li> And this cutter will work fine with my fingernails.</li>
            <li> Until they do, these work fine.</li>
            <li> Wonderful little invention.</li>
            <li> and then I stumbled upon THIS little GEM, and it is wonderful!!</li>
            <li> THIS WAS MORE THAN WHAT I HAVE EXPECTED , ALSO HELPS GREATLY WHEN USING IT FOR MY TOES</li>
            <li> After a clipping, it didn&#x27;t leave my nail as smooth or clean-cut as it could be.</li>
            <li> I needed to file to make the nail smooth.</li>
            <li> Instead of the smooth surface between the lower handle and the clipper assembly, locking teeth would help maintain the angle of the clipper to the handle.  </li>
            <li> It cuts smoothly.</li>
            <li> While they were neat to look at, and conceptually sound, they did indeed fall apart.</li>
            <li> I can never seem to get them to a position that is comfortable and yet still does the job, until now that is.  </li>
            <li> Just having an angle of any kind (as seen in the product photo) makes it MUCH easier to clip nails.</li>
            <li> the head swivels so you can comfortably cut your nails and see what you are doing.  </li>
            <li> The mechanism cuts precise as it&#x27;s described and name implies.</li>
            <li> and they don&#x27;t work cheap.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;These have beautifully fit the bill.  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t receive this for free or a discounted price like some reviews.  </li>
            <li> so I could fit the nail into it.</li>
            <li> So useful to be able to swivel the clipper head around.</li>
            <li> Good for old fingers that have lost some strength.</li>
            <li> So far so good with it and recommend it.</li>
            <li> These clippers are very well designed and look very strong.  </li>
            <li> And the swivel feature is wonderful and fits even my small hands.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s worth the money to invest in the clippers!</li>
            <li> What a wonderful idea for the swivel head, would have never thought just a small change like that would make all of the difference.  </li>
            <li> It makes it possible for me to now clip my own fingernails, which I have not been able to do for almost a year.</li>
            <li> Your nails will have a clean cut and they don&#x27;t even need to be filed.</li>
            <li> ...needs to have a nail file clean it up.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend it to those who want to be able to easily clip their nails in a shorter time.</li>
            <li> and I must say it was a huge success.  </li>
            <li> smaller jaw opening I truly find a problem as most of my nails just barely fit where even a centimeter more gap would make a world of difference.</li>
            <li> Cool idea.</li>
            <li> One of the most unusual nail clippers I&#x27;ve ever seen.</li>
            <li> I am trilled that I got the opportunity to try these because they absolutely wonderful for a nail fanatic like me.</li>
            <li> Another great thing is that you can cut in more of a rounded tip instead of straight across like other clippers.</li>
            <li> Pretty easy to use</li>
            <li> They are sharp and clip my nails great and with ease.</li>
            <li> These are Great, super sharp.  </li>
            <li> Quick delivery.</li>
            <li> These allow you to clip off the ends quickly</li>
            <li> Super fat shipping.</li>
            <li> To use it as a standard toe nail clipper with out the spin works even better because it&#x27;s stronger and has more control.</li>
            <li> I can honestly say that these are the only clippers that will allow me to use both hands comfortably to trim my nails.</li>
            <li> and he liked that they cut the nail evenly and left a smooth finish.</li>
            <li> The act of clipping is very easy compared with my old, shorter, clippers.  </li>
            <li> They are good for left and right handed use.  </li>
            <li> The SnipSnips clipper creates a painless and hassle free nail clipping environment that I&#x27;m sure will be well appreciated among those who really care for their nails.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Great, sharp clipper!</li>
            <li> “A thoughtful design, easy to use, and SHARP cutter, which is most important to me.</li>
            <li> Easy to operate and very effective and much easier than using conventional nail scissors.</li>
            <li> My order just arrived and it took me about 3 minutes to cut my toes nails and these really made it easy.</li>
            <li> Very sturdy and strong.  </li>
            <li> The clippers clip strong and my husband says that he really likes that the clipping end seems to hold the clipped nails for you when you&#x27;ve clipped, so you dont have them flying around.</li>
            <li> these would be good for a person with limited finger strength and/or hand control.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s is large enough for easy handling and control and it has a nice swivel head to clip.</li>
            <li> I like those better than regular nail clipper cuz easy for me to hold the handle.</li>
            <li> , it cut my nails precisely and fast.  </li>
            <li> The rotating makes it much easier to handle and to see precisely what you&#x27;re doing.</li>
            <li> It cuts very neatly and precisely.</li>
            <li> This modern design makes a huge difference.</li>
            <li> Everythingvtried so far is top notch.</li>
            <li> My old drugstore cheapie does a better job and opens wider.</li>
            <li> you can not even imagine how useful that is until you have it in your hands.</li>
            <li> Its such a nice clipper to have, im</li>
            <li> I am very satisfied with these nail trimmers, they are very sharp and precise.</li>
            <li> And the shipping was super fast!</li>
            <li> I just gave these as a gift tonight and when showing how they work they fell apart right in my hand.</li>
            <li> right</li>
            <li> they went right through them no problem.</li>
            <li> Fabulous and clever nail clipper.  </li>
            <li> I found the blade plenty sharp for a nice clean cut and this clipper appears to be sufficiently rugged to outlast my lifetime.</li>
            <li> These won&#x27;t work for me, but a great product if you nails aren&#x27;t super thick.</li>
            <li> Fun for the whole house!</li>
            <li> From the reviews I read I was all excited about this clever looking gadget.</li>
            <li> They are very sharp and have good leverage.</li>
            <li> This clipper is very sharp and has a good quality feel.  </li>
            <li> They are everything they promised to be, and a smart solution to my problem!</li>
            <li> When you get to your toe nails, you have to use considerable force to cut them, and the top handle really cuts into your palm.</li>
            <li> It works for my smaller toes, not 100 percent happy with cut of big toes because of the curve.</li>
            <li> The swivel head is so easy to use specially for left handed people like me.</li>
            <li> Other than that I am very pleased.  </li>
            <li> I like these clippers very much.</li>
            <li> I am able to get a firm grasp on the nail clippers while being assured I won&#x27;t cut too far or too little.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, the ability for it to rotate is the most important design of this clipper.</li>
            <li> You are able to quickly and easily convert your clipping activity from your left hand to your right hand with a simple rotation of the clippers business end.</li>
            <li> They work well and offer a new capability for clippers that is unique.</li>
            <li> Thanks SpinSnips!</li>
            <li> nice wide cutter.  </li>
            <li> so I will probably order more in the future to give as gifts.</li>
            <li> Thanks!”</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great for trimming fingernails but not for thick toe nails.  </li>
            <li> Does not work any better than regular nail clipper.</li>
            <li> It really works!</li>
            <li> Exactly as advertised.</li>
            <li> The only thing that I would love to see added is the file/nail cleaner.</li>
            <li> Now with these clippers I can turn the head of the clippers and cut in many different directions.</li>
            <li> I can see exactly what I&#x27;m doing without having to make repeated clips.  </li>
            <li> But the Spin Snips does it&#x27;s job pretty well</li>
            <li> I will definitely be ordering a couple more of these, as I think several people in my family would love them.</li>
            <li> I would recommend to a friend or relative, for sure.”</li>
            <li> My initial impression, that I love these clippers, has not altered as I&#x27;ve used them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> These are not only a fantastic device they are fully functional in design!</li>
            <li> This clipper came in a pretty box with foam.</li>
            <li> It broke apart immediately on first use.</li>
            <li> With the ability to move the Clippers in different angles I was able to cut even the tiniest of nails.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend these clippers for pregnant mothers and people overweight.</li>
            <li> All I can say is WOW!!!!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so much easier to cut my right hand nails.</li>
            <li> Right now I&#x27;m not worried he&#x27;ll make off with it because he prefers the straight cutters and that is how I found this for me.</li>
            <li> The clipping edges are easy to rotate right or left.</li>
            <li> Great Product, as one gets older it becomes more difficult to keep you toe nails trimmed, this clipper makes it so much easier.</li>
            <li> I was able to use them on the three smaller toes on each foot and they worked very well.  </li>
            <li> The swivel action is extremely handy, especially for toenails.</li>
            <li> The nail clipper is able to swivel well while getting a tight grasp on my nail in order to cut it off cleanly.</li>
            <li> These are super sharp, allow a more precision cut and much easier for my hands to hold and operate.</li>
            <li> The clippers are exactly as described and work reasonably well, even on my behemoth toe nails.  </li>
            <li> I used these clippers for the first time today and found their angular trajectory and increased leverage power much easier to use on thicker toenails.</li>
            <li> After I received my pair, I immediately ordered a pair for my employer, as she is handicapped and has difficulty using regular  &amp;#34;straight on&amp;#34; nail clippers, due to hand dexterity, and she is able to use these just fine!</li>
            <li> I found out out that the swivel head portion of it really clips the smaller toenails the best because on the big hard toenail it didn&#x27;t want to clip easily.</li>
            <li> Very clever design.</li>
            <li> Finally clippers that work easy no matter</li>
            <li> But putting the proper curve on finger nails proved to be easy.</li>
            <li> This clipper is as ideal to helping clip them close and get a clean cut across the nail and the leverage and control the mechanism gives you helps with this as much as the cutting edge itself does.</li>
            <li> I have what is known as hammer thumbs, and am a senior citizen, which means my nails are becoming more brittle and thick.</li>
            <li> The money I am saving in manicures will certainly be a boon.  </li>
            <li> package came in a clear box with a small cushion underneath, almost with a &amp;#34;cloud 9&amp;#34; feel haha, and I can honestly say, the unique design is the one fact that first strikes you when you get it.</li>
            <li> The clippers fold back up together for easy storage and does not take up much space at all.</li>
            <li> I was expecting them to be weak, but they are very strong and cut through finger and toe nails easily.  </li>
            <li> The swivel makes it easier and the large lightweight handles makes it much easier to hold.</li>
            <li> SO MUCH EASIER AND FASTER.</li>
            <li> This really works as advertised.</li>
            <li> This is a very well made clipper</li>
            <li> Very sturdy grip.</li>
            <li> I like because my nails are really thick/tough and this product cuts with ease.  </li>
            <li> and it was shipped to me in a very timely manner.</li>
            <li> This makes it so much easier with the tilting tip.</li>
            <li> I am really thankful that I got to review this product.</li>
            <li> Very sturdy and well made.</li>
            <li> It might cut very well</li>
            <li> Works very well.</li>
            <li> Once you try these you will never go back to cheap drugstore clippers.  </li>
            <li> These clippers work very well.  </li>
            <li> Very Good!&lt;br</li>
            <li> Thanks for this one though.&lt;br</li>
            <li> but he does prefer the straight edge to the curved ones.</li>
            <li> so if you wanted to give them as a gift they are ready to wrap...</li>
            <li> It is so much easier to cut both finger and toe nails now.  </li>
            <li> It has made clipping mine and my son&#x27;s nails much easier.</li>
            <li> I really like these  clippers.  </li>
            <li> Thanks for the chance to try these at a reduced price.  </li>
            <li> Thought it had a straight edge.</li>
            <li> Was looking specfically for a straight edge toe nail clipper.</li>
            <li> Bought as a gift, so can&#x27;t really rate the performance.</li>
            <li> but I didn&#x27;t like them as much as I thought I would</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t think the ability to swivel would change much.</li>
            <li> This thing works very well.  </li>
            <li> The bending head is pretty cool too and definitely helps with angles.  </li>
            <li> doesn&#x27;t produce clean edges, blade must not be clean or sharp enough for a clean cut.</li>
            <li> Cuts nails easily with the long levers.  </li>
            <li> They also turn 360 degrees, so you can get a good clean cut every time, and not be uncomfortable while trying to do it.</li>
            <li> The clipper is very sharp and cuts concisely, it is not heavy at all, very easy to use and very well made!</li>
            <li> These clippers are very sharp and will cut easily through even my husbands thick toe nails leaving a nice even clean cut edge.</li>
            <li> The clippers could be a bit more sharp, but all in all the design works well.</li>
            <li> Very useful little clippers, I am impressed with the cutting abilities of these, they seem to do great with fingernails or thick toenails.</li>
            <li> Very well made and clever design.</li>
            <li> A good idea but not really worth the extra money.</li>
            <li> Easy to use even with my fat fingers and limited flexibility.</li>
            <li> because I am a diabetic and have neuropathy it is so important that I have a nail clipper that is easy to use and very clean cutting.</li>
            <li> Sharp, precise, easy wielding and solidly built.</li>
            <li> You can use them on either toenails or fingernails, and either right or left-handed, since the tip swivels to either side, and it kind of &amp;#34;locks&amp;#34; into place when you get to the angle you want (it&#x27;s not just left or right, as it looks like in the pictures, there are notches in between straight left and top center and straight right and top center, if you get what I mean!).</li>
            <li> I suffer from carpal tunnel and diabetic neuropathy especially in my right hand and working with the small clippers you get at drug stores or discount places became a real nuisance.</li>
            <li> By turning the jaw to an angle I need I am able to clip my nails much easier and the handle is slightly longer allowing a better amount of leverage thus less effort.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The large holes on the handle make it MUCH easier for these old hands to clip nails.</li>
            <li> I ordered him a new straight cut one when I searched this</li>
            <li> I purchased these clippers because of my problems with arthritis (more leverage &amp; less slip).</li>
            <li> First of all I received the nail clipper in less than two days, super fast shipping!  </li>
            <li> but it wasn&#x27;t in my particular situation.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s decent.</li>
            <li> A clever design that allows for easier clipping.</li>
            <li> Clever.</li>
            <li> and they cost several times more than a regular clipper.  </li>
            <li> This is a high quality, cleverly designed product.  </li>
            <li> I wish somebody would invent a toenail clipper with a larger opening so that we, with very thick nails, can trim them more easily!</li>
            <li> If I would improve them I would make the jaws open just a little more and add another inch to the handles for more leverage but such an animal doesn&#x27;t exist.  </li>
            <li> HIGHLY RECOMMEND THESE..  </li>
            <li> but I honestly highly recommend these.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend them.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> The cool steel feels nice against my hand, even when sweaty - and the length gives me much more room to relax my arm instead of holding it at an awkward angle for too long.</li>
            <li> what was wrong with it, but I sent it back and got a new one that works GREAT!  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Usually, I take almost a half hour trying to my own nails because I really like to cut my nails all off, to the smallest spec of white I can see.</li>
            <li> they come in a cute little box</li>
            <li> I love this little implement.  </li>
            <li> Now, I&#x27;m able to clip evenly around each nail without any distress and with the length of the handle, there&#x27;s little effort in clipping toe nails.</li>
            <li> After many years of regular clippers it felt odd to use these at a right angle.  </li>
            <li> and wow now I can use my whole hand</li>
            <li> Who wants to ask for help as an adult? 2)</li>
            <li> the one&#x27;s normally seen in drug stores.  </li>
            <li> I normally used the Revlon brand clippers</li>
            <li> I love how they swivel and there is a long enough handle to hold them with.  </li>
            <li> I rarely review products since I personally feel I am not paid to help advertise or otherwise promote them.</li>
            <li> However my husband who does have thick nails found these to do a nice job</li>
            <li> Wish I had invented these years ago - great for older folks with weak hands AND younger adults who are not ambidextrous!</li>
            <li> They are also not hard to press.  </li>
            <li> Who knew one would feel like singing praises of such a pedestrian item, but these are far superior to any clippers I&#x27;ve used in the past.  </li>
            <li> so I could compare this new one with the others.  </li>
            <li> It has sharp easy action clippers that meet and snip the nail as you want.</li>
            <li> Very sharp and easy to manipulate.</li>
            <li> Quality is good, design is good, and the cutting edges are sharp (clipped thick toe nails easily).</li>
            <li> they need to make a straight edged clipper that&#x27;s identical in every way to this one but instead of the traditional curved clipper blades it needs to be straight across.</li>
            <li> sharp enough to cut my nail prefect... very comfortable to use</li>
            <li> Purchased these to replace some very old clippers my son had been using.  </li>
            <li> I am going to address why I rate these only 4 star first.</li>
            <li> Wow!</li>
            <li> I normally like to buy cheap clippers but never last long at all.</li>
            <li> Surprised that these clippers worked as promised!</li>
            <li> Awesome clippers for cutting toe nails, at any angle!</li>
            <li> WOW !</li>
            <li> I actually received a defective unit first, though.  </li>
            <li> The scissor style are too easy to grab a little flesh in the gap.</li>
            <li> The ability to swivel the head on these is perfect to get in the right position but since the jaw does not open as wide as my regular clippers I can not get the nail in the jaws therefore they are useless for one of the main reasons I bought them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have thoracic outlet syndrome caused by an extra rib squeezing a nerve near my neck; this has caused a significant loss of muscle in my left hand.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have trouble with my hands but could see these clippers being easy to use for someone who does.</li>
            <li> I have no concern about how long these will last, but I am confident they will last me a lifetime.</li>
            <li> Once I saw them, I was fascinated at such a clever invention!  </li>
            <li> I learned the hard way, after suffering a life threatening toe infection, that diabetics must leave foot care to a skilled podiatric surgeon.</li>
            <li> They are super sharp</li>
            <li> I still wish there longer ones available, because it&#x27;s hard for me to reach my feet very well.</li>
            <li> These nail clippers are great for cutting nails at an angle.</li>
            <li> These are curved rather than straight, I was looking for wide, straight cut clippers.</li>
            <li> I will be greatly sad if these ever come up missing, they are the best clippers I have owned yet.</li>
            <li> It does work well on hands the the swivel makes is far easier to trim someone elses hand.</li>
            <li> Snip Snips have solved that problem completely.</li>
            <li> I am 72 years old and have a bit of an agility issue.  </li>
            <li> I have tried numerous clippers and own at least 3 of the &#x27;old fashion&#x27; like</li>
            <li> So maybe a soft cover over the part that unfolds would be a fix.</li>
            <li> I took the soft cover off my old clippers and slipped it on these</li>
            <li> I will be returning this because the opening is too narrow to allow my toenail to fit in.  </li>
            <li> When I was a young kid on a farm some 70 years ago, (I&#x27;m 84 now)</li>
            <li> For different angels, you can leave the head straight or you can rotate it in any direction.</li>
            <li> Buy it you and you will throw your old clippers away.</li>
            <li> On a fixed income I can&#x27;t always take advantage of things I&#x27;d like to try</li>
            <li> These r very helpful- only wish they were about an inch longer</li>
            <li> THE JOB.&lt;br /&gt;IT&#x27;S BY FAR</li>
            <li> , SO FAR, SO GOOD.&lt;br /&gt;DAVID DEL CONTE</li>
            <li> Thanks again for contacting us and also for leaving a product review.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received the replacement SpinSnips along with an additional smaller SpinSnips.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;After decades of trimming my nails without a rotating head on the clipper, I am plenty used to that, so I don&#x27;t actually use the spin feature as much as I thought I would.  </li>
            <li> Oddly, the full metal handle is comfortable to hold and the holes allow for a firm grip so the clipper doesn&#x27;t slip while in use.  </li>
            <li> A little pricey, but WELL worth the money!</li>
            <li> I am very impressed with how sharp the blade is, and how I had no difficulty cutting through my nails.  </li>
            <li> Purchased this because it stated it could trim the thickest nails, however, it is exactly the same capacity as standard drugstore issue, and did not come close to being able to trim thick nails.</li>
            <li> This makes the new toe nails come in with a very hard and close area to clip because the nail hugs the toe more closely than the old nail did.</li>
            <li> I dont&#x27; know how many clippers I&#x27;ve purchased only to discover that I could barely get my toenails into the narrow gap...</li>
            <li> A removable clipping catcher would bring these in line with a lot of other new, higher quality clippers on the market.    </li>
            <li> It has worked well, with the only drawback being strong, healthy nails that were uncomfortable to cut with regular nail clippers.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t open wide enough but the turning feature makes it easy to use with arthritis.</li>
            <li> Second, the cut isn&#x27;t a clean cut; maybe the blades aren&#x27;t sharp.  </li>
            <li> The long handle are also very helpful.</li>
            <li> but they are very sharp and worth the money.  </li>
            <li> Nothing will ever make the experience easy, but these at least get the job done well.</li>
            <li> Requesting seller feedback, then later coming back for product feedback, was a bit much.  </li>
            <li> So if you run into the same problem, give it at least one more</li>
            <li> Cuts thick nails easily.”</li>
            <li> While I was told by customer service I would receive a replacement pair due to the first pair literally falling apart (to which I was told that some have defects) I have never received them.</li>
            <li> Even with a broken middle finger I was able to get enough pressure to comfortably clip my other hand and toes.</li>
            <li> help me cut my tough toe nails better than anything else I&#x27;ve tried.  </li>
            <li> I received these nail clippers at a reduceded price for my unbiased and honest opinion and would highly recommend to anyone with small kids or even with those hard to reach ingrown nails.</li>
            <li> Lol These nail clippers helped me accomplish this painful task in a breeze.</li>
            <li> I generally don&#x27;t post reviews but this item deserves it.</li>
            <li> and I will never go back to my old ones.</li>
            <li> I have tried a lot of similar products, and this one is by far the best.&lt;br /&gt;As</li>
            <li> They kept slipping out of my hand and made nail trimming a real chore.  </li>
            <li> first thing I have to say about this nail clipper is that it&#x27;s rectangular in shape and a lot longer than your average nail clipper.</li>
            <li> We will gladly send you another set of SpinSnips to replace the broken ones.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had many clippers that either stop clipping or get broken.</li>
            <li> I was delighted to find I could grasp the handles on these clippers with my whole hand, like a pair of pliers, adjust the cutting angle and cut my nails!</li>
            <li> IT&#x27;S LONG ENOUGH, STRONG ENOUGH, AND SHARP ENOUGH TO DO</li>
            <li> Swivel feature is nice, and the clipper cuts well, but it just doesn&#x27;t open wide enough for my thick toenails or my cat&#x27;s claws.</li>
            <li> It has a modern design and doesn&#x27;t look like any other.</li>
            <li> Longer handles give more leverage so cutting my nails much easier to do</li>
            <li> Aside from that, the unit frequently popped apart and could only be put back together with a pair of pliers and a lot of patience.</li>
            <li> When I first received this product, I didn&#x27;t think it would be much different from your average nail clipper.</li>
            <li> They definitely are not cheap and are well worth the money.</li>
            <li> My nails are harder now that I am older and these clippers are a God send for me.  </li>
            <li> The older one gets the harder it get to trim toe nails.  </li>
            <li> Since I have no other way to review but with my initial experience, I would not recommend these.</li>
            <li> I have had major back surgery, and since then, it just seems that I have difficulty trying to clip my toenails.  </li>
            <li> They cut off my nails in a snap due to the slightly curved ends of the clipper, and I didn&#x27;t even need to file them (or if I did, it was very minimal to achieve a more apparent curve on my nails).</li>
            <li> A slightly longer cutting surface with a more finely finished cutting edge would be nice (see the aforementioned Seki clippers).  </li>
            <li> Putting my re-engineering hat on:  I do have a few minor queeps (unsure if the seller has any feedback into the design/manufacturing workflow, but it&#x27;s worth a shot...):    </li>
            <li> I gave the clipper a 4 only because the clipper opening was not wide enough to accommodate the larger two toes on each foot.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li> I have only used them 3 times so far, and will let all know how long they last!</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re more expensive than the typical drugstore nail clippers, but the benefits make the outlay very reasonable.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> So easy to use and sharp enough to go through my thick toe nails.</li>
            <li> Good for fingers, bad for toes.</li>
            <li> The jaw needs to open a bit more as I have a few nails that are actually too thick to use these</li>
            <li> These clippers are nice and sharp and allow me to move them into positions that I ,myself am unable to do with regular clippers</li>
            <li> Requires less pressure than normal trimmers.  </li>
            <li> the long handles flex to much on men&#x27;s thick toenails ,nearly come together before they cut thru nail .</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a long process, and even then, my nails have to be filed down to look decent.</li>
            <li> Seems to take a lot of effort to cut through a thin nail and then doesn&#x27;t leave the cut clean</li>
            <li> Nice idea, but for me the cutting edges do not open wide enough for thickened toenails.</li>
            <li> I always find it difficult to clip my left hand nails, but this made them so easy.</li>
            <li> and I normally have trouble using a nail clipper but not this one</li>
            <li> My fingers are not strong enough to work ordinary drug store clippers, or even slightly longer clippers with more leverage.</li>
            <li> I am capable of squeezing hard enough for just a couple toes.</li>
            <li> These clippers will last a very long time.</li>
            <li> Since I have small hands, I can really appreciate the long handles, it helps when I need to cut my husbands toenails...</li>
            <li> My personal physical problem with the typical large toenail clippers is being able to squeeze hard enough when in cutting position.</li>
            <li> These little clippers really surprised me.  </li>
            <li> Not worth the money as they are no better than the regular large ones.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s hard for him to reach them, but, with the long handle and with the swivel head, it makes it so much easier for him.</li>
            <li> When they grew back in they were at least twice as thick and highly curved so that I couldn&#x27;t clip them in a normal fashion with either type of nail clippers (regular clippers or the side nipper variety).  </li>
            <li> Too bad because I liked them.</li>
            <li> they make cutting finger nails more convenient, however they aren&#x27;t the sturdy all purpose clippers as advertised.</li>
            <li> I used it on my son who had small fingers and normally complains about having his nails cut</li>
            <li> I have no complaints and the long handle does help.</li>
            <li> It is smaller than I expected.  </li>
            <li> HOW LONG IT WILL STAY</li>
            <li> Because you have to use your whole hand to cut the thick nails.</li>
            <li> Opening is not large enough.  </li>
            <li> Revolutionary new design which may take a significent nitch out of the usual and customary clipper market.</li>
            <li> But when I left it on a wet counter for few hours it dripped rust from the bent part (shows tiny cracks) next to the blades.</li>
            <li> I was expecting the blades to spread apart further than all other toenail clippers but that was not the case.</li>
            <li> They never seem to be sharp or sturdy enough to hold up in our house.  </li>
            <li> I double dare you to make these two other designs and see just how well they catch on?</li>
            <li> but the levers are little too soft to cut through my toe nails and  the blades should open up just slightly.</li>
            <li> I have lost big and little toe nails several times (due to dropping construction materials or tools on them, or having them run over)</li>
            <li> Not only that, but the mini nail clippers I like to use for small uneven edges are too hard to handle and often slip too easily out of my grasp, resulting in damaged nails that still remained oddly shaped.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> They have a swivel head for easy clipping at awkward angles.  </li>
            <li> I needed a pair of clippers that I could use because of limited use of my dominate hand due to a disease and surgery.</li>
            <li> The longer handle allowed me to reach those toes when I had not be able to before because of bad knees that can&#x27;t twist to reach the toes.  </li>
            <li> Not as sturdy as expected</li>
            <li> but if your nails are fairly thin they should work very well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Cutter is 3/4&amp;#34; wide and nail clipper is 3 1/4&amp;#34; longer.  </li>
            <li> The swivel head doesn&#x27;t move fluidly as I expected, but it doesn&#x27;t need to.  </li>
            <li> but still had to press harder than I expected</li>
            <li> After reading a couple of comments about what would seem to be occasional quality control issues with these clippers, I decided to wait until I had used them a few times to write a review.  </li>
            <li> So far I have had no problems with the clippers&#x27; breaking, although apparently a very small number of people have.  </li>
            <li> Cutting edges are very sharp and leave the nail edges smooth - no need to file or sand.  </li>
            <li> These are stainless steel and have a VERY SHARP cutting edge, so it cuts on the first try, no matter how thick your nails are.  </li>
            <li> I had other nail clippers before</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think that this one is as sharp as I would expect.  </li>
            <li> This one can&#x27;t beat the quality of my other clippers.  </li>
            <li> I have a repaired lower back that is not able to be bent, limiting my ability to bend over.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m extremely expressed by the quality and usefulness of the design.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It looked sharp and seemed to close evenly</li>
            <li> The only reason I did not give a five star rating, is that I would prefer a straight cutting edge rather than curved.</li>
            <li> My only minor complaint is that I wish the blade was a little wider.  </li>
            <li> As stated in other reviews they are sharp !</li>
            <li> Not worth messing with - returns.</li>
            <li> They are usually small and thin and always break really fast.</li>
            <li> Negative (personal)</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not as heavy duty as I expected.</li>
            <li> Do not recommend SpinSnips for thick toenails, especially those that have been infected with a fungus.</li>
            <li> and they don&#x27;t leave ragged edges that have to be filed down.</li>
            <li> Very sharp and works well.</li>
            <li> They are well made and very sharp.  </li>
            <li> They managed to save my toes but all of my nails turned black and came off.  </li>
            <li> the handle takes less pressure to clip them...</li>
            <li> These clippers made the job at least possible, if not easy.  </li>
            <li> He would first numb my toes and then clip them.  </li>
            <li> and they cut leaving a ragged mess.</li>
            <li> OTHERS HAVE BEEN TOO SMALL, NOT ENOUGH GRIP, AND GET DULL QUICKLY.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The cutting tool was not wide enough</li>
            <li> I get so annoyed trying to trim my left hand nails and often resort to filing away forever to get them trimmed down</li>
            <li> My hands are quite arthritic, and this makes life a little bit easier.</li>
            <li> and it gets all the little corners that can be tricky to trim.</li>
            <li> A little pricey</li>
            <li> and then you can file just a little to even out the ends.  </li>
            <li> nails are quite thick And not probably not normal.  </li>
            <li> I must keep them very short both fingers and toe nails to help prevent the splits that can run the whole length down to the base of the nails.</li>
            <li> My carpal tunnel issues have made me crazy when clipping my nails and when I saw this I just thought it was insanely smart.  </li>
            <li> Hard thick toenails require a clipper with a larger opening -</li>
            <li> and it does not really work on elderly parents thick toenails.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.  </li>
            <li> No slivers left or shredded or poor cuts at all.</li>
            <li> They are not just thrown in a messy box etc..</li>
            <li> I may get some more.&lt;br /&gt;Great, I have trouble with my hands and that help me a lot</li>
            <li> If you have trouble clipping your nails at an angle, these are the clippers for you.</li>
            <li> Precision Services Global is a company that stands behind their product</li>
            <li> Twist the head an there in plain view is the thumb.</li>
            <li> I always have had extremely tough toenails to the point where I thought I would have broken some of my old nail clippers, but they felt like goo when compared to the SnipSnips clipper!</li>
            <li> excuse the poor photo quality.</li>
            <li> This clipper is awkward to use and doesn&#x27;t open up enough for thick toenails.</li>
            <li> For average person, it probably rank higher.  </li>
            <li> I was disappointed by the poor quality of the central pin, particularly at the price.</li>
            <li> I had a hip replacement, it is sometimes difficult to clip my toenails, this swivel head makes it possible!  </li>
            <li> The before the cut opening is too small for my toenails.</li>
            <li> However, the shape of the blade usually results in cutting the skin near the edges of the nails as well.</li>
            <li> I wear a small womens glove.</li>
            <li> The answer may be to use a pumice stone everyday so that the nails don&#x27;t get so thick.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d struggled with ordinary nail clippers since being diagnosed with MS 25 years ago.</li>
            <li> I have very thick toe nails and usually end up with jagged nails as my other clippers struggle to clip my toe nails.</li>
            <li> Very heavy metal.  </li>
            <li> We have had a few cases of this happening with them due to a manufacture&#x27;s defect and we are sorry you were one of the ones this happened to.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used a ton of nail clippers in my past, and they all end up hurting my hand at some point because of their pointed ends when I try to cut off a thick toenail.</li>
            <li> She predicted that these clippers will solve a problem for lots of people.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update:  My clippers fell apart after approximately a year and a half.  </li>
            <li> My husband bought a pair for his mother who has weak hands and trouble trimming her toenails.  </li>
            <li> I have weak hands and crooked toes from rheumatoid arthritis and unfortunately given the positions I needed to turn my hand</li>
            <li> I had a hard time before these clippers clipping my nails and my son&#x27;s nails at an angle.</li>
            <li> As a lefty, it is sometimes hard to get those corners on my nails, but, with the swivel head it makes it a breeze.</li>
            <li> My toenails a narly thick and hard.</li>
            <li> They snipped off my THICK acrylic nails</li>
            <li> Hinge has a tendency to slip when used on thick nails.</li>
            <li> : I do not have thick nails.</li>
            <li> My father loves them because he has really thick toe nails</li>
            <li> I would recommend them for anyone that has really thick nails as well as anyone who struggles to reach their toes.</li>
            <li> First off, it is a very weak cut, the mechanics of these cutters don&#x27;t pack strength behind the cut whether cutting straight-on or turning them at a different cutting angle.</li>
            <li> No more!</li>
            <li> The hands in the photo must have small hands!</li>
            <li> It bends when cutting through a thick toenail and the cutting head swivels too easily making it difficult to cut.</li>
            <li> Not worth the hassle of returning as long as I keep it away from water.. but still disappointed..</li>
            <li> To trim my nails at home requires at least six nips per toe, a feat that was impossible with regular clippers and I no longer have the strength in my hands to use the side nippers.  </li>
            <li> I have arthritis in my hands which made the use of standard nail clippers very difficult.  </li>
            <li> I was going to return it, but got ill, and unable to send it back in time.  </li>
            <li> Regular nail clippers have become nearly impossible for me to use.</li>
            <li> So I can&#x27;t speak about tough or thick nails.</li>
            <li> No more expensive trips to the nail salon for me....</li>
            <li> No more contorting yourself to reach difficult areas.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> It allows me to reach a difficult to cut small toe nail that up until now often required me to ask someone for help.</li>
            <li> Also they can still come apart like other clippers if twisted the wrong way.  </li>
            <li> I then cut my toe nails which are very hard</li>
            <li> His toenails are very thick and trimming them has always been quite a chore.  </li>
            <li> I gave them to my husband to use as his toe nails are very thick</li>
            <li> Not happy at all with this item.</li>
            <li> Not happy with these</li>
            <li> I was and not happy with this item and would never order it again.</li>
            <li> have very weak hands as a result of a serious illness.  </li>
            <li> They turn 360 degrees making it so there is no more awkward positions to cut your nails.</li>
            <li> It was worse than terrible, and since it has 4.7 stars, the only conclusion I could come up with was that I got a defective unit.  </li>
            <li> I was skeptical because I don&#x27;t understand the mechanics?</li>
            <li> Maybe I have weird nails</li>
            <li> Sorry I bought it.</li>
            <li> my toes were frostbitten.  </li>
            <li> , I DON&#x27;T HAVE TO BE TWISTING AND SNIPPING ON THE BLIND .</li>

            <li> VERY VERY THIN nails that split vertically.</li>
            <li> I hate when dull clippers leave jagged edges and cracks in my nails.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not all awkward cutting at all .</li>
            <li> , the swivel feature is a life saver when cutting toenails.  </li>
            <li> Awkward to use and</li>
            <li> Can be adjusted to almost any angle, so you can see what you are cutting, and no hand cramps.  </li>
            <li> With the rotation, I no longer have to sit or put my arm at awkward angles in order to try and cut my nails neatly.</li>
            <li> So disappointed in this product.</li>
            <li> I am disappointed in these.  </li>
            <li> The Spin Snips Nail Clipper was a real disappointment.</li>
            <li> Very painful.</li>
            <li> I am very disappointed because it works so well otherwise.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Not as sturdy as expected and it does not really work on elderly parents thick toenails. It does work well on hands the the swivel makes is far easier to trim someone elses hand.</li>
            <li> I am going to address why I rate these only 4 star first. The jaw needs to open a bit more as I have a few nails that are actually too thick to use these and I I have a severe arthritic condition that has curled my pinky finger of my left hand in towards my palm. The ability to swivel the head on these is perfect to get in the right position but since the jaw does not open as wide as my regular clippers I can not get the nail in the jaws therefore they are useless for one of the main reasons I bought them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That being said. the swivel head is awesome for my ability to only use them in one hand effectively. By turning the jaw to an angle I need I am able to clip my nails much easier and the handle is slightly longer allowing a better amount of leverage thus less effort.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The smaller jaw opening I truly find a problem as most of my nails just barely fit where even a centimeter more gap would make a world of difference. Perhaps they will consider that in the future. If you have thicker nails these might not work well for you but if your nails are fairly thin they should work very well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(Please excuse the poor photo quality. Moto E has no focus of ANY kind so way to get cleaner pictures but is good enough to show the differences.)</li>
            <li> I just gave these as a gift tonight and when showing how they work they fell apart right in my hand. Talk about embarrassing! So disappointed in this product. Cool idea. Horrible product.</li>
            <li> So easy to use Love Love Love it.</li>
            <li> This is the greatest nail clipper ever! I love how it swivels. It&#x27;s so much easier to cut my right hand nails. It&#x27;s not all awkward cutting at all . I absolutely love it</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never seen one like this. The swivel head feature is awesome. I just ordered one for a friend.</li>
            <li> OMG THESE ARE THE BEST CLIPPERS I EVER HAD I LOVE THE ROTATING HEAD MAKES CLIPPING NAILS SO MUCH EASIER AND FASTER. HIGHLY RECOMMEND THESE..  I GOT THIS PRODUCT AT A DISCOUNTED PRICE FOR AN HONEST REVIEW.</li>
            <li> I like these clippers very much. Thry are truly well made and precision tools. They work well and offer a new capability for clippers that is unique.</li>
            <li> These clippers are great!  I had a hip replacement, it is sometimes difficult to clip my toenails, this swivel head makes it possible!  Thanks SpinSnips!</li>
            <li> In my opinion - The &amp;#34;perfect&amp;#34; nail clipper. This is the best I have ever used. The swiveling cutter head is fantastic &amp; very easy to change position. Very easy to use. Genius design. Cuts thick nails easily.”</li>
            <li> nice wide cutter.  Cutter is 3/4&amp;#34; wide and nail clipper is 3 1/4&amp;#34; longer.  Nice and strong.</li>
            <li> Can not keep them everybody uses them</li>
            <li> Broke on the second use.</li>
            <li> I had other nail clippers before so I could compare this new one with the others.  I don&#x27;t think that this one is as sharp as I would expect.  It couldn&#x27;t even cut off my cuticles or skin.  There&#x27;s one end which is kind of duller than the rest of the metal part even on the nails.  This one can&#x27;t beat the quality of my other clippers.  After a clipping, it didn&#x27;t leave my nail as smooth or clean-cut as it could be. I needed to file to make the nail smooth.</li>
            <li> Used them once and they were great.  Second time they just exploded into pieces in my hand.  Not worth messing with - returns.</li>
            <li> It works as promised.</li>
            <li> This really works as advertised. My hands are quite arthritic, and this makes life a little bit easier.</li>
            <li> These are amazing.  They snipped off my THICK acrylic nails like they were nothing.  No more expensive trips to the nail salon for me....these are awesome!&lt;br /&gt;Also, the swivel feature is a life saver when cutting toenails.  No more contorting yourself to reach difficult areas.&lt;br /&gt;I have nothing but good to say about these.  If you are hesitating...Don&#x27;t!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never seen or had a pair of nail clippers like these before and I will never go back to my old ones. They are made well and durable. They are sharp and clip my nails great and with ease. they fit nicely in my hand and do not slip out like others. My favorite feature of course is the that is spins. Since these spin, I can get the right angle I need without having to twist and turn a thousand ways lol. I received these to review but I honestly highly recommend these. I believe they will be the best nail clippers you have ever owed too.</li>
            <li> One of the most unusual nail clippers I&#x27;ve ever seen. And after seeing it, I&#x27;m wondering why no one ever thought of this before.    The clippers are exactly as described and work reasonably well, even on my behemoth toe nails.  Putting my re-engineering hat on:  I do have a few minor queeps (unsure if the seller has any feedback into the design/manufacturing workflow, but it&#x27;s worth a shot...):    1.  I&#x27;d prefer the metal to be a bit heavier throughout  2.  An adjustable blade gap would put these over the top.  I dont&#x27; know how many clippers I&#x27;ve purchased only to discover that I could barely get my toenails into the narrow gap... (Are you reading this, Seki?)  3.  Instead of the smooth surface between the lower handle and the clipper assembly, locking teeth would help maintain the angle of the clipper to the handle.  (This could be integrated with the adjustable gap-set above.)  4.  A slightly longer cutting surface with a more finely finished cutting edge would be nice (see the aforementioned Seki clippers).  5.  A removable clipping catcher would bring these in line with a lot of other new, higher quality clippers on the market.    As for the seller, they did great, with accurate description and timely shipping.  (Although one fine point:  If you&#x27;re going to request feedback, make it for the product OR for the seller.  Requesting seller feedback, then later coming back for product feedback, was a bit much.  I recommend going for the product feedback; I suspect that will sell more units.).    Recommended.</li>
            <li> First of all I received the nail clipper in less than two days, super fast shipping!  The product is amazing and it&#x27;s made from quality materials.  I used it on my son who had small fingers and normally complains about having his nails cut and I must say it was a huge success.  I then cut my toe nails which are very hard and I normally have trouble using a nail clipper but not this one, it cut my nails precisely and fast.  I am in love with this nail clipper and I reconmend it for the entire family, it is the best one I&#x27;ve ever owned and I plan on ordering more for my family.</li>
            <li> I have been using the supplement Biotin over the last year to strengthen my hair and nails. It has worked well, with the only drawback being strong, healthy nails that were uncomfortable to cut with regular nail clippers. Snip Snips have solved that problem completely. They are everything they promised to be, and a smart solution to my problem!</li>
            <li> These clippers are very well designed and look very strong.  Well made. I was able to use them on the three smaller toes on each foot and they worked very well.  The longer handle allowed me to reach those toes when I had not be able to before because of bad knees that can&#x27;t twist to reach the toes.  I gave the clipper a 4 only because the clipper opening was not wide enough to accommodate the larger two toes on each foot.&lt;br /&gt;The nails are quite thick And not probably not normal.  But I would be very happy to find a clipper that would accommodate.  This is a very well made clipper</li>
            <li> So far, they work great. Very sturdy grip. I still wish there longer ones available, because it&#x27;s hard for me to reach my feet very well.</li>
            <li> Best nail clips we have ever used.  Wife likes because with wrist arthritis she can now cut her nails without pain.  I like because my nails are really thick/tough and this product cuts with ease.  Both our daughters are wanting a pair so I will probably order more in the future to give as gifts.</li>
            <li> Swivel feature is nice, and the clipper cuts well, but it just doesn&#x27;t open wide enough for my thick toenails or my cat&#x27;s claws.</li>
            <li> These are durable and work well. I would definitely recommend them.</li>
            <li> I am very happy with this product. It cuts smoothly. I am 72 years old and have a bit of an agility issue.  This product solves that problem. The only reason I did not give a five star rating, is that I would prefer a straight cutting edge rather than curved.</li>
            <li> These clippers work great. I like the adjustability of the clipper head and the leverage of the arms.</li>
            <li> While I was told by customer service I would receive a replacement pair due to the first pair literally falling apart (to which I was told that some have defects) I have never received them. Since I have no other way to review but with my initial experience, I would not recommend these. While they were neat to look at, and conceptually sound, they did indeed fall apart.</li>
            <li> the long handles flex to much on men&#x27;s thick toenails ,nearly come together before they cut thru nail .</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not as heavy duty as I expected. It bends when cutting through a thick toenail and the cutting head swivels too easily making it difficult to cut. Good for fingers, bad for toes.</li>
            <li> My highest recommendation.</li>
            <li> They broke apart!  Too bad because I liked them.</li>
            <li> Wish I&#x27;d had these clippers years ago. Quality is good, design is good, and the cutting edges are sharp (clipped thick toe nails easily). Easy to use even with my fat fingers and limited flexibility. Clipper size  is good and they are easy to hold. I even like the appearance  - how often can you say that about nail clippers?  The holes cut into the handles are stylish as well as providing good grip. The clipping edges are easy to rotate right or left.</li>
            <li> This is the best nail clipper I have ever had. because I am a diabetic and have neuropathy it is so important that I have a nail clipper that is easy to use and very clean cutting. and it was shipped to me in a very timely manner. I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> HAVE NOT USED YET BUT LOOKS GREAT</li>
            <li> These feel well made, not flimsy. The swivel head is a great idea. My personal physical problem with the typical large toenail clippers is being able to squeeze hard enough when in cutting position. I am capable of squeezing hard enough for just a couple toes. My toenails a narly thick and hard. The before the cut opening is too small for my toenails. My fingernails are normal/typical/thin. And this cutter will work fine with my fingernails. For my toenails I prefer the flip and squeeze clippers over the scissor style, I just butt the bottom on the toe with the nail in the gap. The scissor style are too easy to grab a little flesh in the gap.</li>
            <li> Great, sharp clipper! Very easy to use.</li>
            <li> I have tried numerous clippers and own at least 3 of the &#x27;old fashion&#x27; like the one&#x27;s normally seen in drug stores.  These are super sharp, allow a more precision cut and much easier for my hands to hold and operate.</li>
            <li> This is a high quality, cleverly designed product.  The clippers are strong and cut easily, and easily move into a variety of helpful positions.  I have weak hands and crooked toes from rheumatoid arthritis and unfortunately given the positions I needed to turn my hand I didn&#x27;t always have the strength to push the clipper.  Still they will come in handy for my husband to help me.</li>
            <li> I love this product. Works great on finger nails. The rotating head is a great idea. There is just one challenge with this clipper. When you get to your toe nails, you have to use considerable force to cut them, and the top handle really cuts into your palm. Because you have to use your whole hand to cut the thick nails. Your index And your thumb will not do. So maybe a soft cover over the part that unfolds would be a fix. I took the soft cover off my old clippers and slipped it on these and wow now I can use my whole hand and it does not cut into my palm.</li>
            <li> What a great idea! I have the hardest time clipping my nails because I have arthritis in my hands. This makes it so much easier with the tilting tip. I also have an easier time clipping my kids nails with it. I am really thankful that I got to review this product. The design is flawless and sleek. Very sturdy and well made. Super happy with this product!</li>
            <li> When I was younger, I went to beauty school and studied nails and facial. My friends always bring their babies to my to trim their nails since I&#x27;m not nervous about it. When I saw these SpinSnips Best Precision Nail Trimmers, I was very intrigued. I was offered these clippers to try for a great deal to share my honest opinion and experience and was excited to do it. When they  arrived, I immediately started clipping the kids nails. Wow! These SpinSnips Nail Trimmers are amazing! Very easy to use and it gets all the little corners that can be tricky to trim. I highly recommend these trimmers for anyone who is looking for a great nail clipper.</li>
            <li> Now these are toe nail clippers! My order just arrived and it took me about 3 minutes to cut my toes nails and these really made it easy.</li>
            <li> Fun for the whole house!</li>
            <li> “This clipper is great! It makes it possible for me to now clip my own fingernails, which I have not been able to do for almost a year. Thanks!”</li>
            <li> From the reviews I read I was all excited about this clever looking gadget. I was expecting the blades to spread apart further than all other toenail clippers but that was not the case. Hard thick toenails require a clipper with a larger opening - how else are we to insert the nail between the blades? The spinning doohickey in theory looked like it would be greatly advantageous but it wasn&#x27;t in my particular situation. I wish somebody would invent a toenail clipper with a larger opening so that we, with very thick nails, can trim them more easily!</li>
            <li> OMG !!! These are Great!! When these arrived they came nicely packaged I have to say I was even happy w/ the packaging lol and i was also impressed with the design !! So simple but genius!! As stated in other reviews they are sharp ! I also knew these were going to be easy to use ! I have to hide them from my husband he is forever stealing the nail clippers :) I will catch him one day lol he breaks every pair if you want something broke give it to my husband lol I do love him :) but he&#x27;s not stealing these lol</li>
            <li> These are great ! I am overweight and have a BIG BELLY in the way when I am trying to cut my toenails. These clippers are nice and sharp and allow me to move them into positions that I ,myself am unable to do with regular clippers They enable me to cut my nails without giving myself a hernia in the process ...LOL.. I would highly recommend these clippers for pregnant mothers and people overweight. Great buy, also !!!</li>
            <li> Good idea but not perfected. Hinge has a tendency to slip when used on thick nails. 90 degree angle of clipper handle to finger obscures line of sight to nail.</li>
            <li> Very useful little clippers, I am impressed with the cutting abilities of these, they seem to do great with fingernails or thick toenails. The swivel makes them really easy to use and sanitize. Since I have small hands, I can really appreciate the long handles, it helps when I need to cut my husbands toenails...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[Tried Discounted Sample Provided For Review And Evaluation]</li>
            <li> Horrible!  They do not cut at all!  I am contacting seller and demanding refund!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great for trimming fingernails but not for thick toe nails.  Opening is not large enough.  Went to a drug store and bought a higher priced Denco toenail clipper (model 3405) which works perfectly.  Do not recommend SpinSnips for thick toenails, especially those that have been infected with a fungus.</li>
            <li> All I can say is WOW!!!! These are the best clippers EVER!!!  I have had major back surgery, and since then, it just seems that I have difficulty trying to clip my toenails.  I can never seem to get them to a position that is comfortable and yet still does the job, until now that is.  These are stainless steel and have a VERY SHARP cutting edge, so it cuts on the first try, no matter how thick your nails are.  They also turn 360 degrees, so you can get a good clean cut every time, and not be uncomfortable while trying to do it. I know what will be stocking stuffers for all the adults in my family this year :)&lt;br /&gt;I was provided a sample for review and I do not promise a good rating in return, nor am I affiliated with this company or compensated in any way. I am just a regular Amazon customer who shops a lot on Amazon.</li>
            <li> Very sharp and works well.</li>
            <li> Very happy with these.  Makes easy work of it.  Wish I&#x27;d had these about 30 years ago.  UPDATED 12/18/16:  Don&#x27;t waste your money.  Junked and tossed out.  These worked well for about one year, but have lost their temper and can no longer transmit enough pressure to cut.  Aside from that, the unit frequently popped apart and could only be put back together with a pair of pliers and a lot of patience.</li>
            <li> Does not work any better than regular nail clipper.</li>
            <li> I will be returning this because the opening is too narrow to allow my toenail to fit in.  It might cut very well but I cannot know!</li>
            <li> I have tried a lot of similar products, and this one is by far the best.&lt;br /&gt;As they say, try it you&#x27;ll like it.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical because I don&#x27;t understand the mechanics? But the finger on my left hand was damaged in an accident and could no longer exert pressure on regular nail clippers. Decided to give these a try. They work beautifully. Want to give some to everyone I know with arthritic hands!</li>
            <li> OMG. I adore these. Life changing….</li>
            <li> Cutting edges are very sharp and leave the nail edges smooth - no need to file or sand.  Very good leverage and great control - these would be good for a person with limited finger strength and/or hand control.  I normally used the Revlon brand clippers but now this is my favorite.</li>
            <li> they make cutting finger nails more convenient, however they aren&#x27;t the sturdy all purpose clippers as advertised. They can&#x27;t cut my toe nails...</li>
            <li> Purchased for elderly relative who has arthritic hands. She is able to use these without assistance.</li>
            <li> Wonderful little invention. Works very well. The swivel head doesn&#x27;t move fluidly as I expected, but it doesn&#x27;t need to.  Just having an angle of any kind (as seen in the product photo) makes it MUCH easier to clip nails. You don&#x27;t have to twist your arm and wrist just to work your way around the fingernail.</li>
            <li> This clipper worked better than I anticipated. They are very sharp and have good leverage.</li>
            <li> Item arrived as stated.</li>
            <li> I bought these for my husband and he is very happy with them.  His toenails are very thick and trimming them has always been quite a chore.  No more!</li>
            <li> These are curved rather than straight, I was looking for wide, straight cut clippers. These won&#x27;t work for me, but a great product if you nails aren&#x27;t super thick.</li>
            <li> I used this and it&#x27;s decent. I have no complaints and the long handle does help. Positioning the head was simple and the nail clippers work as promised. The steel seems to be well made so I have no concern about how long these will last, but I am confident they will last me a lifetime.</li>
            <li> Will not cut my toe nail!</li>
            <li> doesn&#x27;t produce clean edges, blade must not be clean or sharp enough for a clean cut.</li>
            <li> These are great! the head swivels so you can comfortably cut your nails and see what you are doing.  Because of the length of the handle it is  effortless. I don&#x27;t have trouble with my hands but could see these clippers being easy to use for someone who does. It was a good purchase.</li>
            <li> Good set of clippers.  Very sturdy and strong.  The rotating makes it much easier to handle and to see precisely what you&#x27;re doing.</li>
            <li> Spin Snips Precision Nail Clipper are the best nail clippers I have ever had.  I feel like everytime I go to the store I&#x27;m purchasing nail clippers.  They never seem to be sharp or sturdy enough to hold up in our house.  I hate when dull clippers leave jagged edges and cracks in my nails.  Not with these clippers.  These clippers are very sharp and will cut easily through even my husbands thick toe nails leaving a nice even clean cut edge. They have a swivel head for easy clipping at awkward angles.  The handles are longer than most clippers and easy to control. They are good for left and right handed use.  Once you try these you will never go back to cheap drugstore clippers.  I purchased this set of clippers during a promotion for quality testing and review.  Great product!</li>
            <li> Interesting design.  Works well.</li>
            <li> This product really is outstanding. I have a repaired lower back that is not able to be bent, limiting my ability to bend over. This product gave me the ability to reach further. It really works!</li>
            <li> Really, have you ever seen anything so intelligent?  My carpal tunnel issues have made me crazy when clipping my nails and when I saw this I just thought it was insanely smart.  And the shipping was super fast!</li>
            <li> A clever design that allows for easier clipping. However, the shape of the blade usually results in cutting the skin near the edges of the nails as well. Maybe I have weird nails but I can&#x27;t find a way to avoid this. Others seem to have better luck with these.</li>
            <li> I bought these for my husband and he loves them.&lt;br /&gt;Everything I was expecting</li>
            <li> Exactly as advertised. Shipped on time.</li>
            <li> Excellent solution for anyone who has dexterity or hand strength issues.  These clippers work very well.  I highly recommend them.</li>
            <li> I have not had the time to check out all features. Everythingvtried so far is top notch.</li>
            <li> Clever. but still had to press harder than I expected</li>
            <li> Very Good!&lt;br /&gt;They help me cut my tough toe nails better than anything else I&#x27;ve tried.  Nothing will ever make the experience easy, but these at least get the job done well.</li>
            <li> Did not cut well. Sorry I bought it. Was it made in China?</li>
            <li> Great product - quick delivery</li>
            <li> There are the best nail clipper ever, nice size, very sharp and with the turning head it makes a great nail clipper.</li>
            <li> takes time to get used to</li>
            <li> great quality and very versatile product.</li>
            <li> I love this clipper. Husband has his eye on it now too. It&#x27;s MINE:))) The two best things about it is 1) It allows me to reach a difficult to cut small toe nail that up until now often required me to ask someone for help. Who wants to ask for help as an adult? 2) It has sharp easy action clippers that meet and snip the nail as you want. No slivers left or shredded or poor cuts at all. Just what I want.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now they need to make a straight edged clipper that&#x27;s identical in every way to this one but instead of the traditional curved clipper blades it needs to be straight across. Then my husband would definitely want one. Right now I&#x27;m not worried he&#x27;ll make off with it because he prefers the straight cutters and that is how I found this for me. I ordered him a new straight cut one when I searched this came up and I went OHHH LA LA LA...it might work for me. And it does. The mechanism cuts precise as it&#x27;s described and name implies. And the swivel feature is wonderful and fits even my small hands. I wear a small womens glove. It&#x27;s a bit larger than you might be used to it is as big as the larger toe nail clippers and I would appreciate a finger nail sized one too actually. So if maker reads this...I double dare you to make these two other designs and see just how well they catch on? :)))) Thanks for this one though.&lt;br /&gt;PS: I do not have thick nails. In fact the opposite. VERY VERY THIN nails that split vertically. I must keep them very short both fingers and toe nails to help prevent the splits that can run the whole length down to the base of the nails. Very painful. This clipper is as ideal to helping clip them close and get a clean cut across the nail and the leverage and control the mechanism gives you helps with this as much as the cutting edge itself does. So I can&#x27;t speak about tough or thick nails. However my husband who does have thick nails found these to do a nice job but he does prefer the straight edge to the curved ones. If they had one he would have one in the snap of his fingers:)))have one in the snap of his fingers:)))</li>
            <li> A superior product.  Very sharp and easy to manipulate. The swivel action is extremely handy, especially for toenails.</li>
            <li> Very clever design. Easy to operate and very effective and much easier than using conventional nail scissors.</li>
            <li> Great Product, as one gets older it becomes more difficult to keep you toe nails trimmed, this clipper makes it so much easier. A must have to keep your nails looking good and healthy.</li>
            <li> These are the best dang nail clippers i have ever used and they are easy for my mom and dad to use</li>
            <li> Great product.  Can now do my own toenails.</li>
            <li> When I was a young kid on a farm some 70 years ago, (I&#x27;m 84 now) my toes were frostbitten.  They managed to save my toes but all of my nails turned black and came off.  When they grew back in they were at least twice as thick and highly curved so that I couldn&#x27;t clip them in a normal fashion with either type of nail clippers (regular clippers or the side nipper variety).  To do so would cause the nail to flatten out and cut into the flesh of my toes.  I had to go to a podiatrist about every three months and they don&#x27;t work cheap.  He would first numb my toes and then clip them.  This worked but it caused wounds on each side of each nail that had to be dealt with.  To trim my nails at home requires at least six nips per toe, a feat that was impossible with regular clippers and I no longer have the strength in my hands to use the side nippers.  These clippers made the job at least possible, if not easy.  If I would improve them I would make the jaws open just a little more and add another inch to the handles for more leverage but such an animal doesn&#x27;t exist.  Until they do, these work fine.</li>
            <li> The clippers could be a bit more sharp, but all in all the design works well.</li>
            <li> These are terrific nail clippers!  Who knew one would feel like singing praises of such a pedestrian item, but these are far superior to any clippers I&#x27;ve used in the past.  The swivel design makes it easy to approach from any angle, the longer handles give good leverage, and most impressively, the cuts it makes are clean and smooth.  Very impressed and pleased.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t work. Awkward to use and there is no leverage.</li>
            <li> These are Great, super sharp.  The pivot head stays in the selected position, no worries of it moving while in use.</li>
            <li> This is a well made clipper and works beautifully. But when I left it on a wet counter for few hours it dripped rust from the bent part (shows tiny cracks) next to the blades. I am very disappointed because it works so well otherwise. Not worth the hassle of returning as long as I keep it away from water.. but still disappointed..</li>
            <li> It is smaller than I expected.  I was hoping the &amp;#34;jaws&amp;#34; were wider for my big toe nails.  But it seem to work well.  If the unit was just a litle larger overall, it would be easier to handle for me because of reduced feeling in my hands.  For average person, it probably rank higher.  The hands in the photo must have small hands!</li>
            <li> I love these clippers! I wish I would have found these years ago. I received a pair of these clippers in a gift box so it&#x27;s great for a gift. It has a modern design and doesn&#x27;t look like any other. They are stainless steel and heavy duty. The clippers fit my hand perfectly and the rotating head makes it so much easier to clip your finger nails and toe nails. These will make your manicure and pedicure go by a lot faster. They are very sharp and will cut your nails perfectly. Your nails will have a clean cut and they don&#x27;t even need to be filed. For different angels, you can leave the head straight or you can rotate it in any direction. The clippers fold back up together for easy storage and does not take up much space at all. They are longer than most pairs of clippers which makes it very easy to hold. I normally like to buy cheap clippers but never last long at all. They are usually small and thin and always break really fast. They definitely are not cheap and are well worth the money. These clippers will last a very long time. It&#x27;s worth the money to invest in the clippers! I received this product in exchange for my honest, unbiased opinion. I am trilled that I got the opportunity to try these because they absolutely wonderful for a nail fanatic like me.</li>
            <li> Purchased this because it stated it could trim the thickest nails, however, it is exactly the same capacity as standard drugstore issue, and did not come close to being able to trim thick nails. I was going to return it, but got ill, and unable to send it back in time.  Not happy at all with this item.</li>
            <li> Finally clippers that work easy no matter what way you want to cut your nails... I wasn&#x27;t exactly sure why I would need swivel head clippers but one just wouldn&#x27;t understand unless you buy and use them...they come in a cute little box so if you wanted to give them as a gift they are ready to wrap... They are not just thrown in a messy box etc.. I think they would be great for an elderly parent who wants to still clip there nails.. the handle takes less pressure to clip them...</li>
            <li> great nail clipper! sharp enough to cut my nail prefect... very comfortable to use</li>
            <li> Great Nail Clippers I have ever seen!  What a wonderful idea for the swivel head, would have never thought just a small change like that would make all of the difference.  It is so much easier to cut both finger and toe nails now.  Very heavy metal.  Am so glad I was able to review these. The only thing that I would love to see added is the file/nail cleaner. Other than that I am very pleased.  Quick delivery.</li>
            <li> Awesome service. This is a must have product, the best Nail Clippers ever!! Buy it you and you will throw your old clippers away.</li>
            <li> Surprised that these clippers worked as promised!</li>
            <li> Awesome set of clippers. A little pricey but they are very sharp and worth the money.  Great for getting all angles also.</li>
            <li> Really nice clippers. I have thoracic outlet syndrome caused by an extra rib squeezing a nerve near my neck; this has caused a significant loss of muscle in my left hand. Regular nail clippers have become nearly impossible for me to use. These clippers, however, offer me great control.</li>
            <li> Excellent tool-very handy</li>
            <li> Like the concept, all metal, but it just fell apart on the second use. A pin holds the clipper and handles together. It is not welded so it can swivel. But it just came undone and I can not get it back together. Not like the clippers we all use for 30 years or until we lose them.</li>
            <li> For me it is perfect, as soon as my husband try it I may get some more.&lt;br /&gt;Great, I have trouble with my hands and that help me a lot</li>
            <li> These nail clippers are great for cutting nails at an angle. I had a hard time before these clippers clipping my nails and my son&#x27;s nails at an angle. Now with these clippers I can turn the head of the clippers and cut in many different directions. It has made clipping mine and my son&#x27;s nails much easier. If you have trouble clipping your nails at an angle, these are the clippers for you. They would make a great gift too.</li>
            <li> What a brilliant design!  I can see exactly what I&#x27;m doing without having to make repeated clips.  Oddly, the full metal handle is comfortable to hold and the holes allow for a firm grip so the clipper doesn&#x27;t slip while in use.  I am very impressed with how sharp the blade is, and how I had no difficulty cutting through my nails.  The money I am saving in manicures will certainly be a boon.  I&#x27;m definitely going to recommend the SpinSnips to friends whose eyesight and grip are not what they used to be.</li>
            <li> Sharp, precise, easy wielding and solidly built. Can&#x27;t ask for anything more in a nail clipper. Cuts awesome and is easy to use.</li>
            <li> I really like these  clippers.  They are easy to hold and they to a great job.  My nails are harder now that I am older and these clippers are a God send for me.  I always had to go to the salon before; now I&#x27;m doing my own pedicures!!!  Thanks for the chance to try these at a reduced price.  On a fixed income I can&#x27;t always take advantage of things I&#x27;d like to try</li>
            <li> The product is great and use it all the time. I like those better than regular nail clipper cuz easy for me to hold the handle. Great product!</li>
            <li> Best pair of nail clippers!</li>
            <li> NICE, GREAT TOOLS. THANK YOU.</li>
            <li> Fabulous and clever nail clipper.  My husband bought a pair for his mother who has weak hands and trouble trimming her toenails.  Once I saw them, I was fascinated at such a clever invention!  Ordered a pair for myself right away and LOVE THEM!  I get so annoyed trying to trim my left hand nails and often resort to filing away forever to get them trimmed down so they are not daggers.  These allow you to clip off the ends quickly and then you can file just a little to even out the ends.  Wish I had invented these years ago - great for older folks with weak hands AND younger adults who are not ambidextrous!</li>
            <li> Best clippers we&#x27;ve ever had and we&#x27;ve tried many.  Definitely recommend these.</li>
            <li> This clipper is awkward to use and doesn&#x27;t open up enough for thick toenails. My old drugstore cheapie does a better job and opens wider.</li>
            <li> Only thing I&#x27;ve found that aids in clipping nails on feet.  I have disability &amp; looked for several years trying every pair of clippers I could find. These r very helpful- only wish they were about an inch longer</li>
            <li> I thought I&#x27;d love them and they are easy to squeeze BUT you can get your nail in there right and they cut leaving a ragged mess. How did they get these reviews?</li>
            <li> exceeded expectations, this was first time in years i could cut my own toenails without assistance.&lt;br /&gt;would reccommend these clippers to anyone</li>
            <li> I like wife doesn&#x27;t needs greater mouth opening</li>
            <li> Thought it had a straight edge. Was looking specfically for a straight edge toe nail clipper. It works for my smaller toes, not 100 percent happy with cut of big toes because of the curve.</li>
            <li> I have arthritis in my hands which made the use of standard nail clippers very difficult.  I was searching for longer clippers that would provide more leverage and chose these.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These have beautifully fit the bill.  They are well made and very sharp.  The rotating head assures that I can get the angle the works best.  The act of clipping is very easy compared with my old, shorter, clippers.  They cut like butter, as the saying goes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was concerned that the cutters themselves are wider and straighter than the standard finger nail clipper, making them usable for toenails as well.  But putting the proper curve on finger nails proved to be easy.</li>
            <li> Awesome clippers for cutting toe nails, at any angle!</li>
            <li> Good for old fingers that have lost some strength.</li>
            <li> Super fat shipping. Bought as a gift, so can&#x27;t really rate the performance. Will add it aftr the recipient uses the product</li>
            <li> After many years of regular clippers it felt odd to use these at a right angle.  The idea makes sense but I didn&#x27;t like them as much as I thought I would and they cost several times more than a regular clipper.  The metal also seemed thinner and more flexible than I thought it should be.  Also they can still come apart like other clippers if twisted the wrong way.  A good idea but not really worth the extra money.</li>
            <li> Nice idea, but for me the cutting edges do not open wide enough for thickened toenails. The answer may be to use a pumice stone everyday so that the nails don&#x27;t get so thick.</li>
            <li> The Spin Snips is definately an interesting design for a nail clipper. It&#x27;s is large enough for easy handling and control and it has a nice swivel head to clip. I found out out that the swivel head portion of it really clips the smaller toenails the best because on the big hard toenail it didn&#x27;t want to clip easily. To use it as a standard toe nail clipper with out the spin works even better because it&#x27;s stronger and has more control. But the Spin Snips does it&#x27;s job pretty well so I&#x27;m pleased.</li>
            <li> When I first got these and were looking at them in the package, I was worried that they were going to be really heavy to hold, but they aren&#x27;t!  I love how they swivel and there is a long enough handle to hold them with.  Honestly these are the best clippers I think I&#x27;ve owned.  They are good for fingernails and toenails.  They are also not hard to press.  Some clippers you have to be extremely strong to be able to use them.  Not with these.</li>
            <li> These are amazing tools. If you are right or left handed... perfect and easy to use.”</li>
            <li> I actually purchased these for my father, to put as a gift in his Christmas stocking. I have never seen a pair of clippers with a swivel head and wasn&#x27;t really sure what the advantage would be, but, after having used them myself, I LOVE them. As a lefty, it is sometimes hard to get those corners on my nails, but, with the swivel head it makes it a breeze. My father loves them because he has really thick toe nails and it&#x27;s hard for him to reach them, but, with the long handle and with the swivel head, it makes it so much easier for him. He doesn&#x27;t have to get someone else to cut them for him and they don&#x27;t leave ragged edges that have to be filed down. I will definitely be ordering a couple more of these, as I think several people in my family would love them. I would recommend them for anyone that has really thick nails as well as anyone who struggles to reach their toes. I was also very happy that they arrived before the shipping date of Dec. 29th and actually arrived the day before Christmas Eve.</li>
            <li> Revolutionary new design which may take a significent nitch out of the usual and customary clipper market. I used these clippers for the first time today and found their angular trajectory and increased leverage power much easier to use on thicker toenails. I found the blade plenty sharp for a nice clean cut and this clipper appears to be sufficiently rugged to outlast my lifetime. You are able to quickly and easily convert your clipping activity from your left hand to your right hand with a simple rotation of the clippers business end. I also intend to purchase one for my elderly mother as a gift as I believe it would help her handling and aim”</li>
            <li> I have what is known as hammer thumbs, and am a senior citizen, which means my nails are becoming more brittle and thick. These clippers work great on all digits, both hands and feet, and cut with a minimum amount of pressure needed. The large holes on the handle make it MUCH easier for these old hands to clip nails. I have lost big and little toe nails several times (due to dropping construction materials or tools on them, or having them run over) This makes the new toe nails come in with a very hard and close area to clip because the nail hugs the toe more closely than the old nail did. These clippers worked great on even these toes! Even with a broken middle finger I was able to get enough pressure to comfortably clip my other hand and toes. I can honestly say that these are the only clippers that will allow me to use both hands comfortably to trim my nails. I have only used them 3 times so far, and will let all know how long they last!</li>
            <li> I am very satisfied with these nail trimmers, they are very sharp and precise.</li>
            <li> The best one I have ever had &amp; used!&lt;br /&gt;Very easy to clip nails &amp; toenails all the same!&lt;br /&gt;Highly Recommend this one!</li>
            <li> I rarely review products since I personally feel I am not paid to help advertise or otherwise promote them. However, this product is a godsend for me.  I suffer from carpal tunnel and diabetic neuropathy especially in my right hand and working with the small clippers you get at drug stores or discount places became a real nuisance. They kept slipping out of my hand and made nail trimming a real chore.  These clippers are fantastic! I can rotate the handles to just the right angle for best leverage and easily trim fingernails.  What a great invention!  As a diabetic I will not try them on toenails.  I learned the hard way, after suffering a life threatening toe infection, that diabetics must leave foot care to a skilled podiatric surgeon.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t receive this for free or a discounted price like some reviews.  I am a consumer looking for a good pair of nail clippers. I am disappointed in these.  First off, it is a very weak cut, the mechanics of these cutters don&#x27;t pack strength behind the cut whether cutting straight-on or turning them at a different cutting angle. Second, the cut isn&#x27;t a clean cut; maybe the blades aren&#x27;t sharp.  Seems to take a lot of effort to cut through a thin nail and then doesn&#x27;t leave the cut clean...needs to have a nail file clean it up.  Not happy with these but I&#x27;ll keep them in case I lose my cheapy Walgreen&#x27;s ones again.</li>
            <li> This nail trimmer works great.  Can be adjusted to almost any angle, so you can see what you are cutting, and no hand cramps.  Cuts nails easily with the long levers.  Requires less pressure than normal trimmers.  Love it.  Might buy another one for my travel bag.</li>
            <li> Nice idea but it fell apart when I took it out of the box.  Don&#x27;t waste your money!</li>
            <li> The GREATEST pair of nail clippers I have ever purchased thank you Precision Living!!</li>
            <li> Very well made and clever design. Works great! A wonderful addition to you accessories.</li>
            <li> WOW ! THIS WAS MORE THAN WHAT I HAVE EXPECTED , ALSO HELPS GREATLY WHEN USING IT FOR MY TOES , I DON&#x27;T HAVE TO BE TWISTING AND SNIPPING ON THE BLIND . I CAN EASILY SEE EVERYTHING THAT I&#x27;M DOING .</li>
            <li> This clipper is very sharp and has a good quality feel.  I expect to use it for years to come.</li>
            <li> Pretty easy to use but, you have to realign the position of the ends often to get the best grip.</li>
            <li> Not worth the money as they are no better than the regular large ones.</li>
            <li> Great product and  with the added lever length and variable direction----easy to use.</li>
            <li> great idea! but the levers are little too soft to cut through my toe nails and  the blades should open up just slightly.</li>
            <li> Thought it was.a.great idea but broke.almost immediately</li>
            <li> IT&#x27;S LONG ENOUGH, STRONG ENOUGH, AND SHARP ENOUGH TO DO THE JOB.&lt;br /&gt;IT&#x27;S BY FAR THE BEST CLIPPER I&#x27;VE TRIED, AND I&#x27;VE TRIED A LOT.&lt;br /&gt;THE OTHERS HAVE BEEN TOO SMALL, NOT ENOUGH GRIP, AND GET DULL QUICKLY.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;VE ONLY HAD IT FOR A WEEK, SO I HAVE NO IDEA HOW LONG IT WILL STAY SHARP.&lt;br /&gt;BUT, SO FAR, SO GOOD.&lt;br /&gt;DAVID DEL CONTE</li>
            <li> These are some of the neatest nail clippers I have ever seen or even owned. They turn 360 degrees making it so there is no more awkward positions to cut your nails. They are very comfortable to hold onto and use. They have a nice curve in the handle that helps with handling them easier along with longer handles on them. They are super sharp I have very thick toe nails and usually end up with jagged nails as my other clippers struggle to clip my toe nails. Not these nail clippers they went right through them no problem. I received these nail clippers at a discounted rate for my honest unbiased review. I will be greatly sad if these ever come up missing, they are the best clippers I have owned yet. So easy to use and sharp enough to go through my thick toe nails. Every household should have a pair.</li>
            <li> The Spin Snips Nail Clipper was a real disappointment. The cutting tool was not wide enough so I could fit the nail into it. In trying to use the tool I cut into my toe and now I can&#x27;t where shoes for a week. I was and not happy with this item and would never order it again.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t open wide enough but the turning feature makes it easy to use with arthritis.</li>
            <li> “A thoughtful design, easy to use, and SHARP cutter, which is most important to me. I would recommend to a friend or relative, for sure.”</li>
            <li> After reading a couple of comments about what would seem to be occasional quality control issues with these clippers, I decided to wait until I had used them a few times to write a review.  So far I have had no problems with the clippers&#x27; breaking, although apparently a very small number of people have.  My initial impression, that I love these clippers, has not altered as I&#x27;ve used them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have very weak hands as a result of a serious illness.  My fingers are not strong enough to work ordinary drug store clippers, or even slightly longer clippers with more leverage. I decided to try these SpinSnips.  I was delighted to find I could grasp the handles on these clippers with my whole hand, like a pair of pliers, adjust the cutting angle and cut my nails! I really am very pleased to have this problem solved.  I showed the Spinsnips to my occupational therapist and she was quite impressed.  She predicted that these clippers will solve a problem for lots of people.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update:  My clippers fell apart after approximately a year and a half.  I contacted Precision Services Global asking for a replacement, and received the following note:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#34;Thank you for reaching out to us and letting us know of the problem you encountered with the SpinSnips. We have had a few cases of this happening with them due to a manufacture&#x27;s defect and we are sorry you were one of the ones this happened to. We will gladly send you another set of SpinSnips to replace the broken ones. Thanks again for contacting us and also for leaving a product review.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received the replacement SpinSnips along with an additional smaller SpinSnips.  Precision Services Global is a company that stands behind their product and I appreciate that.</li>
            <li> These little clippers really surprised me.  I was expecting them to be weak, but they are very strong and cut through finger and toe nails easily.  The bending head is pretty cool too and definitely helps with angles.  My only minor complaint is that I wish the blade was a little wider.  No big deal.  So far so good with it and recommend it.</li>
            <li> When I first received this product, I didn&#x27;t think it would be much different from your average nail clipper. I didn&#x27;t think the ability to swivel would change much. Boy, was I wrong.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first thing I have to say about this nail clipper is that it&#x27;s rectangular in shape and a lot longer than your average nail clipper. I&#x27;ve used a ton of nail clippers in my past, and they all end up hurting my hand at some point because of their pointed ends when I try to cut off a thick toenail. Not only that, but the mini nail clippers I like to use for small uneven edges are too hard to handle and often slip too easily out of my grasp, resulting in damaged nails that still remained oddly shaped.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, with this nail clipper, it&#x27;s different. The rectangular shape gives my hand much more relief and is a lot more comfortable to the touch. The cool steel feels nice against my hand, even when sweaty - and the length gives me much more room to relax my arm instead of holding it at an awkward angle for too long. I am able to get a firm grasp on the nail clippers while being assured I won&#x27;t cut too far or too little.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, the ability for it to rotate is the most important design of this clipper. With the rotation, I no longer have to sit or put my arm at awkward angles in order to try and cut my nails neatly. The nail clipper is able to swivel well while getting a tight grasp on my nail in order to cut it off cleanly. It&#x27;s extremely easy to use, and cuts through the thickest of nails. I always have had extremely tough toenails to the point where I thought I would have broken some of my old nail clippers, but they felt like goo when compared to the SnipSnips clipper! I&#x27;m extremely expressed by the quality and usefulness of the design.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Usually, I take almost a half hour trying to my own nails because I really like to cut my nails all off, to the smallest spec of white I can see. It&#x27;s a long process, and even then, my nails have to be filed down to look decent. However, with SnipSnips, I recorded a time of just ten minutes! They cut off my nails in a snap due to the slightly curved ends of the clipper, and I didn&#x27;t even need to file them (or if I did, it was very minimal to achieve a more apparent curve on my nails). I received this product at a discount but wasn&#x27;t required to review.The SnipSnips clipper creates a painless and hassle free nail clipping environment that I&#x27;m sure will be well appreciated among those who really care for their nails.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The package came in a clear box with a small cushion underneath, almost with a &amp;#34;cloud 9&amp;#34; feel haha, and I can honestly say, the unique design is the one fact that first strikes you when you get it. I highly recommend it to those who want to be able to easily clip their nails in a shorter time.</li>
            <li> LOVE LOVE LOVE these clippers! So useful to be able to swivel the clipper head around. you can not even imagine how useful that is until you have it in your hands. My hubby does not approve of much, but even he was impressed. His only issue was that the swivel head moved on him while he was using it but I didn&#x27;t have that problem at all. The quality of this is AMAZING, I could rave about it forever. Its such a nice clipper to have, im so happy I was given one to give my honest opinion on. The clippers clip strong and my husband says that he really likes that the clipping end seems to hold the clipped nails for you when you&#x27;ve clipped, so you dont have them flying around. These are a must have</li>
            <li> Easy to use. Perfect for arthritis fingers and hands. Love it. Negative (personal): too big for my finger nails.</li>
            <li> I purchased these clippers because of my problems with arthritis (more leverage &amp; less slip). They do not cut fingernails at all. They grab &amp; crimp, but do not cut..</li>
            <li> I needed a pair of clippers that I could use because of limited use of my dominate hand due to a disease and surgery. This is very easy to use for me. Longer handles give more leverage so cutting my nails much easier to do</li>
            <li> These are not only a fantastic device they are fully functional in design! I have big thumbs and with regular cutters I sometimes can not see where I am clipping, problem solved! Twist the head an there in plain view is the thumb.</li>
            <li> This thing works very well.  I actually received a defective unit first, though.  The best way I can describe it is that it didn&#x27;t &amp;#34;clip&amp;#34; so much as require you to &amp;#34;pinch and rip&amp;#34; off your nail most of the time.  It was worse than terrible, and since it has 4.7 stars, the only conclusion I could come up with was that I got a defective unit.  It looked sharp and seemed to close evenly so I have no idea what was wrong with it, but I sent it back and got a new one that works GREAT!  So if you run into the same problem, give it at least one more try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After decades of trimming my nails without a rotating head on the clipper, I am plenty used to that, so I don&#x27;t actually use the spin feature as much as I thought I would.  It would also be nice if it had a file/digger tool built in like other, cheaper clippers, but they are still very nice at what they do.  Maybe not $15 nice, but close.</li>
            <li> FINALLY!&lt;br /&gt;clipping my nails just got a lot easier! can&#x27;t get any easier than this. perfect angle every time however you want it!</li>
            <li> I love this little implement.  I have a disability that makes it quite difficult to reach my toes and this allows me the angle I need to properly cut my toenails.</li>
            <li> Did not think I would like them the Spintwists. Just a regular person after two uses I don&#x27;t see how I made out without the Spintwists. Nail clipper</li>
            <li> Love it and its everything It said it would be. It&#x27;s easy to use and the swivel helps reach my toes easily.</li>
            <li> Purchased these to replace some very old clippers my son had been using.  It was time for a replacement and I found these.  He used them used yesterday for both his fingernails and toenails and he liked that they cut the nail evenly and left a smooth finish.</li>
            <li> This clipper came in a pretty box with foam. This is a very interesting and practical idea. The swivel head is so easy to use specially for left handed people like me. I always find it difficult to clip my left hand nails, but this made them so easy. It cuts very neatly and precisely. Even my big toe nails were a breeze to clip. I gave them to my husband to use as his toe nails are very thick and he was very satisfied. The long handle are also very helpful. Very happy with this purchase.</li>
            <li> Love these.  The older one gets the harder it get to trim toe nails.  The swivel makes it easier and the large lightweight handles makes it much easier to hold.</li>
            <li> Save your money.  Product has a fundamental design flaw. It broke apart immediately on first use. It seemed like a good idea to me. I was disappointed by the poor quality of the central pin, particularly at the price.</li>
            <li> Fantastic nail clipper! I have been looking for an &amp;#34;angled&amp;#34; pair of clippers, I used to have a pair and they were great but they&#x27;ve disappeared, so I began hunting for another pair...and then I stumbled upon THIS little GEM, and it is wonderful!! You can use them on either toenails or fingernails, and either right or left-handed, since the tip swivels to either side, and it kind of &amp;#34;locks&amp;#34; into place when you get to the angle you want (it&#x27;s not just left or right, as it looks like in the pictures, there are notches in between straight left and top center and straight right and top center, if you get what I mean!). The clipper is very sharp and cuts concisely, it is not heavy at all, very easy to use and very well made! After I received my pair, I immediately ordered a pair for my employer, as she is handicapped and has difficulty using regular  &amp;#34;straight on&amp;#34; nail clippers, due to hand dexterity, and she is able to use these just fine! Will definitely order again and tell friends about them, they&#x27;re GREAT!! A little pricey, but WELL worth the money! Order a pair, you&#x27;ll love them!</li>
            <li> I love these nail clippers. I don&#x27;t know if you have ever tried to cut a toddlers nails but it&#x27;s nearly impossible!! The last thing they want to do is stay still! Lol These nail clippers helped me accomplish this painful task in a breeze. With the ability to move the Clippers in different angles I was able to cut even the tiniest of nails. Another great thing is that you can cut in more of a rounded tip instead of straight across like other clippers. This helps to prevent those pesky pointy ends that catch on all your clothes. I received these nail clippers at a reduceded price for my unbiased and honest opinion and would highly recommend to anyone with small kids or even with those hard to reach ingrown nails.</li>
            <li> I wish that I had known of this tool years ago - when the pain of arthritis began to limit my mobility. I keep it handy and I am considering ordering a second. I keep showing it to others and invite them to try it.</li>
            <li> I generally don&#x27;t post reviews but this item deserves it. I&#x27;ve had many clippers that either stop clipping or get broken. These are quality clippers that has a ingenious mechanism of rotating. Now, I&#x27;m able to clip evenly around each nail without any distress and with the length of the handle, there&#x27;s little effort in clipping toe nails. I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> &amp;#34;Fantastic! I&#x27;ve never been able to cut my nails as easily and as perfectly as I can with this nail clipper! I&#x27;d struggled with ordinary nail clippers since being diagnosed with MS 25 years ago. This modern design makes a huge difference. They&#x27;re more expensive than the typical drugstore nail clippers, but the benefits make the outlay very reasonable.&amp;#34;</li>
