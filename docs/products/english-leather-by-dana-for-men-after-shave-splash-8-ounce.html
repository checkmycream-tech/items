            <li>Great price for a large bottle of after shave.  </li>
            <li>have been using this product for a decade now and am absolutely satisfied.</li>
            <li>English Leather Aftershave by Dana has an excellent scent.  </li>

            <li>We both love the fragrance and like that we can easily get it on Amazon.</li>
            <li>Arrived quickly and packaged nice.</li>
            <li>I remembered that I received a bottle of English Leather as a gift many years ago and that I loved the smell!</li>
            <li>Great old time fragrance.</li>
            <li>so glad it is still available here.</li>
            <li>good price&amp; fast shipping</li>
            <li>Good quality for a reasonable price.</li>
            <li>This was a popular fragrance of the 60&#x27;s, and I have to say that trying  it again brought back a lot of pleasant memories</li>
            <li>He seems to love the rich scent.</li>
            <li>Love the fresh leathery scent!</li>
            <li>Very quick turn around getting product to me.</li>
            <li>The item was shipped very quickly &amp; the packaging was done well</li>
            <li>OLD FASHIONED FRAGRANCE WHICH IS PLEASING TO THE SMELL AND GOOD TO BE ABLE TO FIND IT</li>
            <li>As for me, the lotion works fine</li>
            <li>As we age our memories may not always be accurate, but the &#x27;group think&#x27; on this one</li>
            <li>The seller was fast and effective.</li>
            <li>Great simple fragrance for men and women</li>
            <li>and I enjoy the consequences.</li>
            <li>Shipped free</li>
            <li>English Leather has kept her happy for over 30 years.</li>
            <li>I  have been using it for a few decades &amp; it is the very best there is.</li>
            <li>this product is the original.</li>
            <li>not at all like the original scent.</li>
            <li>Made in China, does not smell like original.</li>
            <li>It smells clean and is not overpowering.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The deodorant stick is not the same or good as the original Dana product.</li>
            <li>Still love the classic smell!</li>
            <li>Nice change from the Wild Country he used to wear</li>
            <li>Very greatful this is still available!</li>
            <li>But the price for this amount, which is a larger bottle than I have ever seen in stores, was good and it came quickly in the mail.</li>
            <li>Clean, fresh smelling.</li>
            <li>Came quickly.</li>
            <li>is that the old fragrance was more attractive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve always liked English Leather.  </li>
            <li>I liked it, but my wife said it smelled like lighter fluid.</li>
            <li>and i see why i had a lot of bumps and it has cleared them right up thank you</li>
            <li>I have always loved smelling this on my dad since I was a little girl.  </li>
            <li>This product was given to a friend and was exactly what he wanted.</li>
            <li>But this is the first time I ordered it through Amazon.</li>
            <li>Have used English Leather for years and me  and the wife love it.</li>
            <li>Exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li>Should have checked Amazon first.</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>This product has a nice fragrance without a bitter after smell.</li>
            <li>I love English Leather.</li>
            <li>After Shave for my husband, we&#x27;ve been married 45 years</li>
            <li>English Leather has always been my favorite After Shave.</li>
            <li>I first used this product 37 years ago, with positive comments from dates and girlfriends.  </li>
            <li>Other than the above, the price is omigod higher than in the days of yore, but Amazon&#x27;s price is the best around (big surprise).</li>
            <li>First aftershave I have ordered online w/o knowing anything about it really.</li>
            <li>The price is also right; the bottle is formidable with its square, masculine shape and its earthy, wooden, screw on top.</li>
            <li>The smell is about the same as I remembered from back in the day, but it does seem to fade more quickly.</li>
            <li>A little more potent than I remembered, especially for an aftershave.</li>
            <li>too much pours out into your hand.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used it my whole life, so when I ran out I got worried.</li>
            <li>Game on time and a great bargain for 8 oz.</li>
            <li>Longtime user who appreciates the speedy delivery and reasonable price.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t really care for it</li>
            <li>I really use it for her.</li>
            <li>Was packed very well and had no issues with breaking or leaking.</li>
            <li>I really like the smell of this after shave</li>
            <li>The product that I received does NOT smell like the original English Leather.  </li>
            <li>It is a musky, unique scent that is definitely &amp;#34;for men only.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>After the product arrived, I opened the bottle...and immediately memories of special occasions and female faces surfaced.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Still, the new version is quite usable and the asking price was reasonable; I&#x27;ll use it until it&#x27;s gone but</li>
            <li>Dad&#x27;s favourite - a classic</li>
            <li>The main problem is getting it out...</li>
            <li>Classic barbershop smells.</li>
            <li>I like many different aftershaves but still come back to this one</li>
            <li>A classic.</li>
            <li>I recommend this product highly.</li>
            <li>This product is nothing more than water with a little bit of perfume in it.</li>
            <li>It must have been a really old stock -- all the fragrance had evaporated away, leaving a very smelly box and just yellow-colored water with no scent inside the bottle.</li>
            <li>I new</li>
            <li>This aftershave has been my favorite for a long, long time.</li>
            <li>It has a different logo than the original Dana product which used the English riding saddle.</li>
            <li>Less rich.</li>
            <li>Smells great, but the bottle is awkward to use without spilling it.</li>
            <li>I have been using the product for at least 10 years and it is my favorite.</li>
            <li>It makes me feel like England&#x27;s King Henry II when I splash it on my face after shaving with my dagger in the early morning.  </li>
            <li>An old comfort for an old man.  </li>
            <li>Overall I am very content with the purchase.</li>
            <li>I remember this aftershave from the 1960&#x27;s and believe me, this product is not like it was in the &amp;#34;good old days&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>She persuaded me to give up on my old Lilac Pinaud, which my Father used before me.</li>
            <li>A favorite of mine since the the late 70&#x27;s</li>
            <li>This is a product that is getting harder and harder to find in the stores and it&#x27;s my husbands favorite.</li>
            <li>My husband has tried numerous other after-shave lotions but inevitably returns to the old favorite.  </li>
            <li>I recently received my order of English Leather deodorent stick, and upon opening  the cap I discoverd  that this product didn&#x27;t remotely resemble the fine scent of English Leather, rather it smelled more like alcohol with a slight scent of fragrance, Whats up with this??</li>
            <li>It lasts barely 15 minutes.</li>
            <li>Since I was a young man I have used English Leather and continue to use it.  </li>
            <li>have verified my opinion by asking several family members for their independent opinions and they agree - the new formula is close but not quite close enough.  </li>
            <li>As for this particular one, it is larger than I expected.</li>

            <li> Great simple fragrance for men and women</li>
            <li> and I enjoy the consequences.</li>
            <li> Shipped free</li>
            <li> English Leather has kept her happy for over 30 years.</li>
            <li> I  have been using it for a few decades &amp; it is the very best there is.</li>
            <li> this product is the original.</li>
            <li> not at all like the original scent.</li>
            <li> Made in China, does not smell like original.</li>
            <li> It smells clean and is not overpowering.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The deodorant stick is not the same or good as the original Dana product.</li>
            <li> Still love the classic smell!</li>
            <li> Nice change from the Wild Country he used to wear</li>
            <li> Very greatful this is still available!</li>
            <li> But the price for this amount, which is a larger bottle than I have ever seen in stores, was good and it came quickly in the mail.</li>
            <li> Clean, fresh smelling.</li>
            <li> Came quickly.</li>
            <li> is that the old fragrance was more attractive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always liked English Leather.  </li>
            <li> I liked it, but my wife said it smelled like lighter fluid.</li>
            <li> and i see why i had a lot of bumps and it has cleared them right up thank you</li>
            <li> I have always loved smelling this on my dad since I was a little girl.  </li>
            <li> This product was given to a friend and was exactly what he wanted.</li>
            <li> But this is the first time I ordered it through Amazon.</li>
            <li> Have used English Leather for years and me  and the wife love it.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li> Should have checked Amazon first.</li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> This product has a nice fragrance without a bitter after smell.</li>
            <li> I love English Leather.</li>
            <li> After Shave for my husband, we&#x27;ve been married 45 years</li>
            <li> English Leather has always been my favorite After Shave.</li>
            <li> I first used this product 37 years ago, with positive comments from dates and girlfriends.  </li>
            <li> Other than the above, the price is omigod higher than in the days of yore, but Amazon&#x27;s price is the best around (big surprise).</li>
            <li> First aftershave I have ordered online w/o knowing anything about it really.</li>
            <li> The price is also right; the bottle is formidable with its square, masculine shape and its earthy, wooden, screw on top.</li>
            <li> The smell is about the same as I remembered from back in the day, but it does seem to fade more quickly.</li>
            <li> A little more potent than I remembered, especially for an aftershave.</li>
            <li> too much pours out into your hand.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it my whole life, so when I ran out I got worried.</li>
            <li> Game on time and a great bargain for 8 oz.</li>
            <li> Longtime user who appreciates the speedy delivery and reasonable price.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t really care for it</li>
            <li> I really use it for her.</li>
            <li> Was packed very well and had no issues with breaking or leaking.</li>
            <li> I really like the smell of this after shave</li>
            <li> The product that I received does NOT smell like the original English Leather.  </li>
            <li> It is a musky, unique scent that is definitely &amp;#34;for men only.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> After the product arrived, I opened the bottle...and immediately memories of special occasions and female faces surfaced.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Still, the new version is quite usable and the asking price was reasonable; I&#x27;ll use it until it&#x27;s gone but</li>
            <li> Dad&#x27;s favourite - a classic</li>
            <li> The main problem is getting it out...</li>
            <li> Classic barbershop smells.</li>
            <li> I like many different aftershaves but still come back to this one</li>
            <li> A classic.</li>
            <li> I recommend this product highly.</li>
            <li> This product is nothing more than water with a little bit of perfume in it.</li>
            <li> It must have been a really old stock -- all the fragrance had evaporated away, leaving a very smelly box and just yellow-colored water with no scent inside the bottle.</li>
            <li> I new</li>
            <li> This aftershave has been my favorite for a long, long time.</li>
            <li> It has a different logo than the original Dana product which used the English riding saddle.</li>
            <li> Less rich.</li>
            <li> Smells great, but the bottle is awkward to use without spilling it.</li>
            <li> I have been using the product for at least 10 years and it is my favorite.</li>
            <li> It makes me feel like England&#x27;s King Henry II when I splash it on my face after shaving with my dagger in the early morning.  </li>
            <li> An old comfort for an old man.  </li>
            <li> Overall I am very content with the purchase.</li>
            <li> I remember this aftershave from the 1960&#x27;s and believe me, this product is not like it was in the &amp;#34;good old days&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> She persuaded me to give up on my old Lilac Pinaud, which my Father used before me.</li>
            <li> A favorite of mine since the the late 70&#x27;s</li>
            <li> This is a product that is getting harder and harder to find in the stores and it&#x27;s my husbands favorite.</li>
            <li> My husband has tried numerous other after-shave lotions but inevitably returns to the old favorite.  </li>
            <li> I recently received my order of English Leather deodorent stick, and upon opening  the cap I discoverd  that this product didn&#x27;t remotely resemble the fine scent of English Leather, rather it smelled more like alcohol with a slight scent of fragrance, Whats up with this??</li>
            <li> It lasts barely 15 minutes.</li>
            <li> Since I was a young man I have used English Leather and continue to use it.  </li>
            <li> have verified my opinion by asking several family members for their independent opinions and they agree - the new formula is close but not quite close enough.  </li>
            <li> As for this particular one, it is larger than I expected.</li>
            <li> Price is still a little high.</li>
            <li> I like to pour out about a quarter size of liquid into my hand and with this bottle it&#x27;s impossible to do that effectively.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a gift for some one who has been a lifelong friend and loves English Leather an can&#x27;t get it locally where he lives.</li>
            <li> HARD TO FIND ITEM AT A REASONABLE PRICE.</li>
            <li> Reviews for fragrances are, by default, highly subjective; what smells good to one person may smell terrible to another.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> days long gone</li>
            <li> The smell lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> I guess it should do me for a long time.</li>
            <li> It has the traditional woody scent, but that scent doesn&#x27;t linger very long and is gone within an hour or less.</li>
            <li> The cap on this was so tight I couldn&#x27;t get it off and thought about taking it back.</li>
            <li> smelly &#x27;manly&#x27;, but it really just smells like an old man that stinks and doesn&#x27;t know it.</li>
            <li> It is not available in the regular malls.</li>
            <li> This item can be bought locally but the size I ordered is not available.</li>
            <li> This product was everything I expected it would be.</li>
            <li> He uses other products, but he likes this one the best.&lt;br /&gt;.</li>
            <li> Not exactly like I remember from my youth</li>
            <li> English Leather is hard to find in stores these days.</li>
            <li> The after shave slips down the bottle&#x27;s side.</li>
            <li> I have used this product off and on for at least 60 years but it has gotten harder and harder to find since there is always something newer to choose from.</li>
            <li> It was either stuck or installed incredibly tight.</li>
            <li> A few months ago, my husband had been showing me the color and scent difference between the cologne and the aftershave.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> The only problem I have is that my friends tell me that it&#x27;s time to leave the 60&#x27;s behind.</li>
            <li> English Leather products are difficult to locate in our area.  </li>
            <li> And how can you go wrong with Dana English Leather after shave?</li>
            <li> I purchased this item for my husband&#x27;s Christmas present, it&#x27;s a nostalgic scent for hom</li>
            <li> I hated the smell of the cheap aftershave that my boyfriend was using, so I bought this for him.</li>
            <li> No more to say...why would I say something else...</li>
            <li> So hard to find this product.  </li>
            <li> Sometimes it is hard to find in Aftershave.  </li>
            <li> Hard to find, anymore.</li>
            <li> This product basically sucks.</li>
            <li> I have investigated other men&#x27;s colognes at Amazon and they also seem to be fake.</li>
            <li> It has no smell to it and seems like its been watered down and the slight odor you do get is very faint and does not smell like it used to.</li>
            <li> Not overpowering, but not so subtle you can&#x27;t smell it after 10 minutes of wear.</li>
            <li> How can you go wrong with Amazon prime?  </li>
            <li> Smells like baby powder and dirty diapers.</li>
            <li> But when it cooled it was almost impossible to get off again.</li>
            <li> It must be a knockoff to be this bad.</li>
            <li> and I have never been disappointed.</li>
            <li> I am very disappointed.</li>
            <li> I feel like Henry, rugged, manly, ruthless, and victorious in battle.  </li>
            <li> the worst I&#x27;ve used.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> This fragrance was one of my favorites 40 years ago.  Still is great, brings back wonderful memories of days long gone</li>
            <li> My dad has used this ever since I can remember, it was the perfect Father&#x27;s Day gift, he was very pleased.  Amazon has the best price I can find!</li>
            <li> have been using this product for a decade now and am absolutely satisfied. It is not available in the regular malls.</li>
            <li> Good product and service is good. Keep up the good work.</li>
            <li> Reviews for fragrances are, by default, highly subjective; what smells good to one person may smell terrible to another.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That being said I can only rate &amp;#34;English Leather By Dana as a four star after shave.  The product that I received does NOT smell like the original English Leather.  Something in this formula has changed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have verified my opinion by asking several family members for their independent opinions and they agree - the new formula is close but not quite close enough.  As we age our memories may not always be accurate, but the &#x27;group think&#x27; on this one is that the old fragrance was more attractive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Still, the new version is quite usable and the asking price was reasonable; I&#x27;ll use it until it&#x27;s gone but probably won&#x27;t repurchase.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As always, YMMV.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Regards,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Jim</li>
            <li> Great old time fragrance.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this fragrance for years and was very pleased that getting it on line is every bit as good as buying it in a store. It arrived in a timely manner and in good shape. I&#x27;m very pleased.</li>
            <li> This product was given to a friend and was exactly what he wanted.</li>
            <li> So hard to find this product.  A few months ago, my husband had been showing me the color and scent difference between the cologne and the aftershave.  I got him this aftershave when he said he was going to run out of it.  We both love the fragrance and like that we can easily get it on Amazon. It is a traditional fragrance for the traditional man.</li>
            <li> English Leather Aftershave by Dana has an excellent scent.  I don&#x27;t know why every man doesn&#x27;t use it. The perfect finish to a shave.</li>
            <li> Very good product enjoyable scent good quantity fair price</li>
            <li> I ordered this product a month ago. My credit card was charged instantly. But I still don&#x27;t have the product even a month later. I have been using the product for at least 10 years and it is my favorite. But this is the first time I ordered it through Amazon. I guess if I am a wise person, I should not order it using this channel.</li>
            <li> wonderful! my man always smells so good!;-)</li>
            <li> Great inexpensive liquid after shave lotion. Nostolgia smell and this product is the original. My wife finds it very pleasant too!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s nice to know some things don&#x27;t change.  My family has been using English Leather for over 43 years!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always liked English Leather.  The scent is not overpowering and it braces the skin quite well.  The price is also right; the bottle is formidable with its square, masculine shape and its earthy, wooden, screw on top. It makes me feel like England&#x27;s King Henry II when I splash it on my face after shaving with my dagger in the early morning.  I feel like Henry, rugged, manly, ruthless, and victorious in battle.  I am invincible.  No one can defeat me when I employ English Leather.  Hurrah, hurrooh, let&#x27;s have a cheer for English Leather, King Henry II, and the British Isles.</li>
            <li> Product works as described with no issues.</li>
            <li> Bought it for the hubs. He seems to love the rich scent. Arrived quickly and packaged nice. Woodsy scent. Not overpowering, but not so subtle you can&#x27;t smell it after 10 minutes of wear. Clean, fresh smelling. Nice change from the Wild Country he used to wear</li>
            <li> Have used English Leather for years and me  and the wife love it. Very quick turn around getting product to me.</li>
            <li> Always a great product at a good value price!</li>
            <li> My husband has tried numerous other after-shave lotions but inevitably returns to the old favorite.  The packaging has been redesigned but it&#x27;s still the well-loved product.</li>
            <li> This is a product that is getting harder and harder to find in the stores and it&#x27;s my husbands favorite. &amp;#34;All my men wear English Leather or they wear nothing at all&amp;#34;. That was the commercial years ago and we still agree with it..</li>
            <li> I have always loved smelling this on my dad since I was a little girl.  I am now 38 and whenever I smell this aftershave anywhere, I always think of my dad:)</li>
            <li> I first used this product 37 years ago, with positive comments from dates and girlfriends.  After the product arrived, I opened the bottle...and immediately memories of special occasions and female faces surfaced.  This fragrance is not overpowering (remember Brut?).  I have no idea how fragrances are marketed to males 17-25, but I can&#x27;t help thinking that this would be one that would still appeal.    Other than the above, the price is omigod higher than in the days of yore, but Amazon&#x27;s price is the best around (big surprise).</li>
            <li> Been using it for years ....I must like it!</li>
            <li> I liked it, but my wife said it smelled like lighter fluid.</li>
            <li> Husband has used this product for years.  Sometimes it is hard to find in Aftershave.  Price is still a little high.</li>
            <li> I not only like the aftershave, but also add the scent to my shaving soap.  It is a musky, unique scent that is definitely &amp;#34;for men only.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> Dad&#x27;s favourite - a classic</li>
            <li> Came quickly. Exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li> There is plenty of aftershave in the bottle.  The main problem is getting it out...too much pours out into your hand.  I poured some into a smaller bottle and solved the problem.  The smell is about the same as I remembered from back in the day, but it does seem to fade more quickly.</li>
            <li> Had been looking for this everywhere. One of my husband&#x27;s (and my) favorites. Should have checked Amazon first. Good price, shipped quickly.</li>
            <li> English Leather is hard to find in stores these days. I&#x27;ve used it my whole life, so when I ran out I got worried. But the price for this amount, which is a larger bottle than I have ever seen in stores, was good and it came quickly in the mail. I definitely recommend it if you like English Leather.</li>
            <li> English Leather products are difficult to locate in our area.  I have had great success ordering the After Shave and Deodorant Sticks from OTC Wholesale.  The packages arrived within about a week of placing the order.  I will definitely use them again when our supply begins to run low.</li>
            <li> Seems the only place I can find this aftershave is on Amazon and the only aftershave that my husband likes</li>
            <li> A faux product&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Any similarities between this product and the popular aromatic product of the 1960&#x27;s is tenuous at best</li>
            <li> Great product! This item can be bought locally but the size I ordered is not available. It arrived in record time and in great shape. I recommend this product highly.</li>
            <li> Classic barbershop smells. A little more potent than I remembered, especially for an aftershave. But I like i and will use it occasionally.</li>
            <li> I have always used English Leather and always will, now that I know I can get it off the Amazon store.  The only place I could get it before was Walmart, which I dread ever going into because of the way they treat their employees and the Walton family greed.</li>
            <li> I love it.  The seller was fast and effective.</li>
            <li> Very greatful this is still available! My dad loves this stuff! It&#x27;s all he&#x27;s ever worn!  He was soo happy to receive this at Christmastime. Thanks!</li>
            <li> Love the fresh leathery scent!</li>
            <li> How can you go wrong with Amazon prime?  And how can you go wrong with Dana English Leather after shave?</li>
            <li> It must have been a really old stock -- all the fragrance had evaporated away, leaving a very smelly box and just yellow-colored water with no scent inside the bottle.</li>
            <li> This product has a nice fragrance without a bitter after smell. Ordering from Amazon insures that you will be able to get it without going from store to store trying to find it.</li>
            <li> An old comfort for an old man.  It is great to have it in my life once again.  Game on time and a great bargain for 8 oz.</li>
            <li> awesome and easy to buy</li>
            <li> HARD TO FIND ITEM AT A REASONABLE PRICE. OLD FASHIONED FRAGRANCE WHICH IS PLEASING TO THE SMELL AND GOOD TO BE ABLE TO FIND IT</li>
            <li> This product is nothing more than water with a little bit of perfume in it. It lasts barely 15 minutes. I wrote to Amazon and they did nothing. I called the manufacturer listed on the box. The manufacturer does not sell it to Amazon. It is Amazon&#x27;s responsibility to make sure that there are no counterfeit products on their web site. I have investigated other men&#x27;s colognes at Amazon and they also seem to be fake.</li>
            <li> Great value and got here asap.  Happy and smell good...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product exclusively since I got it as gift 60 years ago when I was in college.  The deodorant and cologne are also my favorites.  I would recommend this to all my friends..</li>
            <li> First aftershave I have ordered online w/o knowing anything about it really. Seems pretty good, though I have not used many, so I don&#x27;t have a ton to compare it to. Can&#x27;t complain about the smell, and the wife hasn&#x27;t yet either :)</li>
            <li> This is some great stuff!! The girls love it!!! :)</li>
            <li> 2nd order for me....great after shave...good price&amp; fast shipping</li>
            <li> Real good deal price wise for this larger size.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t know what this is but it is not English Leather. Would not reorder this at all!!!!!!! Have used this product for many years. This bottle goes into the trash.</li>
            <li> My favorite. I have used it for over a life time.</li>
            <li> Since I was a young man I have used English Leather and continue to use it.  It&#x27;s the only aftershave that works for my body chemistry.  Refreshing and not overpowering.</li>
            <li> Purchased this as a gift for Christmas</li>
            <li> Longtime user who appreciates the speedy delivery and reasonable price.</li>
            <li> I love English Leather.</li>
            <li> I have used English Leather products for several years.  I know what to expect and I have never been disappointed.</li>
            <li> I got this at Wal Mart for $8. I&#x27;ve seen it for 2 or 3 years and finally decided to buy it. The smell lasts a long time. It&#x27;s not my favorite after shave. The cap on this was so tight I couldn&#x27;t get it off and thought about taking it back. I put it in the microwave to see if it would loosen it up and it did. But when it cooled it was almost impossible to get off again. The bottle design it the worst I&#x27;ve used. The after shave slips down the bottle&#x27;s side. I like to pour out about a quarter size of liquid into my hand and with this bottle it&#x27;s impossible to do that effectively. Giving three stars. I can&#x27;t see this in my regular rotation. Classic fragrances are always welcome on my shelf, except Brut!! That would be the one after shave I&#x27;ve ever been so repulsed by that it immediately went in the trash.</li>
            <li> Husband loves this, will not wear anything else.</li>
            <li> I purchased this item for my husband&#x27;s Christmas present, it&#x27;s a nostalgic scent for hom &amp; I was glad to find a good price for the size. The item was shipped very quickly &amp; the packaging was done well so that the bottle aarrived undamaged. Overall I am very content with the purchase.</li>
            <li> Great simple fragrance for men and women</li>
            <li> I had forgotten the smell, purchase this product several years ago.  Don&#x27;t really care for it now.&lt;br /&gt;I won&#x27;t do these reviews any more!  Don&#x27;t believe you are &amp;#34;required&amp;#34; to say so many words to be &amp;#34;acceptable&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> I hunted everywhere for English Leather After Shave for my husband, we&#x27;ve been married 45 years and he has never worn anything else.  I still think he smells wonderful!</li>
            <li> Great product at a great price.</li>
            <li> Should have ordered the cologne</li>
            <li> This product basically sucks. I read some good reviews about it smelly &#x27;manly&#x27;, but it really just smells like an old man that stinks and doesn&#x27;t know it. Smells like baby powder and dirty diapers. Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> I recently received my order of English Leather deodorent stick, and upon opening  the cap I discoverd  that this product didn&#x27;t remotely resemble the fine scent of English Leather, rather it smelled more like alcohol with a slight scent of fragrance, Whats up with this??</li>
            <li> I hated the smell of the cheap aftershave that my boyfriend was using, so I bought this for him. It smells good, but not as I remembered it. Less rich.</li>
            <li> The scent is the same as ever.  I&#x27;ve used it for 40 years.  This got 4 stars because I had to use a strap wrench to open the bottle.  It was either stuck or installed incredibly tight.</li>
            <li> My husband wears this to work. It smells clean and is not overpowering.&lt;br /&gt;The price is also affordable.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you,RA</li>
            <li> It  is in no way as good as it used to be. It has no smell to it and seems like its been watered down and the slight odor you do get is very faint and does not smell like it used to.</li>
            <li> Good stuff..good business. No more to say...why would I say something else...next time don&#x27;t ask me....please don&#x27;t ask again. or later.</li>
            <li> I remember this aftershave from the 1960&#x27;s and believe me, this product is not like it was in the &amp;#34;good old days&amp;#34;. I am very disappointed.</li>
            <li> not at all like the original scent.</li>
            <li> Great product.  I have been using since I was a teenager.</li>
            <li> My wife Nancy loves the smell. I really use it for her. She persuaded me to give up on my old Lilac Pinaud, which my Father used before me. As for me, the lotion works fine and I enjoy the consequences. It feels good on my skin and cancels out any tenderness caused by my razor.</li>
            <li> This product was everything I expected it would be.</li>
            <li> My husband and myself were very satisfied with the product. My husband has used this&lt;br /&gt;product sense 1966.  He uses other products, but he likes this one the best.&lt;br /&gt;.</li>
            <li> Smells like Dad- he loved it. Hard to find, anymore.</li>
            <li> it has been around for a while and i see why i had a lot of bumps and it has cleared them right up thank you</li>
            <li> Great price for a large bottle of after shave.  Shipped free which was a great deal.  Was packed very well and had no issues with breaking or leaking.</li>
            <li> This is the only aftershave and cologne my wife likes. English Leather has kept her happy for over 30 years.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a gift for some one who has been a lifelong friend and loves English Leather an can&#x27;t get it locally where he lives.</li>
            <li> English Leather has always been my favorite After Shave. As for this particular one, it is larger than I expected. I guess it should do me for a long time.</li>
            <li> Came as promised, in good condition. Will order again.</li>
            <li> Why do they put antibacterial chemicals in this?  Not the way it used to be made years ago.</li>
            <li> This is a Christmas gift for my spouse.  He and I both like the smell of English Leather and he has used it for years.</li>
            <li> Smells great, but the bottle is awkward to use without spilling it.</li>
            <li> I really like the smell of this after shave and I thought it was a bargain for the price.</li>
            <li> Yes, but none that can match English Leather.I  have been using it for a few decades &amp; it is the very best there is.</li>
            <li> I have used this product off and on for at least 60 years but it has gotten harder and harder to find since there is always something newer to choose from. I like many different aftershaves but still come back to this one so glad it is still available here.</li>
            <li> It may be just because my grandfather wore it, and my uncle wore it, and my father wore it. But honestly, it&#x27;s a great scent. Woods, cedar, moss and of course leather. It&#x27;s like an even manlier version of Ferarri Red. Oh yeah. I went the.</li>
            <li> You know that air-conditioned hotel room smell that contains a hint of smoke, masked by the scent of Febreze? That&#x27;s the essence of English Leather.</li>
            <li> never any problems with the product or this site&amp;#62;</li>
            <li> On time and as advertised.</li>
            <li> One of the all-time great after shave&#x27;s, been using it for many, many years, great manly scent for use in the morning, or anytime, especially after a shower, A can&#x27;t miss after shave..</li>
            <li> Made in China, does not smell like original. Smells like a chemical cleaner.  It must be a knockoff to be this bad.</li>
            <li> My husband has worn this for  years it&#x27;s his favorite. He was very happy that i found it on amazon.</li>
            <li> My husband&#x27;s favorite!</li>
            <li> In a trivia type conversation someone mentioned aftershave&#x27;s you never see on the store shelf&#x27;s anymore. English leather was on the list. I remembered that I received a bottle of English Leather as a gift many years ago and that I loved the smell! I checked several stores and did not find any. I new if it still existed it would be on Amazon and it was. Still love the classic smell!</li>
            <li> Just as advertised. Good sale.</li>
            <li> Great stuff. The only problem I have is that my friends tell me that it&#x27;s time to leave the 60&#x27;s behind.</li>
            <li> This aftershave has been my favorite for a long, long time.</li>
            <li> This was a popular fragrance of the 60&#x27;s, and I have to say that trying  it again brought back a lot of pleasant memories&lt;br /&gt;and an occasional comment from someone&#x27;s grandmother.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great !  I&#x27;m old.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At this point, one bottle is probably a life time supply.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did use to like their &amp;#34;soap on a rope&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tempus fugit.</li>
            <li> It has the traditional woody scent, but that scent doesn&#x27;t linger very long and is gone within an hour or less.</li>
            <li> Excellent, was very pleased with ordering and shipping process.</li>
            <li> A classic.A favorite of mine since the the late 70&#x27;s-the wife still loves it!Shipped well-packaged.Don&#x27;t hesitate on this as is the same as in the store-not a knock-off.</li>
            <li> English Leather is the only after shave that I have ever considered using. Great smell and is easy on the skin.</li>
            <li> Just what I and others wanted.</li>
            <li> The aftershave is very nice and is as good as ever.  The deodorant stick is not the same or good as the original Dana product. It evaporates away and does not maintain its quality over time.  It has a different logo than the original Dana product which used the English riding saddle. Is it a rip off??</li>
            <li> Not exactly like I remember from my youth but it is close</li>
            <li> I have been getting English Leather for my husband for years.  We both love the fragrance.  Good quality for a reasonable price.</li>
            <li> Good shiping good item</li>
