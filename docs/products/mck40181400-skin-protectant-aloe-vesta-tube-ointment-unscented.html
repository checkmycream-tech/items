            <li> This is the best skin ointment I have ever used. I used it for the first time when I was in the hospital. When I got out of the hospital I tried several pharmacies and couldn&#x27;t find it anywhere.  I thought to check Amazon and I was glad to see I could buy it from Amazon. It is a great product that I will continue to buy from Amazon.</li>
