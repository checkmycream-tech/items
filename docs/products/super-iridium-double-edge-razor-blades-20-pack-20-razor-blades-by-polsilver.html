    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>Best blades I have used.</li>
            <li>Polsilver gives me the best of both worlds for a every day shave</li>
            <li>Perfect balance of sharpness and longevity.</li>
            <li>These are, for me, the very best.</li>
            <li>The Polsilver Iridium Razors are, in my opinion, the best of the best.  </li>
            <li>These are the best blades I have ever used.  </li>
            <li>After years of trying dozens of blades these topped my gillette silver blues are the best to date.</li>
            <li>Excellent.</li>
            <li>These and Feathers are the best.</li>
            <li>Very good, but not the vastly superior blade</li>
            <li>Happy shaving.</li>
            <li>For me, these are about as good as it gets.</li>
            <li>Over all these are the best blades I have come across and worthy of 5 stars.</li>
            <li>Close, comfortable shave, and great longevity.</li>
            <li>These are absolutely the best blades for my skin type.</li>
            <li>I use these in the fairly mild DE89 and it delivers a great shave.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve been using these with EJ DE89 razor and mitchells wool fat soap and so far am very happy.</li>
            <li>Very smooth.</li>
            <li>Then i decided to go after top ranked Feather and Polsilver.</li>
            <li>This product deserves 5 stars for sure.</li>
            <li>and I get more shaves from these blades compared to others,</li>
            <li>I think I found my favorite blades.</li>
            <li>favorite blade is still the Gillette 7&#x27;oclock SharpEdge.</li>
            <li>A pack of 100&lt;br /&gt;costs about 45.00 or more.  </li>
            <li>Better blades then Astras.</li>
            <li>This doesn&#x27;t affect how the blade shaves, but since I&#x27;m using a Gillette Slim Adjustable, it&#x27;s just more gunk that might go into the hole in the handle and cause problems with the razor.</li>
            <li>These are very cool.</li>
            <li>One of the best Gillette / P&amp;G offerings for the wet shaver today.</li>
            <li>I can easily get 4 to 5 shaves per blade no problems (your MMV though)  </li>
            <li>The PolSilver Super Iridium are outstanding blades.</li>
            <li>because of how smooth they are.</li>
            <li>These blades give me a great close shave and will last 5 shaves with no problem (for me).  </li>
            <li>Provides a smooth and comfortable shave every time.  </li>
            <li>Used these with a Parker 26C open comb razor and getting great shaves without tugging or irratation.  </li>
            <li>These are very nice sharp and smooth blades.</li>
            <li>Polsilver are good blades but you can get better blades for less money.</li>
            <li>They are basically the best Russian blade out of all the Russian blades I&#x27;ve tried which is all of them except PermaSharp.</li>
            <li>Popped one into a 48-50 Gillette Super Speed.</li>
            <li>A very high quality sharp blade with very good smoothness.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve seen blades that many rate highly</li>
            <li>Compared to astra these provide a much smoother nick/irritation free shave for me.</li>
            <li>The real benefit of these is how smooth they are.  </li>
            <li>Could tell the difference right away.</li>
            <li>I feel Astra blades are just as good for less money.</li>
            <li>but I can&#x27;t imagine how the could have a better balance of smooth and sharp.</li>
            <li>They are clearly as&lt;br /&gt;sharp as Feathers and as smooth as glass.</li>
            <li>Hopefully these will last for as many shaves as the astras do.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Good balance of sharp and smooth, For me, similar to Persona Med Preps.  </li>
            <li>for how the Super Iridium Blades shave, I think they gave me a better shave than any other blade I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li>These are a bit pricier than some DE razor blades, but compared with ridiculously overpriced cartridges, ALL  of the DE blades are great deal.</li>
            <li>I get about a week of normal daily shaves from one blade, with fresh blades for special occasions/BBS times.</li>
            <li>but they are much smoother.</li>
            <li>I find blades with platinum coating provide a smoother shave compared to just stainless steel.</li>
            <li>really</li>
            <li>but I really like them and will be looking to purchase the 100 pack.</li>
            <li>Fast shipment.</li>
            <li>Your mileage may very.</li>
            <li>Would highly recommend</li>
            <li>I go back and Forth between these and Feathers as my blade of choice, but I tend to like these more because you get basically the same ultra smooth shave without having to be uber careful not to cut yourself.</li>
            <li>My favorite blade, stays sharp longer and offers the smoothest shave I have found.</li>
            <li>My face was still smooth last night when I went to bed and barely needed a shave this morning!  </li>
            <li>Tops right next to astra and feathers</li>
            <li>Unbelievably sharp and smooth blades.  </li>
            <li>I thought the gillette yellows were sharp and smooth.</li>
            <li>man these are smooth AND sharp.</li>
            <li>but i can live with it.</li>
            <li>They are very sharp and smooth.</li>
            <li>(Sharks for instance), that I didn&#x27;t care for too much, so you need to try different blades with your razor until you find the one you want to use.</li>
            <li>They are similar to astra and I think they are made in the same factory like many other Russian blades but these are much smoother than astra for me.</li>
            <li>but if anyone enjoys astra/silver blue or other Russian blades then they should love the Polsilver blades.</li>
            <li>I find it is very similar to Gillette Silver Blues, both sharp but sometimes not as smooth a shave.</li>
            <li>For the price difference, however, I will likely stick with Astra&#x27;s, which I find to be very close to the Super Iridium blades and can be bought for a lot less money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Like most other rewievs Polsilvers are almost as sharp as Feather</li>
            <li>although they are really sharp, sometimes it is not as smooth, this all comes down to the type of razor I use and proper prep work.  </li>
            <li>you likely know by reading other reviews, these ratings are very subjective.</li>
            <li>Where the feathers feel rough and are unforgiving, and the yellows are smoother but not as sharp these glide right over the face and get almost as close as the feathers.</li>
            <li>They are as sharp as the Gillette 7 o&#x27;clock sharp edge but seem to hold an edge a little better.  </li>
            <li>Feather is sharp but is rough on my skin and Astra has a smooth glide but not as sharp as Feather.</li>

            <li> Not so sure that a very thin coating of Iridium actually makes a difference to preserve sharpness, but I like these blades and use them alternating with Feathers.</li>
            <li> Usually my beard starrs back by 6:30-7pm with the yellows and shave ready by the next morning.  </li>
            <li> Price is a little high.</li>
            <li> They are also very durable, lasting at least six or&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s been only couple months i started with wet shaving again after years and decided to try some different brand DE razors.</li>
            <li> The only down side is they are the most expensive razors sold.</li>
            <li> They are slightly sharper than yellows but less than feather although not by much.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Basically these are like a much improved version of astra sp blades in my experience at least.</li>
            <li> but I have to be careful in my second and touch up passes not to nick myself or apply any pressure resulting in razor burn.</li>
            <li> Sharp enough for a close shave</li>
            <li> If you have a very heavy beard and don&#x27;t have sensitive skin, these would no doubt work well.&lt;br</li>
            <li> but they feel like they don&#x27;t stay as sharp for as long as the astras.</li>
            <li> At fifty cents a blade, I&#x27;m not ready to buy 100 though.  </li>
            <li> Feather blades are slightly sharper, but do hold an edge as long...</li>
            <li> These are sharp blades</li>
            <li> The astra are just as sharp</li>
            <li> These are pricier than other blades</li>
            <li> These are nearly as sharp as Feathers, but smoother.</li>
            <li> On par with other top-rated blades.  </li>
            <li> Maybe I&#x27;m spoiled with other blades like persona  or feather.</li>
            <li> Very sharp blades.</li>
            <li> they put on the blades to keep the wrapping paper tight against each blade.</li>
            <li> not sure which one I prefer.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried a sample pack and am getting at least 8 shaves per blade.  </li>
            <li> Now when I say almost I mean there is hardly a difference if I hadn&#x27;t used a feather</li>
            <li> but you know I mean)</li>
            <li> Little expensive</li>
            <li> The only thing bad i can say about them is the gunk (wax, I guess)</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have that tough a beard except for under my chin but have no problem shaving ATG.  </li>
            <li> Expensive (for DE blades) but</li>
            <li> Time for 100 of these bad boys.</li>
            <li> But these blades just tugged on me too bad.</li>

            <li> It&#x27;s been only couple months i started with wet shaving again after years and decided to try some different brand DE razors. I started with Personna and forget about it. Then i decided to go after top ranked Feather and Polsilver. Like most other rewievs Polsilvers are almost as sharp as Feather but they are much smoother. This product deserves 5 stars for sure. Between Feather and Polsilver i definitely say Polsilver. Little expensive but i can live with it.</li>
            <li> These are sharp blades and I get more shaves from these blades compared to others, although they are really sharp, sometimes it is not as smooth, this all comes down to the type of razor I use and proper prep work.  I find it is very similar to Gillette Silver Blues, both sharp but sometimes not as smooth a shave. I find blades with platinum coating provide a smoother shave compared to just stainless steel.</li>
            <li> I think I found my favorite blades. These are very nice sharp and smooth blades. They are similar to astra and I think they are made in the same factory like many other Russian blades but these are much smoother than astra for me. Compared to astra these provide a much smoother nick/irritation free shave for me. The astra are just as sharp but I have to be careful in my second and touch up passes not to nick myself or apply any pressure resulting in razor burn. With these blades I can almost shave with my eyes closed(not really but you know I mean) because of how smooth they are. The smoothness results in no razor burn/irritation or nicks even with multiple passes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Basically these are like a much improved version of astra sp blades in my experience at least. Of course everyone&#x27;s skin/beard is different but if anyone enjoys astra/silver blue or other Russian blades then they should love the Polsilver blades. They are basically the best Russian blade out of all the Russian blades I&#x27;ve tried which is all of them except PermaSharp. These are pricier than other blades but I really like them and will be looking to purchase the 100 pack. Happy shaving.</li>
            <li> These blades give me a great close shave and will last 5 shaves with no problem (for me).  I also shave with Feather blades...not sure which one I prefer.  Feather blades are slightly sharper, but do hold an edge as long...maybe 3 shaves.</li>
            <li> Fast shipment. Best blades I have used. Tops right next to astra and feathers</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Astra and Feather blades, but these fall in between the two for me. Feather is sharp but is rough on my skin and Astra has a smooth glide but not as sharp as Feather. Polsilver gives me the best of both worlds for a every day shave so now this will be my go to blade.Time for 100 of these bad boys.</li>
            <li> I received a pack in a blade sampler. Popped one into a 48-50 Gillette Super Speed. Reminds me a lot of a feather blade.&lt;br /&gt;Doesn&#x27;t work well with my face. If you have a very heavy beard and don&#x27;t have sensitive skin, these would no doubt work well.&lt;br /&gt;My favorite blade is still the Gillette 7&#x27;oclock SharpEdge. Perfect balance of sharpness and longevity. Your mileage may very.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried a sample pack and am getting at least 8 shaves per blade.  I don&#x27;t have that tough a beard except for under my chin but have no problem shaving ATG.  They are as sharp as the Gillette 7 o&#x27;clock sharp edge but seem to hold an edge a little better.  At fifty cents a blade, I&#x27;m not ready to buy 100 though.  I get 5 shaves out of the Gillette and similar out of Personna.</li>
            <li> Unbelievably sharp and smooth blades.  Provides a smooth and comfortable shave every time.  I can easily get 4 to 5 shaves per blade no problems (your MMV though)  One of the best Gillette / P&amp;G offerings for the wet shaver today.</li>
            <li> Used these with a Parker 26C open comb razor and getting great shaves without tugging or irratation.  Would highly recommend</li>
            <li> Very sharp blades. Could tell the difference right away. Price is a little high.</li>
            <li> These are nearly as sharp as Feathers, but smoother. I go back and Forth between these and Feathers as my blade of choice, but I tend to like these more because you get basically the same ultra smooth shave without having to be uber careful not to cut yourself. I use these in the fairly mild DE89 and it delivers a great shave. These are a bit pricier than some DE razor blades, but compared with ridiculously overpriced cartridges, ALL  of the DE blades are great deal. For me, these are about as good as it gets. YMMV.</li>
            <li> A very high quality sharp blade with very good smoothness.&lt;br /&gt;I get no irritation from these blades at all.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using them in a Fatboy set on 7.</li>
            <li> These are, for me, the very best. Close, comfortable shave, and great longevity. I get about a week of normal daily shaves from one blade, with fresh blades for special occasions/BBS times.</li>
            <li> My favorite blade, stays sharp longer and offers the smoothest shave I have found.</li>
            <li> On par with other top-rated blades.  Good balance of sharp and smooth, For me, similar to Persona Med Preps.  Very good, but not the vastly superior blade some make it out to be.</li>
            <li> The Polsilver Iridium Razors are, in my opinion, the best of the best.  They are clearly as&lt;br /&gt;sharp as Feathers and as smooth as glass. They are also very durable, lasting at least six or&lt;br /&gt;seven shaves.  The only down side is they are the most expensive razors sold. A pack of 100&lt;br /&gt;costs about 45.00 or more.  So if you don&#x27;t mind spending a chunk of change, these razors cannot&lt;br /&gt;be beat by anything else out there.</li>
            <li> These are very cool. Sharp enough for a close shave but they have not caused me any nicks or cuts. I am using these blades for two or three shaves. Not so sure that a very thin coating of Iridium actually makes a difference to preserve sharpness, but I like these blades and use them alternating with Feathers.</li>
            <li> I thought the gillette yellows were sharp and smooth. These are the best blades I have ever used.  They are slightly sharper than yellows but less than feather although not by much.  The real benefit of these is how smooth they are.  Where the feathers feel rough and are unforgiving, and the yellows are smoother but not as sharp these glide right over the face and get almost as close as the feathers. Now when I say almost I mean there is hardly a difference if I hadn&#x27;t used a feather I would say these gave me the closest shave of my life.  Usually my beard starrs back by 6:30-7pm with the yellows and shave ready by the next morning.  My face was still smooth last night when I went to bed and barely needed a shave this morning!  With the feather I could have gone to the following evening before I would feel like I could use a shave for comparison.  Over all these are the best blades I have come across and worthy of 5 stars.</li>
            <li> Polsilver are good blades but you can get better blades for less money. I feel Astra blades are just as good for less money.</li>
            <li> After years of trying dozens of blades these topped my gillette silver blues are the best to date. Kai/Astra/med preps are still on my wish list but I can&#x27;t imagine how the could have a better balance of smooth and sharp.</li>
            <li> Expensive (for DE blades) but man these are smooth AND sharp. I&#x27;ve been using Astras for the last year and occasionally throw a feather in here and there. I like the Feathers but they feel like they don&#x27;t stay as sharp for as long as the astras. Hopefully these will last for as many shaves as the astras do.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using these with EJ DE89 razor and mitchells wool fat soap and so far am very happy.</li>
            <li> Excellent. Very smooth.</li>
            <li> Better blades then Astras. These and Feathers are the best.</li>
            <li> Maybe I&#x27;m spoiled with other blades like persona  or feather. But these blades just tugged on me too bad.</li>
            <li> These are absolutely the best blades for my skin type. I have medium sensitivity skin, and these blades don&#x27;t burn me. They also seem to last forever. I use a double open comb Merkur. I also use only Trumper&#x27;s cream in the tub now. Feather is the only blade close to this one for me, but this Iridium is peerless.</li>
            <li> The PolSilver Super Iridium are outstanding blades. The only thing bad i can say about them is the gunk (wax, I guess) they put on the blades to keep the wrapping paper tight against each blade. This doesn&#x27;t affect how the blade shaves, but since I&#x27;m using a Gillette Slim Adjustable, it&#x27;s just more gunk that might go into the hole in the handle and cause problems with the razor. This, however seems to be the case with all the brands of blades made in the same factory in Russia (Astra and the various Gillette brands).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for how the Super Iridium Blades shave, I think they gave me a better shave than any other blade I&#x27;ve used. They are very sharp and smooth. For the price difference, however, I will likely stick with Astra&#x27;s, which I find to be very close to the Super Iridium blades and can be bought for a lot less money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As you likely know by reading other reviews, these ratings are very subjective. I&#x27;ve seen blades that many rate highly (Sharks for instance), that I didn&#x27;t care for too much, so you need to try different blades with your razor until you find the one you want to use.</li>
