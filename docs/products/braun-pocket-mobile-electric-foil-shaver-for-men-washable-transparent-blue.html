            <li>great for travel use</li>

            <li>and he&#x27;s happy with it.  </li>
            <li>a GREAT shaver in it&#x27;s class&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>Great Price.</li>
            <li>Very handy and</li>
            <li>When I have to head into work on a sunday at 7:30am, it&#x27;s very nice to have this thing in the glove box to trim myself up.</li>
            <li>Very handy.</li>
            <li>If find that is gives a very nice shave.</li>
            <li>A superb device -- I&#x27;ve owned many shavers, including ones costing well over $100.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Best of luck to all men and ladies, Treat your face with love and tender care.</li>
            <li>For the price it&#x27;s a remarkable piece of technology - when it works.</li>
            <li>It would be perfect ... but the foil damages easily.</li>
            <li>Good price from a good brand.  </li>
            <li>Good product.</li>
            <li>Excellent light duty shaver, for pocket, auto or briefcase.&lt;br /&gt;Use</li>
            <li>It has, surprisingly, given just as good a shave as my Braun 3 Series shaver.</li>
            <li>Good for on the go.</li>
            <li>I have never had good results with electric razors.</li>
            <li>I detail my mustache to a good extent with the Braun</li>
            <li>Shaves as good as the $98 brand named rotary I got as a gift.</li>
            <li>This is a compact battery powered razor that provides a good close shave.</li>
            <li>Good razor.</li>
            <li>you&#x27;re on budget and searching for a good travel shaver</li>
            <li>Good Buy.</li>
            <li>Good value for product</li>
            <li>I have yet to figure out what it is good for.</li>
            <li>The battery life is good considering what you&#x27;re asking it to do, but rechargeables are the order of the day.</li>
            <li>Not as close as a blade, but good for an electric.</li>
            <li>The shaver appears to be of good quality.  </li>
            <li>Before that I used a $10 knock-off from a Chinatown that worked surprisingly well.</li>
            <li>It gives a good shave too</li>
            <li>However, this is good for what it does.</li>
            <li>Lightweight is good.  </li>
            <li>and it is good for the price.</li>
            <li>This shaver is really good for when it comes to doing bald taper fades, or cleaning on the neck where the neck taper is at.</li>
            <li>factor, batteries, cover...all good.  </li>
            <li>For its purpose, as a portable travel shaver, the shaver does a good job</li>
            <li>/&gt;Trust me, this is a really good travel razor</li>
            <li>Maybe good for a camping trip???</li>
            <li>Definitely a good buy.</li>
            <li>Once a week or so, it is good to use the brush for any buildup that might occur (e.g., between the blades of the shaving block).  </li>
            <li>Once a week or so, it is good to use the brush for any buildup that might occur (e.g., between the blades of the shaving block).  </li>
            <li>This shaver is good using it every day.</li>
            <li>A good mobile razor.  </li>
            <li>Good design.  </li>
            <li>A fair price.  </li>
            <li>This shaver works best when running at full speed.</li>
            <li>Battery life is very good and replacing them is easy.  </li>
            <li>Performs super!!!</li>
            <li>I have had one unit for many years and it still works great.</li>
            <li>Worked great, and i love the guard that snaps in to place to protect the blades.</li>
            <li>Loved that this item came with batteries, it was a nice touch.  </li>
            <li>Quite good and handy for a foil shaver.</li>
            <li>The Braun gives a good, close and reasonably comfortable shave; not quite as good as a Norelco but good.</li>
            <li>This thing cuts better than any 3,5,or 7 series shaver Braun makes and it is cheaper than the replacement blade!  </li>
            <li>Purchased 3 more for my sons !</li>
            <li>Love the battery operation instead of having to recharge every time I use it !</li>
            <li>It works like a charm, and make sure you change your batteries after one month or two months of using!  </li>
            <li>Inexpensive and better than a $90 razor according to my husband!</li>
            <li>and it goes on for more than a month!</li>
            <li>Cleans easy, dependable, great design.  </li>
            <li>A fine shaver that I got  at a great price ....</li>
            <li>buying from Amazon is amazing.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s amazing</li>
            <li>for the price, this thing works amazing.</li>
            <li>Anyone want to but a Braun pocket shaver REAL cheap?</li>
            <li>and you don&#x27;t have replacements handy in your hotel</li>
            <li>and he can&#x27;t come home to shave - also handy for mornings when he realizes he &amp;#34;missed a spot&amp;#34; as he is driving to work.  </li>
            <li>The sliding cover is a nice touch as well.</li>
            <li>The MobileShave gives a surprisingly good shave, but like most Braun single-foil shavers it will miss some longer hairs on your neck.</li>
            <li>Handy size and works well.</li>
            <li>Nice unit.  </li>
            <li>I can recommend this shaver to anyone needing a nice cordless option.</li>
            <li>The shaver itself does a nice job.  </li>
            <li>Perhaps shavers using 2 AAs are all kind of noisy.</li>
            <li>How nice * Jesus&#x27; Blessings and Peace</li>
            <li>It works fairly well if you re-educate yourself about the fact that you are using a $9 razor and that you may not be able to use it like a $150 Braun or Panasonic razor.</li>
            <li>Nice thing is it runs on AA&#x27;s</li>
            <li>Nice design.</li>
            <li>This is a handy shaver for the car and travel.  </li>
            <li>adopt it as my own if it does not get touched by him...</li>
            <li>Nice color, though.</li>
            <li>By contrast, the inch-long straight trimmer on the 375 is perfect for trimming sideburns.</li>
            <li>But both razors do a nice job.</li>
            <li>but it should be handy for traveling My son</li>
            <li>Is the shaver better than a good razor: no, but it comes darn close.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It is really nice that this shaver is not one of them.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Switching from the Pro glide to this has saved me over the $100 that a nice Braun is going to cost me.</li>
            <li>if you get 5 o&#x27;clock shadow by 3 and have a meeting at 4, this will tidy you up a bit for the meeting.  </li>
            <li>He&#x27;s not to thrilled with it..</li>
            <li>BRAUN POCKET SHAVER is the best work for months on two battery, very close shave, you can take it with you on the trip or just anywhere.</li>
            <li>Own two.</li>
            <li>compact, nice flip cover, and close shave.</li>
            <li>I was hoping to keep this in my desk at work for days where I didn&#x27;t think I needed to look nice</li>
            <li>He didn&#x27;t seem thrilled either.</li>
            <li>In the beginning I liked the BRAUN POCKET SHAVER,2xAA,CAP - WASHABLE, M60B  </li>
            <li>nice shaver, don&#x27;t wash anything electrical</li>
            <li>I expect it will be especially useful on those overnight flights and train</li>
            <li>Both cheap and good for shaving, transparent body is very beautiful, but also body wash, very convenient.</li>
            <li>Great for travel, I keep one in my car for a quick shave if needed.</li>
            <li>great unit for the car and quick touch ups</li>
            <li>Good price, works well, easily portable</li>
            <li>VERY easy to use.</li>
            <li>When traveling I sometimes carry spare AA batteries, but they are very easy to find in all countries.</li>
            <li>Nicely made, very comfortable.</li>
            <li>I liked the older one better but for a travel shaver its the best I have tried, battery life is good and it gives a pretty good shave plus being waterproof is a bonus</li>
            <li>And the price is right!!!</li>
            <li>and I hope that they continue to make large amounts of cash and become very wealthy and happy for the rest of their lives.</li>
            <li>I travel a lot, love this nice compact Frazer.</li>
            <li>Cheap and good.</li>
            <li>This unit does not shave hairs that have lasted over a day effectively or those that have grown any more than a 1/4 inch from my face.</li>
            <li>It does not snag or pull hairs and does an excellent job of not missing hairs.  </li>
            <li>This is a just ok shaver, just as good as the rest of electric shavers but the price is right and it is good for travel camping or for that afternoon touch me up</li>
            <li>This Braun Pocket Shaver is inexpensive and the perfect item for the person who wants to travel light.  </li>
            <li>But it is important that you use strong fresh batteries to keep it at its best.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t think Braun made such a shaver, but was happy to see the great reviews on this and ordered it.  </li>
            <li>It is working good and clean.</li>
            <li>These are are great because they work, they are dependable, and they are easy to clean.  </li>
            <li>Great for a first time shaver.</li>
            <li>Handy and easy to operate.  </li>
            <li>it is best used as a back-up shaver in your travel shaving kit, with extra batteries stored in the kit too.</li>
            <li>and you can keep them in the shaver for many years without leaking.</li>
            <li>for travel, it is the best electric shaver I have owned (an I tried 5 different brands/types).</li>
            <li>This one is actually better.  </li>
            <li>overall good product great of on the road or in a carry on.</li>
            <li>so you can bring it with you and shave again in a bathroom somewhere at 4pm to look better for dinner.</li>
            <li>...and much more efficient than buying a screen and cutter block for a razor whose model number I can&#x27;t remember...and so on.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t need a razor for travel like most of these reviewers probably did</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;d always cut myself, I&#x27;ve tried a couple of electric shavers (rechargeable and wired) and the rechargeable one did ok</li>
            <li>and it takes AA batteries instead of AAA which cost a bit more</li>
            <li>It also seems more rugged</li>
            <li>okay</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m satisfied</li>
            <li>and there.&lt;br /&gt;I used a better model of Braun shaver before</li>
            <li>Most have removable foil covers that get lost or fall off at some point.</li>
            <li>Like this better then the throw away&#x27;s</li>
            <li>Love this shaver.</li>
            <li>I am pleased</li>
            <li>use this exclusively for my upper lip to keep away the stache, and it is absolutely perfect for this.</li>
            <li>I am thoroughly pleased with this shaver.  </li>
            <li>great shaver and a very close shave</li>
            <li>The 370 was/is a great travel shaver, so much that hubby uses it almost every day instead of his $120 shaver.</li>
            <li>For the cost of this disposable shaver, I would have to play more the replace the blades and screen on my Braun shaver.  </li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>The swivel cover is perfect for traveling, the AA batteries last many days, it shaves as close as any electric I have owned.  </li>
            <li>trimmer-- better trimmer than the one on the M90.</li>
            <li>keep my 375 in the car where I did most of my shaving on my commute to work.</li>
            <li>I use the M90 more often.</li>
            <li>I skip shaving for more than two days, I find that this shaver misses some hairs.</li>
            <li>I skip shaving for more than two days, I find that this shaver misses some hairs.</li>
            <li>I love the design of the shaver, where you can just rotate the cover on and off.</li>
            <li>uses 2 AA copper top bats...provided with it.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been able to get from it.</li>
            <li>But if you let your bear grow more than a day or two, is does not shaves well.</li>
            <li>Smooth shave too!</li>

            <li>But wait more than 24 hours</li>
            <li>For the price I guess I did ok.</li>
            <li>Does an ok job in an emergency.</li>
            <li>I love it.  </li>
            <li>I have purchased many shaveers over the years but none give the shave this one does.</li>
            <li>However, after shaving with both, I realized the inexpensive M60 was doing a much better job.</li>
            <li>It may make more sense to use rechargeable batteries.</li>
            <li>What&#x27;s interesting..</li>
            <li>And in China, the power is not always available and if you have a bunch of things to recharge, it is nice to have something that has AA batteries instead.</li>
            <li>I would say it&#x27;s better than I imagined</li>
            <li>What more can I say.</li>
            <li>you miss a day, you will be better off getting out the manual razor and cream.</li>
            <li>In fact, I&#x27;ve had shavers that cost much more that did not shave as well.</li>
            <li>He keeps it in the car and mostly uses it to touch up spots that he realizes he missed in the morning.  </li>
            <li>and I look forward to many many more.</li>
            <li>i have lathered up and used this shaver, and it does do a better job that way.  </li>
            <li>i&#x27;ll try my eneloops when the duracells die, but i suspect the duracells will give me more power for a better shave.</li>
            <li>I will have to get him a better one for Christmas.</li>
            <li>I am well satisfied with my purchase.</li>
            <li>As that famous ad slogan says about another product, &amp;#34;Don&#x27;t leave your home without (the Braun pocket shaver)</li>
            <li>This shaver is much better than the price would have you believe.</li>
            <li>Bought this to replace a Braun portable that I&#x27;ve used for many years...</li>
            <li>Seemed like no matter how many times I went over those areas</li>
            <li>I love the design and the weight and</li>
            <li>I find it not quite able to get the job done.  </li>
            <li>much more closer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>, what more can you ask for?</li>
            <li>Works much better than i thought it would</li>
            <li>Fantastic product!</li>
            <li>I have one in front of the mirror in the bathroom, one in the suitcase and have bought 2 more as gifts.</li>
            <li>The drier the skin and whiskers the better.  </li>
            <li>The drier the skin and whiskers the better.  </li>
            <li>I have used a rotary for years, but have never been totally satisfied with the closeness of the shave.  </li>
            <li>and I couldn&#x27;t be more</li>
            <li>and you have a winning combination.</li>
            <li>This one has been my go-to field shaver for almost 7 years- keep it clean with some water, blow it out, brush off the blades with the toothbrush of your favorite Soldier- Good2Go for another month!  </li>
            <li>I use it as a quick follow-up to the rotary and have been very pleased with the result.  </li>
            <li>It is portable, cute and shaves very clean.</li>
            <li>I bought it when I was travelling and forgot my Philips shaver at home (a great one btw) and thought I could use this one to get a decent shave.&lt;br /&gt;Ohh</li>
            <li>I would recommend it highly; it makes a great gift.  </li>
            <li>The Model 370 was so good, I&#x27;m willing to give the M90 a shot.  </li>
            <li>Braun always puts out a good shaver and this is my 3rd one and it is great for a light one.</li>
            <li>This is the most fabulous awesome thing I have ever bought in my entire life.</li>
            <li>Does a pretty good job, too.  </li>
            <li>I love the way this shaver is designed with a built in cover and easy access to the batteries.</li>
            <li>It is extremely easy to clean, comes with its own brush and can be washed under water.  </li>
            <li>Even more incredible to me, is the fact that I ordered it one day and, hey presto, I got it the next day!</li>
            <li>The very low price was surprising since Braun has a good reputation.  </li>
            <li>Made well,easy to clean !</li>
            <li>Not as close as a blade on my cheeks and neck, but perfectly acceptable, and better than any other electric shaver I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li>The original batteries are still going strong!</li>
            <li>, the battery compartment doesn&#x27;t seem to make good contact, as certain time the unit did not turn on and I have to shake it to get the battery engaged.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The cleaning brush on the 375 is slightly larger than the ones on the M60/90, but neither are very good for cleaning the shavers.</li>
            <li>Easy to clean, very easy to use</li>
            <li>these are my favorite can wait to shave for that smooth baby but feel.</li>
            <li>I can spend 30 minutes passing over my beard and shaved head, it will make lots of lovely buzzing sounds, and it will sound like hair is being cut, but it does not cut anything.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>If I let my face go more than 3 days it struggles, but if I keep up with it, the M60 does a fantastic job.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Just as expected - great shaver!</li>
            <li>Glad mine was a free sample.</li>
            <li>/&gt;For more detailed evaluation, let me compare to a Panasonic 3 head rechargeable shaver I have.  </li>
            <li>Braun shaves closer than my Panasonic, and it glides more smoothly over my skin.  </li>
            <li>Good design, shaves very well.</li>
            <li>Good shaver,  I use it for travel and because I don&#x27;t have to carry the AC cord around, it is very convenient.  </li>
            <li>It is easy to carry around, What about the effect of the shave, only my husband knows, but the workmanship is very good.</li>
            <li>well, easy clean up, and not CUTS!</li>
            <li>got to me super fast and works great</li>
            <li>Excellent dry shave using light pressure.</li>
            <li>easy on batteries; easy to use; clean shave!  </li>
            <li>I bought it based on other reviews and for me, after a couple of months of use, it has been perfect.</li>
            <li>Cool design though!</li>
            <li>THe design makes it easy to pack,</li>
            <li>and I wanted something to shave him with that would be easy to use and do the job.</li>
            <li>I have all of the battery operated shavers, this and the Panasonic are the best built and most practical everyday shavers ot them all.</li>
            <li>that are easy to find and easy to replace.</li>
            <li>/&gt;+  uses 2 AA battery, easy to replace.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Washable, hardy, durable and easy to carry around.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I strongly advise putting it in a Ziploc bag and storing the batteries separately otherwise when it&#x27;s not used overtime the batteries can leak and ruin it as it did to my son&#x27;s version.</li>
            <li>So good that is beats my main nolreo tri head.</li>
            <li>It seems to still run strong and do its job</li>
            <li>so I don&#x27;t have strong comparison.  </li>
            <li>The fact that the Braun&#x27;s batteries were user-replaceable was a strong selling point for me.  </li>
            <li>This is hands down the best electric shaver that I have ever used.</li>
            <li>But it&#x27;s a battery shaver as good as any other and one can stay on top of ones beard by keeping it handy.</li>
            <li>It has been working fine as a travel shaver; like the size and weight.</li>
            <li>All in all, this is a fine low-cost shaver</li>
            <li>and it worked fine for that, too.</li>
            <li>Braun makes a fine product.</li>
            <li>They work fine on 2 AA batteries.</li>
            <li>Works fine.</li>
            <li>and they are still working fine.  </li>
            <li>Two stars instead of one because perhaps the item I received was defective somehow, and intact models work fine?</li>
            <li>It came quick and is packaged in a box with a tab at the top like it would be hung on a peg at the drug store.</li>
            <li>close shave easy to clean and easy to use.</li>
            <li>Attached brush easy to remove to clean cutter, saw no need to wash, Easy to hold and use.</li>
            <li>i liked the protective cap but shave is not as close as the Sanyo( that was supposed to be a &amp;#34;backup&amp;#34; if Airline lost my main suitcase ! )</li>
            <li>IT IS LIGHT AND</li>
            <li>He gets a clean shave and it&#x27;s easy to take apart and rinse the the whiskers out.</li>
            <li>But with short stubble works great</li>
            <li>My youngest son just started shaving and this fit the bill.</li>
            <li>It works just great for travel use and he actually uses it at home as well.</li>
            <li>, using this it took me under a minute to shave and my face was smooth as if I&#x27;d have shaven with a manual razor..</li>
            <li>the downside the instructions do recommend taking out the batteries after each use as they may start to leak and it also recommends putting a light coat of machine oil on the foil IF you rinse the foil under water often</li>
            <li>In just a couple of minutes I can have my face baby-back smooth.  </li>
            <li>Hubby likes how it is comfortable and stable to hold.</li>
            <li>Great close shave and the batteries last for weeks.</li>
            <li>(Which is cheap).</li>
            <li>Also comfortable to hold.</li>
            <li>My legs are smooth after a shave.</li>
            <li>Works well, easy to handle and clean.  </li>
            <li>Easy to clean.</li>
            <li>It was cheap and it runs on batteries so this was meant to be a traveling razor.</li>
            <li>This is so cheap that when the head eventually wears out, I will toss it and just buy another one of these...very convenient...</li>
            <li>cheap.</li>
            <li>thoughtful design.</li>
            <li>Easy to clean.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to clean.</li>
            <li>Easy to use and clean.</li>
            <li>Simple, bombproof, works great, inexpensive.</li>
            <li>For the price it is a great low cost shaver.</li>
            <li>Easy to clean.</li>
            <li>By comparison, that cheap knock off once went off while in my duffel bag as I attempted to stow it in an overhead.</li>
            <li>but it has since become my primary shaver.</li>
            <li>Excellent product for either field duty use or everyday use.</li>
            <li>It is light, compact, and cuts well.  </li>
            <li>but it do the work!, easy to clean, to use</li>
            <li>today everything is rechargeable, and when I was in Africa, there were places where the power was available 4 or 5 hours a day.  </li>
            <li>Like always the quality of Braun shavers is ratified with this cheap travel shaver.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s just a clean and easy go.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I ordered this for my husband and it is great for when he has to last minute shave.</li>
            <li>a great travel or back up razor...</li>
            <li>The low cost of this shaver does not reflect its quality--I&#x27;d happily buy it at 3x the price!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>a higher-end, more powerful razor.  </li>
            <li>It is easy to clean and handle.</li>
            <li>I have also had to grab it and run on a couple of occasions and use it as my primary.  </li>
            <li>I love this Braun pocket shaver, it gives me a clean shave and does it quickly thank you for your service.</li>
            <li>I love the 375 because it is slightly smaller but has a good</li>
            <li>Received the item, and tried the same night, good product, well.. it&#x27;s an upgrade from razor blade from electric, so it&#x27;s much better.</li>
            <li>Very nice shaver at a reasonable price , works very well</li>
            <li>I do quickly clean mine after each use and find it&#x27;s holding up just fine.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m happy to say it&#x27;s the same quality as my original.  </li>
            <li>Not for everyday use probably but perfect for post-flight clean up.</li>
            <li>While I don&#x27;t have heavy growth I can grow quite an impressive full beard.</li>
            <li>Mildly water resistant easy to clean.</li>
            <li>User friendly in a sturdy package.</li>
            <li>Protective shield for the blade that rotates away when in use is a nice feature, allowing some protection from normal use.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m now on the 4th month with the shaver, with the original batteries in the package.</li>
            <li>I picked up the original M90 model years ago on an extended stay in Texas.</li>
            <li>Originally bought for travel but</li>
            <li>It does pretty well for the most part.</li>
            <li>Wouldn&#x27;t shave worth a darn!</li>
            <li>There is one significant con:  </li>
            <li>this is great for travel and runs a long time on a set of batteries.</li>
            <li>As expected, not the greatest shaver, but it certainly works, and I plan on getting another as a backup.  </li>
            <li>Plus MobileShave can be washed clean and even used in the shower if you like that option.</li>
            <li>As electric shavers go, based on my experience with several over the years this a quite good one and at a fantastic price.</li>
            <li>its powerful and easy to carry around.</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t have a time to clean yet.</li>
            <li>They definitely clean up the growth.  </li>
            <li>I use a Q-Tip to clean the shaving head area of water, including the gasket area where the shaving head is connected.</li>
            <li>clean prolongs the life of the blade.</li>
            <li>I use mine primarily to clean up after a razor shave.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s really handy for a quick touch up, unlike most guy&#x27;s who think a shadow is what women like, the truth is women like a clean shaven guy, not stubble that scratches, but that is just my thoughts along with several women.</li>
            <li>It is not as good as a high end shaver but is much cheaper and easier to carry on a trip.</li>
            <li>Great design features like the swiveling blade guard which prevents it from being turned on when closed.</li>
            <li>This one is much better than the Remington; it really attacks the stubble and gets rid of it.</li>
            <li>good quality even at the low end price.</li>
            <li>Really cool waterproof battery compartment if you like that sort of thing.</li>
            <li>It has now become his full time razor.  </li>
            <li>perfect to keep in the car if running late.  </li>
            <li>The overall quality of the shaver is quite good as well.</li>
            <li>So much, that we ordered 2 more for our sons.</li>
            <li>it shaves good enough.</li>
            <li>it does such a good job</li>
            <li>This product is not ment to be a full size shaver</li>
            <li>Basically I use it for touch ups between full shaves.  </li>
            <li>However, this one doesn&#x27;t come with a trimmer, which really sucks, as that is one of the best features of the Braun.  </li>
            <li>Overall a good shaver.</li>
            <li>Shaves as well or better than units costing three times as much.</li>
            <li>He has used it to do a full shave when crunched for time in the morning and says it works well</li>
            <li>I still use a straight razor or tossaway for the most part, but when I take off for the weekend on the motorcycle this is my ride-a-long shaver.</li>
            <li>I still have my old one, but I figured its would be nice to have another.</li>
            <li>/&gt;(I have been shaving with a blade because I have not had good shave recently with an electric</li>
            <li>I can not speak to the products durability/endurance over time, yet I can offer an objective observation as to why the product may not work as good as advertised for some:</li>
            <li>this gives a good shave...great for trips and a quick touch up later in the day.</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s great, because even though the foil apparently costs more than replacing the whole shaver, it&#x27;s environmentally better to replace only the part.  </li>
            <li>A cute little razor that fits in your pocket and does a good job if you need a quick shave.</li>
            <li>Seriously I use it almost every day and it is excellent for traveling.</li>
            <li>Keep this in my car for quick touch ups after work.</li>
            <li>Gave as gifts and most report they like it better than there regular electric shaver.</li>
            <li>THis present was one of the most practical the recipient got and was well pleased with he portability and working shaver.  </li>
            <li>Bear in mind that this is a quick cleanup razor</li>
            <li>I bought this for camping off the grid for a quick shave.</li>
            <li>It helps me shave quickly without nicks</li>
            <li>I keep one in my car for any time i might want a quick touch up.</li>
            <li>Not as close as a razor and shaving cream, but it&#x27;s a quick fix when you don&#x27;t have time to shave in the shower.  </li>
            <li>I did get one pimple after using this shaver, but it went away quick.</li>
            <li>Arrived quickly.</li>
            <li>The product holds a charge for weeks on end and is convenient to take with me when I travel as well as to keep in the car for those quick touch ups.</li>
            <li>I kept it as a backup shaver but its not even adequate for that.</li>
            <li>At school and missed a spot shaving in the morning - out with the pocket shaver and a quick touch up.  </li>
            <li>and it still works (keep it in my desk for needful times), and the second one resides in my bug out bag toiletries bag and has seen more Army field time than many Staff NCOs.  </li>
            <li>Just a quick buzz and perfection is at hand.</li>
            <li>Satisfied with the product, i owned another model and hope this one is like the other one or maybe greater !</li>
            <li>and how quickly it does the job.&lt;br</li>
            <li>shaves per charge, so I was pondering a replacement when I ran across this extraordinarily inexpensive Braun.  </li>
            <li>Barely adequate is how I would describe the performance of this shaver.  </li>
            <li>Stopped working after less than a week ... which was very surprising as I have happily owned this type of Braun shaver in the past.</li>
            <li>nothing major, very smooth shave, still on original batteries.</li>
            <li>Expect great battery life but not a quick shave.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Never the less it doesn&#x27;t come close to the great feeling I got as using the Panasonic ES-LT41-K.  </li>
            <li>and the top has a folding cover -good for travel or a small bathroom.</li>
            <li>the blue color is kind of cool too).</li>
            <li>Given that it&#x27;s a portable shaver and not one for regular home use, I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s pretty good.  </li>
            <li>It can shave very close, and it glides easily over my skin.&lt;br</li>
            <li>very old and have used over the years for many months.&lt;br /&gt;What</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used the Braun MobileShave M-60 for two years now, and I&#x27;m ordering my first replacement!  </li>
            <li>I found it to be highly functional and effective and highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>Braun should publicize this far more than they do, and I only knew about by searching on the amazing website.</li>
            <li>They are cheap and give a really close shave.  </li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s well worth keeping in your messenger bag or brief case for touch ups, and it is a nice compact package (with \\&quot;on-board\\&quot; storage for a cleaning brush) for travel.</li>
            <li>Just keep the batteries fresh.</li>
            <li>the price this is definitely worth getting and atleast trying out.</li>
            <li>I have ordered two of these, different in colors and model however evenly alike and effective.  </li>
            <li>Not crazy that its battery powered</li>
            <li>This item works good, but seems to need repeated moves over the same area to really cut the bristles.</li>
            <li>Effective if used daily.  </li>
            <li>powerful.</li>
            <li>Its such a great design, and being Braun, I wouldn&#x27;t be surprised if Deiter Rammes was</li>
            <li>This is a nice addition to my shaver inventory, especially for travel.  </li>
            <li>This is not only reasonable but also compact and good shaving.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s worth having, I would tell the undecided.</li>
            <li>Worth the money</li>
            <li>This is better by far.</li>
            <li>i&#x27;m a wet shaver, but this is a good shaver to have when you&#x27;re away from the home.  </li>
            <li>just turning on, this shaver sounds much weaker than the Panasonic (I made sure to use fresh Duracell batteries), and it took much longer (10 passes) to shave than the Panasonic (4</li>
            <li>This cannot shave even close to a twenty year old, three head electric, and no where near as good as a blade, but in a pinch, while traveling, it can get you by.&lt;br</li>
            <li>it didn&#x27;t work, and wasn&#x27;t useful.</li>
            <li>Well worth the price.</li>
            <li>It fits in a small space, isn&#x27;t easily damaged and gives a suprisingly good shave</li>
            <li>Sure, it cannot compare with razors or other more powerful electrics, but what do you expect?  </li>
            <li>Based on the glowing reviews for this handy little guy, I thought it would be perfect for my purposes - touch-ups between shower razor shaving (usually don&#x27;t do everything every day).</li>
            <li>don&#x27;t know how long it will last, but immediate impressions are very good.</li>
            <li>It works best at a certain hair length though, but better than the rotating shavers I have used which required foam (if I didn&#x27;t want my skin to roughen up), extensive cleaning, and are generally more expensive.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried to find the right shaver for travel.</li>
            <li>Works well enough, and the waterproof feature makes it super easy to clean.</li>
            <li>have a light beard, and shaving once a day, it does a decent job for me.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>It took several passes, but was pretty effective on the mustache and chin area.</li>
            <li>Great little travel shaver!  </li>
            <li>(I can get a complete, very good shave in less than the 5 minutes it takes me to drive 2 miles to church on Sunday morning.)</li>
            <li>Once a hair gets a three day head start, only the trimmer or a straight razor will get at it.375 is slightly larger than the ones on the M60/90, but neither are very good for cleaning the shavers.</li>
            <li>Overall, for the price, this is an economical razor that is great for daily and or travel use.</li>
            <li>The Smart Foil makes a tremendous difference compared to the older-style foil.</li>
            <li>My love for this Braun shaver is not necessarily regarding the brand, yet rather it&#x27;s effectiveness in sustaining a CLEAN and respectable shave on a daily basis.</li>
            <li>This shaver consistently gives me a smooth, non-irritating shave, particularly when I use an electric pre-shave like Williams Lectric</li>
            <li>I had a choice of M60 (without trimmer) and M90 (with trimmer); since I hardly ever used trimmer in the old model I went for M60, which is cheaper and in my favorite color - blue.&lt;br /&gt;New layout of holes in the foil seems to work well - the new shaver does a very good job.</li>
            <li>DOES THE REPLACEMENT FOIL COST MORE THAN AN ENTIRE SHAVER?&lt;br /&gt;NOT VERY ECO-FRIENDLY THERE BRAUN!!</li>
            <li>/&gt;Basically it is worth the price, not a dollar more.&lt;br /&gt;Battery life is great, and it never irritates the skin, but it leaves quite a few hairs no matter how long they are and no matter how many times you go over them.</li>
            <li>Bought it to replace same model the I used for over seven years before it finally wore out, great value.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t like to spend very much for a travel shaver</li>
            <li>Takes a little time but effective and clean.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m doing more travel lately, and wanted something light and easy to travel with.  </li>
            <li>with lithium batteries this is about as good a little shaver as there is.</li>
            <li>Its a little noisy and the shave is not that close, but about as good as any sub $75 shaver.</li>
            <li>Good little shaver for the money.</li>
            <li>Wet shave (also used shaving gel) gave much more clean</li>
            <li>Maybe their expectations were too high or they were trying to get rid of a full beard...</li>
            <li>It does both although with the AA batteries it is pretty dense.</li>
            <li>The only drawback I can think of is that I haven&#x27;t been able to find replacement blades/foil.</li>
            <li>and they last many close shaves.  </li>
            <li>The latest problem is the last straw for me.  </li>
            <li>I first discovered them while on a trip to Germany and had forgotten to pack a razor.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t use if for daily shaving, rather for touching up areas I missed.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The foil is extremely comfortable and doesn&#x27;t give razor burn when you apply pressure like the old one did.  </li>
            <li>Thanks Braun!</li>
            <li>Be sure to save all the packaging for a while so you can send it back if it dies</li>
            <li>Highly recommend!!</li>
            <li>so I decided to get this M60B to replace the one that broke and have been using it for several months and really love it.  </li>
            <li>I have given these as gifts to my sons and they love using them as well and have stopped buying replacement blades and screens for their regular shavers.  </li>
            <li>For more than 15 years the only shaver I&#x27;ve used is a Braun Pocket Shaver.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll never go back :-)</li>
            <li>M60B follows in the M90s footsteps but now smaller and more refined.</li>
            <li>At first I was a bit skeptical, but I&#x27;ve had this for a couple months now and am impressed with its shave.</li>
            <li>Works well as a teenager&#x27;s first shaver.</li>
            <li>I purchased my first Braun M60 from Walgreens to see if it met my needs.</li>
            <li>I have used Energizer batteries for the first two 60 day battery replacements.</li>
            <li>Foil was torn and cut my son&#x27;s face the first time he tried it.</li>
            <li>this is the newer model was a lil worried at first but for the price i said i will give it a shot i did.</li>
            <li>When I first got this product, I looooooved it.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s well-made and last for many years.  </li>
            <li>It gets pretty close.</li>
            <li>Very Satisfied,Highly Recommend !</li>
            <li>The first one I bought in Victoria, AU and lasted for 8 years.</li>
            <li>Works better than bigger norelco.</li>
            <li>I was encouraged when I started shaving with it for the first time.</li>
            <li>I bought this for my son- his first shaver.  </li>
            <li>So, after testing it in multiple places on both legs to make sure (yes, I even tried cleaning it out which made zero difference)</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m willing to believe that perhaps I got a dud, so to speak.</li>
            <li>However, with that brand name I had much higher expectations.  </li>
            <li>Not too good for handling heavy, or think beards/facial hair.</li>
            <li>It gives a fairly close shave (not like a non-electric) and I have had razors that were VERY expensive and this one did ALMOST as good a job</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very compact and very sharp, as good or better than some standard razors you use at home in your bathroom.</li>
            <li>I returned the Remington Curve razor so highly recommended for women because it removed absolutely none of my leg hair stubble when used either  wet or dry, and replaced it with the Braun M-60, which is THE BEST ELECTRIC RAZOR I&#x27;ve ever used.  </li>
            <li>It does work and leaves me very smooth, but takes a long time and a number of passes.</li>
            <li>Good enough to be my regular shaver.</li>
            <li>This is satisfactory in every way but not as good as a more expensive razor.</li>
            <li>Battery life is good, the product shaves only moderately well.  </li>
            <li>This battery powered shaver works pretty much as described.</li>
            <li>This one does the job as long as I don&#x27;t let my beard grow for more than 2 days.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried many shavers in the past, and by far this works best for me -- I&#x27;ve been using it for numerous years as my only shaver, at home and elsewhere.  </li>
            <li>Like all electric shavers, the eventual end comes with the foil wearing out and developing holes --- but now apparently replacement foils are available.  </li>
            <li>(I DROPPED AND BROKE THE SHAVING FOIL ON THE OTHER ONE AFTER SEVERAL YEARS OF GREAT SERVICE.  </li>
            <li>razor is not designed for women, and it won&#x27;t work anywhere beyond the &#x27;light stubble&#x27; phase; but if you&#x27;re the type who prefers preemptive daily (or every other day) maintenance, this is more than up to the job!  </li>
            <li>Pretty nice little unit.</li>
            <li>It gives you a closer shave than you thought possible, and really does give you that, well feel and look of what I can only call a &amp;#34;Perfectly smooth face.&amp;#34; I love it beyond words, and the &amp;#34;Twist Cap&amp;#34; that protects the shaving head is genius.</li>
            <li>I liked the feeling of shaving very closely, but later I did not like so much because I have sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>Plus it runs on AA batteries which is easy to replace unlike regular shavers.  </li>
            <li>Had one previously and liked it.</li>
            <li>and they last a good long time, thus negating the lack of AC power and cost of disposable batteries.</li>
            <li>Just back from a road trip, 17 days on the set of Duracell AA&#x27;s that came with it and they&#x27;re still going strong.</li>
            <li>a large influence.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I certainly didn&#x27;t expect a closer shave than I get with a razor.</li>
            <li>This one is cleverly designed and works very, very well.</li>
            <li>I was hoping for an easy and fast shave, but you have to keep shaving the same spot over and over and still get some hair spots.</li>
            <li>This shaver is easy to hold, it&#x27;s quiet, and it shaves really close.</li>
            <li>I picked this shaver up not excepting much considering its modest price tag, so I was mildly amazed by</li>
            <li>This newer model has an improved &#x27;smartfoil&#x27; which actually seems to catch hairs slightly better and does a better job getting slightly longer hairs.</li>
            <li>These are fine for the cottage or on your daily</li>
            <li>It half shaves your face if you have any discernible facial hair - dish out more money for a better product.</li>
            <li>Unfortunately my main razor broke a foil after the first 2 weeks</li>
            <li>purchased this to replace my older Braun portable shaver that gave up after about 10 years!</li>
            <li>Well it is certainly convenient but will not give a very close shave</li>
            <li>Nice little shaver.</li>
            <li>Nice little on the go shaver.</li>
            <li>Its a nice little portable shaver to be used in a pinch.</li>
            <li>Pros: small form factor, good value, decent shave.</li>
            <li>(Amazing low price makes this totally feasible.)  </li>
            <li>motor is much weaker than a real Braun shaver.  </li>
            <li>If you really need trimmer, go for M90 instead.</li>
            <li>He loves this &amp;#34;pocket shaver&amp;#34; so much that he now carries it in his glove compartment for touch ups after work when we are meeting out for dinner</li>
            <li>We both highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li>Very affordable.</li>
            <li>/&gt;This is a well-made, very reasonably-priced electric razor.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li>But do you really want to chance it when your reputation is on the line</li>
            <li>He really enjoys it as well as my husband.</li>
            <li>and it has performed very well.</li>
            <li>that is so so so much closer than any electric.</li>
            <li>It really didn&#x27;t work well as I needed it for my husband who was dying of cancer</li>
            <li>I find myself going over and over the same area again and again to get that smooth finished feeling.  </li>
            <li>but when you are all by yourself in the car it really doesn&#x27;t matter.  </li>
            <li>Also, translucent plastic body looks similar to cheap plastic toys that shows inside batteries and circuit board.  </li>
            <li>Really like that the cover rotates and protects.</li>
            <li>the fit and finish is solid.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had these shavers before and really like them for touch ups or traveling.  </li>
            <li>The blade cannot be replaced, but if you clean it regularly, you can easily get 6 months of daily use from it before the blade is no longer functional.  </li>
            <li>I in no way ever allow my hairs to grow that much before trimming</li>
            <li>It is purse size and the price is reasonable.</li>
            <li>They cause the motors to run faster and are much lighter.</li>
            <li>I would give this product 5 stars if it had a popup trimmer, but I really like that it&#x27;s washable.</li>
            <li>but it was very portable.</li>
            <li>Thanks Braun.</li>
            <li>Replacing the whole unit was easier and cheaper than hunting for a foil and blade replacement.  </li>
            <li>better than i expected.</li>
            <li>It provides very acceptable close shaves  for the price.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m hoping the recipients like it as much as he does.</li>
            <li>Works absolutely fantastically.  </li>
            <li>Very well built and designed.....</li>
            <li>very often.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Figured I should let people know how much I like the shaver</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t reccomend it for shaving the whole head when doing a bald fade, but can be well used for taper fade on the side of the head.</li>
            <li>I used it today on my brother,  and it worked very well</li>
            <li>FAST SHIPPING AND THE SHAVER</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t expect a very close shave.  </li>
            <li>I bought it and tossed it in my glove compartment for those days when Murphy&#x27;s Law is really attacking you.</li>
            <li>Not so much on the neck and side of the face.</li>
            <li>Maybe this is because I used a real razor for a couple of months</li>
            <li>very close shave&lt;br /&gt;+  </li>
            <li>but it didn&#x27;t bother me too much</li>
            <li>it works very well for a travel razor.</li>
            <li>it is convenient and I use it very often.</li>
            <li>Their latest battery-powered travel shaver, the MobileShave M60B, is a definite improvement over my old PocketGo P-70.</li>
            <li>It does take a few minutes longer to shave but for this kind of money?</li>
            <li>It is nice to know that the works are well sealed, but wetting it still seem like asking for trouble.  </li>
            <li>It is nice to know that the works are well sealed, but wetting it still seem like asking for trouble.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only used it 7 times - in between days when I use a razor.&lt;br /&gt;Shave is as good as any other electric I have used.&lt;br /&gt;Batteries are still good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>They are reasonably priced, and last forever, and can be washed clean just by sticking the head under the faucet.</li>
            <li>I expected much more of the razor as I already have one older</li>
            <li>On my fine beard and angular face, it gives me a shave that is as smooth as any shaver I&#x27;ve ever used, and I&#x27;ve tried just about every brand and style all over the past 50 years.</li>
            <li>and I can&#x27;t argue with many of them other than to say this a NINE DOLLAR razor</li>
            <li>it won&#x27;t cut hair greater than 1/8 inch max, but neither do other shavers.  </li>
            <li>Although it was not exactly the same as my original, which I grew to love over its lifetime ...</li>
            <li>Well this pocket sized, extra powerful (Yeah!)</li>
            <li>The replacement foils (as noted by other reviewers) cost more than the device.</li>
            <li>I have to use a regular razor to clean up after using the electric.</li>
            <li>Keep the batteries out when not in use for prolonged life and clean it regularly.  </li>
            <li>how long this runs on the 2 AA batteries (especially lithium), and it&#x27;s my experience that it always works effectively.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;d been using the Venus Embrace manual razors, which are truly the best manual razor for women but are so expensive, but I&#x27;m having knee replacement soon and wanted an electric razor to use after surgery as I won&#x27;t be able to get my leg wet for several days and my leg hair will get out of hand if I don&#x27;t shave.  </li>
            <li>Running the flexible foil against my hair-growth pattern with light or gentle pressure keeps me ready-for-summer all year long!</li>
            <li>/&gt;It is a little larger and heavier than I would have liked, but I think the convenience is worth it.</li>
            <li>Good for both dry and wet shaving on the go or traveling.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s okay, not worth the hassle of returning.  </li>
            <li>Not sure how good it would be for a full beard; I get the feeling from other reviews that it might not be up to the job.</li>
            <li>The foil design seems newer and better than the previous M30 I have.</li>
            <li>The result is clean and smooth as expected for the daily course off to work in the morning.</li>
            <li>I bought the M-60 as a backup to my main razor since I was traveling out of country and shaving every day is a must.  </li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t shave as close as the older Braun 370 Pocket shaver I had to replace.  </li>
            <li>It also doesn&#x27;t have a trimmer like the older one, which I didn&#x27;t realize when I bought it.  </li>
            <li>I just don&#x27;t think this type of foil blade works as well with my particular face.</li>
            <li>After 3 months of use mainly at the gym, I noticed rusted screw heads when you remove the head cover.  </li>
            <li>I gave this razor to a friend of mine who is transgender (male to female) and they really love it.  </li>
            <li>I expect it to be decent based on the reviews.</li>
            <li>Use this razor daily, have one at work, car, home, seem to last a year or more, just change batteries as needed</li>
            <li>Replaced an older Braun Pocket Shaver.  </li>
            <li>so I wouldn&#x27;t mind having it as my main shaver.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m buying a second one because it&#x27;s good to have a few of them, so if it&#x27;s lost or stolen</li>
            <li>It is well built and does a decent job of getting rid of the whiskers.  </li>
            <li>Better than some more expensive electric shavers, cheaper than cartridge razors.  </li>
            <li>and I particularly like the fact that you con replace batts.</li>
            <li>The Braun is not nearly as loud, which is relevant since I normally shave while watching TV.  </li>
            <li>Another Braun product that I can Highly Recommend.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend this unit.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this to anyone.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this shaver.</li>
            <li>So, the Braun gives me a good electric shave...which is roughly as close as a wet shave leaves me after my beard has grown all day!</li>
            <li>Love this little mavel.</li>
            <li>This little shaver works about as well as those costing $70 or more.</li>
            <li>It gives a nice close shave and also because of its size it shaves in the hard to reach places.  </li>
            <li>But this one doesn&#x27;t have the little slide open sideburn trimmer, which really comes in handy sometimes.</li>
            <li>Not much else to say here, I can vouch the batteries were good because they were brand new and worked in the other shaver I bought.</li>
            <li>but when these work they are a remarkably cheap and work as well as could be expected under the circumstances.</li>
            <li>At a cheaper price for this whole unit than just the replacement blades for my old Remington, I&#x27;ll just buy another one of these when the blades or foil wear out.</li>
            <li>So far it has worked very well.  </li>
            <li>dont go more then a few days with out shaving</li>
            <li>I guess normal coarseness</li>
            <li>and I this has me looking normal again in minutes.  </li>
            <li>The second (this model) has a psychedelic screen pattern that is less effective than the older style and which has worn out.  </li>
            <li>it does not do well 1-2 Day no shave if you have a nice thick beard come in like me.</li>
            <li>this is a good shaver, not a great shaver.  </li>
            <li>Not a huge deal b/c it was a stocking stuffer and it was after all - cheap!</li>
            <li>It lasted for most of his deployment before it gave out but they are not at all expensive and easily replaced.</li>
            <li>or if you have no time to dry.&lt;br /&gt;I strongly recommend replacing provided regular Duracell batteries with lithium AA Energizer batteries - they are lighter, last longer</li>
            <li>The shaver has such low skin irritation that doing that would be just fine.</li>
            <li>Pretty decent blades, overall.  </li>
            <li>This new Braun rides with me in the morning and saves prep time at home.</li>
            <li>No matter if the razor was new, had new heads or foil</li>
            <li>so I opened my brand new M-60.  </li>
            <li>This is with new Duracells</li>
            <li>and I think Braun&#x27;s new hole pattern on the foil does help.</li>
            <li>Works like a new..</li>
            <li>Knowing he needed a new shaver for the car...</li>
            <li>I was cheaper to buy a  new one</li>
            <li>When he was not deployed it lasted for a lot longer before he needed a new one.</li>
            <li>Its cheaper to buy a new unit, then buy the micro film.</li>
            <li>If the foil lasts longer than a year (new brand)</li>
            <li>It is cheaper to buy a new one of these items rather than replace an parts.</li>
            <li>The new one is mostly plastic rather than the heavy metal of the old one.</li>
            <li>I should buy another one for when I wear out the studs on the foil cap snapping and unsnapping it to clean it every day (like I said, not really accustomed to the waterproofness yet)</li>
            <li>(it details features available across several different models, but does not indicate which models have which features, or what the features of this shaver specifically are).</li>
            <li>How many times have I left my home to discover - as I touched my chin, or just under my nose, that I&#x27;d not really shaved that part of my face.</li>
            <li>I found it more frustrating than it&#x27;s worth.  </li>
            <li>It works just fine in dry shave, although takes little longer and not as neat &amp; clean.  </li>
            <li>I just usually have a nice Razor shave then, just keep it up daily with this bad boy, impressive power for (2) AA battery powered shaver.</li>
            <li>I find this shaver very useful especially for trimming above my lip and below my nose.  </li>
            <li>Compared to the 7 series this is not bad at all, the only downside being that you have to manually clean it somewhat frequently, and it eats through the little batteries like they&#x27;re candy.</li>
            <li>Works pretty good, but bogs down alot if you put hardly any pressure on it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a long-time Braun user (currently I&#x27;m using a Series 5 550cc), but I&#x27;ll be first to admit some of their models have problems.</li>
            <li>I have several other brands an this one works better than do.</li>
            <li>Exactly what I needed for carry on when I can not bring my double edge razor.</li>
            <li>The Braun Pocket Shaver, model M60B, is so useful for grooming after a long day at work when one has no time to return home before an evening&#x27;s engagement.  </li>
            <li>First of all, I got it on next day after order.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s the second one I have owned; the first one still working too.</li>
            <li>This works well enough, but consistent with size and price</li>
            <li>Actually, its the 3rd such I have had over many years.  </li>
            <li>Traditional shaving methods dictate one should never shave against the natural hair growth, but everybody knows that&#x27;s the only way to get a smooth shave.</li>
            <li>The shave itself is generally good so long, as you use a pre shave lotion and youI press fairly hard against your beard  </li>
            <li>Talcum powder that collects inside is easily knocked loose and/or blown from the internal blade parts and skin oils and bits go with it.  </li>
            <li>Talcum powder that collects inside is easily knocked loose and/or blown from the internal blade parts and skin oils and bits go with it.  </li>
            <li>it was also comfortable and didn&#x27;t leave any razor burns like my previous electric razor</li>
            <li>Since getting away from full facial hair I&#x27;ve used a variety of blades, both disposable and not and finally decided to give the ole lectro razor a shot.</li>
            <li>really good little razor, not super quality</li>
            <li>Even my most recent is down to 2</li>
            <li>Nonetheless, at such a reasonable price, when I damage or wear out a foil I just buy a new razor.</li>
            <li>This shaver has a very clever and functional design, especially for the price.  </li>
            <li>I only use it to shave certain areas,but it cleans thaose areas up nicely,and I like the fact it has a flip screen saver attached to it.</li>
            <li>This shaver is no good enough, I should invested a little more $10 or $20 more and get something decent.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s hard to find in most stores now.  </li>
            <li>Wasn&#x27;t a huge waste of money.</li>
            <li>I am unsure but if you only need a touch up or early morning shaving (or that 5:00 shadow) then this will work very well.&lt;br /&gt;Very</li>
            <li>Old one wore out</li>
            <li>VERY close shaves, 2 AA batteries last, literally, for a month or two.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>In any case, no, it&#x27;s not a perfect shaver, but considering how inexpensive (I did NOT say cheap) and small it is, it&#x27;s a really good value for my normal(?)</li>
            <li>In truth, I do not know if my old device was water resistant and never tried.&lt;br</li>
            <li>(I ruined one of the old style foils just washing it).</li>
            <li>This shaver gives a very close shave provided the stubble is short.  </li>
            <li>but I think you&#x27;re going to lose the shavers battle with the old foil design</li>
            <li>Beware of standard version Coppertop brand batteries and ever ready batteries because they leak.</li>
            <li>Foil only lasts a few years , but its really for on the go light stubble not every day..</li>
            <li>I was quite pleasantly surprised as this is a battery powered travel shaver</li>
            <li>invariably end up drawing some blood, &amp;#34;for sensitive skin&amp;#34; claims of razor-shaving products notwithstanding.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m surprised Braun put their name on it.</li>
            <li>This portable shaver is very well designed and works well enough for the money.</li>
            <li>the foil developed a tear after 1 week.</li>
            <li>375 is about 4 years old.</li>
            <li>Once a hair gets a three day head start, only the trimmer or a straight razor will get at it.</li>
            <li>He has sensitive skin with</li>
            <li>it was rechargeable, but it did not work nearly as well.  </li>
            <li>I have a heavy beard but still get a close comfortable shave.</li>
            <li>Not as well as a real, blade shave, but it gets the basic job done.</li>
            <li>My facial hair is very controllable so its never going to be put through its paces.</li>
            <li>Not only that, not having to recharge is very valuable.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m surprised how well it works.  </li>
            <li>Once a week I put liquid soap on the blade, put the foil on, and let it run, rinsing it, and use the brush to complete cleaning it.</li>
            <li>(work days) for about three years until the foil finally developed a tear / hole and began to grab the hair.  </li>
            <li>In my opinion, complete garbage.  </li>
            <li>last a couple months if you shave fast, so you won&#x27;t have to do a drug deal with your mafia supply sergeant</li>
            <li>The folil alone costs almost as much as the entire razor.  </li>
            <li>I even love the use of common AA batts instead of rechargeables, but...</li>
            <li>So far, he loves it.</li>
            <li>Shaver arrived and it was complete with a set of batteries.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>There are non-whisker hairs (softer, lying close to the skin) in a couple areas near my beard which I also wish to shave.  </li>
            <li>The Panasonic has no problem with the soft hairs, since one of its 3 heads is a slotted head.  </li>
            <li>The majority of them provided a mediocre shave, but were good for touch ups in the evening.</li>
            <li>Works well, just as good as any expensive shaver.  </li>
            <li>Plain and simple this is a great little travel shaver.  </li>
            <li>This is my second or third Braun travel shaver, that should say something right there.</li>
            <li>I had an old Krups shaver way back when that was dirt cheap and worked extremely well.  </li>
            <li>This just glides over the curls and barely works on new hair growth.</li>
            <li>I use an old toothbrush to clean the head after each shave, and lube the screen with a few drops of &#x27;lectric shave before each use.</li>
            <li>In years past they never leaked in current years they frequently do ruining many of my devices.</li>
            <li>This is a handy little shaver for touching up on the go when you&#x27;re running a little late.</li>
            <li>More for thinner or less coarse facial hair.</li>
            <li>this small shaver is fine for me as a woman.</li>
            <li>The first thing to break will be the screen and a replacement screen cost about the same as an entire razor.</li>
            <li>The batteries last a decent amount of time.</li>
            <li>It gets weak without strong batteries!  </li>
            <li>The main change, other than color and lack of the little push-out trimmer, is the newer Design Smart Foil like many of the more expensive Series shavers.</li>
            <li>Low price, high performance.</li>
            <li>This little shaver has turned into my everyday shaver, it cuts close and clean and the battery life is tremendous.</li>
            <li>It works ok but not nearly as good as a razor.  </li>
            <li>just went on a month long trip to China, and one set of batteries lasted the whole trip.</li>
            <li>I found that I had to use it repeatedly and turn it perpendicular relative to a normal razor you might get a semi-decent shave.</li>
            <li>The cleaning brush is housed firmly at the bottom of the unit, and the flip-up travel/storage/protective cap is attached and locks solidly over the top of the unit, protecting it with no additional bulk or extra parts.  </li>
            <li>Little brush stowed at the bottom of the body lets you do quick cleaning when there is no water</li>
            <li>It won&#x27;t replace a blade or your main shaver, but it will keep the stubble down to a reasonable level.</li>
            <li>I find it hard to completely bash something that is this cheap and</li>
            <li>It was my third Pocket Shaver--cheaper to buy a new shaver than replacement foil and cutter.</li>
            <li>I wonder how much Duracell paid Braun to include &amp;#34;we recommend Duracell batteries&amp;#34; in the manual&amp;#34; - nobody with even basic technical knowledge believes statements like this.&lt;br /&gt;Summary -</li>
            <li>Fantastic battery operated shaver, I not only use it for travelling but everyday.</li>
            <li>Very compact, low noise, and easy to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have very coarse facial hair and the Braun M60b worked like a charm wet and/or dry.</li>
            <li>It finally gave out and I really wanted the same identical one but couldn&#x27;t find a replacement, so</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s bigger, bulkier and doesn&#x27;t shave nearly as close as the one that was 19 years old.  </li>
            <li>A reasonable shave on my moderate facial growth.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s clever, though it doesn&#x27;t keep shavings out of my toilet kit.  </li>
            <li>I charge the two double a batteries every Sunday, and they last for the whole week.</li>
            <li>Because its head is smaller, it takes somewhat longer to shave with the Braun; but I really don&#x27;t care about that, since I am watching TV at the same time anyway.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have particularly thick facial hair, but perhaps others will have better luck.</li>
            <li>I was very surprised at how well this thing works given its very low price.  </li>
            <li>It provides a clean close shave and doesn&#x27;t turn your neck into a red bumpy mess.  </li>
            <li>and you have no other options?</li>
            <li>the folil only when the cost of the entire unit was almost exactly the same</li>
            <li>Servicing the built in batteries is not economically feasible, since replacing the whole unit also buys you new heads.  </li>
            <li>For the price I expected it to be less than perfect but not at all useless.</li>
            <li>Small, portable, battery driven and clean shaving all in one package.</li>
            <li>I owned one of the older battery powered Braun shavers and it lasted a surprisingly long time.</li>
            <li>I had an older one for a long time.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not just good for a &amp;#34;dumpster face&amp;#34; but is a quick cure for &amp;#34;stubble trouble.&amp;#34; You know, when you believe you shaved immaculately only to discover in the midst of the morning rush hour an annoying stubble that had eluded you.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t get the coarse hair only the real fine, thin whiskers...</li>
            <li>/&gt;Just don&#x27;t expect shaving experience from more expensive and high performing shaver or razor.</li>
            <li>I generally have to replace the batteries every 2 months.</li>
            <li>Not really used to the whole waterproof thing yet</li>
            <li>old one worked well and is still in daily use.  </li>
            <li>I use a much larger one from an old Braun.&lt;br /&gt;If</li>
            <li>I use a much larger one from an old Braun.&lt;br /&gt;If</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only had it for a month or so, but so far it works flawlessly.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>The only thing I wish if it has side trimmber like its old models do.</li>
            <li>It does a good job of cutting what the razor misses and of lunchtime and evening touch ups.</li>
            <li>I have really tried to give them a fair trial but have been disappointed time and again.  </li>
            <li>Helps to protect the foils when not in use (probably the first thing to break down on shavers like these), and it saves the hassle of taking it in and out of a separate case.</li>
            <li>Otherwise, this bad boy is amazingly close and the foil design is such that it allows you to apply pressure in just the right ways while shaving.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The Braun M60B is essentially the same device with added features of twist cap (never detaches so it can&#x27;t be lost), new geometric pattern foil, and washability;</li>
            <li>The new foil makes a big difference in closeness and an even bigger difference in comfort.</li>
            <li>Got my first in Germany, never went back to any other company.</li>
            <li>it is very small and just had a cheap appearance.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know what other brands or makes of electric shavers claim to do/are capable of.</li>
            <li>/&gt;UPDATE: the foil developed holes after a solid year of nearly daily use.</li>
            <li>Otherwise the shaver will not dry thoroughly and develope an odor.</li>
            <li>And hairs that get missed quickly become too long for the foil to catch, so things were a little untidy after a couple of weeks.</li>
            <li>got a little razor burn feel the first time but</li>
            <li>little Panasonic travel shaver or the Silver Remington shaver give a much closer shave and they are cheaper!</li>
            <li>This little gem has been in my office drawer for almost two years now and has not failed me yet.  </li>
            <li>It suspect this new shaver will last as long.</li>
            <li>, it is the length- shave everyday and the product functions as advertised, wait a day or two and the economy electronic device you just purchased may not perform as well as a much higher priced unit.</li>
            <li>Shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought my first model 375 when I discovered that it cost less than a replacement cutter and foil for my more expensive Braun corded shaver.</li>
            <li>I keep this in my briefcase for quick touch ups late in the day and travel.</li>
            <li>I usually shave with a double blade every other day, but with this shaver, I popped in the 2 provided batteries and shave once a day...easy and just fine...</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d purchased the exact same shaver a long time ago, kept it in the pickup, used it all the time, finally got dulled down.</li>
            <li>Small, light, convenient and protects itself with a folding cover that means I can just throw it in a bag with other stuff.</li>
            <li>This is a very cooly designed little shaver.</li>
            <li>I needed small shaver for a trip to a conference and foil in my older Braun pocket shaver (6 years old)</li>
            <li>bought this to replace a very cheap generic shaver I bought from superdrug, and sadly I think I will have to go back to using it.</li>
            <li>They come in different colors and some have the little sideburn trimmer, but really, do you need that?</li>
            <li>You&#x27;re running horribly late, it&#x27;s an important meeting, but you look like you spent the last month sleeping in a dumpster.</li>

            <li> My husband thinks it&#x27;s great.</li>
            <li> great for travel use</li>
            <li> because it uses 2 AA, power isn&#x27;t so great</li>
            <li> and he&#x27;s happy with it.  </li>
            <li> a GREAT shaver in it&#x27;s class&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> Great Price.</li>
            <li> Very handy and</li>
            <li> When I have to head into work on a sunday at 7:30am, it&#x27;s very nice to have this thing in the glove box to trim myself up.</li>
            <li> Very handy.</li>
            <li> If find that is gives a very nice shave.</li>
            <li> A superb device -- I&#x27;ve owned many shavers, including ones costing well over $100.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Best of luck to all men and ladies, Treat your face with love and tender care.</li>
            <li> For the price it&#x27;s a remarkable piece of technology - when it works.</li>
            <li> It would be perfect ... but the foil damages easily.</li>
            <li> Good price from a good brand.  </li>
            <li> Good product.</li>
            <li> Excellent light duty shaver, for pocket, auto or briefcase.&lt;br /&gt;Use</li>
            <li> It has, surprisingly, given just as good a shave as my Braun 3 Series shaver.</li>
            <li> Good for on the go.</li>
            <li> I have never had good results with electric razors.</li>
            <li> I detail my mustache to a good extent with the Braun</li>
            <li> Shaves as good as the $98 brand named rotary I got as a gift.</li>
            <li> This is a compact battery powered razor that provides a good close shave.</li>
            <li> Good razor.</li>
            <li> you&#x27;re on budget and searching for a good travel shaver</li>
            <li> Good Buy.</li>
            <li> Good value for product</li>
            <li> I have yet to figure out what it is good for.</li>
            <li> The battery life is good considering what you&#x27;re asking it to do, but rechargeables are the order of the day.</li>
            <li> Not as close as a blade, but good for an electric.</li>
            <li> The shaver appears to be of good quality.  </li>
            <li> Before that I used a $10 knock-off from a Chinatown that worked surprisingly well.</li>
            <li> It gives a good shave too</li>
            <li> However, this is good for what it does.</li>
            <li> Lightweight is good.  </li>
            <li> and it is good for the price.</li>
            <li> This shaver is really good for when it comes to doing bald taper fades, or cleaning on the neck where the neck taper is at.</li>
            <li> factor, batteries, cover...all good.  </li>
            <li> For its purpose, as a portable travel shaver, the shaver does a good job</li>
            <li> /&gt;Trust me, this is a really good travel razor</li>
            <li> Maybe good for a camping trip???</li>
            <li> Definitely a good buy.</li>
            <li> Once a week or so, it is good to use the brush for any buildup that might occur (e.g., between the blades of the shaving block).  </li>
            <li> Once a week or so, it is good to use the brush for any buildup that might occur (e.g., between the blades of the shaving block).  </li>
            <li> This shaver is good using it every day.</li>
            <li> A good mobile razor.  </li>
            <li> Good design.  </li>
            <li> A fair price.  </li>
            <li> This shaver works best when running at full speed.</li>
            <li> Battery life is very good and replacing them is easy.  </li>
            <li> Performs super!!!</li>
            <li> I have had one unit for many years and it still works great.</li>
            <li> Worked great, and i love the guard that snaps in to place to protect the blades.</li>
            <li> Loved that this item came with batteries, it was a nice touch.  </li>
            <li> Quite good and handy for a foil shaver.</li>
            <li> The Braun gives a good, close and reasonably comfortable shave; not quite as good as a Norelco but good.</li>
            <li> This thing cuts better than any 3,5,or 7 series shaver Braun makes and it is cheaper than the replacement blade!  </li>
            <li> Purchased 3 more for my sons !</li>
            <li> Love the battery operation instead of having to recharge every time I use it !</li>
            <li> It works like a charm, and make sure you change your batteries after one month or two months of using!  </li>
            <li> Inexpensive and better than a $90 razor according to my husband!</li>
            <li> and it goes on for more than a month!</li>
            <li> Cleans easy, dependable, great design.  </li>
            <li> A fine shaver that I got  at a great price ....</li>
            <li> buying from Amazon is amazing.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s amazing</li>
            <li> for the price, this thing works amazing.</li>
            <li> Anyone want to but a Braun pocket shaver REAL cheap?</li>
            <li> and you don&#x27;t have replacements handy in your hotel</li>
            <li> and he can&#x27;t come home to shave - also handy for mornings when he realizes he &amp;#34;missed a spot&amp;#34; as he is driving to work.  </li>
            <li> The sliding cover is a nice touch as well.</li>
            <li> The MobileShave gives a surprisingly good shave, but like most Braun single-foil shavers it will miss some longer hairs on your neck.</li>
            <li> Handy size and works well.</li>
            <li> Nice unit.  </li>
            <li> I can recommend this shaver to anyone needing a nice cordless option.</li>
            <li> The shaver itself does a nice job.  </li>
            <li> Perhaps shavers using 2 AAs are all kind of noisy.</li>
            <li> How nice * Jesus&#x27; Blessings and Peace</li>
            <li> It works fairly well if you re-educate yourself about the fact that you are using a $9 razor and that you may not be able to use it like a $150 Braun or Panasonic razor.</li>
            <li> Nice thing is it runs on AA&#x27;s</li>
            <li> Nice design.</li>
            <li> This is a handy shaver for the car and travel.  </li>
            <li> adopt it as my own if it does not get touched by him...</li>
            <li> Nice color, though.</li>
            <li> By contrast, the inch-long straight trimmer on the 375 is perfect for trimming sideburns.</li>
            <li> But both razors do a nice job.</li>
            <li> but it should be handy for traveling My son</li>
            <li> Is the shaver better than a good razor: no, but it comes darn close.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It is really nice that this shaver is not one of them.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Switching from the Pro glide to this has saved me over the $100 that a nice Braun is going to cost me.</li>
            <li> if you get 5 o&#x27;clock shadow by 3 and have a meeting at 4, this will tidy you up a bit for the meeting.  </li>
            <li> He&#x27;s not to thrilled with it..</li>
            <li> BRAUN POCKET SHAVER is the best work for months on two battery, very close shave, you can take it with you on the trip or just anywhere.</li>
            <li> Own two.</li>
            <li> compact, nice flip cover, and close shave.</li>
            <li> I was hoping to keep this in my desk at work for days where I didn&#x27;t think I needed to look nice</li>
            <li> He didn&#x27;t seem thrilled either.</li>
            <li> In the beginning I liked the BRAUN POCKET SHAVER,2xAA,CAP - WASHABLE, M60B  </li>
            <li> nice shaver, don&#x27;t wash anything electrical</li>
            <li> I expect it will be especially useful on those overnight flights and train</li>
            <li> Both cheap and good for shaving, transparent body is very beautiful, but also body wash, very convenient.</li>
            <li> Great for travel, I keep one in my car for a quick shave if needed.</li>
            <li> great unit for the car and quick touch ups</li>
            <li> Good price, works well, easily portable</li>
            <li> VERY easy to use.</li>
            <li> When traveling I sometimes carry spare AA batteries, but they are very easy to find in all countries.</li>
            <li> Nicely made, very comfortable.</li>
            <li> I liked the older one better but for a travel shaver its the best I have tried, battery life is good and it gives a pretty good shave plus being waterproof is a bonus</li>
            <li> And the price is right!!!</li>
            <li> and I hope that they continue to make large amounts of cash and become very wealthy and happy for the rest of their lives.</li>
            <li> I travel a lot, love this nice compact Frazer.</li>
            <li> Cheap and good.</li>
            <li> This unit does not shave hairs that have lasted over a day effectively or those that have grown any more than a 1/4 inch from my face.</li>
            <li> It does not snag or pull hairs and does an excellent job of not missing hairs.  </li>
            <li> This is a just ok shaver, just as good as the rest of electric shavers but the price is right and it is good for travel camping or for that afternoon touch me up</li>
            <li> This Braun Pocket Shaver is inexpensive and the perfect item for the person who wants to travel light.  </li>
            <li> But it is important that you use strong fresh batteries to keep it at its best.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t think Braun made such a shaver, but was happy to see the great reviews on this and ordered it.  </li>
            <li> It is working good and clean.</li>
            <li> These are are great because they work, they are dependable, and they are easy to clean.  </li>
            <li> Great for a first time shaver.</li>
            <li> Handy and easy to operate.  </li>
            <li> it is best used as a back-up shaver in your travel shaving kit, with extra batteries stored in the kit too.</li>
            <li> and you can keep them in the shaver for many years without leaking.</li>
            <li> for travel, it is the best electric shaver I have owned (an I tried 5 different brands/types).</li>
            <li> This one is actually better.  </li>
            <li> overall good product great of on the road or in a carry on.</li>
            <li> so you can bring it with you and shave again in a bathroom somewhere at 4pm to look better for dinner.</li>
            <li> ...and much more efficient than buying a screen and cutter block for a razor whose model number I can&#x27;t remember...and so on.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t need a razor for travel like most of these reviewers probably did</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;d always cut myself, I&#x27;ve tried a couple of electric shavers (rechargeable and wired) and the rechargeable one did ok</li>
            <li> and it takes AA batteries instead of AAA which cost a bit more</li>
            <li> It also seems more rugged</li>
            <li> okay</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m satisfied</li>
            <li> and there.&lt;br /&gt;I used a better model of Braun shaver before</li>
            <li> Most have removable foil covers that get lost or fall off at some point.</li>
            <li> Like this better then the throw away&#x27;s</li>
            <li> Love this shaver.</li>
            <li> I am pleased</li>
            <li> use this exclusively for my upper lip to keep away the stache, and it is absolutely perfect for this.</li>
            <li> I am thoroughly pleased with this shaver.  </li>
            <li> great shaver and a very close shave</li>
            <li> The 370 was/is a great travel shaver, so much that hubby uses it almost every day instead of his $120 shaver.</li>
            <li> For the cost of this disposable shaver, I would have to play more the replace the blades and screen on my Braun shaver.  </li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> The swivel cover is perfect for traveling, the AA batteries last many days, it shaves as close as any electric I have owned.  </li>
            <li> trimmer-- better trimmer than the one on the M90.</li>
            <li> keep my 375 in the car where I did most of my shaving on my commute to work.</li>
            <li> I use the M90 more often.</li>
            <li> I skip shaving for more than two days, I find that this shaver misses some hairs.</li>
            <li> I skip shaving for more than two days, I find that this shaver misses some hairs.</li>
            <li> I love the design of the shaver, where you can just rotate the cover on and off.</li>
            <li> uses 2 AA copper top bats...provided with it.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been able to get from it.</li>
            <li> But if you let your bear grow more than a day or two, is does not shaves well.</li>
            <li> Smooth shave too!</li>

            <li> But wait more than 24 hours</li>
            <li> For the price I guess I did ok.</li>
            <li> Does an ok job in an emergency.</li>
            <li> I love it.  </li>
            <li> I have purchased many shaveers over the years but none give the shave this one does.</li>
            <li> However, after shaving with both, I realized the inexpensive M60 was doing a much better job.</li>
            <li> It may make more sense to use rechargeable batteries.</li>
            <li> What&#x27;s interesting..</li>
            <li> And in China, the power is not always available and if you have a bunch of things to recharge, it is nice to have something that has AA batteries instead.</li>
            <li> I would say it&#x27;s better than I imagined</li>
            <li> What more can I say.</li>
            <li> you miss a day, you will be better off getting out the manual razor and cream.</li>
            <li> In fact, I&#x27;ve had shavers that cost much more that did not shave as well.</li>
            <li> He keeps it in the car and mostly uses it to touch up spots that he realizes he missed in the morning.  </li>
            <li> and I look forward to many many more.</li>
            <li> i have lathered up and used this shaver, and it does do a better job that way.  </li>
            <li> i&#x27;ll try my eneloops when the duracells die, but i suspect the duracells will give me more power for a better shave.</li>
            <li> I will have to get him a better one for Christmas.</li>
            <li> I am well satisfied with my purchase.</li>
            <li> As that famous ad slogan says about another product, &amp;#34;Don&#x27;t leave your home without (the Braun pocket shaver)</li>
            <li> This shaver is much better than the price would have you believe.</li>
            <li> Bought this to replace a Braun portable that I&#x27;ve used for many years...</li>
            <li> Seemed like no matter how many times I went over those areas</li>
            <li> I love the design and the weight and</li>
            <li> I find it not quite able to get the job done.  </li>
            <li> much more closer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> , what more can you ask for?</li>
            <li> Works much better than i thought it would</li>
            <li> Fantastic product!</li>
            <li> I have one in front of the mirror in the bathroom, one in the suitcase and have bought 2 more as gifts.</li>
            <li> The drier the skin and whiskers the better.  </li>
            <li> The drier the skin and whiskers the better.  </li>
            <li> I have used a rotary for years, but have never been totally satisfied with the closeness of the shave.  </li>
            <li> and I couldn&#x27;t be more</li>
            <li> and you have a winning combination.</li>
            <li> This one has been my go-to field shaver for almost 7 years- keep it clean with some water, blow it out, brush off the blades with the toothbrush of your favorite Soldier- Good2Go for another month!  </li>
            <li> I use it as a quick follow-up to the rotary and have been very pleased with the result.  </li>
            <li> It is portable, cute and shaves very clean.</li>
            <li> I bought it when I was travelling and forgot my Philips shaver at home (a great one btw) and thought I could use this one to get a decent shave.&lt;br /&gt;Ohh</li>
            <li> I would recommend it highly; it makes a great gift.  </li>
            <li> The Model 370 was so good, I&#x27;m willing to give the M90 a shot.  </li>
            <li> Braun always puts out a good shaver and this is my 3rd one and it is great for a light one.</li>
            <li> This is the most fabulous awesome thing I have ever bought in my entire life.</li>
            <li> Does a pretty good job, too.  </li>
            <li> I love the way this shaver is designed with a built in cover and easy access to the batteries.</li>
            <li> It is extremely easy to clean, comes with its own brush and can be washed under water.  </li>
            <li> Even more incredible to me, is the fact that I ordered it one day and, hey presto, I got it the next day!</li>
            <li> The very low price was surprising since Braun has a good reputation.  </li>
            <li> Made well,easy to clean !</li>
            <li> Not as close as a blade on my cheeks and neck, but perfectly acceptable, and better than any other electric shaver I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li> The original batteries are still going strong!</li>
            <li> , the battery compartment doesn&#x27;t seem to make good contact, as certain time the unit did not turn on and I have to shake it to get the battery engaged.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The cleaning brush on the 375 is slightly larger than the ones on the M60/90, but neither are very good for cleaning the shavers.</li>
            <li> Easy to clean, very easy to use</li>
            <li> these are my favorite can wait to shave for that smooth baby but feel.</li>
            <li> I can spend 30 minutes passing over my beard and shaved head, it will make lots of lovely buzzing sounds, and it will sound like hair is being cut, but it does not cut anything.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> If I let my face go more than 3 days it struggles, but if I keep up with it, the M60 does a fantastic job.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Just as expected - great shaver!</li>
            <li> Glad mine was a free sample.</li>
            <li> /&gt;For more detailed evaluation, let me compare to a Panasonic 3 head rechargeable shaver I have.  </li>
            <li> Braun shaves closer than my Panasonic, and it glides more smoothly over my skin.  </li>
            <li> Good design, shaves very well.</li>
            <li> Good shaver,  I use it for travel and because I don&#x27;t have to carry the AC cord around, it is very convenient.  </li>
            <li> It is easy to carry around, What about the effect of the shave, only my husband knows, but the workmanship is very good.</li>
            <li> well, easy clean up, and not CUTS!</li>
            <li> got to me super fast and works great</li>
            <li> Excellent dry shave using light pressure.</li>
            <li> easy on batteries; easy to use; clean shave!  </li>
            <li> I bought it based on other reviews and for me, after a couple of months of use, it has been perfect.</li>
            <li> Cool design though!</li>
            <li> THe design makes it easy to pack,</li>
            <li> and I wanted something to shave him with that would be easy to use and do the job.</li>
            <li> I have all of the battery operated shavers, this and the Panasonic are the best built and most practical everyday shavers ot them all.</li>
            <li> that are easy to find and easy to replace.</li>
            <li> /&gt;+  uses 2 AA battery, easy to replace.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Washable, hardy, durable and easy to carry around.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I strongly advise putting it in a Ziploc bag and storing the batteries separately otherwise when it&#x27;s not used overtime the batteries can leak and ruin it as it did to my son&#x27;s version.</li>
            <li> So good that is beats my main nolreo tri head.</li>
            <li> It seems to still run strong and do its job</li>
            <li> so I don&#x27;t have strong comparison.  </li>
            <li> The fact that the Braun&#x27;s batteries were user-replaceable was a strong selling point for me.  </li>
            <li> This is hands down the best electric shaver that I have ever used.</li>
            <li> But it&#x27;s a battery shaver as good as any other and one can stay on top of ones beard by keeping it handy.</li>
            <li> It has been working fine as a travel shaver; like the size and weight.</li>
            <li> All in all, this is a fine low-cost shaver</li>
            <li> and it worked fine for that, too.</li>
            <li> Braun makes a fine product.</li>
            <li> They work fine on 2 AA batteries.</li>
            <li> Works fine.</li>
            <li> and they are still working fine.  </li>
            <li> Two stars instead of one because perhaps the item I received was defective somehow, and intact models work fine?</li>
            <li> It came quick and is packaged in a box with a tab at the top like it would be hung on a peg at the drug store.</li>
            <li> close shave easy to clean and easy to use.</li>
            <li> Attached brush easy to remove to clean cutter, saw no need to wash, Easy to hold and use.</li>
            <li> i liked the protective cap but shave is not as close as the Sanyo( that was supposed to be a &amp;#34;backup&amp;#34; if Airline lost my main suitcase ! )</li>
            <li> IT IS LIGHT AND</li>
            <li> He gets a clean shave and it&#x27;s easy to take apart and rinse the the whiskers out.</li>
            <li> But with short stubble works great</li>
            <li> My youngest son just started shaving and this fit the bill.</li>
            <li> It works just great for travel use and he actually uses it at home as well.</li>
            <li> , using this it took me under a minute to shave and my face was smooth as if I&#x27;d have shaven with a manual razor..</li>
            <li> the downside the instructions do recommend taking out the batteries after each use as they may start to leak and it also recommends putting a light coat of machine oil on the foil IF you rinse the foil under water often</li>
            <li> In just a couple of minutes I can have my face baby-back smooth.  </li>
            <li> Hubby likes how it is comfortable and stable to hold.</li>
            <li> Great close shave and the batteries last for weeks.</li>
            <li> (Which is cheap).</li>
            <li> Also comfortable to hold.</li>
            <li> My legs are smooth after a shave.</li>
            <li> Works well, easy to handle and clean.  </li>
            <li> Easy to clean.</li>
            <li> It was cheap and it runs on batteries so this was meant to be a traveling razor.</li>
            <li> This is so cheap that when the head eventually wears out, I will toss it and just buy another one of these...very convenient...</li>
            <li> cheap.</li>
            <li> thoughtful design.</li>
            <li> Easy to clean.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to clean.</li>
            <li> Easy to use and clean.</li>
            <li> Simple, bombproof, works great, inexpensive.</li>
            <li> For the price it is a great low cost shaver.</li>
            <li> Easy to clean.</li>
            <li> By comparison, that cheap knock off once went off while in my duffel bag as I attempted to stow it in an overhead.</li>
            <li> but it has since become my primary shaver.</li>
            <li> Excellent product for either field duty use or everyday use.</li>
            <li> It is light, compact, and cuts well.  </li>
            <li> but it do the work!, easy to clean, to use</li>
            <li> today everything is rechargeable, and when I was in Africa, there were places where the power was available 4 or 5 hours a day.  </li>
            <li> Like always the quality of Braun shavers is ratified with this cheap travel shaver.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s just a clean and easy go.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I ordered this for my husband and it is great for when he has to last minute shave.</li>
            <li> a great travel or back up razor...</li>
            <li> The low cost of this shaver does not reflect its quality--I&#x27;d happily buy it at 3x the price!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> a higher-end, more powerful razor.  </li>
            <li> It is easy to clean and handle.</li>
            <li> I have also had to grab it and run on a couple of occasions and use it as my primary.  </li>
            <li> I love this Braun pocket shaver, it gives me a clean shave and does it quickly thank you for your service.</li>
            <li> I love the 375 because it is slightly smaller but has a good</li>
            <li> Received the item, and tried the same night, good product, well.. it&#x27;s an upgrade from razor blade from electric, so it&#x27;s much better.</li>
            <li> Very nice shaver at a reasonable price , works very well</li>
            <li> I do quickly clean mine after each use and find it&#x27;s holding up just fine.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m happy to say it&#x27;s the same quality as my original.  </li>
            <li> Not for everyday use probably but perfect for post-flight clean up.</li>
            <li> While I don&#x27;t have heavy growth I can grow quite an impressive full beard.</li>
            <li> Mildly water resistant easy to clean.</li>
            <li> User friendly in a sturdy package.</li>
            <li> Protective shield for the blade that rotates away when in use is a nice feature, allowing some protection from normal use.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m now on the 4th month with the shaver, with the original batteries in the package.</li>
            <li> I picked up the original M90 model years ago on an extended stay in Texas.</li>
            <li> Originally bought for travel but</li>
            <li> It does pretty well for the most part.</li>
            <li> Wouldn&#x27;t shave worth a darn!</li>
            <li> There is one significant con:  </li>
            <li> this is great for travel and runs a long time on a set of batteries.</li>
            <li> As expected, not the greatest shaver, but it certainly works, and I plan on getting another as a backup.  </li>
            <li> Plus MobileShave can be washed clean and even used in the shower if you like that option.</li>
            <li> As electric shavers go, based on my experience with several over the years this a quite good one and at a fantastic price.</li>
            <li> its powerful and easy to carry around.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t have a time to clean yet.</li>
            <li> They definitely clean up the growth.  </li>
            <li> I use a Q-Tip to clean the shaving head area of water, including the gasket area where the shaving head is connected.</li>
            <li> clean prolongs the life of the blade.</li>
            <li> I use mine primarily to clean up after a razor shave.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really handy for a quick touch up, unlike most guy&#x27;s who think a shadow is what women like, the truth is women like a clean shaven guy, not stubble that scratches, but that is just my thoughts along with several women.</li>
            <li> It is not as good as a high end shaver but is much cheaper and easier to carry on a trip.</li>
            <li> Great design features like the swiveling blade guard which prevents it from being turned on when closed.</li>
            <li> This one is much better than the Remington; it really attacks the stubble and gets rid of it.</li>
            <li> good quality even at the low end price.</li>
            <li> Really cool waterproof battery compartment if you like that sort of thing.</li>
            <li> It has now become his full time razor.  </li>
            <li> perfect to keep in the car if running late.  </li>
            <li> The overall quality of the shaver is quite good as well.</li>
            <li> So much, that we ordered 2 more for our sons.</li>
            <li> it shaves good enough.</li>
            <li> it does such a good job</li>
            <li> This product is not ment to be a full size shaver</li>
            <li> Basically I use it for touch ups between full shaves.  </li>
            <li> However, this one doesn&#x27;t come with a trimmer, which really sucks, as that is one of the best features of the Braun.  </li>
            <li> Overall a good shaver.</li>
            <li> Shaves as well or better than units costing three times as much.</li>
            <li> He has used it to do a full shave when crunched for time in the morning and says it works well</li>
            <li> I still use a straight razor or tossaway for the most part, but when I take off for the weekend on the motorcycle this is my ride-a-long shaver.</li>
            <li> I still have my old one, but I figured its would be nice to have another.</li>
            <li> /&gt;(I have been shaving with a blade because I have not had good shave recently with an electric</li>
            <li> I can not speak to the products durability/endurance over time, yet I can offer an objective observation as to why the product may not work as good as advertised for some:</li>
            <li> this gives a good shave...great for trips and a quick touch up later in the day.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s great, because even though the foil apparently costs more than replacing the whole shaver, it&#x27;s environmentally better to replace only the part.  </li>
            <li> A cute little razor that fits in your pocket and does a good job if you need a quick shave.</li>
            <li> Seriously I use it almost every day and it is excellent for traveling.</li>
            <li> Keep this in my car for quick touch ups after work.</li>
            <li> Gave as gifts and most report they like it better than there regular electric shaver.</li>
            <li> THis present was one of the most practical the recipient got and was well pleased with he portability and working shaver.  </li>
            <li> Bear in mind that this is a quick cleanup razor</li>
            <li> I bought this for camping off the grid for a quick shave.</li>
            <li> It helps me shave quickly without nicks</li>
            <li> I keep one in my car for any time i might want a quick touch up.</li>
            <li> Not as close as a razor and shaving cream, but it&#x27;s a quick fix when you don&#x27;t have time to shave in the shower.  </li>
            <li> I did get one pimple after using this shaver, but it went away quick.</li>
            <li> Arrived quickly.</li>
            <li> The product holds a charge for weeks on end and is convenient to take with me when I travel as well as to keep in the car for those quick touch ups.</li>
            <li> I kept it as a backup shaver but its not even adequate for that.</li>
            <li> At school and missed a spot shaving in the morning - out with the pocket shaver and a quick touch up.  </li>
            <li> and it still works (keep it in my desk for needful times), and the second one resides in my bug out bag toiletries bag and has seen more Army field time than many Staff NCOs.  </li>
            <li> Just a quick buzz and perfection is at hand.</li>
            <li> Satisfied with the product, i owned another model and hope this one is like the other one or maybe greater !</li>
            <li> and how quickly it does the job.&lt;br</li>
            <li> shaves per charge, so I was pondering a replacement when I ran across this extraordinarily inexpensive Braun.  </li>
            <li> Barely adequate is how I would describe the performance of this shaver.  </li>
            <li> Stopped working after less than a week ... which was very surprising as I have happily owned this type of Braun shaver in the past.</li>
            <li> nothing major, very smooth shave, still on original batteries.</li>
            <li> Expect great battery life but not a quick shave.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Never the less it doesn&#x27;t come close to the great feeling I got as using the Panasonic ES-LT41-K.  </li>
            <li> and the top has a folding cover -good for travel or a small bathroom.</li>
            <li> the blue color is kind of cool too).</li>
            <li> Given that it&#x27;s a portable shaver and not one for regular home use, I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s pretty good.  </li>
            <li> It can shave very close, and it glides easily over my skin.&lt;br</li>
            <li> very old and have used over the years for many months.&lt;br /&gt;What</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used the Braun MobileShave M-60 for two years now, and I&#x27;m ordering my first replacement!  </li>
            <li> I found it to be highly functional and effective and highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Braun should publicize this far more than they do, and I only knew about by searching on the amazing website.</li>
            <li> They are cheap and give a really close shave.  </li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s well worth keeping in your messenger bag or brief case for touch ups, and it is a nice compact package (with \\&quot;on-board\\&quot; storage for a cleaning brush) for travel.</li>
            <li> Just keep the batteries fresh.</li>
            <li> the price this is definitely worth getting and atleast trying out.</li>
            <li> I have ordered two of these, different in colors and model however evenly alike and effective.  </li>
            <li> Not crazy that its battery powered</li>
            <li> This item works good, but seems to need repeated moves over the same area to really cut the bristles.</li>
            <li> Effective if used daily.  </li>
            <li> powerful.</li>
            <li> Its such a great design, and being Braun, I wouldn&#x27;t be surprised if Deiter Rammes was</li>
            <li> This is a nice addition to my shaver inventory, especially for travel.  </li>
            <li> This is not only reasonable but also compact and good shaving.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s worth having, I would tell the undecided.</li>
            <li> Worth the money</li>
            <li> This is better by far.</li>
            <li> i&#x27;m a wet shaver, but this is a good shaver to have when you&#x27;re away from the home.  </li>
            <li> just turning on, this shaver sounds much weaker than the Panasonic (I made sure to use fresh Duracell batteries), and it took much longer (10 passes) to shave than the Panasonic (4</li>
            <li> This cannot shave even close to a twenty year old, three head electric, and no where near as good as a blade, but in a pinch, while traveling, it can get you by.&lt;br</li>
            <li> it didn&#x27;t work, and wasn&#x27;t useful.</li>
            <li> Well worth the price.</li>
            <li> It fits in a small space, isn&#x27;t easily damaged and gives a suprisingly good shave</li>
            <li> Sure, it cannot compare with razors or other more powerful electrics, but what do you expect?  </li>
            <li> Based on the glowing reviews for this handy little guy, I thought it would be perfect for my purposes - touch-ups between shower razor shaving (usually don&#x27;t do everything every day).</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t know how long it will last, but immediate impressions are very good.</li>
            <li> It works best at a certain hair length though, but better than the rotating shavers I have used which required foam (if I didn&#x27;t want my skin to roughen up), extensive cleaning, and are generally more expensive.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried to find the right shaver for travel.</li>
            <li> Works well enough, and the waterproof feature makes it super easy to clean.</li>
            <li> have a light beard, and shaving once a day, it does a decent job for me.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> It took several passes, but was pretty effective on the mustache and chin area.</li>
            <li> Great little travel shaver!  </li>
            <li> (I can get a complete, very good shave in less than the 5 minutes it takes me to drive 2 miles to church on Sunday morning.)</li>
            <li> Once a hair gets a three day head start, only the trimmer or a straight razor will get at it.375 is slightly larger than the ones on the M60/90, but neither are very good for cleaning the shavers.</li>
            <li> Overall, for the price, this is an economical razor that is great for daily and or travel use.</li>
            <li> The Smart Foil makes a tremendous difference compared to the older-style foil.</li>
            <li> My love for this Braun shaver is not necessarily regarding the brand, yet rather it&#x27;s effectiveness in sustaining a CLEAN and respectable shave on a daily basis.</li>
            <li> This shaver consistently gives me a smooth, non-irritating shave, particularly when I use an electric pre-shave like Williams Lectric</li>
            <li> I had a choice of M60 (without trimmer) and M90 (with trimmer); since I hardly ever used trimmer in the old model I went for M60, which is cheaper and in my favorite color - blue.&lt;br /&gt;New layout of holes in the foil seems to work well - the new shaver does a very good job.</li>
            <li> DOES THE REPLACEMENT FOIL COST MORE THAN AN ENTIRE SHAVER?&lt;br /&gt;NOT VERY ECO-FRIENDLY THERE BRAUN!!</li>
            <li> /&gt;Basically it is worth the price, not a dollar more.&lt;br /&gt;Battery life is great, and it never irritates the skin, but it leaves quite a few hairs no matter how long they are and no matter how many times you go over them.</li>
            <li> Bought it to replace same model the I used for over seven years before it finally wore out, great value.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like to spend very much for a travel shaver</li>
            <li> Takes a little time but effective and clean.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m doing more travel lately, and wanted something light and easy to travel with.  </li>
            <li> with lithium batteries this is about as good a little shaver as there is.</li>
            <li> Its a little noisy and the shave is not that close, but about as good as any sub $75 shaver.</li>
            <li> Good little shaver for the money.</li>
            <li> Wet shave (also used shaving gel) gave much more clean</li>
            <li> Maybe their expectations were too high or they were trying to get rid of a full beard...</li>
            <li> It does both although with the AA batteries it is pretty dense.</li>
            <li> The only drawback I can think of is that I haven&#x27;t been able to find replacement blades/foil.</li>
            <li> and they last many close shaves.  </li>
            <li> The latest problem is the last straw for me.  </li>
            <li> I first discovered them while on a trip to Germany and had forgotten to pack a razor.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use if for daily shaving, rather for touching up areas I missed.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The foil is extremely comfortable and doesn&#x27;t give razor burn when you apply pressure like the old one did.  </li>
            <li> Thanks Braun!</li>
            <li> Be sure to save all the packaging for a while so you can send it back if it dies</li>
            <li> Highly recommend!!</li>
            <li> so I decided to get this M60B to replace the one that broke and have been using it for several months and really love it.  </li>
            <li> I have given these as gifts to my sons and they love using them as well and have stopped buying replacement blades and screens for their regular shavers.  </li>
            <li> For more than 15 years the only shaver I&#x27;ve used is a Braun Pocket Shaver.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll never go back :-)</li>
            <li> M60B follows in the M90s footsteps but now smaller and more refined.</li>
            <li> At first I was a bit skeptical, but I&#x27;ve had this for a couple months now and am impressed with its shave.</li>
            <li> Works well as a teenager&#x27;s first shaver.</li>
            <li> I purchased my first Braun M60 from Walgreens to see if it met my needs.</li>
            <li> I have used Energizer batteries for the first two 60 day battery replacements.</li>
            <li> Foil was torn and cut my son&#x27;s face the first time he tried it.</li>
            <li> this is the newer model was a lil worried at first but for the price i said i will give it a shot i did.</li>
            <li> When I first got this product, I looooooved it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s well-made and last for many years.  </li>
            <li> It gets pretty close.</li>
            <li> Very Satisfied,Highly Recommend !</li>
            <li> The first one I bought in Victoria, AU and lasted for 8 years.</li>
            <li> Works better than bigger norelco.</li>
            <li> I was encouraged when I started shaving with it for the first time.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my son- his first shaver.  </li>
            <li> So, after testing it in multiple places on both legs to make sure (yes, I even tried cleaning it out which made zero difference)</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m willing to believe that perhaps I got a dud, so to speak.</li>
            <li> However, with that brand name I had much higher expectations.  </li>
            <li> Not too good for handling heavy, or think beards/facial hair.</li>
            <li> It gives a fairly close shave (not like a non-electric) and I have had razors that were VERY expensive and this one did ALMOST as good a job</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very compact and very sharp, as good or better than some standard razors you use at home in your bathroom.</li>
            <li> I returned the Remington Curve razor so highly recommended for women because it removed absolutely none of my leg hair stubble when used either  wet or dry, and replaced it with the Braun M-60, which is THE BEST ELECTRIC RAZOR I&#x27;ve ever used.  </li>
            <li> It does work and leaves me very smooth, but takes a long time and a number of passes.</li>
            <li> Good enough to be my regular shaver.</li>
            <li> This is satisfactory in every way but not as good as a more expensive razor.</li>
            <li> Battery life is good, the product shaves only moderately well.  </li>
            <li> This battery powered shaver works pretty much as described.</li>
            <li> This one does the job as long as I don&#x27;t let my beard grow for more than 2 days.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried many shavers in the past, and by far this works best for me -- I&#x27;ve been using it for numerous years as my only shaver, at home and elsewhere.  </li>
            <li> Like all electric shavers, the eventual end comes with the foil wearing out and developing holes --- but now apparently replacement foils are available.  </li>
            <li> (I DROPPED AND BROKE THE SHAVING FOIL ON THE OTHER ONE AFTER SEVERAL YEARS OF GREAT SERVICE.  </li>
            <li> razor is not designed for women, and it won&#x27;t work anywhere beyond the &#x27;light stubble&#x27; phase; but if you&#x27;re the type who prefers preemptive daily (or every other day) maintenance, this is more than up to the job!  </li>
            <li> Pretty nice little unit.</li>
            <li> It gives you a closer shave than you thought possible, and really does give you that, well feel and look of what I can only call a &amp;#34;Perfectly smooth face.&amp;#34; I love it beyond words, and the &amp;#34;Twist Cap&amp;#34; that protects the shaving head is genius.</li>
            <li> I liked the feeling of shaving very closely, but later I did not like so much because I have sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li> Plus it runs on AA batteries which is easy to replace unlike regular shavers.  </li>
            <li> Had one previously and liked it.</li>
            <li> and they last a good long time, thus negating the lack of AC power and cost of disposable batteries.</li>
            <li> Just back from a road trip, 17 days on the set of Duracell AA&#x27;s that came with it and they&#x27;re still going strong.</li>
            <li> a large influence.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I certainly didn&#x27;t expect a closer shave than I get with a razor.</li>
            <li> This one is cleverly designed and works very, very well.</li>
            <li> I was hoping for an easy and fast shave, but you have to keep shaving the same spot over and over and still get some hair spots.</li>
            <li> This shaver is easy to hold, it&#x27;s quiet, and it shaves really close.</li>
            <li> I picked this shaver up not excepting much considering its modest price tag, so I was mildly amazed by</li>
            <li> This newer model has an improved &#x27;smartfoil&#x27; which actually seems to catch hairs slightly better and does a better job getting slightly longer hairs.</li>
            <li> These are fine for the cottage or on your daily</li>
            <li> It half shaves your face if you have any discernible facial hair - dish out more money for a better product.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately my main razor broke a foil after the first 2 weeks</li>
            <li> purchased this to replace my older Braun portable shaver that gave up after about 10 years!</li>
            <li> Well it is certainly convenient but will not give a very close shave</li>
            <li> Nice little shaver.</li>
            <li> Nice little on the go shaver.</li>
            <li> Its a nice little portable shaver to be used in a pinch.</li>
            <li> Pros: small form factor, good value, decent shave.</li>
            <li> (Amazing low price makes this totally feasible.)  </li>
            <li> motor is much weaker than a real Braun shaver.  </li>
            <li> If you really need trimmer, go for M90 instead.</li>
            <li> He loves this &amp;#34;pocket shaver&amp;#34; so much that he now carries it in his glove compartment for touch ups after work when we are meeting out for dinner</li>
            <li> We both highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> Very affordable.</li>
            <li> /&gt;This is a well-made, very reasonably-priced electric razor.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> But do you really want to chance it when your reputation is on the line</li>
            <li> He really enjoys it as well as my husband.</li>
            <li> and it has performed very well.</li>
            <li> that is so so so much closer than any electric.</li>
            <li> It really didn&#x27;t work well as I needed it for my husband who was dying of cancer</li>
            <li> I find myself going over and over the same area again and again to get that smooth finished feeling.  </li>
            <li> but when you are all by yourself in the car it really doesn&#x27;t matter.  </li>
            <li> Also, translucent plastic body looks similar to cheap plastic toys that shows inside batteries and circuit board.  </li>
            <li> Really like that the cover rotates and protects.</li>
            <li> the fit and finish is solid.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had these shavers before and really like them for touch ups or traveling.  </li>
            <li> The blade cannot be replaced, but if you clean it regularly, you can easily get 6 months of daily use from it before the blade is no longer functional.  </li>
            <li> I in no way ever allow my hairs to grow that much before trimming</li>
            <li> It is purse size and the price is reasonable.</li>
            <li> They cause the motors to run faster and are much lighter.</li>
            <li> I would give this product 5 stars if it had a popup trimmer, but I really like that it&#x27;s washable.</li>
            <li> but it was very portable.</li>
            <li> Thanks Braun.</li>
            <li> Replacing the whole unit was easier and cheaper than hunting for a foil and blade replacement.  </li>
            <li> better than i expected.</li>
            <li> It provides very acceptable close shaves  for the price.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m hoping the recipients like it as much as he does.</li>
            <li> Works absolutely fantastically.  </li>
            <li> Very well built and designed.....</li>
            <li> very often.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Figured I should let people know how much I like the shaver</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t reccomend it for shaving the whole head when doing a bald fade, but can be well used for taper fade on the side of the head.</li>
            <li> I used it today on my brother,  and it worked very well</li>
            <li> FAST SHIPPING AND THE SHAVER</li>
            <li> Thanks</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t expect a very close shave.  </li>
            <li> I bought it and tossed it in my glove compartment for those days when Murphy&#x27;s Law is really attacking you.</li>
            <li> Not so much on the neck and side of the face.</li>
            <li> Maybe this is because I used a real razor for a couple of months</li>
            <li> very close shave&lt;br /&gt;+  </li>
            <li> but it didn&#x27;t bother me too much</li>
            <li> it works very well for a travel razor.</li>
            <li> it is convenient and I use it very often.</li>
            <li> Their latest battery-powered travel shaver, the MobileShave M60B, is a definite improvement over my old PocketGo P-70.</li>
            <li> It does take a few minutes longer to shave but for this kind of money?</li>
            <li> It is nice to know that the works are well sealed, but wetting it still seem like asking for trouble.  </li>
            <li> It is nice to know that the works are well sealed, but wetting it still seem like asking for trouble.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used it 7 times - in between days when I use a razor.&lt;br /&gt;Shave is as good as any other electric I have used.&lt;br /&gt;Batteries are still good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> They are reasonably priced, and last forever, and can be washed clean just by sticking the head under the faucet.</li>
            <li> I expected much more of the razor as I already have one older</li>
            <li> On my fine beard and angular face, it gives me a shave that is as smooth as any shaver I&#x27;ve ever used, and I&#x27;ve tried just about every brand and style all over the past 50 years.</li>
            <li> and I can&#x27;t argue with many of them other than to say this a NINE DOLLAR razor</li>
            <li> it won&#x27;t cut hair greater than 1/8 inch max, but neither do other shavers.  </li>
            <li> Although it was not exactly the same as my original, which I grew to love over its lifetime ...</li>
            <li> Well this pocket sized, extra powerful (Yeah!)</li>
            <li> The replacement foils (as noted by other reviewers) cost more than the device.</li>
            <li> I have to use a regular razor to clean up after using the electric.</li>
            <li> Keep the batteries out when not in use for prolonged life and clean it regularly.  </li>
            <li> how long this runs on the 2 AA batteries (especially lithium), and it&#x27;s my experience that it always works effectively.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;d been using the Venus Embrace manual razors, which are truly the best manual razor for women but are so expensive, but I&#x27;m having knee replacement soon and wanted an electric razor to use after surgery as I won&#x27;t be able to get my leg wet for several days and my leg hair will get out of hand if I don&#x27;t shave.  </li>
            <li> Running the flexible foil against my hair-growth pattern with light or gentle pressure keeps me ready-for-summer all year long!</li>
            <li> /&gt;It is a little larger and heavier than I would have liked, but I think the convenience is worth it.</li>
            <li> Good for both dry and wet shaving on the go or traveling.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s okay, not worth the hassle of returning.  </li>
            <li> Not sure how good it would be for a full beard; I get the feeling from other reviews that it might not be up to the job.</li>
            <li> The foil design seems newer and better than the previous M30 I have.</li>
            <li> The result is clean and smooth as expected for the daily course off to work in the morning.</li>
            <li> I bought the M-60 as a backup to my main razor since I was traveling out of country and shaving every day is a must.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t shave as close as the older Braun 370 Pocket shaver I had to replace.  </li>
            <li> It also doesn&#x27;t have a trimmer like the older one, which I didn&#x27;t realize when I bought it.  </li>
            <li> I just don&#x27;t think this type of foil blade works as well with my particular face.</li>
            <li> After 3 months of use mainly at the gym, I noticed rusted screw heads when you remove the head cover.  </li>
            <li> I gave this razor to a friend of mine who is transgender (male to female) and they really love it.  </li>
            <li> I expect it to be decent based on the reviews.</li>
            <li> Use this razor daily, have one at work, car, home, seem to last a year or more, just change batteries as needed</li>
            <li> Replaced an older Braun Pocket Shaver.  </li>
            <li> so I wouldn&#x27;t mind having it as my main shaver.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m buying a second one because it&#x27;s good to have a few of them, so if it&#x27;s lost or stolen</li>
            <li> It is well built and does a decent job of getting rid of the whiskers.  </li>
            <li> Better than some more expensive electric shavers, cheaper than cartridge razors.  </li>
            <li> and I particularly like the fact that you con replace batts.</li>
            <li> The Braun is not nearly as loud, which is relevant since I normally shave while watching TV.  </li>
            <li> Another Braun product that I can Highly Recommend.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend this unit.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this to anyone.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this shaver.</li>
            <li> So, the Braun gives me a good electric shave...which is roughly as close as a wet shave leaves me after my beard has grown all day!</li>
            <li> Love this little mavel.</li>
            <li> This little shaver works about as well as those costing $70 or more.</li>
            <li> It gives a nice close shave and also because of its size it shaves in the hard to reach places.  </li>
            <li> But this one doesn&#x27;t have the little slide open sideburn trimmer, which really comes in handy sometimes.</li>
            <li> Not much else to say here, I can vouch the batteries were good because they were brand new and worked in the other shaver I bought.</li>
            <li> but when these work they are a remarkably cheap and work as well as could be expected under the circumstances.</li>
            <li> At a cheaper price for this whole unit than just the replacement blades for my old Remington, I&#x27;ll just buy another one of these when the blades or foil wear out.</li>
            <li> So far it has worked very well.  </li>
            <li> dont go more then a few days with out shaving</li>
            <li> I guess normal coarseness</li>
            <li> and I this has me looking normal again in minutes.  </li>
            <li> The second (this model) has a psychedelic screen pattern that is less effective than the older style and which has worn out.  </li>
            <li> it does not do well 1-2 Day no shave if you have a nice thick beard come in like me.</li>
            <li> this is a good shaver, not a great shaver.  </li>
            <li> Not a huge deal b/c it was a stocking stuffer and it was after all - cheap!</li>
            <li> It lasted for most of his deployment before it gave out but they are not at all expensive and easily replaced.</li>
            <li> or if you have no time to dry.&lt;br /&gt;I strongly recommend replacing provided regular Duracell batteries with lithium AA Energizer batteries - they are lighter, last longer</li>
            <li> The shaver has such low skin irritation that doing that would be just fine.</li>
            <li> Pretty decent blades, overall.  </li>
            <li> This new Braun rides with me in the morning and saves prep time at home.</li>
            <li> No matter if the razor was new, had new heads or foil</li>
            <li> so I opened my brand new M-60.  </li>
            <li> This is with new Duracells</li>
            <li> and I think Braun&#x27;s new hole pattern on the foil does help.</li>
            <li> Works like a new..</li>
            <li> Knowing he needed a new shaver for the car...</li>
            <li> I was cheaper to buy a  new one</li>
            <li> When he was not deployed it lasted for a lot longer before he needed a new one.</li>
            <li> Its cheaper to buy a new unit, then buy the micro film.</li>
            <li> If the foil lasts longer than a year (new brand)</li>
            <li> It is cheaper to buy a new one of these items rather than replace an parts.</li>
            <li> The new one is mostly plastic rather than the heavy metal of the old one.</li>
            <li> I should buy another one for when I wear out the studs on the foil cap snapping and unsnapping it to clean it every day (like I said, not really accustomed to the waterproofness yet)</li>
            <li> (it details features available across several different models, but does not indicate which models have which features, or what the features of this shaver specifically are).</li>
            <li> How many times have I left my home to discover - as I touched my chin, or just under my nose, that I&#x27;d not really shaved that part of my face.</li>
            <li> I found it more frustrating than it&#x27;s worth.  </li>
            <li> It works just fine in dry shave, although takes little longer and not as neat &amp; clean.  </li>
            <li> I just usually have a nice Razor shave then, just keep it up daily with this bad boy, impressive power for (2) AA battery powered shaver.</li>
            <li> I find this shaver very useful especially for trimming above my lip and below my nose.  </li>
            <li> Compared to the 7 series this is not bad at all, the only downside being that you have to manually clean it somewhat frequently, and it eats through the little batteries like they&#x27;re candy.</li>
            <li> Works pretty good, but bogs down alot if you put hardly any pressure on it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a long-time Braun user (currently I&#x27;m using a Series 5 550cc), but I&#x27;ll be first to admit some of their models have problems.</li>
            <li> I have several other brands an this one works better than do.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I needed for carry on when I can not bring my double edge razor.</li>
            <li> The Braun Pocket Shaver, model M60B, is so useful for grooming after a long day at work when one has no time to return home before an evening&#x27;s engagement.  </li>
            <li> First of all, I got it on next day after order.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s the second one I have owned; the first one still working too.</li>
            <li> This works well enough, but consistent with size and price</li>
            <li> Actually, its the 3rd such I have had over many years.  </li>
            <li> Traditional shaving methods dictate one should never shave against the natural hair growth, but everybody knows that&#x27;s the only way to get a smooth shave.</li>
            <li> The shave itself is generally good so long, as you use a pre shave lotion and youI press fairly hard against your beard  </li>
            <li> Talcum powder that collects inside is easily knocked loose and/or blown from the internal blade parts and skin oils and bits go with it.  </li>
            <li> Talcum powder that collects inside is easily knocked loose and/or blown from the internal blade parts and skin oils and bits go with it.  </li>
            <li> it was also comfortable and didn&#x27;t leave any razor burns like my previous electric razor</li>
            <li> Since getting away from full facial hair I&#x27;ve used a variety of blades, both disposable and not and finally decided to give the ole lectro razor a shot.</li>
            <li> really good little razor, not super quality</li>
            <li> Even my most recent is down to 2</li>
            <li> Nonetheless, at such a reasonable price, when I damage or wear out a foil I just buy a new razor.</li>
            <li> This shaver has a very clever and functional design, especially for the price.  </li>
            <li> I only use it to shave certain areas,but it cleans thaose areas up nicely,and I like the fact it has a flip screen saver attached to it.</li>
            <li> This shaver is no good enough, I should invested a little more $10 or $20 more and get something decent.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to find in most stores now.  </li>
            <li> Wasn&#x27;t a huge waste of money.</li>
            <li> I am unsure but if you only need a touch up or early morning shaving (or that 5:00 shadow) then this will work very well.&lt;br /&gt;Very</li>
            <li> Old one wore out</li>
            <li> VERY close shaves, 2 AA batteries last, literally, for a month or two.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> In any case, no, it&#x27;s not a perfect shaver, but considering how inexpensive (I did NOT say cheap) and small it is, it&#x27;s a really good value for my normal(?)</li>
            <li> In truth, I do not know if my old device was water resistant and never tried.&lt;br</li>
            <li> (I ruined one of the old style foils just washing it).</li>
            <li> This shaver gives a very close shave provided the stubble is short.  </li>
            <li> but I think you&#x27;re going to lose the shavers battle with the old foil design</li>
            <li> Beware of standard version Coppertop brand batteries and ever ready batteries because they leak.</li>
            <li> Foil only lasts a few years , but its really for on the go light stubble not every day..</li>
            <li> I was quite pleasantly surprised as this is a battery powered travel shaver</li>
            <li> invariably end up drawing some blood, &amp;#34;for sensitive skin&amp;#34; claims of razor-shaving products notwithstanding.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m surprised Braun put their name on it.</li>
            <li> This portable shaver is very well designed and works well enough for the money.</li>
            <li> the foil developed a tear after 1 week.</li>
            <li> 375 is about 4 years old.</li>
            <li> Once a hair gets a three day head start, only the trimmer or a straight razor will get at it.</li>
            <li> He has sensitive skin with</li>
            <li> it was rechargeable, but it did not work nearly as well.  </li>
            <li> I have a heavy beard but still get a close comfortable shave.</li>
            <li> Not as well as a real, blade shave, but it gets the basic job done.</li>
            <li> My facial hair is very controllable so its never going to be put through its paces.</li>
            <li> Not only that, not having to recharge is very valuable.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m surprised how well it works.  </li>
            <li> Once a week I put liquid soap on the blade, put the foil on, and let it run, rinsing it, and use the brush to complete cleaning it.</li>
            <li> (work days) for about three years until the foil finally developed a tear / hole and began to grab the hair.  </li>
            <li> In my opinion, complete garbage.  </li>
            <li> last a couple months if you shave fast, so you won&#x27;t have to do a drug deal with your mafia supply sergeant</li>
            <li> The folil alone costs almost as much as the entire razor.  </li>
            <li> I even love the use of common AA batts instead of rechargeables, but...</li>
            <li> So far, he loves it.</li>
            <li> Shaver arrived and it was complete with a set of batteries.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> There are non-whisker hairs (softer, lying close to the skin) in a couple areas near my beard which I also wish to shave.  </li>
            <li> The Panasonic has no problem with the soft hairs, since one of its 3 heads is a slotted head.  </li>
            <li> The majority of them provided a mediocre shave, but were good for touch ups in the evening.</li>
            <li> Works well, just as good as any expensive shaver.  </li>
            <li> Plain and simple this is a great little travel shaver.  </li>
            <li> This is my second or third Braun travel shaver, that should say something right there.</li>
            <li> I had an old Krups shaver way back when that was dirt cheap and worked extremely well.  </li>
            <li> This just glides over the curls and barely works on new hair growth.</li>
            <li> I use an old toothbrush to clean the head after each shave, and lube the screen with a few drops of &#x27;lectric shave before each use.</li>
            <li> In years past they never leaked in current years they frequently do ruining many of my devices.</li>
            <li> This is a handy little shaver for touching up on the go when you&#x27;re running a little late.</li>
            <li> More for thinner or less coarse facial hair.</li>
            <li> this small shaver is fine for me as a woman.</li>
            <li> The first thing to break will be the screen and a replacement screen cost about the same as an entire razor.</li>
            <li> The batteries last a decent amount of time.</li>
            <li> It gets weak without strong batteries!  </li>
            <li> The main change, other than color and lack of the little push-out trimmer, is the newer Design Smart Foil like many of the more expensive Series shavers.</li>
            <li> Low price, high performance.</li>
            <li> This little shaver has turned into my everyday shaver, it cuts close and clean and the battery life is tremendous.</li>
            <li> It works ok but not nearly as good as a razor.  </li>
            <li> just went on a month long trip to China, and one set of batteries lasted the whole trip.</li>
            <li> I found that I had to use it repeatedly and turn it perpendicular relative to a normal razor you might get a semi-decent shave.</li>
            <li> The cleaning brush is housed firmly at the bottom of the unit, and the flip-up travel/storage/protective cap is attached and locks solidly over the top of the unit, protecting it with no additional bulk or extra parts.  </li>
            <li> Little brush stowed at the bottom of the body lets you do quick cleaning when there is no water</li>
            <li> It won&#x27;t replace a blade or your main shaver, but it will keep the stubble down to a reasonable level.</li>
            <li> I find it hard to completely bash something that is this cheap and</li>
            <li> It was my third Pocket Shaver--cheaper to buy a new shaver than replacement foil and cutter.</li>
            <li> I wonder how much Duracell paid Braun to include &amp;#34;we recommend Duracell batteries&amp;#34; in the manual&amp;#34; - nobody with even basic technical knowledge believes statements like this.&lt;br /&gt;Summary -</li>
            <li> Fantastic battery operated shaver, I not only use it for travelling but everyday.</li>
            <li> Very compact, low noise, and easy to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have very coarse facial hair and the Braun M60b worked like a charm wet and/or dry.</li>
            <li> It finally gave out and I really wanted the same identical one but couldn&#x27;t find a replacement, so</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s bigger, bulkier and doesn&#x27;t shave nearly as close as the one that was 19 years old.  </li>
            <li> A reasonable shave on my moderate facial growth.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s clever, though it doesn&#x27;t keep shavings out of my toilet kit.  </li>
            <li> I charge the two double a batteries every Sunday, and they last for the whole week.</li>
            <li> Because its head is smaller, it takes somewhat longer to shave with the Braun; but I really don&#x27;t care about that, since I am watching TV at the same time anyway.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have particularly thick facial hair, but perhaps others will have better luck.</li>
            <li> I was very surprised at how well this thing works given its very low price.  </li>
            <li> It provides a clean close shave and doesn&#x27;t turn your neck into a red bumpy mess.  </li>
            <li> and you have no other options?</li>
            <li> the folil only when the cost of the entire unit was almost exactly the same</li>
            <li> Servicing the built in batteries is not economically feasible, since replacing the whole unit also buys you new heads.  </li>
            <li> For the price I expected it to be less than perfect but not at all useless.</li>
            <li> Small, portable, battery driven and clean shaving all in one package.</li>
            <li> I owned one of the older battery powered Braun shavers and it lasted a surprisingly long time.</li>
            <li> I had an older one for a long time.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not just good for a &amp;#34;dumpster face&amp;#34; but is a quick cure for &amp;#34;stubble trouble.&amp;#34; You know, when you believe you shaved immaculately only to discover in the midst of the morning rush hour an annoying stubble that had eluded you.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t get the coarse hair only the real fine, thin whiskers...</li>
            <li> /&gt;Just don&#x27;t expect shaving experience from more expensive and high performing shaver or razor.</li>
            <li> I generally have to replace the batteries every 2 months.</li>
            <li> Not really used to the whole waterproof thing yet</li>
            <li> old one worked well and is still in daily use.  </li>
            <li> I use a much larger one from an old Braun.&lt;br /&gt;If</li>
            <li> I use a much larger one from an old Braun.&lt;br /&gt;If</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only had it for a month or so, but so far it works flawlessly.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> The only thing I wish if it has side trimmber like its old models do.</li>
            <li> It does a good job of cutting what the razor misses and of lunchtime and evening touch ups.</li>
            <li> I have really tried to give them a fair trial but have been disappointed time and again.  </li>
            <li> Helps to protect the foils when not in use (probably the first thing to break down on shavers like these), and it saves the hassle of taking it in and out of a separate case.</li>
            <li> Otherwise, this bad boy is amazingly close and the foil design is such that it allows you to apply pressure in just the right ways while shaving.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The Braun M60B is essentially the same device with added features of twist cap (never detaches so it can&#x27;t be lost), new geometric pattern foil, and washability;</li>
            <li> The new foil makes a big difference in closeness and an even bigger difference in comfort.</li>
            <li> Got my first in Germany, never went back to any other company.</li>
            <li> it is very small and just had a cheap appearance.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know what other brands or makes of electric shavers claim to do/are capable of.</li>
            <li> /&gt;UPDATE: the foil developed holes after a solid year of nearly daily use.</li>
            <li> Otherwise the shaver will not dry thoroughly and develope an odor.</li>
            <li> And hairs that get missed quickly become too long for the foil to catch, so things were a little untidy after a couple of weeks.</li>
            <li> got a little razor burn feel the first time but</li>
            <li> little Panasonic travel shaver or the Silver Remington shaver give a much closer shave and they are cheaper!</li>
            <li> This little gem has been in my office drawer for almost two years now and has not failed me yet.  </li>
            <li> It suspect this new shaver will last as long.</li>
            <li> , it is the length- shave everyday and the product functions as advertised, wait a day or two and the economy electronic device you just purchased may not perform as well as a much higher priced unit.</li>
            <li> Shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought my first model 375 when I discovered that it cost less than a replacement cutter and foil for my more expensive Braun corded shaver.</li>
            <li> I keep this in my briefcase for quick touch ups late in the day and travel.</li>
            <li> I usually shave with a double blade every other day, but with this shaver, I popped in the 2 provided batteries and shave once a day...easy and just fine...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d purchased the exact same shaver a long time ago, kept it in the pickup, used it all the time, finally got dulled down.</li>
            <li> Small, light, convenient and protects itself with a folding cover that means I can just throw it in a bag with other stuff.</li>
            <li> This is a very cooly designed little shaver.</li>
            <li> I needed small shaver for a trip to a conference and foil in my older Braun pocket shaver (6 years old)</li>
            <li> bought this to replace a very cheap generic shaver I bought from superdrug, and sadly I think I will have to go back to using it.</li>
            <li> They come in different colors and some have the little sideburn trimmer, but really, do you need that?</li>
            <li> You&#x27;re running horribly late, it&#x27;s an important meeting, but you look like you spent the last month sleeping in a dumpster.</li>
            <li> (IMO, the idea of wet shaving with an electric shaver is very counterproductive, since, unlike the situation with a conventional blade, softening the beard does not make cutting it any easier for an electric shaver mechanism (which has more of a scissor like action).  </li>
            <li> (IMO, the idea of wet shaving with an electric shaver is very counterproductive, since, unlike the situation with a conventional blade, softening the beard does not make cutting it any easier for an electric shaver mechanism (which has more of a scissor like action).  </li>
            <li> The foils are expensive , better off just buying a new one for less then $20.00 ...</li>
            <li> This Braun Pocket Shaver is on the other end of the spectrum; the shave I get when using it is almost as close and complete as my full-size top-end electric razor.</li>
            <li> I have had Braun products in the past and they have always given me years of trouble free service.</li>
            <li> This razor provides a decent shave and has an attached foil cover which can&#x27;t be misplaced.</li>
            <li> The foil and head last very long with just the simple maintenance of brushing the head off with the included brush--about 90 seconds once or twice a week.  </li>
            <li> It easily provides a super-close shave in minutes and can be done in car or anywhere and is so small it fits well in a small pocket or purse.</li>
            <li> If one were to shave in the prescribed way with a regular razor (not going against the grain per se) the end result would be the equivalent to the result of a shave with this product- giving the edge (a slightly closer shave) to the Braun.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Combine that with a sub $20 price tag, near effortless cleaning and a wet/dry capability</li>
            <li> Small and reasonably lightweight.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t tell how long the batteries last because I have not yet worn any out.</li>
            <li> Shaves my stubble well enough if I don&#x27;t let it get long.  </li>
            <li> I long ago gave up on using disc head shavers and double or triple foils on my sparse beard.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a long time fan of Braun shavers, going back about 30 years.  </li>
            <li> Batteries last a long time.</li>
            <li> Since I take long overseas trips and cannot always shave on a regular schedule, this is a problem.</li>
            <li> how long this unit will last</li>
            <li> /&gt;The batteries do last quite long on these as well...</li>
            <li> And we&#x27;ll see how long it will last.</li>
            <li> the small trimmer unit was missing on this model, it still performs as well as the original.  </li>
            <li> I was VERY disappointed in this, especially since Braun is a good brand (normally) name.</li>
            <li> The batteries don&#x27;t last very long.  </li>
            <li> The screen of this shaver has larger opening then most shaving foils, perhaps that is the reason that instead of cutting the hair it just pulls it out at times.</li>
            <li> With this product I take only 1 minute to dry shave in the morning.</li>
            <li> If you leave the shaver in the car or camper in cold weather, the batteries will not be as powerful as at warmer normal temps, but it will still work well enough to shave.</li>
            <li> and it works and without the non-working unnecessary spring action all the new shavers have now under the blade!  </li>
            <li> This little shaver fixed that.  </li>
            <li> Had it for 2 weeks and used a few times so far.</li>
            <li> Batteries lasting longer than I expected.</li>
            <li> This shaver can be used wet, and I actually like using it with shave gel</li>
            <li> - It&#x27;s been a few years since I last bought one, and the M60 now has the same blade foil as the M90 that I tried later.</li>
            <li> so we will see how long the shaver holds up (it has now been 3 months and all&#x27;s well).</li>
            <li> Braun..so long.</li>
            <li> With Litium batteries it works a long time.  </li>
            <li> If you travel frequently, do not hesitate to buy this product.</li>
            <li> A set of AA batteries lasts a LONG time in it.</li>
            <li> Also,IF THE STUBBLE&#x27;S ARE TOO LONG it does not cut well.</li>
            <li> I am Asian and I don&#x27;t need to shave that often, this shaver worked for about 2 months and then the foil gets rough on my face.</li>
            <li> Lasted Long Time...</li>
            <li> The only thing that Braun seems to be consistent with is sub-par devices, lack of QA and poor customer service.  </li>
            <li> I have very thin, fine leg hair....</li>
            <li> The screen on one of them finally broke and I was down to only one</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d give it four stars if used on a face that had been previously shaved within 24 hours; not as close as an expensive rechargable, but not terrible.  </li>
            <li> I bought this little shaver and a larger Remington shaver (at three times the cost) the same week.</li>
            <li> I use this daily, replacing all my other shaving devices.</li>
            <li> As long as I do daily..............perfect!</li>
            <li> I have a heavy beard, and this little shaver really performs.  </li>
            <li> My reasoning for this is I use it dry.</li>
            <li> If I loose this one I&#x27;ll buy another in a heart beat.</li>
            <li> Won&#x27;t take long for it to pay for itself!!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s compact enough to add to my toiletry kit as a back-up, the batteries last (almost) forever, and the rotating guard is slick.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately it is not exceptional at its main function- to provide a close shave.  </li>
            <li> I have previously owned one of these shavers and bought a second one.</li>
            <li> Works in the shower, wet or dry.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve use it in dry and wet condition.  </li>
            <li> only comparison I can make is to an actual manual blade razor (usually disposable)- this does not shave as close as a blade, but it&#x27;s close.</li>
            <li> I have heavy, thick, fast-growing facial hair, with very sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li> This is my second little shave by Braun.</li>
            <li> I would recommend it to anyone who needs a little help, especially women.</li>
            <li> You cannot beat this little device for the price alone; will definitely buy another as a spare.</li>
            <li> I have two of these little beauties -- Braun, German, well-made.  </li>
            <li> little more because I felt it was cutting the hair</li>
            <li> I generally get between one and two years out of one, before the screen develops a small hole.</li>
            <li> and I was constantly looking for the missing plastic head cover.</li>
            <li> The rotating cap is very convenient, making additional pouches unnecessary.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;ve only used it a few times.</li>
            <li> So, if you&#x27;re a wet shaver and you bought this for travel, just keep in mind that difference.&lt;br</li>
            <li> but that is to be expected with a travel shaver.</li>
            <li> and therefore I can conclude that foil shavers aren&#x27;t that fast and by design all are worse than the rotary shavers.&lt;br /&gt;Sorry</li>
            <li> I performs just as well as the M90 and is only missing the side burn trimmer.  </li>
            <li> Only had it for a few days</li>
            <li> But no real complaints.</li>
            <li> I might give up on using a wet razor.</li>
            <li> That said, it&#x27;s exactly as expected for a backup shaver.</li>
            <li> Batteries last a few weeks.</li>
            <li> like the fact it uses AA batteries; no need to drag around yet another battery</li>
            <li> I like the protection cover because my first choice, less expensive Eltron, only lasted 2 days due to damage.</li>
            <li> If you use the shaver with shaving cream, let the shaver dry between uses by removing the shaving head foil, close the shaver to protect the blade and stand it upside down.</li>
            <li> I have had trial and error spent with other shavers.</li>
            <li> The small but powerful electric razor fits the bill -- and I may just stick with it rather than go back to the expensive Venus Embrace razors.  </li>
            <li> One complaint, the replacement heads and foils are just too expensive; it is cheaper to buy a whole new shaver.  </li>
            <li> Only negative is the lack of any trimmer for sideburns or lopping off those missed hairs that have grown too long to be picked up by the shaver head.</li>
            <li> While a little bigger and heavier than a previous travel electric saver I had for 30+ years, I like it and it works well.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve purchased several battery-operated shavers over the past 25 years.</li>
            <li> Works extremely well.</li>
            <li> It shaves quite well except it is a bit noisy - noisier than my other Panasonic model.</li>
            <li> I was on the other side of the US.  </li>
            <li> exellent shaver, works as well as my $120 Braun Aviator, and u can use it wet!</li>
            <li> I needed a small electric razor, I bought this to keep in my car, but am using it almost daily Shaves</li>
            <li> The battery life is 4-5x longer than in other battery-powered electric razors I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> even after running this pocket shaver over a small area multiple times (like over fifty back-and-forth movements)</li>
            <li> I have a tough beard, but this little shaver gets the job done very well.</li>
            <li> I have thick whiskers and was surprised at the cut this little beast provided.</li>
            <li> My husband has used this little gadget for several years and ordered a few for Christmas gifts.</li>
            <li> This approach requires very minimal maintenance and does not lead to any problems that I have ever experienced.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This approach requires very minimal maintenance and does not lead to any problems that I have ever experienced.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> reviews seem to come from people trying to shove their long hairs into this machine and being disappointed when they don&#x27;t fit through.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I guess I should have expected less from a battery operated razor.</li>
            <li> and I find you need to work a little harder with this thing to make it work.</li>
            <li> Even after decent use it appears that I am getting &amp;#34;burns&amp;#34; with this razor, or that I am cutting too short than I</li>
            <li> I agree with other reviews, I would have given this product even less than a star because it doesn&#x27;t deserve one.</li>
            <li> These usually last about a year before they go dull</li>
            <li> Very convenient to use and much less expensive than buying blades for my other electric shaver.  </li>
            <li> I like this razor so much that when my elderly father became unable to use a disposable blade razor, I bought one for him.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s confusing to use because you have to angle the head a very specific way to catch the hair.</li>
            <li> My average shave per day is 5-6 minutes.</li>
            <li> I hate shaving, therefore I love the Braun Pocket Shaver.  </li>
            <li> It is really for shaving for casual events and not for formal or business meetings.</li>
            <li> I sometimes shave before turning in for the night or if I knock the brush down in the morning</li>
            <li> He has Down Syndrome and loves the ease of using this for his morning shave.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m considering purchasing one for the office and our other vehicle!</li>
            <li> Aids - remote control.&lt;br /&gt;The phone needs to be recharged virtually every night, and usually one other item too.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Miss the trimmer I had on the previous unit.  </li>
            <li> Typically used 3-4 times a week.&lt;br /&gt;Battery life has been excellent.&lt;br /&gt;Considering</li>
            <li> I used one I owned previously for about 1 year with zero issue before I felt the need to replace the blade.</li>
            <li> this product is not for black men.</li>
            <li> For some reason this one does not shave as close as ones previously purchased</li>
            <li> At less than twenty dollars they are almost disposable.</li>
            <li> model costs less than change foil and cutters.</li>
            <li> Although it does not give as close a shave as what I am used to, it does admirably and takes less time.  </li>
            <li> This shaver is small and compact and I use it for shaving in the field, (I&#x27;m military).  </li>
            <li> This shaver is intended to replace my usual wet blade shave during travel.  </li>
            <li> If hairs get a little long e.g. 2 day&#x27;s growth, it has a hard time getting all the strays.</li>
            <li> was a little reluctant because the price was so much less than I thought it would be.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Almost seems like the stubble cant enter the tight mesh foil or something.&lt;br</li>
            <li> This electronic shaver fits into tight spaces in one&#x27;s luggage.</li>
            <li> I do not have a heavy beard by any measure but did not want to spend a half hour trying to get an acceptable shave.</li>
            <li> I purchased it, because there the lighting in Hotel rooms is bad, and it is hard to shave with a Bic, so this is easy.</li>
            <li> I bought this for traveling to save a little space &amp; weight.</li>
            <li> A little noisy too.</li>
            <li> This little razor has been with me all over the globe</li>
            <li> I have had this shaver for a little over a year.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The trimmer on the M90 is of little value.</li>
            <li> Some longer hairs or neck hairs may evade the Braun, but they can be &amp;#34;mowed down&amp;#34; with a little perseverance.</li>
            <li> Whoever is the engineer, (or team) from Braun that came up with this little shaver is a genius.  </li>
            <li> If your grandmother has a little stubble...</li>
            <li> perhaps shaves little too close</li>
            <li> This little gem did the trick.  </li>
            <li> However, this is NOT an everyday shaver.  </li>
            <li> Also, you are in trouble if the batteries die when traveling</li>
            <li> - it&#x27;s so convenient when you were in a hurry and missed a few nubs.</li>
            <li> The included manual is frustrating because it is too generic</li>
            <li> Therefore I use the Braun EVERYDAY and</li>
            <li> but I won&#x27;t use this shaver everyday.</li>
            <li> , how wrong I was, after 30 minutes shaving I had my face completely irritated and still had a lot of hair here</li>
            <li> instead of buying blades every few months just buy bunch of these.</li>
            <li> Also, as you shave, the motor sounds uneven as you move the shaver over your face.</li>
            <li> The problem with the Braun shaver was that I had to replace the blades and the head screen every few months.  </li>
            <li> and I shave everyday</li>
            <li> I have now turned it into an everyday shaver.</li>
            <li> so I doubt it was caused by heavy stubble.</li>
            <li> I have a medium to heavy beard and it has no problem coping.</li>
            <li> Few zits will pop up the day after using this shaver.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this for a few months now.  </li>
            <li> Sadly, it did not work anywhere near as well as the Remington shaver I had a decade ago.</li>
            <li> You can go distractingly mad, poking it, licking it or attempting to tear out the offending follicle by its roots only to plow into the back of a police cruiser.</li>
            <li> What is bad is that unlike my old one, this one lacks a trimmer for sideburns and long neck hairs.</li>
            <li> you&#x27;re looking for a compact portable slick little lectro shaver, this is the way to go.</li>
            <li> The directions were a little difficult because there were multiple models on the instructions.</li>
            <li> If you skip a few days, say  when camping, it has a hard time with longer face hair.</li>
            <li> He was on blood thinners and not allowed to use usual razor with a blade</li>
            <li> This one is like all in the past...</li>
            <li> I can press this shaver firmly against my skin for closer shave with no discomfort at all!  </li>
            <li> I have used these shavers in the past on an every day use....</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s on the side, is small and is curved.</li>
            <li> Small unit with reliable function.  </li>
            <li> my neck has a swirling hair pattern and is difficult to shave with either a blade or electric without repeatedly going over it in different directions, but this shaver handles it nicely.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It is small and compact.</li>
            <li> I have had foil shavers in the past and know maintenance and keeping then</li>
            <li> I bought it strictly for travel, but find myself using it when in a hurry or just too lazy to lather up.</li>
            <li> , only thing is that the shaver is AA battery operated, but you can&#x27;t go wrong with this shaver.</li>
            <li> It is so small that it can be kept almost anywhere.</li>
            <li> small &amp; compact --&amp;#62;  </li>
            <li> There is no better insurance policy for oversleeping and rushing to work without shaving.  </li>
            <li> Cons: dense (with batteries), no trimmer, not rechargeable, hard plastic may crack if dropped.</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m assuming that when it gets dull we&#x27;re just suppose to throw it away and buy something else.</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t press too hard.  </li>
            <li> It takes AA batteries, so you will be either replacing those or need a charger nearby for secondary batteries.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The secondary effect is that with no shave my professionalism is being questioned causing problems at work.  </li>
            <li> I read all the negative reviews</li>
            <li> instructions as to battery use was confusing and may have been reason that razor didn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li> After at least two dozen uses I have yet to replace the batteries.</li>
            <li> I will often rely on this compact shaver if I am running late (all ways) or need a touch up.</li>
            <li> If you have a thick beard this may not be for you, but like the title of this review states, \\&quot;It works for me\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> there was nothing wrong with my other two razors.  </li>
            <li> The failure mode has always been in battery performance.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little slow and sometimes sounds like its working hard, and the shave isn&#x27;t quite as close as a blade or an expensive electric shaver.</li>
            <li> This failed to do the job, even half way.</li>
            <li> I got these because it was less expensive than buying a replacement foil and cutter block.  </li>
            <li> By the time I got home, it was too late to return it!  </li>
            <li> Too weak.  </li>
            <li> Weak performance-</li>
            <li> I had the model with the trimmer for 2 years, and decided the replace it with this newer model in case the blades had gotten dull (although I hadn&#x27;t noticed anything but a small reduction in cutting ability).</li>
            <li> it is very slow going.  </li>
            <li> but I absolutely hate shaving with a manual razor because its time consuming, it would always pull my facial hair instead of shaving it</li>
            <li> but the wired one was worse than shaving with a manual razor</li>
            <li> Worked poorly on underarms, and might as well have had the cap on for my legs.</li>
            <li> I keep one in my car for those times that I am running behind and one at home.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m very disappointed with my new travel elec razor from /braun.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m afraid I will be forced to check the bag instead of storing it in the overhead compartment of the plane.  </li>
            <li> Of the 3 i have, none have failed yet.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m unable to find any replacement screens as of yet</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think you can go wrong with a Braun.</li>
            <li> Something&#x27;s wrong with this one.</li>
            <li> My husband and I both use one and it does the job but not like an expensive electric razor, of course.</li>
            <li> I have 1 spot on my face that is difficult to shave with a razor without nicking a mole.</li>
            <li> just a useless waterproof paper weight</li>
            <li> and I am unable to get a replacement&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> However, this is unfair comparison because Braun M60B is intended as travel shaver.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately, these hairs never seem to poke through the Braun&#x27;s foil, no matter how I maneuver it.  </li>
            <li> Closer than my $175.00 Braun razors that I have purchased in the past and was highly disappointed.  </li>
            <li> a disappointment......</li>
            <li> Note, that plastic jobby that cover the cutting head is what makes if valuable to me, it will not bust inside my backpack.</li>
            <li> in desperate times...</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just plain terrible.</li>
            <li> thus reducing the cost of expensive blade replacements by 75 percent!  </li>
            <li> But.... they die faster than a bad guy in Bruce Willis movie.</li>
            <li> My Ex boyfriend is the person I am always buying this product for and his comments are - &amp;#34;Good product, however the screen goes bad in 10 to 12 months</li>
            <li> I wanted so badly for it to work</li>
            <li> Too bad.</li>
            <li> my hormones went crazy and so did my hair growth -- on face, legs and arms!  </li>
            <li> I bought 2 as a Christmas gift my father try to shave and it did not do well : (</li>
            <li> Claims the head can be washed out with water, but not planning on doing that as it comes with a brush, built in the base.  </li>
            <li> however Amazons stupid requirement for fifteen words in a review is #@!$%</li>
            <li> the closeness of my Braun&#x27;s have been terrible.  </li>
            <li> terrible-</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Good price from a good brand.  However, this is NOT an everyday shaver.  It takes AA batteries, so you will be either replacing those or need a charger nearby for secondary batteries.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The motor is much weaker than a real Braun shaver.  Also, you are in trouble if the batteries die when traveling and you don&#x27;t have replacements handy in your hotel room.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So it is best used as a back-up shaver in your travel shaving kit, with extra batteries stored in the kit too.</li>
            <li> While a little bigger and heavier than a previous travel electric saver I had for 30+ years, I like it and it works well.  Good product.</li>
            <li> I travel a lot, love this nice compact Frazer.</li>
            <li> I USE THIS SHAVER FOR A BACK UP AND TRAVEL IT IS LIGHT AND WASHABLE HAS A CLEANING  BRUSH ATTACHED SHAVES CLOSE WITH OUT SHAVER BURN</li>
            <li> Works great. I&#x27;ve had it for a year, no problems.</li>
            <li> I wanted a travel razor for occasional use in travel kit. Old one wore out and I was constantly looking for the missing plastic head cover. This one is cleverly designed and works very, very well. Can&#x27;t tell how long the batteries last because I have not yet worn any out.</li>
            <li> I needed small shaver for a trip to a conference and foil in my older Braun pocket shaver (6 years old) was dying. I had a choice of M60 (without trimmer) and M90 (with trimmer); since I hardly ever used trimmer in the old model I went for M60, which is cheaper and in my favorite color - blue.&lt;br /&gt;New layout of holes in the foil seems to work well - the new shaver does a very good job. The rotating cap is very convenient, making additional pouches unnecessary. Little brush stowed at the bottom of the body lets you do quick cleaning when there is no water or if you have no time to dry.&lt;br /&gt;I strongly recommend replacing provided regular Duracell batteries with lithium AA Energizer batteries - they are lighter, last longer and you can keep them in the shaver for many years without leaking. I wonder how much Duracell paid Braun to include &amp;#34;we recommend Duracell batteries&amp;#34; in the manual&amp;#34; - nobody with even basic technical knowledge believes statements like this.&lt;br /&gt;Summary - for travel, it is the best electric shaver I have owned (an I tried 5 different brands/types). If you really need trimmer, go for M90 instead.</li>
            <li> I bought this for traveling to save a little space &amp; weight. It does both although with the AA batteries it is pretty dense. Pros: small form factor, good value, decent shave. Cons: dense (with batteries), no trimmer, not rechargeable, hard plastic may crack if dropped.</li>
            <li> inexpensive, does the job, portable, marvelous for travel, no trimmer</li>
            <li> I bought this &amp;#34;pocket shaver&amp;#34; for my husband to use after he had surgery.  He was on blood thinners and not allowed to use usual razor with a blade and we did not want to spend a fortune since it was only a temporary situation.  He loves this &amp;#34;pocket shaver&amp;#34; so much that he now carries it in his glove compartment for touch ups after work when we are meeting out for dinner and he can&#x27;t come home to shave - also handy for mornings when he realizes he &amp;#34;missed a spot&amp;#34; as he is driving to work.  We both highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> Had it for 2 weeks and used a few times so far. It has been working fine as a travel shaver; like the size and weight.</li>
            <li> Plain and simple this is a great little travel shaver.  I would recommend it highly; it makes a great gift.  The only drawback I can think of is that I haven&#x27;t been able to find replacement blades/foil.</li>
            <li> My Asian Hubby LOVES this razor.  He gets a clean shave and it&#x27;s easy to take apart and rinse the the whiskers out.</li>
            <li> Had it for two years..works great.</li>
            <li> Great travel shaver Keep it in the desk for when you forget to shave. Works well on stubble, does not work so well on longer hair because it feels like it starts pulling your chin off. But with short stubble works great</li>
            <li> This is my second little shave by Braun. I keep one in my travel bag. and one in my car. It&#x27;s really handy for a quick touch up, unlike most guy&#x27;s who think a shadow is what women like, the truth is women like a clean shaven guy, not stubble that scratches, but that is just my thoughts along with several women.</li>
            <li> When I was shaving my face the cutter block cut through the shaver foil...&lt;br /&gt;Enough said...</li>
            <li> I have three of these now. I keep one in the car, the office and our camper. Great shave if you shave regularly. If you skip a few days, say  when camping, it has a hard time with longer face hair. For daily shaving I give it a &amp;#34;5&amp;#34;! Very affordable. I have had one unit for many years and it still works great. Of the 3 i have, none have failed yet. I use both rechargeable and alkaline batteries. If you leave the shaver in the car or camper in cold weather, the batteries will not be as powerful as at warmer normal temps, but it will still work well enough to shave. But that&#x27;s a battery problem.</li>
            <li> Works well enough, and the waterproof feature makes it super easy to clean. The sliding cover is a nice touch as well.</li>
            <li> As expected, not the greatest shaver, but it certainly works, and I plan on getting another as a backup.  Shaves my stubble well enough if I don&#x27;t let it get long.  Batteries lasting longer than I expected.</li>
            <li> Great shaver for your car&#x27;s glove compartment. These usually last about a year before they go dull and you throw them away.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve purchased several battery-operated shavers over the past 25 years. The majority of them provided a mediocre shave, but were good for touch ups in the evening. This Braun Pocket Shaver is on the other end of the spectrum; the shave I get when using it is almost as close and complete as my full-size top-end electric razor. It&#x27;s compact enough to add to my toiletry kit as a back-up, the batteries last (almost) forever, and the rotating guard is slick.  I like this razor so much that when my elderly father became unable to use a disposable blade razor, I bought one for him. (Despite being nearly blind and suffering from memory loss, he is able to shave with no problems, and no longer cuts himself.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a well-made, very reasonably-priced electric razor. I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> This new Braun rides with me in the morning and saves prep time at home. It replaces the freebe Braun 6 that I was given on an overnight flight on Midland Air 10 years ago. It suspect this new shaver will last as long.</li>
            <li> You can buy AA batteries anywhere and they last many close shaves.  I use it when I&#x27;m short of time leave the house without shaving then do it at work or on the way.  Miss the trimmer I had on the previous unit.  Like the swing blade cover.  Excellent value.</li>
            <li> I will never buy a Braun razor again.  I have really tried to give them a fair trial but have been disappointed time and again.  The only thing that Braun seems to be consistent with is sub-par devices, lack of QA and poor customer service.  The reason that they probably don&#x27;t have open ratings on the Braun site is because they know the product that they are selling is inferior to others.  I have bought multiple razors, a shaving system and a cordless travel shaver.  No matter if the razor was new, had new heads or foil or I used a lotion or pre shave gel, the closeness of my Braun&#x27;s have been terrible.  The latest problem is the last straw for me.  I bought the M-60 as a backup to my main razor since I was traveling out of country and shaving every day is a must.  Unfortunately my main razor broke a foil after the first 2 weeks so I opened my brand new M-60.  Within 3 days the M-60 broke stranding me without a razor or the ability to get a replacement foil or razor.  The secondary effect is that with no shave my professionalism is being questioned causing problems at work.  Bottom line, if you want a quality reliable product that you can trust to work when you need it, do not look at Braun products.  Yes they look nice, they have the best advertising that your money can buy and there are some favorable reviews on here.  But do you really want to chance it when your reputation is on the line and you have no other options?</li>
            <li> Keep this in my car for quick touch ups after work. It works great!</li>
            <li> Stopped working after less than a week ... which was very surprising as I have happily owned this type of Braun shaver in the past. But sent it back with no problems. Just don&#x27;t what shaver to order from here!</li>
            <li> Excellent light duty shaver, for pocket, auto or briefcase.&lt;br /&gt;Use with the Zeikos rechargeable batteries.&lt;br /&gt;Recharge about once a month. Use regularly.</li>
            <li> The Braun gives a good, close and reasonably comfortable shave; not quite as good as a Norelco but good. It is excellent shape/design for travel which is my intended use.</li>
            <li> This is a great shaver to keep in your car.  I had an old Krups shaver way back when that was dirt cheap and worked extremely well.  This one is actually better.  It somehow has a great battery life and gives an excellent shave for an inexpensive shaver.  If I loose this one I&#x27;ll buy another in a heart beat.</li>
            <li> Just as described.  Gave as gifts and most report they like it better than there regular electric shaver.</li>
            <li> these are my favorite can wait to shave for that smooth baby but feel.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a long-time Braun user (currently I&#x27;m using a Series 5 550cc), but I&#x27;ll be first to admit some of their models have problems. Their latest battery-powered travel shaver, the MobileShave M60B, is a definite improvement over my old PocketGo P-70. The main change, other than color and lack of the little push-out trimmer, is the newer Design Smart Foil like many of the more expensive Series shavers. The Smart Foil makes a tremendous difference compared to the older-style foil. The MobileShave gives a surprisingly good shave, but like most Braun single-foil shavers it will miss some longer hairs on your neck. This shaver can be used wet, and I actually like using it with shave gel (Nivea for Men Q10 is my favorite)which I think gives a closer shave with no irritation. Plus MobileShave can be washed clean and even used in the shower if you like that option. Battery life (two Duracell AAs are included) is excellent. All in all, this is a fine low-cost shaver and it&#x27;s well worth keeping in your messenger bag or brief case for touch ups, and it is a nice compact package (with \\&quot;on-board\\&quot; storage for a cleaning brush) for travel. Well done.</li>
            <li> Get model with a trimmer. This model does not have a trimmer.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used it 7 times - in between days when I use a razor.&lt;br /&gt;Shave is as good as any other electric I have used.&lt;br /&gt;Batteries are still good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Three years later still working. Typically used 3-4 times a week.&lt;br /&gt;Battery life has been excellent.&lt;br /&gt;Considering the price, a very good deal.</li>
            <li> For whatever reason, this does not shave the stubble on my head. I can spend 30 minutes passing over my beard and shaved head, it will make lots of lovely buzzing sounds, and it will sound like hair is being cut, but it does not cut anything.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought this to replace a very cheap generic shaver I bought from superdrug, and sadly I think I will have to go back to using it.</li>
            <li> This Braun Pocket Shaver is inexpensive and the perfect item for the person who wants to travel light.  It is a space saver that works well any time and any place.  I found it to be highly functional and effective and highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Handy size and works well.</li>
            <li> Nice unit.  Batteries last forever.</li>
            <li> overall good product great of on the road or in a carry on. Doesnt have the bread trimmer on this model so dont go more then a few days with out shaving</li>
            <li> I have a couple of these...one just for a backup...they are great.  close shave easy to clean and easy to use.</li>
            <li> A superb device -- I&#x27;ve owned many shavers, including ones costing well over $100.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This one is a gem -- VERY close shaves, 2 AA batteries last, literally, for a month or two.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Clever cover protects shaving head, plus it&#x27;s washable and inexpensive.</li>
            <li> I have been using these Braun travel/pocket shavers for years now.  I first discovered them while on a trip to Germany and had forgotten to pack a razor.  I bought one and have never used anything else since.  They are reasonably priced, and last forever, and can be washed clean just by sticking the head under the faucet.</li>
            <li> No matter what I tried I could not get it to turn on.  Not much else to say here, I can vouch the batteries were good because they were brand new and worked in the other shaver I bought.</li>
            <li> Ordered this for our son that has just started to get facial hair. It works great!  He really enjoys it as well as my husband.</li>
            <li> This was a gift for my dad for Christmas. He had one similar to this for years and it finally gave out. It&#x27;s hard to find in most stores now.  He loves it!</li>
            <li> Not the best shaving results. I was hoping for an easy and fast shave, but you have to keep shaving the same spot over and over and still get some hair spots. If I could, i would return it and go back to shaving with a razor</li>
            <li> Love this little mavel. Be prepared to take it out while going through airport security, the screeners didnt know what it was on several flights. Works extremely well.</li>
            <li> THis present was one of the most practical the recipient got and was well pleased with he portability and working shaver.  THe design makes it easy to pack,</li>
            <li> Excellent product for the money.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t shave as close as the older Braun 370 Pocket shaver I had to replace.  It also doesn&#x27;t have a trimmer like the older one, which I didn&#x27;t realize when I bought it.  It&#x27;s okay, not worth the hassle of returning.  The Model 370 was so good, I&#x27;m willing to give the M90 a shot.  In any case, no, it&#x27;s not a perfect shaver, but considering how inexpensive (I did NOT say cheap) and small it is, it&#x27;s a really good value for my normal(?) daily growth.</li>
            <li> Cheap and good. The foil design seems newer and better than the previous M30 I have. Even comes with 2 duracell batteries.</li>
            <li> User friendly in a sturdy package.</li>
            <li> Sure, it cannot compare with razors or other more powerful electrics, but what do you expect?  It&#x27;s a battery powered pocket shaver!  I have this in my car - it&#x27;s so convenient when you were in a hurry and missed a few nubs.</li>
            <li> Excellent Shaver. I have had Braun products in the past and they have always given me years of trouble free service. My youngest son just started shaving and this fit the bill. He has a hurry up lifestyle and carries with him, in his backpack or car, all of the time. Another Braun product that I can Highly Recommend.</li>
            <li> I bought this little shaver and a larger Remington shaver (at three times the cost) the same week. This one is much better than the Remington; it really attacks the stubble and gets rid of it. I don&#x27;t use if for daily shaving, rather for touching up areas I missed. However, I maintained my clean-shaven head with it for two weeks and it worked fine for that, too.</li>
            <li> This battery powered shaver works pretty much as described. I just don&#x27;t think this type of foil blade works as well with my particular face. A little noisy too.</li>
            <li> I like Braun travel razors. I have had one model or another since the mid 1980s. Got my first in Germany, never went back to any other company. This one is like all in the past... good quality even at the low end price. If you need a trimmer get another model. This cuts so well it evens out my sideburns without a trimmer...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use it every day. Not really used to the whole waterproof thing yet but it does wash off. Really cool waterproof battery compartment if you like that sort of thing. I should buy another one for when I wear out the studs on the foil cap snapping and unsnapping it to clean it every day (like I said, not really accustomed to the waterproofness yet)</li>
            <li> Works like a charm at this point but I&#x27;ve only used it a few times. It has, surprisingly, given just as good a shave as my Braun 3 Series shaver. The only drawback is a lack of trimmer, but if that&#x27;s what you need, buy the M90.</li>
            <li> This little razor has been with me all over the globe and it has performed very well. But it is important that you use strong fresh batteries to keep it at its best. I can recommend this shaver to anyone needing a nice cordless option.</li>
            <li> As electric shavers go, based on my experience with several over the years this a quite good one and at a fantastic price. Running on AA batteries is just great, you know you&#x27;ll always power if you bring rechargeables and/or buy batteries.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Still..this IS an electric shaver. I switched to using a safety razor, shaving soap, and a brush recently for my daily shave (I bought this razor just for travel) and...that is so so so much closer than any electric. So, the Braun gives me a good electric shave...which is roughly as close as a wet shave leaves me after my beard has grown all day! So, if you&#x27;re a wet shaver and you bought this for travel, just keep in mind that difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do like that it&#x27;s portable so you can bring it with you and shave again in a bathroom somewhere at 4pm to look better for dinner. The shaver has such low skin irritation that doing that would be just fine.</li>
            <li> Nice little shaver. Good for on the go. Found out that lithium batteries are a must for this item. I give it 3 1/2 stars.</li>
            <li> ...and much more efficient than buying a screen and cutter block for a razor whose model number I can&#x27;t remember...and so on. I use this daily, replacing all my other shaving devices. I wish only that this shaver had an option to plug in a cord when I wanted. And the price is right!!!</li>
            <li> I have had this shaver for a little over a year. It still shaves well and operates reliably. I change the batteries about every 3 weels.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Excellent value.</li>
            <li> It really didn&#x27;t work well as I needed it for my husband who was dying of cancer and I wanted something to shave him with that would be easy to use and do the job. This failed to do the job, even half way. For the price I expected it to be less than perfect but not at all useless.</li>
            <li> I have one of this model and three of the next one up. Great for travel, I keep one in my car for a quick shave if needed. Just keep the batteries fresh. The first thing to break will be the screen and a replacement screen cost about the same as an entire razor.</li>
            <li> My husband loves this!  It works just great for travel use and he actually uses it at home as well.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t need a razor for travel like most of these reviewers probably did but I absolutely hate shaving with a manual razor because its time consuming, it would always pull my facial hair instead of shaving it and I&#x27;d always cut myself, I&#x27;ve tried a couple of electric shavers (rechargeable and wired) and the rechargeable one did ok but the wired one was worse than shaving with a manual razor, using this it took me under a minute to shave and my face was smooth as if I&#x27;d have shaven with a manual razor.. it was also comfortable and didn&#x27;t leave any razor burns like my previous electric razor did.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the downside the instructions do recommend taking out the batteries after each use as they may start to leak and it also recommends putting a light coat of machine oil on the foil IF you rinse the foil under water often so it doesn&#x27;t rust (which should be expected).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the upside it does great and it takes AA batteries instead of AAA which cost a bit more, you may come across a $10 razor but it probably also takes AAA which is the catch.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the price this is definitely worth getting and atleast trying out.</li>
            <li> The Braun M60B shaver is an excellent device.  I long ago gave up on using disc head shavers and double or triple foils on my sparse beard.  I used my favored Braun 5523 pocket shaver for 10 years before the plastic housing cracked.  The Braun M60B is essentially the same device with added features of twist cap (never detaches so it can&#x27;t be lost), new geometric pattern foil, and washability; all improvements.  In truth, I do not know if my old device was water resistant and never tried.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The foil is extremely comfortable and doesn&#x27;t give razor burn when you apply pressure like the old one did.  I can press this shaver firmly against my skin for closer shave with no discomfort at all!  The shaver itself does a nice job.  It&#x27;s actually closer than a blade on my moustache.  Not as close as a blade on my cheeks and neck, but perfectly acceptable, and better than any other electric shaver I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s confusing to use because you have to angle the head a very specific way to catch the hair. The included manual is frustrating because it is too generic (it details features available across several different models, but does not indicate which models have which features, or what the features of this shaver specifically are).</li>
            <li> [[ASIN:B002PCPZQA BRAUN POCKET SHAVER,2xAA,CAP - WASHABLE, M60B]] - It&#x27;s been a few years since I last bought one, and the M60 now has the same blade foil as the M90 that I tried later. The new foil makes a big difference in closeness and an even bigger difference in comfort. It also seems more rugged (I ruined one of the old style foils just washing it).</li>
            <li> with lithium batteries this is about as good a little shaver as there is. I have two of them and I couldn&#x27;t be happier with the shaves I get.</li>
            <li> I have never had good results with electric razors. This one is no different. It simply does not shave my whiskers. I have to use a regular razor to clean up after using the electric.</li>
            <li> I have ordered two of these, different in colors and model however evenly alike and effective.  These are battery operated. I prefer that this shaver unit could be a rechargeable. Being battery operated is the only drawback. I detail my mustache to a good extent with the Braun however I recommend Norelco-Philips XA9146/ 42 for a finer touch. The Braun cleans my face without a nick using soap or shaving cream in the shower. The result is clean and smooth as expected for the daily course off to work in the morning. This unit does not shave hairs that have lasted over a day effectively or those that have grown any more than a 1/4 inch from my face. Therefore I use the Braun EVERYDAY and so we will see how long the shaver holds up (it has now been 3 months and all&#x27;s well). I have had trial and error spent with other shavers. My love for this Braun shaver is not necessarily regarding the brand, yet rather it&#x27;s effectiveness in sustaining a CLEAN and respectable shave on a daily basis. I further recommend Norelco-Philips XA9146/ 42 in mustache detailing and making the gradual curve. Best of luck to all men and ladies, Treat your face with love and tender care.</li>
            <li> I bought this shaver as a patch up shaver for when I&#x27;m in the car heading to an event and I&#x27;m in need of a touch-up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It works okay but does not produce the closest shave possible.  I find myself going over and over the same area again and again to get that smooth finished feeling.  A tad on the noisy side but when you are all by yourself in the car it really doesn&#x27;t matter.  I&#x27;m unable to find any replacement screens as of yet so I&#x27;m assuming that when it gets dull we&#x27;re just suppose to throw it away and buy something else.</li>
            <li> A fine shaver that I got  at a great price ....under 20 bucks...I use it at work for touch ups......because I can.</li>
            <li> I travel constantly and the size of the razor fits anywhere.  It gives a nice close shave and also because of its size it shaves in the hard to reach places.  It uses standard batteries which last several months.  It is extremely easy to clean, comes with its own brush and can be washed under water.  BUY it!</li>
            <li> Shaves as good as the $98 brand named rotary I got as a gift. Which also eats the skin off my neck. It does take a few minutes longer to shave but for this kind of money? I&#x27;m satisfied</li>
            <li> I purchased this product based on price and brand name of Braun.  After 3 months of use mainly at the gym, I noticed rusted screw heads when you remove the head cover.  Also, translucent plastic body looks similar to cheap plastic toys that shows inside batteries and circuit board.  Shaving experience is acceptable but I won&#x27;t use this shaver everyday.</li>
            <li> It shaves quite well except it is a bit noisy - noisier than my other Panasonic model. Perhaps shavers using 2 AAs are all kind of noisy. I had rechargeable BRAUN before and it worked quite well also.  It is recommended.</li>
            <li> I bought this for the days I forgot to shave or needed a tocuh up before an afternoon meeting.  It does work and leaves me very smooth, but takes a long time and a number of passes.</li>
            <li> I returned the Remington Curve razor so highly recommended for women because it removed absolutely none of my leg hair stubble when used either  wet or dry, and replaced it with the Braun M-60, which is THE BEST ELECTRIC RAZOR I&#x27;ve ever used.  It&#x27;s powered with 2 AA batteries but boy does it give a great shave!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After going through menopause my hormones went crazy and so did my hair growth -- on face, legs and arms!  I&#x27;d been using the Venus Embrace manual razors, which are truly the best manual razor for women but are so expensive, but I&#x27;m having knee replacement soon and wanted an electric razor to use after surgery as I won&#x27;t be able to get my leg wet for several days and my leg hair will get out of hand if I don&#x27;t shave.  The small but powerful electric razor fits the bill -- and I may just stick with it rather than go back to the expensive Venus Embrace razors.  Thanks Braun!</li>
            <li> This is a compact battery powered razor that provides a good close shave. I keep it in my car to deal with five o&#x27;clock shadow and to hit spots I miss in the morning with my blade razor. Perfect as a backup razor to keep in your car or at work.</li>
            <li> I purchased this razor for my husband as a back up razor.  It has now become his full time razor.  It has a lot of power for a battery razor.  I don&#x27;t think you can go wrong with a Braun.</li>
            <li> Works pretty good, but bogs down alot if you put hardly any pressure on it. This is with new Duracells</li>
            <li> We bought these for a Christmas gift.  They come with a 2 yr warranty and they also have duracell batteries included.  How nice * Jesus&#x27; Blessings and Peace</li>
            <li> I hate shaving, therefore I love the Braun Pocket Shaver.  In just a couple of minutes I can have my face baby-back smooth.  I gave this razor to a friend of mine who is transgender (male to female) and they really love it.  It easily provides a super-close shave in minutes and can be done in car or anywhere and is so small it fits well in a small pocket or purse.</li>
            <li> It works great. Hubby likes how it is comfortable and stable to hold. Really like that the cover rotates and protects. Not crazy that its battery powered but that is to be expected with a travel shaver.</li>
            <li> Fantastic battery operated shaver, I not only use it for travelling but everyday. Great close shave and the batteries last for weeks.</li>
            <li> This is a $9.00 battery powered shaver and it includes 2 Duracell AA batteries. It works fairly well if you re-educate yourself about the fact that you are using a $9 razor and that you may not be able to use it like a $150 Braun or Panasonic razor. I found that I had to use it repeatedly and turn it perpendicular relative to a normal razor you might get a semi-decent shave. Bear in mind that this is a quick cleanup razor and it&#x27;s not going to give you a Merkur razor with a Badger brush shave look when you are done. Also understand that these fail pretty regularly - the first one I bought died about 2 weeks post-purchase and after about ten shaves. I read all the negative reviews and I can&#x27;t argue with many of them other than to say this a NINE DOLLAR razor and you won&#x27;t get the $150 shave. For the price it&#x27;s a remarkable piece of technology - when it works. Be sure to save all the packaging for a while so you can send it back if it dies but when these work they are a remarkably cheap and work as well as could be expected under the circumstances. I find it hard to completely bash something that is this cheap and the fit and finish is solid. But.... they die faster than a bad guy in Bruce Willis movie.</li>
            <li> Good razor. Would recommend you buy. Does eat a lot of AAs.</li>
            <li> This shaver gives a very close shave provided the stubble is short.  It will not cut any hairs of any length.  If I shave twice a day this will get as close as a blade.  Skip a day and you need a 2nd shaver to get the stubble to a managable length</li>
            <li> I agree with other reviews, I would have given this product even less than a star because it doesn&#x27;t deserve one. This shaver doesn&#x27;t shave at all!! I bought it when I was travelling and forgot my Philips shaver at home (a great one btw) and thought I could use this one to get a decent shave.&lt;br /&gt;Ohh, how wrong I was, after 30 minutes shaving I had my face completely irritated and still had a lot of hair here and there.&lt;br /&gt;I used a better model of Braun shaver before and therefore I can conclude that foil shavers aren&#x27;t that fast and by design all are worse than the rotary shavers.&lt;br /&gt;Sorry Braun, but I think you&#x27;re going to lose the shavers battle with the old foil design, it&#x27;s just not performant enough.&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re on budget and searching for a good travel shaver choose HQ40, you would not regret buying it.&lt;br /&gt;And Braun..so long.</li>
            <li> I have all of the battery operated shavers, this and the Panasonic are the best built and most practical everyday shavers ot them all.</li>
            <li> They work well.  With Litium batteries it works a long time.  I keep it in my bag when I travel.  Mildly water resistant easy to clean.</li>
            <li> Pretty nice little unit. I bought this for camping off the grid for a quick shave. It won&#x27;t replace a blade or your main shaver, but it will keep the stubble down to a reasonable level. Nice thing is it runs on AA&#x27;s that are easy to find and easy to replace.</li>
            <li> This thing cuts better than any 3,5,or 7 series shaver Braun makes and it is cheaper than the replacement blade!  Just simple and it works and without the non-working unnecessary spring action all the new shavers have now under the blade!  instead of buying blades every few months just buy bunch of these.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used it and it is wrapped and under the tree currently. I expect it to be decent based on the reviews. It came quick and is packaged in a box with a tab at the top like it would be hung on a peg at the drug store. May post again later.</li>
            <li> It is easy to carry around, What about the effect of the shave, only my husband knows, but the workmanship is very good.</li>
            <li> Handy and easy to operate.  Protective shield for the blade that rotates away when in use is a nice feature, allowing some protection from normal use.</li>
            <li> Both cheap and good for shaving, transparent body is very beautiful, but also body wash, very convenient. wo xihuan zhege guahudao</li>
            <li> The batteries don&#x27;t last very long.  It gives a great shave, and its design is perfect.  The short battery life is my only complaint.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I still haven&#x27;t received the 11B Foil and Cutter below.</li>
            <li> This is a handy little shaver for touching up on the go when you&#x27;re running a little late. I strongly advise putting it in a Ziploc bag and storing the batteries separately otherwise when it&#x27;s not used overtime the batteries can leak and ruin it as it did to my son&#x27;s version. Beware of standard version Coppertop brand batteries and ever ready batteries because they leak. In years past they never leaked in current years they frequently do ruining many of my devices. Stick to Panasonic/Sanyo or Enloope. Those are quality batteries</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried to find the right shaver for travel. Most have removable foil covers that get lost or fall off at some point. This razor provides a decent shave and has an attached foil cover which can&#x27;t be misplaced. I can toss it in my glove box with no fear of damage to it and that&#x27;s a big plus!</li>
            <li> instructions as to battery use was confusing and may have been reason that razor didn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li> Great for a first time shaver. More for thinner or less coarse facial hair. Not too good for handling heavy, or think beards/facial hair. I used one I owned previously for about 1 year with zero issue before I felt the need to replace the blade. (Which is cheap). Good Buy.</li>
            <li> I have used these shavers in the past on an every day use....Foil only lasts a few years , but its really for on the go light stubble not every day..Like this better then the throw away&#x27;s..The foils are expensive , better off just buying a new one for less then $20.00 ...The more expensive Braun&#x27;s I&#x27;ve used, but to cumbersome...</li>
            <li> Love this shaver. please note that this is a day After shave shaver. it does not do well 1-2 Day no shave if you have a nice thick beard come in like me. I just usually have a nice Razor shave then, just keep it up daily with this bad boy, impressive power for (2) AA battery powered shaver. Highly recommend!!</li>
            <li> I only use it to shave certain areas,but it cleans thaose areas up nicely,and I like the fact it has a flip screen saver attached to it.Also comfortable to hold.Nice design.</li>
            <li> This is a just ok shaver, just as good as the rest of electric shavers but the price is right and it is good for travel camping or for that afternoon touch me up</li>
            <li> This is hands down the best electric shaver that I have ever used. I was quite pleasantly surprised as this is a battery powered travel shaver and you wouldn&#x27;t think it would be all that great. I bought it based on other reviews and for me, after a couple of months of use, it has been perfect. I have to use an electric shaver as regular razor blades invariably end up drawing some blood, &amp;#34;for sensitive skin&amp;#34; claims of razor-shaving products notwithstanding. This shaver is easy to hold, it&#x27;s quiet, and it shaves really close. I take my time shaving and I think Braun&#x27;s new hole pattern on the foil does help. I&#x27;ve never used anything like it before. I use Sanyo &amp;#34;Eneloop&amp;#34; rechargeable batteries and they last a good long time, thus negating the lack of AC power and cost of disposable batteries. At a cheaper price for this whole unit than just the replacement blades for my old Remington, I&#x27;ll just buy another one of these when the blades or foil wear out.</li>
            <li> I travel and prefer this style shaver instead of anything electrical. My legs are smooth after a shave. It helps me shave quickly without nicks like there would be with a razor! It is also one of the quietest shavers I have ever had. I do not disturb persons watching TV or socializing in the same hotel room I am in while I am shaving.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nice product!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lisa F. Hilo,HI</li>
            <li> This is a handy shaver for the car and travel.  Works well, easy to handle and clean.  I am pleased</li>
            <li> Works well, just as good as any expensive shaver.  Plus it runs on AA batteries which is easy to replace unlike regular shavers.  When you use the shaver with Eneloop rechargeable batteries, it&#x27;s the perfect combination.</li>
            <li> THIS IS FOR STUBBLE!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bad reviews seem to come from people trying to shove their long hairs into this machine and being disappointed when they don&#x27;t fit through.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use this exclusively for my upper lip to keep away the stache, and it is absolutely perfect for this. It cuts just as close as a razer against the grain, with no pimples/cuts. If you want to maintain a close shave every day, this is THE ideal tool for you.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used these 2 battery Braun shavers exclusively for years now. I use them with rechargeable batteries. I generally get between one and two years out of one, before the screen develops a small hole. I use an old toothbrush to clean the head after each shave, and lube the screen with a few drops of &#x27;lectric shave before each use. I shave after thoroughly washing and drying my face.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s working great. I like the protection cover because my first choice, less expensive Eltron, only lasted 2 days due to damage. My Arimis gift one lasted 30 years, then transducer gave up.</li>
            <li> Product does not work.  Ordered it before a cross-country trip and by the time I found out it didn&#x27;t work I was on the other side of the US.  By the time I got home, it was too late to return it!  Doesn&#x27;t work for face hair, leg hair, coarse hair or ffine hair.  It just doesn&#x27;t work.  Save your money.</li>
            <li> I had two Braun M-90 pocket shavers and used them alternating them for about 10 years.  The screen on one of them finally broke and I was down to only one so I decided to get this M60B to replace the one that broke and have been using it for several months and really love it.  I performs just as well as the M90 and is only missing the side burn trimmer.  I am thoroughly pleased with this shaver.  Braun makes a fine product.</li>
            <li> Have one in the car to touch up during the day! Works great! Easy to clean. Well made with integral cover.</li>
            <li> It just won&#x27;t function. I expected much more of the razor as I already have one older model.&lt;br /&gt;Sad,&lt;br /&gt;Albert Reynolds&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m very disappointed with my new travel elec razor from /braun.&lt;br /&gt;my old one worked well and is still in daily use.  Even with batt. that&lt;br /&gt;are very old and have used over the years for many months.&lt;br /&gt;What a disappointment......&lt;br /&gt;Albert E Reynolds</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had these shavers before and really like them for touch ups or traveling.  But this one doesn&#x27;t have the little slide open sideburn trimmer, which really comes in handy sometimes. Also, as you shave, the motor sounds uneven as you move the shaver over your face.</li>
            <li> I find this shaver very useful especially for trimming above my lip and below my nose.  I also use it for a finishing touch after shaving with my Norelco.  I keep one in my car for any time i might want a quick touch up.</li>
            <li> great shaver and a very close shave</li>
            <li> The 370 was/is a great travel shaver, so much that hubby uses it almost every day instead of his $120 shaver. So, I went looking for another and bought this... I&#x27;m surprised Braun put their name on it. It&#x27;s just plain terrible. The cutter head actually cut his face during shaving. Something&#x27;s wrong with this one. Buying another 370.</li>
            <li> I ordered several of these to replace the Braun shaver that I&#x27;ve had for years.  The problem with the Braun shaver was that I had to replace the blades and the head screen every few months.  For the cost of this disposable shaver, I would have to play more the replace the blades and screen on my Braun shaver.  This shaver does quite well, runs on batteries (you can use re-chargeable ones as well) and it works quite well.  The blade cannot be replaced, but if you clean it regularly, you can easily get 6 months of daily use from it before the blade is no longer functional.  I have given these as gifts to my sons and they love using them as well and have stopped buying replacement blades and screens for their regular shavers.  It&#x27;s also a great alternative to throw into your travel kit, since it&#x27;s lightweight, runs on batteries and can be replaced when it&#x27;s worn out.  Great way to shave without all of the hassle of replacement blades or screens.  They come in different colors and some have the little sideburn trimmer, but really, do you need that?</li>
            <li> This portable shaver is very well designed and works well enough for the money. It is not as good as a high end shaver but is much cheaper and easier to carry on a trip. I love the way this shaver is designed with a built in cover and easy access to the batteries.</li>
            <li> perfect to keep in the car if running late.  however Amazons stupid requirement for fifteen words in a review is #@!$%</li>
            <li> incredible value for Braun quality. 5 stars.</li>
            <li> Very happy with this shaver.  I haven&#x27;t used a shaver in years as I never got what I thought was a close shave.  Always used a razor.  This one does the job as long as I don&#x27;t let my beard grow for more than 2 days.  Then it doesn&#x27;t work as well as a razor.  As long as I do daily..............perfect!</li>
            <li> I have been using Braun battery powered shavers for a number of years. They work great and don&#x27;t suck up alot of battery. Close shave and I have two. One for the car and one for the bathroom. Love it.</li>
            <li> Nice little on the go shaver. Takes a little time but effective and clean.</li>
            <li> Bought several of these. They work fine on 2 AA batteries.</li>
            <li> Good value for product</li>
            <li> But my husband has not tried it yet...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Who I bought it for...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But the idea is great...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will adopt it as my own if it does not get touched by him...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you!</li>
            <li> This item works good, but seems to need repeated moves over the same area to really cut the bristles. I in no way ever allow my hairs to grow that much before trimming and I find you need to work a little harder with this thing to make it work. But I do like how there is no cord and the top has a folding cover -good for travel or a small bathroom.</li>
            <li> It makes a lot of noise, but doesn&#x27;t cut a beard that well.  Nice color, though.</li>
            <li> I love this Braun pocket shaver, it gives me a clean shave and does it quickly thank you for your service.</li>
            <li> Its a nice little portable shaver to be used in a pinch. Its a little noisy and the shave is not that close, but about as good as any sub $75 shaver.</li>
            <li> the foil developed a tear after 1 week. Threw it away.</li>
            <li> buying from Amazon is amazing. anything I need I can find there. this small shaver is fine for me as a woman. It is purse size and the price is reasonable. I would recommend it to anyone who needs a little help, especially women.</li>
            <li> Bought it to replace same model the I used for over seven years before it finally wore out, great value.</li>
            <li> After using the shaver during several road trips I find I like it a lot.  The swivel cover is perfect for traveling, the AA batteries last many days, it shaves as close as any electric I have owned.  Only negative is the lack of any trimmer for sideburns or lopping off those missed hairs that have grown too long to be picked up by the shaver head.</li>
            <li> exellent shaver, works as well as my $120 Braun Aviator, and u can use it wet! something i cant do wth my $120 shaver. Would definitely recommend it! I paid $20 for mine and I&#x27;ve had it for over a year. The replacement foil on my Brain Aviator was $ 40 twice the price of this shaver. Get one, u won&#x27;t regret it!</li>
            <li> For more than 15 years the only shaver I&#x27;ve used is a Braun Pocket Shaver. On my fine beard and angular face, it gives me a shave that is as smooth as any shaver I&#x27;ve ever used, and I&#x27;ve tried just about every brand and style all over the past 50 years. This shaver consistently gives me a smooth, non-irritating shave, particularly when I use an electric pre-shave like Williams Lectric Shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought my first model 375 when I discovered that it cost less than a replacement cutter and foil for my more expensive Braun corded shaver. I love the 375 because it is slightly smaller but has a good trimmer-- better trimmer than the one on the M90. The M60) has no trimmer.&lt;br /&gt;I keep my 375 in the car where I did most of my shaving on my commute to work. Now that I&#x27;m retired I use the M90 more often. Both use the same screen and cutter.&lt;br /&gt;My 375 is about 4 years old. It was my third Pocket Shaver--cheaper to buy a new shaver than replacement foil and cutter. I bought the M-90 just over 2 years ago and use it about 60 percent of the time, so I&#x27;m guessing it has about 200+ shaves on it.  If I could find a 375, I&#x27;d buy it as a spare.&lt;br /&gt;Through the years I&#x27;ve discovered that batteries do make a difference. This shaver works best when running at full speed. Rechargable NiMh batteries seem to cause the shaver to run slower than alkalines. They are also heavier. The best bet are Lithium Ion batteries. I get about 60 shaves on a set of Li-Ions. They cause the motors to run faster and are much lighter. (I can get a complete, very good shave in less than the 5 minutes it takes me to drive 2 miles to church on Sunday morning.) The lighter weight Li-Ions are a plus when carrying the shaver in a backpack through airports.&lt;br /&gt;The trimmer on the M90 is of little value. It&#x27;s on the side, is small and is curved. I have yet to figure out what it is good for. By contrast, the inch-long straight trimmer on the 375 is perfect for trimming sideburns. The cleaning brush on the 375 is slightly larger than the ones on the M60/90, but neither are very good for cleaning the shavers. I use a much larger one from an old Braun.&lt;br /&gt;If I skip shaving for more than two days, I find that this shaver misses some hairs. Once a hair gets a three day head start, only the trimmer or a straight razor will get at it.375 is slightly larger than the ones on the M60/90, but neither are very good for cleaning the shavers.

            <li> Small unit with reliable function.  Uses 2 AA alkaline batteries which seem to last forever. Great for the office and travel. Highly recommend this unit.</li>
            <li> Good for both dry and wet shaving on the go or traveling.  Small, portable, battery driven and clean shaving all in one package.</li>
            <li> Very convenient to use and much less expensive than buying blades for my other electric shaver.  I&#x27;ll never go back :-)</li>
            <li> It was cheap and it runs on batteries so this was meant to be a traveling razor. it cuts fair at best but it will take off last night&#x27;s beard.  My husband and I both use one and it does the job but not like an expensive electric razor, of course.</li>
            <li> great unit for the car and quick touch ups</li>
            <li> I would give this product 5 stars if it had a popup trimmer, but I really like that it&#x27;s washable.</li>
            <li> Bought for my boyfriend.  He opened and tried to use it, it did not work at all.  Another reviewer said it didnt work on asian facial hair as it is so coarse.  My boyfriend is korean and he agrees. My step-dad owns it and likes it.  He has sensitive skin with I guess normal coarseness and it doesnt cause a rash for him,  so good luck!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a long time fan of Braun shavers, going back about 30 years.  I&#x27;m doing more travel lately, and wanted something light and easy to travel with.  I didn&#x27;t think Braun made such a shaver, but was happy to see the great reviews on this and ordered it.  Perfect size -- about the size of a bar of soap, well made, and i like the simplicity -- even the sliding plastic cover for the shaving head is neat.  A pair of AA batteries powers it -- couldn&#x27;t be simpler.</li>
            <li> Works fine. I have several other brands an this one works better than do.</li>
            <li> Use this razor daily, have one at work, car, home, seem to last a year or more, just change batteries as needed</li>
            <li> Small and reasonably lightweight. I love the design of the shaver, where you can just rotate the cover on and off. Helps to protect the foils when not in use (probably the first thing to break down on shavers like these), and it saves the hassle of taking it in and out of a separate case. The cleaning brush also fits neatly into the shaver.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Battery lasts forever. I&#x27;ve used it every day and I&#x27;m now on the 4th month with the shaver, with the original batteries in the package. Still going strong.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great price as well.</li>
            <li> Not as close as a razor and shaving cream, but it&#x27;s a quick fix when you don&#x27;t have time to shave in the shower.  Travels well, which is themain reason for purchase.</li>
            <li> smaller and more expensive than this one, principally beause it was rechargeable, but it did not work nearly as well.  I usually shave with a double blade every other day, but with this shaver, I popped in the 2 provided batteries and shave once a day...easy and just fine...no razor burn...This is so cheap that when the head eventually wears out, I will toss it and just buy another one of these...very convenient...uses 2 AA copper top bats...provided with it.  Claims the head can be washed out with water, but not planning on doing that as it comes with a brush, built in the base.  Very handy and the head cover is very good...no worry about it coming off in my shaving kit!  I have a goatee and mustache so I shave my cheeks and my neck...my neck has a swirling hair pattern and is difficult to shave with either a blade or electric without repeatedly going over it in different directions, but this shaver handles it nicely.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I find that using this razor, I only have to shave with my blade razor every 4th day...thus reducing the cost of expensive blade replacements by 75 percent!  Won&#x27;t take long for it to pay for itself!!</li>
            <li> this product is not for black men. This just glides over the curls and barely works on new hair growth.</li>
            <li> I buy 2 of these shavers per year. For some reason this one does not shave as close as ones previously purchased</li>
            <li> I picked this shaver up not excepting much considering its modest price tag, so I was mildly amazed by the great shaves I&#x27;ve been able to get from it. The overall quality of the shaver is quite good as well. The battery life is good considering what you&#x27;re asking it to do, but rechargeables are the order of the day.</li>
            <li> This pocket shaver is awesome! So good that is beats my main nolreo tri head. I have bought 3 and given them as gift.</li>
            <li> Too weak.  Effective if used daily.  But if you let your bear grow more than a day or two, is does not shaves well.</li>
            <li> powerful. cheap. thoughtful design.</li>
            <li> It works as well as the more expensive ones. Batteries last a long time. Easy to clean.</li>
            <li> I have an M60 for travel and an M90 for home use. Essentially the same razors, but the M90 has a trimmer and the body of the unit seems a bit beefier than the M60. But both razors do a nice job. I have a heavy beard but still get a close comfortable shave. Not as close as a blade, but good for an electric. Moreover, the Braun Pocket Shaver shaves as close as any electric razor I&#x27;ve ever used. Some longer hairs or neck hairs may evade the Braun, but they can be &amp;#34;mowed down&amp;#34; with a little perseverance. The batteries last a decent amount of time. It&#x27;s easy to clean. It&#x27;s waterproof. It would be perfect ... but the foil damages easily. Nonetheless, at such a reasonable price, when I damage or wear out a foil I just buy a new razor.</li>
            <li> Great little travel shaver!  Purchased 3 more for my sons ! Love the battery operation instead of having to recharge every time I use it !</li>
            <li> Good price, works well, easily portable</li>
            <li> Exactly what I needed for carry on when I can not bring my double edge razor. Easy to use and clean. Batteries easier than carrying a wall charger. Smooth shave too!</li>
            <li> Whoever is the engineer, (or team) from Braun that came up with this little shaver is a genius.  I have a heavy beard, and this little shaver really performs.  Absolutly a great value.  If you travel frequently, do not hesitate to buy this product.</li>
            <li> Sent it to my husband over seas</li>
            <li> Works for what I need. I have 1 spot on my face that is difficult to shave with a razor without nicking a mole. So this works well for that.  Never been a fan of foil razors.</li>
            <li> Nicely made, very comfortable.</li>
            <li> Use care with the screen over the blades, otherwise an excellent product and VERY handy wherever you might be.</li>
            <li> Unbeatable value. I&#x27;d purchased the exact same shaver a long time ago, kept it in the pickup, used it all the time, finally got dulled down. So I went on ahead and bought it again. Simple, bombproof, works great, inexpensive. A great item.</li>
            <li> Good design, shaves very well.</li>
            <li> I have been using now for 3 months abroad, here in Vilcabamba, Ecuador. It is a champ, no problems, thinking now about buying 2-3 to have as backup when I stop through the USA for my 1-2 weeks stops. I purchased it, because there the lighting in Hotel rooms is bad, and it is hard to shave with a Bic, so this is easy. Note, that plastic jobby that cover the cutting head is what makes if valuable to me, it will not bust inside my backpack.

            <li> For the price it is a great low cost shaver. It is compact for the traveling person. Easy to clean.</li>
            <li> Well it is certainly convenient but will not give a very close shave but it should be handy for traveling My son will probably keep it for college since shaving will not be a priority.</li>
            <li> Replaced an older Braun Pocket Shaver.  Works perfectly.  So much, that we ordered 2 more for our sons.</li>
            <li> really good little razor, not super quality but you can&#x27;t beat the price</li>
            <li> This shaver has a very clever and functional design, especially for the price.  Unfortunately it is not exceptional at its main function- to provide a close shave.  I&#x27;d give it four stars if used on a face that had been previously shaved within 24 hours; not as close as an expensive rechargable, but not terrible.  But wait more than 24 hours and it takes FOREVER to get all of the longer hairs- one star would be generous.  Since I take long overseas trips and cannot always shave on a regular schedule, this is a problem.</li>
            <li> This shaver gets the job done. When I have to head into work on a sunday at 7:30am, it&#x27;s very nice to have this thing in the glove box to trim myself up. I did get one pimple after using this shaver, but it went away quick. it shaves good enough. Not as well as a real, blade shave, but it gets the basic job done.</li>
            <li> Loved that this item came with batteries, it was a nice touch.  The shaver appears to be of good quality.  The directions were a little difficult because there were multiple models on the instructions.</li>
            <li> I purchased this shaver to be used when I go on a plane trip.  I don&#x27;t want to check-in my carry on bag but if I have a razor blade in the bag I&#x27;m afraid I will be forced to check the bag instead of storing it in the overhead compartment of the plane.  I have been using the pocket shaver for about a month at home in place  of my razor.  It works ok but not nearly as good as a razor.  The two batteries have been in the unit for over a month and I shave everyday and they are still working fine.  For the price I guess I did ok.</li>
            <li> Low power seems disposable.</li>
            <li> The Braun Pocket Shaver, model M60B, is so useful for grooming after a long day at work when one has no time to return home before an evening&#x27;s engagement.  I keep it in my briefcase for just that purpose and am considering purchasing another to keep in my automobile.[[ASIN:B002PCPZQA BRAUN POCKET SHAVER,2xAA,CAP - WASHABLE, M60B]]</li>
            <li> the batteries last forever (and they come with it!!) its powerful and easy to carry around. A+++ WILL SHAVE AGAIN!!</li>
            <li> got a little razor burn feel the first time but nothing major, very smooth shave, still on original batteries. I&#x27;d recommend this for travel</li>
            <li> I picked up the original M90 model years ago on an extended stay in Texas. Before that I used a $10 knock-off from a Chinatown that worked surprisingly well. Well the M90 wasn&#x27;t as close of a shave but it was very portable. By comparison, that cheap knock off once went off while in my duffel bag as I attempted to stow it in an overhead. That was fun.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The M60B follows in the M90s footsteps but now smaller and more refined. I used to use it only for travel but it has since become my primary shaver. Its such a great design, and being Braun, I wouldn&#x27;t be surprised if Deiter Rammes was a large influence.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I haven&#x27;t had to replace the foil or blades yet. My facial hair is very controllable so its never going to be put through its paces.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve gotten to where I use it all the time because it shaves so well. Originally bought for travel but it does such a good job I use it all the time.</li>
            <li> Arrived quickly. Does an ok job in an emergency. Keep it in the glove compartment for a last minute shave.</li>
            <li> I got these because it was less expensive than buying a replacement foil and cutter block.  Only this model does not have the trimmer.</li>
            <li> This shaver is small and compact and I use it for shaving in the field, (I&#x27;m military).  It does not snag or pull hairs and does an excellent job of not missing hairs.  Excellent product for either field duty use or everyday use.</li>
            <li> Awesome product. Very compact, low noise, and easy to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have very coarse facial hair and the Braun M60b worked like a charm wet and/or dry. You cannot beat this little device for the price alone; will definitely buy another as a spare.</li>
            <li> Just back from a road trip, 17 days on the set of Duracell AA&#x27;s that came with it and they&#x27;re still going strong. Small, light, convenient and protects itself with a folding cover that means I can just throw it in a bag with other stuff. It&#x27;s a little slow and sometimes sounds like its working hard, and the shave isn&#x27;t quite as close as a blade or an expensive electric shaver. And hairs that get missed quickly become too long for the foil to catch, so things were a little untidy after a couple of weeks. So it gets five stars as an affordable and convenient travelling companion, not as a sole-use shaver long-term.</li>
            <li> This is a nice addition to my shaver inventory, especially for travel.  It is light, compact, and cuts well.  Very handy.</li>
            <li> I love it.  It does everything it is suppose to do.  Performs super!!!</li>
            <li> I had one of these before but lost it. I keep it in my car in case I leave the house and forgot to shave. Great design features like the swiveling blade guard which prevents it from being turned on when closed. It gives a good shave too so I wouldn&#x27;t mind having it as my main shaver. Great value!</li>
            <li> I keep this in my briefcase for quick touch ups late in the day and travel.</li>
            <li> Great shave for the price. Great shave period. The product holds a charge for weeks on end and is convenient to take with me when I travel as well as to keep in the car for those quick touch ups. I have purchased many shaveers over the years but none give the shave this one does.</li>
            <li> isn&#x27;t the best shaver of them all but it do the work!, easy to clean, to use, i&#x27;m happy with my purchase</li>
            <li> I just wished it was a bit cheaper.  It works like a charm, and make sure you change your batteries after one month or two months of using!  It gets weak without strong batteries!  Good buy!</li>
            <li> This is not only reasonable but also compact and good shaving. You can use it wherever on a trip or at home confortably.</li>
            <li> I bought this for the price &amp; the great reviews. It did not work at all on my legs. I know it didn&#x27;t say it would, but for any ladies that might want to try it now there is something that says it won&#x27;t!</li>
            <li> Purchased the M60 and the R4 the same day. I didn&#x27;t consider a comparison because of the price difference between the two. However, after shaving with both, I realized the inexpensive M60 was doing a much better job. Not only that, not having to recharge is very valuable. Pack an extra set of AA batteries and off you go. I have thick whiskers and was surprised at the cut this little beast provided. If I let my face go more than 3 days it struggles, but if I keep up with it, the M60 does a fantastic job.&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t know how long it will last, but immediate impressions are very good.</li>
            <li> At first I was a bit skeptical, but I&#x27;ve had this for a couple months now and am impressed with its shave. It takes 2 double A batteries which lasts me about 2 months. It may make more sense to use rechargeable batteries. I gave one of these to my son for Xmas. He likes it a lot as well.</li>
            <li> First of all, I got it on next day after order. It is working good and clean. Every time the shaver with me now. I like it and would be recommended that stuff.&lt;br /&gt;P.S. I am still using the shaver after 6 months. It works perfect. Didn&#x27;t have a time to clean yet. Works like a new.. What&#x27;s interesting..</li>
            <li> This product is not ment to be a full size shaver but it does a great job.  Only had it for a few days and I&#x27;m surprised how well it works.  If there are any problems in the future, I&#x27;ll post but i don&#x27;t anticipate any.  Basically I use it for touch ups between full shaves.  I get five o&#x27;clock shadow and I this has me looking normal again in minutes.  Thanks Braun.</li>
            <li> I got this as a backup razor. It is small and compact. VERY easy to use. It gives a fairly close shave (not like a non-electric) and I have had razors that were VERY expensive and this one did ALMOST as good a job and yet was $100 cheaper.&lt;br /&gt;If you are wanting a great razor for the money this is the one (and the blue color is kind of cool too). The low reviews I do not understand. Maybe their expectations were too high or they were trying to get rid of a full beard...I am unsure but if you only need a touch up or early morning shaving (or that 5:00 shadow) then this will work very well.&lt;br /&gt;Very happy customer</li>
            <li> Pretty decent blades, overall.  They definitely clean up the growth.  However, this one doesn&#x27;t come with a trimmer, which really sucks, as that is one of the best features of the Braun.  So, I&#x27;d recommend getting the version of this with the trimmer, instead.  However, this is good for what it does.</li>
            <li> I do not like this shaver at all. It doesn&#x27;t give me a close shave. Almost seems like the stubble cant enter the tight mesh foil or something.&lt;br /&gt;The little Panasonic travel shaver or the Silver Remington shaver give a much closer shave and they are cheaper! I dont know what the hell I will do with this&lt;br /&gt;thing. I kept it as a backup shaver but its not even adequate for that. Cool design though!</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t work as a shaver.... just a useless waterproof paper weight</li>
            <li> Works well as a teenager&#x27;s first shaver.</li>
            <li> I purchased my first Braun M60 from Walgreens to see if it met my needs. I am still using this shaver after 150 days. I ordered additional shavers from Amazon because they were cheaper than local stores. My average shave per day is 5-6 minutes. The batteries, based on my shaving time, have lasted 60 days. I have used Energizer batteries for the first two 60 day battery replacements. I expect the Duracell batteries included with the shaver to last about the same time. I use shaving cream for shaving because I get a closer shave with no irritation. Is the shaver better than a good razor: no, but it comes darn close. If you use the shaver with shaving cream, let the shaver dry between uses by removing the shaving head foil, close the shaver to protect the blade and stand it upside down. Otherwise the shaver will not dry thoroughly and develope an odor. Once a week I put liquid soap on the blade, put the foil on, and let it run, rinsing it, and use the brush to complete cleaning it. I use a Q-Tip to clean the shaving head area of water, including the gasket area where the shaving head is connected. I have had foil shavers in the past and know maintenance and keeping then clean prolongs the life of the blade.</li>
            <li> I had the model with the trimmer for 2 years, and decided the replace it with this newer model in case the blades had gotten dull (although I hadn&#x27;t noticed anything but a small reduction in cutting ability). This newer model has an improved &#x27;smartfoil&#x27; which actually seems to catch hairs slightly better and does a better job getting slightly longer hairs. I use these as my daily razor, I have to shave with a razor about 1-2 times per week to catch neck hairs that this razor misses. I generally have to replace the batteries every 2 months. Overall, for the price, this is an economical razor that is great for daily and or travel use. I feel like you can&#x27;t find an electric razor that truly replaces a blade shave, so why spend $100-300 dollars on a fancy razor?</li>
            <li> I have a Norelco travel shaver that I&#x27;ve had for 19 years.  It finally gave out and I really wanted the same identical one but couldn&#x27;t find a replacement, so I decided on this one.  It&#x27;s bigger, bulkier and doesn&#x27;t shave nearly as close as the one that was 19 years old.  I am now looking to replace this one.</li>
            <li> Inexpensive and better than a $90 razor according to my husband!</li>
            <li> Lots of power, great shaves. Only improvement would be if it was rechargeable. I purchased two of them, solid buy.</li>
            <li> This is what you need for travel, especially internationally.&lt;br /&gt;So today everything is rechargeable, and when I was in Africa, there were places where the power was available 4 or 5 hours a day.  And in China, the power is not always available and if you have a bunch of things to recharge, it is nice to have something that has AA batteries instead. (Especially ones that are universally available).&lt;br /&gt;I need to use the recharger for these things:&lt;br /&gt;Phone (the phone is unusable, but I have apps for the currency exchange rate, translation, keep my travel schedule, etc.)&lt;br /&gt;Tablet - for logging into the internet, and also as a Kindle Reader.&lt;br /&gt;Video camera - has swappable power units so I can recharge one while I use another.&lt;br /&gt;Hearing Aids - remote control.&lt;br /&gt;The phone needs to be recharged virtually every night, and usually one other item too.&lt;br /&gt;It is really nice that this shaver is not one of them.&lt;br /&gt;I have a light beard, and shaving once a day, it does a decent job for me.&lt;br /&gt;I just went on a month long trip to China, and one set of batteries lasted the whole trip.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s the bottom line. It&#x27;s very compact and very sharp, as good or better than some standard razors you use at home in your bathroom. I would say it&#x27;s better than I imagined it would be when I ordered it. It&#x27;s worth having, I would tell the undecided.</li>
            <li> This is the same Braun shaver I purchased several years ago.  It provides a clean close shave and doesn&#x27;t turn your neck into a red bumpy mess.  (I can&#x27;t deal with rotary shavers for this reason.)  I used it daily (work days) for about three years until the foil finally developed a tear / hole and began to grab the hair.  Replacing the whole unit was easier and cheaper than hunting for a foil and blade replacement.  This purchase was a no brainer and I&#x27;m happy to say it&#x27;s the same quality as my original.  It takes two AA batteries that last about a month of daily use.  This is also the perfect travel shaver.</li>
            <li> Goes anywhere.  Takes a bit longer to shave with than a $200.00 or $300.00 shaver, but what the hey, it cost 20 bucks and runs terrific on rechargeables.  I have two of these little beauties -- Braun, German, well-made.  What more can I say.</li>
            <li> great! better than i expected.</li>
            <li> Overall a good shaver. For the price a great deal., Portable and great to travel with. I take it everywhere</li>
            <li> Given that it&#x27;s a portable shaver and not one for regular home use, I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s pretty good.  A reasonable shave on my moderate facial growth.  I like the cover - it&#x27;s clever, though it doesn&#x27;t keep shavings out of my toilet kit.  But no real complaints.</li>
            <li> For around $20, I bought this at a PX in Afghanistan. The FOB that we frequented was always out of water, so my razor/cream was out of the question. I have now turned it into an everyday shaver. I charge the two double a batteries every Sunday, and they last for the whole week. It does pretty well for the most part. It doesn&#x27;t get along with my jaw line just below my left ear. That takes some work to get trimmed even after months of use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you miss a day, you will be better off getting out the manual razor and cream. Trying to use the M60B is almost a chore at that point. But for the price, you CANNOT complain about the razor. Switching from the Pro glide to this has saved me over the $100 that a nice Braun is going to cost me.</li>
            <li> Like always the quality of Braun shavers is ratified with this cheap travel shaver. It provides very acceptable close shaves  for the price.</li>
            <li> Shaves as well or better than units costing three times as much. In fact, I&#x27;ve had shavers that cost much more that did not shave as well. Does not have a sideburn trimmer, but you can work around that. A set of AA batteries lasts a LONG time in it. I have a tough beard, but this little shaver gets the job done very well.</li>
            <li> I needed a small electric razor, I bought this to keep in my car, but am using it almost daily Shaves well, easy clean up, and not CUTS!</li>
            <li> In my opinion, complete garbage.  I tried shaving my face and I got verrrry spotty results.  I returned mine asap and went back to a razor.</li>
            <li> easy on batteries; easy to use; clean shave!  Worth the money and it&#x27;s the second one I have owned; the first one still working too.</li>
            <li> I got this for my husband as a gift 4 months ago and he likes it.  He keeps it in the car and mostly uses it to touch up spots that he realizes he missed in the morning.  He has used it to do a full shave when crunched for time in the morning and says it works well but he prefers to use razor.</li>
            <li> I owned one of the older battery powered Braun shavers and it lasted a surprisingly long time. I damaged the foil and I thought that it would be easier and faster to buy a replacement. This is better by far. I might give up on using a wet razor.</li>
            <li> Braun always puts out a good shaver and this is my 3rd one and it is great for a light one.</li>
            <li> Just as expected - great shaver!</li>
            <li> The screen of this shaver has larger opening then most shaving foils, perhaps that is the reason that instead of cutting the hair it just pulls it out at times. Also,IF THE STUBBLE&#x27;S ARE TOO LONG it does not cut well.</li>
            <li> Returned. Foil was torn and cut my son&#x27;s face the first time he tried it. He&#x27;s 14 so I doubt it was caused by heavy stubble.</li>
            <li> This is the most fabulous awesome thing I have ever bought in my entire life. I have had nothing but happy times with this and I look forward to many many more. The person that sold me this item is probably the nicest person on the face of the earth. If I ever met the cellar in person I would probably hug them and give them a $50 check just for being the person they are. I should continue to pray a wonderful things happen to the person that sold it to me and I hope that they continue to make large amounts of cash and become very wealthy and happy for the rest of their lives.</li>
            <li> I bought six of these --- one for home, one for in the car, four for gifts.  They are very handy and work excellently!</li>
            <li> While I don&#x27;t have heavy growth I can grow quite an impressive full beard. Since getting away from full facial hair I&#x27;ve used a variety of blades, both disposable and not and finally decided to give the ole lectro razor a shot. I&#x27;m impressed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is not my daily shaver. I still use a straight razor or tossaway for the most part, but when I take off for the weekend on the motorcycle this is my ride-a-long shaver. My reasoning for this is I use it dry. I sometimes shave before turning in for the night or if I knock the brush down in the morning I like that it&#x27;s just a clean and easy go.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve had this for several months and have not had to deal with replacing any parts, so I have no idea the pros and cons of that aspect. I do quickly clean mine after each use and find it&#x27;s holding up just fine. After at least two dozen uses I have yet to replace the batteries. It seems to still run strong and do its job well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re looking for a compact portable slick little lectro shaver, this is the way to go. If you have a thick beard this may not be for you, but like the title of this review states, \\&quot;It works for me\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> I have owned two of these, with some differences.  The second (this model) has a psychedelic screen pattern that is less effective than the older style and which has worn out.  The former foil pattern is recommended.  Expect great battery life but not a quick shave.  These are fine for the cottage or on your daily leisurely commute.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;WHY DOES THE REPLACEMENT FOIL COST MORE THAN AN ENTIRE SHAVER?&lt;br /&gt;NOT VERY ECO-FRIENDLY THERE BRAUN!!</li>
            <li> do not expect a $200 shave from a $20 shaver.  this is a good shaver, not a great shaver.  i&#x27;m have light/medium beard.  i&#x27;m a wet shaver, but this is a good shaver to have when you&#x27;re away from the home.  if you get 5 o&#x27;clock shadow by 3 and have a meeting at 4, this will tidy you up a bit for the meeting.  if you&#x27;re going away for the weekend or taking a vacation, this will do.  if i wet shave directly after i shave with this thing, i&#x27;ll still get stubble in the sink.  it does seem to miss hair for whatever reason regardless of length.  it won&#x27;t cut hair greater than 1/8 inch max, but neither do other shavers.  it also irritates the skin below the chin and on the neck.  don&#x27;t press too hard.  i have lathered up and used this shaver, and it does do a better job that way.  this is the shaver to have in your office drawer, glove compartment, or gym bag.  i&#x27;m still using the duracells that came with it.  i&#x27;ll try my eneloops when the duracells die, but i suspect the duracells will give me more power for a better shave.</li>
            <li> Got this for my Hubby&#x27;s birthday.. Knowing he needed a new shaver for the car... He&#x27;s not to thrilled with it.. It doesn&#x27;t get the coarse hair only the real fine, thin whiskers... I will have to get him a better one for Christmas.</li>
            <li> I have previously owned one of these shavers and bought a second one. Quite a difference between the two. The new one is mostly plastic rather than the heavy metal of the old one. Lightweight is good.  What is bad is that unlike my old one, this one lacks a trimmer for sideburns and long neck hairs. The shave itself is generally good so long, as you use a pre shave lotion and youI press fairly hard against your beard  I use mine primarily to clean up after a razor shave.</li>
            <li> BRAUN POCKET SHAVER is the best work for months on two battery, very close shave, you can take it with you on the trip or just anywhere. the best company for men portable shaver.</li>
            <li> I go camping a lot and have found that this is great for shaving my legs. Yes it&#x27;s not the intended use but it works great for it!</li>
            <li> My husband has used this little gadget for several years and ordered a few for Christmas gifts. I&#x27;m hoping the recipients like it as much as he does.</li>
            <li> At school and missed a spot shaving in the morning - out with the pocket shaver and a quick touch up.  Keep the batteries out when not in use for prolonged life and clean it regularly.  Works absolutely fantastically.  Good enough to be my regular shaver.</li>
            <li> Good little shaver for the money. Well made. I use it in conjunction with my rotary shaver. I would recommend it.</li>
            <li> I ordered this for my husband and it is great for when he has to last minute shave. Easier on his skin than razor shaving and it is good for the price.</li>
            <li> Quite good and handy for a foil shaver. With foil shavers you need to shave every day. If hairs get a little long e.g. 2 day&#x27;s growth, it has a hard time getting all the strays. But it&#x27;s a battery shaver as good as any other and one can stay on top of ones beard by keeping it handy.</li>
            <li> It was a great buy.  Although it was not exactly the same as my original, which I grew to love over its lifetime ... the small trimmer unit was missing on this model, it still performs as well as the original.  I am well satisfied with my purchase.</li>
            <li> I keep the battery powered razor in my car, just in case I need a touch-up while I&#x27;m out. If find that is gives a very nice shave. I also like it when I travel on flights because it&#x27;s easier to pack than my Norelco and cord.</li>
            <li> Works in a pinch. Keep one at your desk or glove compartment. I will often rely on this compact shaver if I am running late (all ways) or need a touch up.</li>
            <li> Very well built and designed.....a great travel or back up razor...it has a terrific feel in operation,n ote it takes a bit of time to set your beard to the razor</li>
            <li> With this product I take only 1 minute to dry shave in the morning. It works best at a certain hair length though, but better than the rotating shavers I have used which required foam (if I didn&#x27;t want my skin to roughen up), extensive cleaning, and are generally more expensive.</li>
            <li> How many times have I left my home to discover - as I touched my chin, or just under my nose, that I&#x27;d not really shaved that part of my face. And it bothered the heck out of me! Well this pocket sized, extra powerful (Yeah!) battery powered shaver is THE answer. It gives you a closer shave than you thought possible, and really does give you that, well feel and look of what I can only call a &amp;#34;Perfectly smooth face.&amp;#34; I love it beyond words, and the &amp;#34;Twist Cap&amp;#34; that protects the shaving head is genius. Braun should publicize this far more than they do, and I only knew about by searching on the amazing website. Even more incredible to me, is the fact that I ordered it one day and, hey presto, I got it the next day! Way to go Amazon! It is in my bag, or car, or briefcase, at all times. As that famous ad slogan says about another product, &amp;#34;Don&#x27;t leave your home without (the Braun pocket shaver) it.&amp;#34; You&#x27;ll feel great - for sure!!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve purchased two of these, one almost a decade ago in a PX in somewhere terrible- I still have that one and it still works (keep it in my desk for needful times), and the second one resides in my bug out bag toiletries bag and has seen more Army field time than many Staff NCOs.  This one has been my go-to field shaver for almost 7 years- keep it clean with some water, blow it out, brush off the blades with the toothbrush of your favorite Soldier- Good2Go for another month!  Does a pretty good job, too.  Two AA batteries last a couple months if you shave fast, so you won&#x27;t have to do a drug deal with your mafia supply sergeant very often.&lt;br /&gt;The only reason I am posting this review is because I wanted to know if they were still for sale and I found the darn things on Amazon.  Figured I should let people know how much I like the shaver, maybe you&#x27;ll want one, too.&lt;br /&gt;This thing deserves a medal, two medals, since it lasted two deployments.  I should buy another in case I need to DX one of them or one gets lost, or heaven forbid someone borrows it.</li>
            <li> i had one of these for years looked a bit diffrent this is the newer model was a lil worried at first but for the price i said i will give it a shot i did. got to me super fast and works great</li>
            <li> This works well enough, but consistent with size and price it is very slow going.  It does shave close, but requires numerous passes.  That said, it&#x27;s exactly as expected for a backup shaver.</li>
            <li> Great design and close shave. At less than twenty dollars they are almost disposable. I use it as my daily razor. Batteries last a few weeks. Own two.</li>
            <li> This shaver is much better than the price would have you believe. I bought it strictly for travel, but find myself using it when in a hurry or just too lazy to lather up. I have a medium to heavy beard and it has no problem coping. I&#x27;ve only had it for a month or so, but so far it works flawlessly.&lt;br /&gt;I wouldn&#x27;t  hesitate to recommend it.</li>
            <li> When I first got this product, I looooooved it. It is portable, cute and shaves very clean. I am Asian and I don&#x27;t need to shave that often, this shaver worked for about 2 months and then the foil gets rough on my face. I get razor bumps everytime I  use this shaver, It never happened to me when I use a manual razor. Few zits will pop up the day after using this shaver. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I have heavy, thick, fast-growing facial hair, with very sensitive skin.  I&#x27;ve tried many shavers in the past, and by far this works best for me -- I&#x27;ve been using it for numerous years as my only shaver, at home and elsewhere.  I&#x27;m buying a second one because it&#x27;s good to have a few of them, so if it&#x27;s lost or stolen you can still shave.  (Amazing low price makes this totally feasible.)  It&#x27;s amazing how long this runs on the 2 AA batteries (especially lithium), and it&#x27;s my experience that it always works effectively.  It&#x27;s well-made and last for many years.  Like all electric shavers, the eventual end comes with the foil wearing out and developing holes --- but now apparently replacement foils are available.  That&#x27;s great, because even though the foil apparently costs more than replacing the whole shaver, it&#x27;s environmentally better to replace only the part.  If you&#x27;re traveling internationally, don&#x27;t worry about any electric outlet-plug adaptor --- there&#x27;s no cord at all.  When traveling I sometimes carry spare AA batteries, but they are very easy to find in all countries.</li>
            <li> I use this once a day to keep my beard under control between blade shaves. I have no idea how long this unit will last but I would buy another in a heart beat.</li>
            <li> used the shaver for a solid week on a camping trip. Worked great, and i love the guard that snaps in to place to protect the blades. for the price, this thing works amazing. Highly recommended</li>
            <li> i liked the protective cap but shave is not as close as the Sanyo( that was supposed to be a &amp;#34;backup&amp;#34; if Airline lost my main suitcase ! )</li>
            <li> This is my third razor.  The folil alone costs almost as much as the entire razor.  there was nothing wrong with my other two razors.  It just did not make sense to but the folil only when the cost of the entire unit was almost exactly the same</li>
            <li> This shaver is really good for when it comes to doing bald taper fades, or cleaning on the neck where the neck taper is at. I don&#x27;t reccomend it for shaving the whole head when doing a bald fade, but can be well used for taper fade on the side of the head. It gets pretty close. I used it today on my brother,  and it worked very well, only thing is that the shaver is AA battery operated, but you can&#x27;t go wrong with this shaver. I was amazed</li>
            <li> Had one previously and liked it. Till I got a hole in the screen. I was cheaper to buy a  new one</li>
            <li> It half shaves your face if you have any discernible facial hair - dish out more money for a better product.</li>
            <li> FAST SHIPPING AND THE SHAVER WORKS GREAT.  THIS IS MY SECOND ONE OF THE SAME ITEM (I DROPPED AND BROKE THE SHAVING FOIL ON THE OTHER ONE AFTER SEVERAL YEARS OF GREAT SERVICE.  I COULD NOT PURCHASE THE REPLACEMENT FOIL FROM THE MANUFACTURER CHEAPER THAN I PURCHASED THE ENTIRE UNIT FROM YOU.</li>
            <li> If your grandmother has a little stubble...maybe it would be OK.&lt;br /&gt;Form factor, batteries, cover...all good.  Screen comes up short.  I buy a razor to shave myself; anything is superfluous.</li>
            <li> My husband used this while he was deployed and it was the best thing I could have sent him over there. It is so small that it can be kept almost anywhere. It lasted for most of his deployment before it gave out but they are not at all expensive and easily replaced. When he was not deployed it lasted for a lot longer before he needed a new one.</li>
            <li> This little shaver has turned into my everyday shaver, it cuts close and clean and the battery life is tremendous. No problems with longer hair because I shave every day.</li>
            <li> After a 14 hr. flight I no longer looked like my passport photo.  This little shaver fixed that.  It is well built and does a decent job of getting rid of the whiskers.  Not for everyday use probably but perfect for post-flight clean up.</li>
            <li> This is satisfactory in every way but not as good as a more expensive razor. It is really for shaving for casual events and not for formal or business meetings.</li>
            <li> I use this shaver all days, no problem at all ! Very good ! Thanks</li>
            <li> Compared to the 7 series this is not bad at all, the only downside being that you have to manually clean it somewhat frequently, and it eats through the little batteries like they&#x27;re candy. Otherwise, this bad boy is amazingly close and the foil design is such that it allows you to apply pressure in just the right ways while shaving.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly Recommended.</li>
            <li> Excellent shaver ! Great price ! Does a perfect job ! Very Satisfied,Highly Recommend ! Takes 2 AA batt. Made well,easy to clean !</li>
            <li> This is a great value. I didn&#x27;t expect a very close shave.  I certainly didn&#x27;t expect a closer shave than I get with a razor. However, I&#x27;ve found that this actually shaves closer! I use it in tandem with a razor. I use it in the car on the way to work. It does a good job of cutting what the razor misses and of lunchtime and evening touch ups. I would highly recommend this to anyone. I&#x27;m considering purchasing one for the office and our other vehicle!</li>
            <li> My husband loves this shaver for its convenience.  I just wish they sold replaceable blades.  Otherwise this works great! He keeps one in his desk drawer at work and one in his glove box in the car!!</li>
            <li> Wonderfull, its my second one. The first one I bought in Victoria, AU and lasted for 8 years. If only the microfilm did not break, I still could be using it. Its cheaper to buy a new unit, then buy the micro film.</li>
            <li> Bought this to replace a Braun portable that I&#x27;ve used for many years...this gives a good shave...great for trips and a quick touch up later in the day.</li>
            <li> This shaver is no good enough, I should invested a little more $10 or $20 more and get something decent. I don&#x27;t recommend it.</li>
            <li> Use it daily. Had one for years, finally had to get another. Low price, high performance. Highly recommend. Works better than bigger norelco.</li>
            <li> I bought it and tossed it in my glove compartment for those days when Murphy&#x27;s Law is really attacking you. You&#x27;re running horribly late, it&#x27;s an important meeting, but you look like you spent the last month sleeping in a dumpster. It&#x27;s not just good for a &amp;#34;dumpster face&amp;#34; but is a quick cure for &amp;#34;stubble trouble.&amp;#34; You know, when you believe you shaved immaculately only to discover in the midst of the morning rush hour an annoying stubble that had eluded you. You can go distractingly mad, poking it, licking it or attempting to tear out the offending follicle by its roots only to plow into the back of a police cruiser. Have no fear baby Braun ist hier. Just a quick buzz and perfection is at hand. Seriously I use it almost every day and it is excellent for traveling.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used the Braun MobileShave M-60 for two years now, and I&#x27;m ordering my first replacement!  This shaver is a workhorse in my experience.  I use it for 20-30 minutes/day, and it&#x27;s held up for two years with just one (included) surface-foil change!  The battery life is 4-5x longer than in other battery-powered electric razors I&#x27;ve used. The foil and head last very long with just the simple maintenance of brushing the head off with the included brush--about 90 seconds once or twice a week.  The cleaning brush is housed firmly at the bottom of the unit, and the flip-up travel/storage/protective cap is attached and locks solidly over the top of the unit, protecting it with no additional bulk or extra parts.  The low cost of this shaver does not reflect its quality--I&#x27;d happily buy it at 3x the price!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This razor is not designed for women, and it won&#x27;t work anywhere beyond the &#x27;light stubble&#x27; phase; but if you&#x27;re the type who prefers preemptive daily (or every other day) maintenance, this is more than up to the job!  I&#x27;ll run it over my legs daily while I watch the news or read, and it keeps my legs in public-presentation condition at all times.  It doesn&#x27;t shave as close as a multi-bladed manual razor and shave lotion, but my skin is definitely still in &#x27;touchable&#x27; shape.  Running the flexible foil against my hair-growth pattern with light or gentle pressure keeps me ready-for-summer all year long!</li>
            <li> Excellent dry shave using light pressure. Attached brush easy to remove to clean cutter, saw no need to wash, Easy to hold and use.</li>
            <li> My Ex boyfriend is the person I am always buying this product for and his comments are - &amp;#34;Good product, however the screen goes bad in 10 to 12 months and I am unable to get a replacement&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> Received the item, and tried the same night, good product, well.. it&#x27;s an upgrade from razor blade from electric, so it&#x27;s much better. Easy to clean, very easy to use</li>
            <li> Better than some more expensive electric shavers, cheaper than cartridge razors.  One complaint, the replacement heads and foils are just too expensive; it is cheaper to buy a whole new shaver.  Go figure.</li>
            <li> Very nice shaver at a reasonable price , works very well and I particularly like the fact that you con replace batts. when worn ,unlike  rechargeables shavers.</li>
            <li> compact, nice flip cover, and close shave. excellent travel piece.</li>
            <li> I was hoping to keep this in my desk at work for days where I didn&#x27;t think I needed to look nice that end up being days that I do. I was encouraged when I started shaving with it for the first time. It took several passes, but was pretty effective on the mustache and chin area. Not so much on the neck and side of the face. Seemed like no matter how many times I went over those areas I couldn&#x27;t get it to look shaven. Oh well. Wasn&#x27;t a huge waste of money. I don&#x27;t have particularly thick facial hair, but perhaps others will have better luck.</li>
            <li> For its purpose, as a portable travel shaver, the shaver does a good job and I would recommend it.</li>
            <li> This is my second or third Braun travel shaver, that should say something right there. I don&#x27;t like to spend very much for a travel shaver and I like to keep one in my car, just in case. They have all worked well. I still have my old one, but I figured its would be nice to have another. A great purchase.</li>
            <li> Wouldn&#x27;t shave worth a darn! Left plenty of stubble. But, then I guess you get what you pay for. Glad mine was a free sample. Must have set the company back 2-3 dollars cost.</li>
            <li> The shaver worked real good. I had an older one for a long time. that&#x27;s why I ordered another Braun</li>
            <li> works as well as any electric razor. It shaves without nicks and cuts which is my reason for using electric instead of blade.</li>
            <li> Satisfied with the product, i owned another model and hope this one is like the other one or maybe greater !</li>
            <li> Perfect to keep in the car for when you forget to shave or want a touch-up. It fits in a small space, isn&#x27;t easily damaged and gives a suprisingly good shave</li>
            <li> I bought 2 as a Christmas gift my father try to shave and it did not do well : (</li>
            <li> After my prior Braun shaver gave up the ghost, (after probably 15 years)&lt;br /&gt;I was getting by with a safety razor, but since I have a beard, I only really&lt;br /&gt;need to shave my cheeks and neck each day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sooooo I saw this low-priced item and thought was the perfect solution.  I love the design and the weight and&lt;br /&gt;the ergonomics.  I even love the use of common AA batts instead of rechargeables, but...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;...I find it not quite able to get the job done.  Maybe this is because I used a real razor for a couple of months&lt;br /&gt;and now I&#x27;m spoiled, but I wish it would shave closer and nab those longish hairs.  It doesn&#x27;t.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Trust me, this is a really good travel razor and I think it&#x27;s well built and such -- but I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s a replacement&lt;br /&gt;for a higher-end, more powerful razor.  And I&#x27;m not blaming Braun.  It isn&#x27;t advertised as such....</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this for a few months now.  No problems.  I was replacing one that I&#x27;ve had for over 5 years.</li>
            <li> These work great in a pinch! I bought one for each of my sons and they keep them ion their car.</li>
            <li> Good shaver,  I use it for travel and because I don&#x27;t have to carry the AC cord around, it is very convenient.  The only thing I wish if it has side trimmber like its old models do.</li>
            <li> I got both this unit and the Panasonic ES3831K at the same time.  They both use 2xAA batteries and have no cord connection.&lt;br /&gt;From just turning on, this shaver sounds much weaker than the Panasonic (I made sure to use fresh Duracell batteries), and it took much longer (10 passes) to shave than the Panasonic (4 passes).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, the battery compartment doesn&#x27;t seem to make good contact, as certain time the unit did not turn on and I have to shake it to get the battery engaged.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I returned the unit.</li>
            <li> My husband loves this when we are traveling.  He can shave at the last minute in our car.  It is easy to clean and handle.</li>
            <li> As they say, you get what you pay for. This was a gift for my stepson (he&#x27;s 20).. it is very small and just had a cheap appearance. He didn&#x27;t seem thrilled either. Not a huge deal b/c it was a stocking stuffer and it was after all - cheap! Maybe good for a camping trip??? in desperate times...</li>
            <li> My husband thinks it&#x27;s great. He gets a close shave.</li>
            <li> Battery life is good, the product shaves only moderately well.  This electronic shaver fits into tight spaces in one&#x27;s luggage.</li>
            <li> This little shaver works about as well as those costing $70 or more. Works in the shower, wet or dry. Definitely a good buy.</li>
            <li> This cannot shave even close to a twenty year old, three head electric, and no where near as good as a blade, but in a pinch, while traveling, it can get you by.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Basically it is worth the price, not a dollar more.&lt;br /&gt;Battery life is great, and it never irritates the skin, but it leaves quite a few hairs no matter how long they are and no matter how many times you go over them.</li>
            <li> A cute little razor that fits in your pocket and does a good job if you need a quick shave.</li>
            <li> Background:&lt;br /&gt;I bought this along with Panasonic ES-LT41-K Men&#x27;s 3-Blade (Arc 3) Wet/Dry Rechargeable Electric Shaver with Nanotech Blades, Black/Silver so I don&#x27;t have strong comparison.  In the beginning I liked the BRAUN POCKET SHAVER,2xAA,CAP - WASHABLE, M60B  little more because I felt it was cutting the hair much more closer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After 5 months of on and off use along with the Panasonic ES-LT41-K, I began to use lot less.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Positive:&lt;br /&gt;+  small &amp; compact --&amp;#62;  great for travel use&lt;br /&gt;+  uses 2 AA battery, easy to replace.&lt;br /&gt;+  gives very close shave&lt;br /&gt;+  water proof&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Negative:&lt;br /&gt;-  because it uses 2 AA, power isn&#x27;t so great but it didn&#x27;t bother me too much&lt;br /&gt;-  perhaps shaves little too close&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Experience:&lt;br /&gt;In the beginning I liked the feeling of shaving very closely, but later I did not like so much because I have sensitive skin.  Even after decent use it appears that I am getting &amp;#34;burns&amp;#34; with this razor, or that I am cutting too short than I should.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve use it in dry and wet condition.  It works just fine in dry shave, although takes little longer and not as neat &amp; clean.  I shaved in shower with it and had no problem with water proof.  Wet shave (also used shaving gel) gave much more clean shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Conclusion:&lt;br /&gt;Never the less it doesn&#x27;t come close to the great feeling I got as using the Panasonic ES-LT41-K.  However, this is unfair comparison because Braun M60B is intended as travel shaver.  And as a travel shaver, it performs its function as intended and I have no complaints.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just don&#x27;t expect shaving experience from more expensive and high performing shaver or razor.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my son- his first shaver.  He says it works well and he&#x27;s happy with it.  Works well and lost cost, what more can you ask for?</li>
            <li> Warning:Not course nappy beard friendly;will cause individual to bump up because of how close the shave will be!!&lt;br /&gt;  &amp;#34;Still a GREAT shaver in it&#x27;s class&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> Works much better than i thought it would</li>
            <li> nice shaver, don&#x27;t wash anything electrical</li>
            <li> I am pleases with the product any the service.</li>
            <li> Great Price. Lasted Long Time...</li>
            <li> Washable, hardy, durable and easy to carry around.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The batteries do last quite long on these as well...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Use it almost daily and it goes on for more than a month!</li>
            <li> My husband loves it for traveling.</li>
            <li> Fantastic product! Greatest thing since sliced bread! I have one in front of the mirror in the bathroom, one in the suitcase and have bought 2 more as gifts. I highly recommend this shaver. Thank you Braun and Amazon.</li>
            <li> A shaver is supposed to shave and one would expect that when ordering a shaving product. I have very thin, fine leg hair.... even after running this pocket shaver over a small area multiple times (like over fifty back-and-forth movements) the stubble was still there. I was VERY disappointed in this, especially since Braun is a good brand (normally) name. So, after testing it in multiple places on both legs to make sure (yes, I even tried cleaning it out which made zero difference) I decided to return it. I wanted so badly for it to work but I went back to razor blade shaving like I&#x27;ve done for 60+ years.</li>
            <li> Based on the glowing reviews for this handy little guy, I thought it would be perfect for my purposes - touch-ups between shower razor shaving (usually don&#x27;t do everything every day). Sadly, it did not work anywhere near as well as the Remington shaver I had a decade ago. Worked poorly on underarms, and might as well have had the cap on for my legs. I tried cleaning it, changing the batteries, different techniques... nothing seemed to get it to perform as well as everyone else has said.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m willing to believe that perhaps I got a dud, so to speak. Nevertheless, for an item this inexpensive, the return process would be too time-consuming.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line: it didn&#x27;t work, and wasn&#x27;t useful. Two stars instead of one because perhaps the item I received was defective somehow, and intact models work fine? Oh well.</li>
            <li> This is a very cooly designed little shaver. I got it for my 15-year-old, and it&#x27;s perfect for his burgeoning mustache. Not sure how good it would be for a full beard; I get the feeling from other reviews that it might not be up to the job. And we&#x27;ll see how long it will last. So far, he loves it.</li>
            <li> This little gem has been in my office drawer for almost two years now and has not failed me yet.  There is no better insurance policy for oversleeping and rushing to work without shaving.  Cleans easy, dependable, great design.  Well worth the price.</li>
            <li> I bought the Braun Pocket Shaver (M60B) after reading some reviews on Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was a little reluctant because the price was so much less than I thought it would be.&lt;br /&gt;I decided to take the chance as the risk was not great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Shaver arrived and it was complete with a set of batteries.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried it out and was very impressed with the close shave I got with it and how quickly it does the job.&lt;br /&gt;(I have been shaving with a blade because I have not had good shave recently with an electric razor.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It appears to be built to last for quite awhile,  possibly years if taken care of properly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Buy it,  you will be impressed.</li>
            <li> I was very surprised at how well this thing works given its very low price.  Instead of using the provided alkaline batteries, I installed a pair of recently charged 2300mAh NiMh rechargeable batteries.  Using it every day, those batteries lasted for well over a month without requiring a recharge - and these were not quicky shaves.  It can shave very close, and it glides easily over my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For more detailed evaluation, let me compare to a Panasonic 3 head rechargeable shaver I have.  Actually, its the 3rd such I have had over many years.  The failure mode has always been in battery performance.  Servicing the built in batteries is not economically feasible, since replacing the whole unit also buys you new heads.  Even my most recent is down to 2 shaves per charge, so I was pondering a replacement when I ran across this extraordinarily inexpensive Braun.  The very low price was surprising since Braun has a good reputation.  The fact that the Braun&#x27;s batteries were user-replaceable was a strong selling point for me.  Nevertheless, at the low price I was not expecting much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Braun shaves closer than my Panasonic, and it glides more smoothly over my skin.  The Braun is not nearly as loud, which is relevant since I normally shave while watching TV.  Battery life is very good and replacing them is easy.  Because its head is smaller, it takes somewhat longer to shave with the Braun; but I really don&#x27;t care about that, since I am watching TV at the same time anyway.  There is one significant con:  There are non-whisker hairs (softer, lying close to the skin) in a couple areas near my beard which I also wish to shave.  Unfortunately, these hairs never seem to poke through the Braun&#x27;s foil, no matter how I maneuver it.  Every 4 or 5 days, I have to resort to another means (the Panasonic or a blade) to get those hairs.  The Panasonic has no problem with the soft hairs, since one of its 3 heads is a slotted head.  (Norelco heads are also slotted and will also get these hairs.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Although these devices claim to be washable, I would not recommend washing.  It is nice to know that the works are well sealed, but wetting it still seem like asking for trouble.  For decades, I  have used talcum powder as a lubricant for shaving.  The drier the skin and whiskers the better.  (IMO, the idea of wet shaving with an electric shaver is very counterproductive, since, unlike the situation with a conventional blade, softening the beard does not make cutting it any easier for an electric shaver mechanism (which has more of a scissor like action).  Indeed, softening the beard just decreases the probability that any given hair will get to where a blade can hit it.)  Talcum powder that collects inside is easily knocked loose and/or blown from the internal blade parts and skin oils and bits go with it.  Once a week or so, it is good to use the brush for any buildup that might occur (e.g., between the blades of the shaving block).  This approach requires very minimal maintenance and does not lead to any problems that I have ever experienced.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If I were still dating, I would keep one of these in my car for last minute touch-ups.ill also get these hairs.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Although these devices claim to be washable, I would not recommend washing.

            <li> this is great for travel and runs a long time on a set of batteries. the swivel cover can&#x27;t get lost!</li>
            <li> I have used a rotary for years, but have never been totally satisfied with the closeness of the shave.  This little gem did the trick.  I use it as a quick follow-up to the rotary and have been very pleased with the result.  I have also had to grab it and run on a couple of occasions and use it as my primary.  The shaver was delivered on Dec 18th--it&#x27;s now Jan 17th--and I have used it every day since it arrived. The original batteries are still going strong!</li>
            <li> This shaver is good using it every day. (for 2-3 days grew beard it doesn&#x27;t work)&lt;br /&gt;Foil last ~1-2 years.&lt;br /&gt;This model costs less than change foil and cutters. This is the third I bought.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know what other brands or makes of electric shavers claim to do/are capable of. However, I do know that this brand and this model perform as advertised and I couldn&#x27;t be more pleased.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only comparison I can make is to an actual manual blade razor (usually disposable)- this does not shave as close as a blade, but it&#x27;s close. Traditional shaving methods dictate one should never shave against the natural hair growth, but everybody knows that&#x27;s the only way to get a smooth shave. If one were to shave in the prescribed way with a regular razor (not going against the grain per se) the end result would be the equivalent to the result of a shave with this product- giving the edge (a slightly closer shave) to the Braun.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Combine that with a sub $20 price tag, near effortless cleaning and a wet/dry capability and you have a winning combination. I can not speak to the products durability/endurance over time, yet I can offer an objective observation as to why the product may not work as good as advertised for some: it&#x27;s not the thickness or rapid growth of an individual&#x27;s facial hair, it is the length- shave everyday and the product functions as advertised, wait a day or two and the economy electronic device you just purchased may not perform as well as a much higher priced unit. Simple.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: the foil developed holes after a solid year of nearly daily use. The replacement foils (as noted by other reviewers) cost more than the device. Too bad. Went with another brand. If the foil lasts longer than a year (new brand) then I&#x27;ll keep it. If not, I&#x27;m going back to the Braun.</li>
            <li> They are cheap and give a really close shave.  Closer than my $175.00 Braun razors that I have purchased in the past and was highly disappointed.  These are are great because they work, they are dependable, and they are easy to clean.  I&#x27;m really impressed considering these run on 2 AA size batteries.  I wish they would sell the foil part as an accessory.  I buy these about every two years.  I keep one in my car for those times that I am running behind and one at home.</li>
            <li> Barely adequate is how I would describe the performance of this shaver.  No,it&#x27;s not meant to replace your rechargeable Braun.  However, with that brand name I had much higher expectations.  Weak performance- and I had only a medium growth.  I found it more frustrating than it&#x27;s worth.  I guess I should have expected less from a battery operated razor.</li>
            <li> This shaver is intended to replace my usual wet blade shave during travel.  So far it has worked very well.  Although it does not give as close a shave as what I am used to, it does admirably and takes less time.  I expect it will be especially useful on those overnight flights and train rides.&lt;br /&gt;I like the fact it uses AA batteries; no need to drag around yet another battery charger.&lt;br /&gt;It is a little larger and heavier than I would have liked, but I think the convenience is worth it.</li>
            <li> I do not have a heavy beard by any measure but did not want to spend a half hour trying to get an acceptable shave. Junk. Anyone want to but a Braun pocket shaver REAL cheap?</li>
            <li> A good mobile razor.  Pack includes 2 AA batteries (a plus).  Good design.  A fair price.  It is cheaper to buy a new one of these items rather than replace an parts.</li>
            <li> Best razor for the money anywhere!!  Even if you purchased one a year it is cheaper than replacing the blades or screens on some models...Well done to Braun!!</li>
            <li> purchased this to replace my older Braun portable shaver that gave up after about 10 years! I liked the older one better but for a travel shaver its the best I have tried, battery life is good and it gives a pretty good shave plus being waterproof is a bonus</li>
            <li> I purchased this for my brother who I care for.  He has Down Syndrome and loves the ease of using this for his morning shave.  It also travels well.</li>
            <li> it works very well for a travel razor. it is convenient and I use it very often.</li>
