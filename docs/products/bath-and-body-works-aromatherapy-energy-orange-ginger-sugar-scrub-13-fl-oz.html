            <li>I&#x27;ve been using a bar soap after I use this to kind of get some of the oil off my skin before I get out of the shower.</li>

            <li> Just thought I would give this a try since I like the soap, but not really my &amp;#34;cup of tea&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> The jar is so full of oil it makes it awkward to try and use without dripping oil down your arms.&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;It is greasy and the oil is so heavy it makes the bottom of the tub slippery</li>
            <li> and it was hard to use.</li>
            <li> I gave it four stars because you cannot use it and then shave your legs, because it leaves like a film and it is very hard to shave.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed in this product.  </li>

            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this scrub for 5 years....no other scrub compares. It&#x27;s refreshing and gives you the boost you need in the mornings. I also shave my legs after rinsing it off so I don&#x27;t have to use shaving cream as well.</li>
