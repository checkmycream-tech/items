            <li> This eye shadow palette is great! I bought the other two at the same time and I&#x27;ve only had them for a couple days. So far, I&#x27;m impressed. The colors are really nice for year-round. You could wear this easily to work or school, and day to night. I love that the palette was planned out so well. The colors offered compliment each other and they are wearable. It isn&#x27;t just a random mix of shades that don&#x27;t work together.

            <li> If you don&#x27;t already have the Naked palette invest in this! I love it but don&#x27;t use as often as I should because I love my Naked Palette. The colors are neutral and amazing! When I do use it I&#x27;m reminded how great it is.</li>
