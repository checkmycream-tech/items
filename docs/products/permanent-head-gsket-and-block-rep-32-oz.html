    <ol>
            <li>I used this 6 months ago and my car is running great!</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s still perfect.  </li>
            <li>everything runs great.  </li>
            <li>(Happy ending).</li>
            <li>There is a great deal of preparation you need like cleaning and flushing out your engine; and instead of using this product...</li>
            <li>No water in oil yet was a good sign.</li>
            <li>Then one day I mentioned to him that I had a blown head gasket, He laughed and said &amp;</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m more then happy with this product.</li>
            <li>I am so glad I tried this product!</li>
            <li>#34;For best results, flush your system first with K&amp;W chemical flush.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;But</li>
            <li>You cannot expect your car do do this on its own, and for petes sake, READ THE INSTRUCTIONS AND FOLLOW THEM TO A T.  </li>
            <li>but I am happy that it is working right now and not smoking as it was.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure this is very important.</li>
            <li>sure you use the stuff correctly though.</li>
            <li>I heard it works much better that way.</li>
            <li>In my garage for a couple weeks while I tore the top off the engine and re-do the heads.</li>
            <li>My 2000 grand am GT was leaking coolant</li>
            <li>and I sure could do it myself if I had more muscle and more time, but</li>
            <li>This stuff cost around $24 bucks at the auto parts store and you can get a much better deal here at amazon.&lt;br</li>
            <li>You should be sure to drain and flush you system of anti-freeze and fill with water then add K &amp; W.</li>
            <li>This will definetly make it easier for me to sell or trade in the vehicle and get a better value for my truck.</li>
            <li>My wife drove the &#x27;98 Camaro for about 10 miles after a radiator hose blew and most of the coolant went</li>
            <li>plugged up radiator and blew the top off after two weeks</li>
            <li>It will NOT mix with my anti freeze and sits in the top of the radiator like a bunch of oatmeal and woodchips.  </li>
            <li>The car had been dumping coolant out the exhaust as well as blowing huge clouds of steam once warmed up.  </li>
            <li>IF YOU DONT DO THIS IMPORTANT STEP, it will work just like it did on the guys lexus.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Followed instructions precisely -- and</li>
            <li>it is important to flush and re-flush before putting this stuff in and continuing with the remaining steps.</li>
            <li>But there&#x27;s an important disclaimer.  </li>
            <li>It currently has 352,600 miles on it, and it running great.  </li>
            <li>I just finished having my front suspension replaced the second time, and was happy to  do so.</li>
            <li>I even dumped some cheapo brand oil into the motor and turned the motor over with the drain plug out, to get the system rinsed free of water as well as possible.&lt;br /&gt;Also</li>
            <li>Boy, I sure am glad I used it, because now I&#x27;m driving around and it really beats having to tear the head off my engine.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Success!  </li>
            <li>they are pretty cheap) and filled with Coolant.</li>
            <li>This is truely a mechanic in a bottle..</li>
            <li>a 51 year old Lady, a hands on kind of gal who dont worry about getting my hands greasy.  </li>
            <li>Maybe if you are lucky it will plug your leak (it didn&#x27;t in my case).&lt;br</li>
            <li>But apparently, when you add the sealant to the cooling system, and warm the engine up, as soon as you shut the engine off the pressure in the cooling system injects the sealant into the leak.</li>
            <li>We travel up and down the east coast; I&#x27;ll keep this handy and whenever it may get used; post some better comments.</li>
            <li>Followed directions exactly (except I flushed many more times than directions stated to get all the oil out) and 5 months later still no oil in coolant.</li>
            <li>I tried this out after being told it was the best at the local auto parts store, following directions EXACTLY, and made sure to thoroughly flush out my old antifreeze.  </li>
            <li>After you dump it in your radiator, you must must must run your engine at a fast idle between 1500 and 2000 rpm&#x27;s for about 15 to 20 minutes so the stuff will circulate freely through the cooling system.</li>
            <li>However this product is worth its weight in gold if you know how to read and follow the instructions to the letter.  </li>
            <li>Worth a shot.</li>
            <li>Before use, I always make sure I flush my radiator about ten times to insure its all clean before running it through with K&amp;W.  </li>
            <li>#34;I&#x27;ll be right over.&amp;#34;  </li>
            <li>believe that  your cooling system must be ABSOLUTELY free-flowing, absolutely clean before you put in this stuff.  </li>
            <li>It has a new radiator, which could be important.</li>
            <li>My &#x27;99 Ford Windstar van started blowing white smoke out the exhaust, cracked head are leaking head gasket, but either way cost more to repair than what the van was worth.</li>
            <li>This worked great for me and left only water inside for a week.</li>
            <li>This product seems to excel at repairing this kind of problem.&lt;br /&gt;Seems strange that this could work at first.</li>
            <li>It seemed like it was running better, but when the car heats up, there is still white smoke.  </li>
            <li>got a milk jug cleaned out and poured the ocntents of the nanotechnology into it filling it the rest of the way with HOT TAP WATER, just like the instructions said, REMOVED THE THERMOSTAT,  </li>
            <li>I followed the instructions exactly, and it&#x27;s no longer doing it.</li>
            <li>Yes, I did have issues with engine running hot, but not over heating.</li>
            <li>Followed instructions and it appeared to work but the car continued to run hot.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re car is pumping steam out the back like a freight train like mine was, then dump 2 cans in and top it off with water before holding it at a fast idle.</li>
            <li>They will refund the price of the product, but not pay for the flush out and new anti freeze!!  </li>
            <li>do I really want to do this at 67?</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s much easier and faster to use.</li>
            <li>You will know it&#x27;s working when you hear your cylinders start kicking back in and engine starts running smooth again.</li>
            <li>If you don&#x27;t hold it at a fast idle, it will not work..</li>
            <li>Much to my surprise, all the leaks stopped.</li>
            <li>Thank You so much K &amp; W HEAD for saving my trip to STURGIS 75TH.</li>
            <li>Thanks again</li>
            <li>I have a 1999 Plymouth Voyager minivan, which I really like.  </li>
            <li>He bought a bottle of the blue stuff, the same kind that I had sitting in my car.  </li>
            <li>those same directions SHOULD say,  &amp;#34;IMPORTANT:  Your system must be flushed and clean BEFORE you use our product.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Eventually, the coolant looked pretty clear and he went for a test drive.  </li>
            <li>coolant is steady,</li>
            <li>If you consider putting this product into a really decrepit aluminum radiator 30 years old, that might be a problem.</li>
            <li>He then drove the truck  normally.</li>
            <li>If you live in an area where there&#x27;s high limestone content in your water supply, then you need to fill your radiator with distilled or filtered water  because the limestone tends to bond with the K&amp;W and can stop your heater core from working.</li>
            <li>This stuff will NOT create new seals.</li>
            <li>Replaced thermostat (might as well put in a new one...</li>
            <li>Green anti freeze was no friend to aluminum radiators and heater cores so most old ones are bad.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Next time, I&#x27;ll use K&amp;W first before I change any parts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I knew my 15 year old yukon xl, with 200k, blew a head gasket.</li>
            <li>Maybe my head gasket is too far gone for this type of repair.</li>
            <li>So far after about 1 week and 300 miles</li>
            <li>None of these products is really a &#x27;permanent&#x27; solution like they all claim -- they can only help for a while...</li>
            <li>it developed 110,000 miles ago.</li>
            <li>I have a 30 year old car.  </li>
            <li>12 hours after you drain it Worked so far for me.</li>
            <li>It plugged the radiator but fixed the head gasket.</li>
            <li>and it was fixed.  </li>
            <li>drained my car and refilled it with plain water several times, and drained it again to make sure ALL THE ANTIFREEZE was out of the engine and the block.  </li>
            <li>It had classic head gasket symptoms,  white smoke, overheating.</li>
            <li>We know the car need a major repair</li>
            <li>I believe that it&#x27;s vital to flush your radiator and entire cooling system BEFORE you pour the K&amp;W stuff in.  </li>
            <li>we took the old car engine out and installed a used engine with low miles.</li>
            <li>so we broke out the tester and expected to watch the test fluid turn yellow as with the first time we tested it and again to my amazement the fluid stayed blue which indicates NO blown head gasket.</li>
            <li>my only reservation to giving 5 stars is that the directions were hidden under a back peel-off label like medicine bottles except without an obvious note that it was there, so I applied it according to directions remembered from the reviews on amazon but forgot to mix it first.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s worth the try as I too was skeptical as my car could not go 10 miles without loosing water and running hot until I used this product.</li>

            <li> I think it might last a fairly long time.</li>
            <li> just how long depends on your individual situation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> In fact that was my second engine due to the same cracked cylinder head coolant leak.</li>
            <li> When you drain your motor:  let it drip from the drain plug for a long time, to get all the water you can.  </li>
            <li> My other car is a thunderbird and my dodge shadow is my extra car, my \\&quot;just in case\\&quot; car.  </li>
            <li> Let it dry for 15 hrs.</li>
            <li> I then drained the system and removed the lower radiator hose from the engine and let dry for about 30 hours.  </li>

            <li> Like the other guy said \\&quot;I wouldn&#x27;t believe it if I didn&#x27;t see it</li>
            <li> I bought a bottle of K&amp;W Nano Technolgy INSTANT COOLING SYSTEM STOP LEAK to repair a small leak in my Dodge Pickup.  </li>
            <li> I hope this helps other unsuspecting customers.  </li>
            <li> : I did follow the instructions very carefully.</li>

            <li> visible coolant leaking off the bottom of the engine like a garden hose turned on a little bit.</li>

            <li> Yes, removing the thermostat sucks</li>
            <li> Added to a 2001 Kia Optima which had oil in the coolant overflow tank - I mean a lot of oil.  </li>
            <li> G-R-E-A-T stuff, man,  Seriously</li>
            <li> Of course the engine overheated big time and the gaskets were in bad shape once I got coolant in it again...</li>
            <li> so at least there are no worries about this stuff gumming up the engine or a radiator and making a bad situation worse as people have reported happening with some other products.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Unbelievable!!</li>
            <li> , it even works on a very bad leak situation for a little while -- on an engine with a small-to-medium leak</li>
            <li> Engine was cold.</li>
            <li> I was very skeptical of the product, but</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have anything bad to say about the shipper or K&amp;W.</li>
            <li> Anyway the radiator went bad, replaced it but not before the damage was done, the headgasket had blown through to the water</li>
            <li> let the truck run for a while just to see if it was going to eventually start making the plumes of smoke that I grew to hate..</li>
            <li> and you checked everything, put it in before it get real bad</li>

            <li> I had a 99 Dodge Caravan that I used this stuff on last year.  Afterwards, I noticed a leak from the water pump.  When I changed the water pump, no more leaks.  I just figured that the leak was a resulf of a faulty water pump.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But this year, my 2002 Buick also started to leak radiator fluid.  This time, I changed out both the upper radiator hose and the water pump.  When, I got no results, I finally used the K&amp;W block sealer again.  Success!  The leak stopped instantly.  Next time, I&#x27;ll use K&amp;W first before I change any parts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Make sure you use the stuff correctly though. Before use, I always make sure I flush my radiator about ten times to insure its all clean before running it through with K&amp;W.  Also, instead of following the instructions on the bottle, I actually let the mixture run through my engine for at least 500 miles before replacing it with coolant.  I heard it works much better that way.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been wrenching on cars for 50 years. Built and re-built countless engines. I knew my 15 year old yukon xl, with 200k, blew a head gasket. The cloud of smoke and steam, left in the Church parking lot when I left, was the tell-tail sign. I knew what it meant. In my garage for a couple weeks while I tore the top off the engine and re-do the heads. Sheeeesh. do I really want to do this at 67? With summer approaching, and I still have to get up to the cabin and get the dock in. I heard about this stuff, but at $30 a quart ! There must be something to it.  So I took a chance and tried it. After getting it in the system, and getting it up to temp, I shut it off and went to bed. Next dmorning, I started it up and a medium size cloud of steam came out for about 15 seconds and stopped. I drove it to the store and came home and shut it off. Later in the day, I started it up again. Only a small puff came out for about 5 seconds. Next morning..no cloud at all !!!. It&amp;#34;s been a week now and nothing. Plus my antifreeze level has not dropped at all. I&#x27;m more then happy with this product. If it makes it to this coming fall, I will be elated, to say the least. They now have this product in the round bottle that mixes with the antifreeze and you leave it in. That is the one I used. It&#x27;s much easier and faster to use. This is truely a mechanic in a bottle..</li>
            <li> I tried this product on a 1990 Toyota Corolla.  It seemed like it was running better, but when the car heats up, there is still white smoke.  This product may work on small leaks.  Maybe my head gasket is too far gone for this type of repair.</li>
            <li> The two reviewers that say it didn&#x27;t work in their cars need a bottle of \\&quot;get a clue\\&quot;. Seriously, if your car is leaking  coolant through the exhaust and blowing white smoke as soon as you turn it on, your seals are gone. This stuff will NOT create new seals. My 2000 grand am GT was leaking coolant I believe from the lower intake gasket. So much so (about a bottle a week) that I had resorted to just using plain old water which is bad and will rust out your radiator. Anyway I followed the instructions to the letter. Yes, removing the thermostat sucks but I did it. And I flushed the hell out of it to get all traces of coolant (and rust out) even though I was already only using water. Put the stuff in and idled for about 30 min. Let it dry for 15 hrs. flushed again. Replaced thermostat (might as well put in a new one... they are pretty cheap) and filled with Coolant. 1 week later ...... Still no leaks!!!!! Like the other guy said \\&quot;I wouldn&#x27;t believe it if I didn&#x27;t see it myself.\\&quot; Now I just have to wait and see how permanent the fix is.</li>
            <li> I always use the can that costs around $9.00 and have been using it for about 25 years. After you dump it in your radiator, you must must must run your engine at a fast idle between 1500 and 2000 rpm&#x27;s for about 15 to 20 minutes so the stuff will circulate freely through the cooling system. You will know it&#x27;s working when you hear your cylinders start kicking back in and engine starts running smooth again. If you live in an area where there&#x27;s high limestone content in your water supply, then you need to fill your radiator with distilled or filtered water  because the limestone tends to bond with the K&amp;W and can stop your heater core from working. If you&#x27;re car is pumping steam out the back like a freight train like mine was, then dump 2 cans in and top it off with water before holding it at a fast idle. If you don&#x27;t hold it at a fast idle, it will not work..PERIOD!</li>
            <li> I had a head gasket leak which was causing over-pressurization of my coolant system as well as antifreeze leakage from the engine.  I tried this out after being told it was the best at the local auto parts store, following directions EXACTLY, and made sure to thoroughly flush out my old antifreeze.  So far after about 1 week and 300 miles everything runs great.  I&#x27;ll update if/when the gasket starts causing problems again.</li>
            <li> We know the car need a major repair but this product is helping to extend it for a few months</li>
            <li> I think the leak actually got worse. I&#x27;m not sure if it was just my car but I would not purchase a sealer again. I don&#x27;t have anything bad to say about the shipper or K&amp;W.</li>
            <li> Without being to lengthy in words, I came home from having coffee and noticed my car running like it needed a tune up and in my rear view mirror I had noticed white smoke. Stepping out of the car and looking at the smoke I had observed antifreeze spraying on the ground. I checked my radiator and found it almost empty. I followed the instructions to the letter and my car dumped this product out of the tail pipe too. All I can say is it depends on how big you leaky gasket is. It didn&#x27;t do what all the promises on the back said. If you ever noticed you&#x27;re losing antifreeze somewhere and you checked everything, put it in before it get real bad or it won&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li> This stuff will seal things in your car in this axact order:&lt;br /&gt;1. Passages in your radiator (these are intentional and needed for engine cooling).&lt;br /&gt;2. Heater core (this are so you have heat in your passenger compartment)&lt;br /&gt;3. Draining valve (you can disconnect radiator hose to drain from this point on)&lt;br /&gt;4. Maybe if you are lucky it will plug your leak (it didn&#x27;t in my case).&lt;br /&gt;My recommendation: stay away. you want to drive your jalopy - fix it. This stuff is worthless.&lt;br /&gt;BTW: I did follow the instructions very carefully.</li>
            <li> I used this on my 92 Lexus ES300 with 220,000 miles.  The car had been dumping coolant out the exhaust as well as blowing huge clouds of steam once warmed up.  After draining the cooling system I removed the thermostat and flushed the system.  I then refilled with product and water and ran for about 40 minutes.  I then drained the system and removed the lower radiator hose from the engine and let dry for about 30 hours.  Flushed system again, replaced thermostat, then refilled with coolant and water.  Started car and let run for about 10 minutes with zero improvment - still dumping coolant and blowing steam.</li>
            <li> My &#x27;99 Ford Windstar van started blowing white smoke out the exhaust, cracked head are leaking head gasket, but either way cost more to repair than what the van was worth. A friend told me about this stuff so thought, what the hey, give it a try. I followed the instructions to the letter and it hasn&#x27;t leak a drop since, about 7 months and 2500 miles later. If you think this is a permanent fix I have a bridge to sell you but it has kept my old junker going for quite a while for very little money.</li>
            <li> My Dodge shadow blew a head gasket, I could not afford the money the mechanics stated it would take to fix it and I sure could do it myself if I had more muscle and more time, but Im a 51 year old Lady, a hands on kind of gal who dont worry about getting my hands greasy.  My other car is a thunderbird and my dodge shadow is my extra car, my \\&quot;just in case\\&quot; car.  Anyway the radiator went bad, replaced it but not before the damage was done, the headgasket had blown through to the water jacket.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I drained my car and refilled it with plain water several times, and drained it again to make sure ALL THE ANTIFREEZE was out of the engine and the block.  IF YOU DONT DO THIS IMPORTANT STEP, it will work just like it did on the guys lexus.  It will not work in the presence of anti-freeze.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I got a milk jug cleaned out and poured the ocntents of the nanotechnology into it filling it the rest of the way with HOT TAP WATER, just like the instructions said, REMOVED THE THERMOSTAT,  started the car and poured the contents of the nanotechnology and H2O into the radiator, letting the car idle for around 30 minutes.  It smoked and stunk like poop, but soon it stopped smoking, and the engine settled down and she started purring like a kitten.  This stuff cost around $24 bucks at the auto parts store and you can get a much better deal here at amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You have to realize that whatever caused your headgasket or block to go  to begin with still has to be reckoned with, you cannot fix what your problem caused without fixing the problem that caused it without the same thing happening again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Preventive maintenance, check your thermostat, your radiator to see if it might be clogged, change your oil every few thousand miles, etc.  You cannot expect your car do do this on its own, and for petes sake, READ THE INSTRUCTIONS AND FOLLOW THEM TO A T.  If you have ANY antifreeze in your vehicle this product WILL NOT WORK PERIOD.  However this product is worth its weight in gold if you know how to read and follow the instructions to the letter.  I used this 6 months ago and my car is running great! I would reccommend it to anyone who knows how to read and has a blown head gasket through to the exhaust or through to the water jacket. FIVE STAR RATING*****</li>
            <li> 2K miles and still going, it&#x27;s bee about 3months and I am still driving with no problems. You should be sure to drain and flush you system of anti-freeze and fill with water then add K &amp; W. This worked great for me and left only water inside for a week. I then later drained and added the correct amount of Anti-freeze and water. I am so glad I tried this product! It&#x27;s worth the try as I too was skeptical as my car could not go 10 miles without loosing water and running hot until I used this product. I</li>
            <li> I used this to repair a cracked head on a GSXR-750 which was compressing the cooling system. I followed the instructions exactly, and it&#x27;s no longer doing it. This product seems to excel at repairing this kind of problem.&lt;br /&gt;Seems strange that this could work at first. But apparently, when you add the sealant to the cooling system, and warm the engine up, as soon as you shut the engine off the pressure in the cooling system injects the sealant into the leak.</li>
            <li> Added to a 2001 Kia Optima which had oil in the coolant overflow tank - I mean a lot of oil.  Followed directions exactly (except I flushed many more times than directions stated to get all the oil out) and 5 months later still no oil in coolant. A Miracle in a Bottle.</li>
            <li> I have a 1998 F150 that has a blown head gasket, we tested the exhaust gas in the antifreeze and the test fluid instantly turned yellow. I decided what the heck we will just try some block and gasket repair, what could be the worste that could happen. If it worked to make the truck smoke a lot less than it was or I would still have to replace the head gasket. I received a flyer for the K&amp;W Nanotechnology Block and gasket repairer and decided I was going to try it. I was a little over whelmed by the step by step directions that needed to be done inorder just to see if it was going to work but I decided that if I was going to try it, I was going to follow the directions to the T and not skip a step. I am not going to bore you with every step that I took in following the directions, but to my suprise after the 12 hour wait and the final flush, I started the truck and to my suprise there was no white smoke...let the truck run for a while just to see if it was going to eventually start making the plumes of smoke that I grew to hate.. NO SMOKE!! I was baffled...so we broke out the tester and expected to watch the test fluid turn yellow as with the first time we tested it and again to my amazement the fluid stayed blue which indicates NO blown head gasket. It has been 3 days since we applied the block and gasket repair and I am still not seeing the smoke. I am truly amazed. I am not sure how long it will last but I am happy that it is working right now and not smoking as it was. This will definetly make it easier for me to sell or trade in the vehicle and get a better value for my truck. I dont believe in a mechanic in a bottle, but I am starting to think that there is a slim possibility that this stuff actually does what it says it does.&lt;br /&gt;Lisa</li>
            <li> My wife drove the &#x27;98 Camaro for about 10 miles after a radiator hose blew and most of the coolant went bye-bye. Of course the engine overheated big time and the gaskets were in bad shape once I got coolant in it again... visible coolant leaking off the bottom of the engine like a garden hose turned on a little bit. I knew an engine rebuild was called for but didn&#x27;t have the bucks just then. Intrigued by the &amp;#34;Nanotechnology&amp;#34; claim for this K&amp;W product I thought I had nothing to lose by giving it a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Followed instructions precisely -- and it is important to flush and re-flush before putting this stuff in and continuing with the remaining steps. Much to my surprise, all the leaks stopped. But after about 200 miles of driving in the cool time of the Fall, they started slowly coming back and were soon as bad as ever -- that really didn&#x27;t surprise me because the gasket damage was so bad to begin with. The fact that it worked at all in such a bad case and lasted for a couple hundred miles was actually pretty impressive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, it even works on a very bad leak situation for a little while -- on an engine with a small-to-medium leak I think it might last a fairly long time. None of these products is really a &#x27;permanent&#x27; solution like they all claim -- they can only help for a while... just how long depends on your individual situation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;NOTE: When I did dig into the engine I found absolutely NO gunk or clogged passages from using this product... not even any residue on the old, fried gasket surfaces -- so at least there are no worries about this stuff gumming up the engine or a radiator and making a bad situation worse as people have reported happening with some other products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BOTTOM LINE: Worth a shot.</li>
            <li> Unbelievable!! Only BLOCK SEALER that works!! My 1996 Dodge Camper Van 5.9 eng. (weeks before going to STURGIS 75TH Motorcycle Rally) started blowing white smoke out the exhaust. Instantly I know what that meant. In fact that was my second engine due to the same cracked cylinder head coolant leak. I shut the engine off immediately. I&#x27;m sure this is very important. Not to cause further damage. No water in oil yet was a good sign. One month later: and a hundred or so test miles around town: I loaded up the camper van, hooked on the Harley &amp; trailer, and headed down the highway. Within the first 200 miles I realized the engine was running warmer than usual. But it wasn&#x27;t over heating. It was 1300 miles to Sturgis. 2600 miles total round trip. Yes, I did have issues with engine running hot, but not over heating. However, never the slightest buff of white smoke out the exhaust. No loss of radiator coolant level. I used product per instructions suggested. Half the bottle. Engine was cold. I do believe I should have waited till the thermostat opened before pouring in K &amp; W HEAD sealer. That (MAY?) have caused some radiator cored to seal up too. Thank You so much K &amp; W HEAD for saving my trip to STURGIS 75TH. And about $1300 in repair bills!!! Thanks again</li>
            <li> Followed instructions to the letter but didn&#x27;t work at all on a cracked block. .&lt;br /&gt;Waste of time and effort.</li>
            <li> It worked!  But there&#x27;s an important disclaimer.  I believe that it&#x27;s vital to flush your radiator and entire cooling system BEFORE you pour the K&amp;W stuff in.  Otherwise, this stuff &amp;#60;may&amp;#62; clog your system.  Here&#x27;s what happened to me.  (Happy ending). I have a 1999 Plymouth Voyager minivan, which I really like.  It had a blown head gasket and was leaking green coolant rapidly onto the pavement. I bought a can of the &amp;#60;other&amp;#62; sealant, which is blue in color.  But I procrastinated and didn&#x27;t put in.  I just drove with radiator cap partially closed and added coolant every now and then.  Enter the story of my son-in-law.  At about the same time, the head gasket blew in his 2000 Ford F-150.  He bought a bottle of the blue stuff, the same kind that I had sitting in my car.  It didn&#x27;t work.  He had to drain it all.  Cost him $65 plus a bunch of anti-freeze.  He went to a different auto parts store. they recommended the K&amp;W stuff.  It worked!  Stopped his leak almost instantly.  He then drove the truck  normally. After several days and several thousand miles, the truck overheated again.  He inspected the contents of the cooling system.  There was a ton of the larger particle  stuff floating around in it.  Yet, the leak was plugged and holding!  He reasoned that his system had to be clogged. So he began flushing it with a garden hose; draining, flushing; repeat, repeat.  Eventually, the coolant looked pretty clear and he went for a test drive.  Problem solved!  No overheating, no leak.  He drove it several thousand miles and it&#x27;s still perfect.  Then one day I mentioned to him that I had a blown head gasket, He laughed and said &amp;#34;I&#x27;ll be right over.&amp;#34;  We bought a can of K&amp;W for $25.00.  EVERY SINGLE THING that had happened to his truck happened to my minivan!!!  1.  Installed K&amp;W; 2. Ran car on idle.  3. Leak was plugged in 15 minutes no more leaking.  4. Went for a test drive.  5. Still no leaking but the car overheated. 6.  Thank goodness he knew whatto do.  7.  After about 5 cycles of filling, flushing, and draining, my coolant was clear-looking and the minivan did not overheat.  And the leak was stopped, utterly and completely.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I believe that  your cooling system must be ABSOLUTELY free-flowing, absolutely clean before you put in this stuff.  Otherwise, it might clog up things.  The directions on the bottle of K&amp;W say &amp;#34;For best results, flush your system first with K&amp;W chemical flush.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;But those same directions SHOULD say,  &amp;#34;IMPORTANT:  Your system must be flushed and clean BEFORE you use our product.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line:  I saw this product stop head gasket leaks in 2 different vehicles.  It works.</li>
            <li> I  tried it but it did nothing but lighten my wallet.</li>
            <li> this product did not work, i took out my thermostat flushed out cooling system of antifreeze,went by the instrunshion.but nanotechology did not seal block or repair my head gasket leak..had used it 4 weeks  before  but leak came back</li>
            <li> I have a 1999 Dodge 2500 Diesel pickup.It has been a construction, hunting, fishing, 4 wheeling vehicle all of its life.  It currently has 352,600 miles on it, and it running great.  It also has a 2 inch crack in the block which  it developed 110,000 miles ago. It was leaking enough coolant to cause me serious concern. K &amp; W Nanotechnology was recommended by Carquest, so I tried it. I was told to follow directions explicitly...which  I did. It has worked wonders.  I just finished having my front suspension replaced the second time, and was happy to  do so. I expect to get over 500,000 miles with this  truck...cracked block or not. This was a miracle product for me!!</li>
            <li> [[ASIN:B00BDPYL8I CRC (401224-6-6PK) FiberLock Head Gasket and Block Repair - 32 fl. oz.,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am writing so that anyone thinking about using this gets a balanced feedback.  I was reluctant to use it after reading the reviews.  Boy, I sure am glad I used it, because now I&#x27;m driving around and it really beats having to tear the head off my engine.&lt;br /&gt;  Details:  I have a 30 year old car.  It has a new radiator, which could be important. If you consider putting this product into a really decrepit aluminum radiator 30 years old, that might be a problem. Green anti freeze was no friend to aluminum radiators and heater cores so most old ones are bad.&lt;br /&gt;  Be careful to use the required amount per quart of cooling system volume, do the research to find your car&#x27;s volume.&lt;br /&gt;  Yes, you will have to change your oil because it has water in it. When you drain your motor:  let it drip from the drain plug for a long time, to get all the water you can.  I even dumped some cheapo brand oil into the motor and turned the motor over with the drain plug out, to get the system rinsed free of water as well as possible.&lt;br /&gt;Also, don&#x27;t freak out if you start up and there&#x27;s a little smoke still; it&#x27;s residual moisture in your exhaust system.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My car has gone FROM: White smoke out of the tail pipe, Cappuccino colored oil in the engine, Losing coolant constantly.&lt;br /&gt;TO:  No Smoke from tailpipe,  Oil change and now no frothy foam,  coolant is steady, (I put a mark on the coolant tank to be sure).&lt;br /&gt;Good luck</li>
            <li> Used this in my daughter&#x27;s 2003 Rendevous. It had classic head gasket symptoms,  white smoke, overheating. I was very skeptical of the product, but what the heck. At 25 minutes of idle smoke quit, no coolant blow back through the overflow tank, seems to be holding, no overheating. You MUST follow directions to the letter. Flush, flush, flush. No antifreeze while applying,  no thermostat. It says permanent,  but who knows?  You must also wait for it to dry throughly.  12 hours after you drain it Worked so far for me.</li>
            <li> plugged up radiator and blew the top off after two weeks</li>
            <li> my only reservation to giving 5 stars is that the directions were hidden under a back peel-off label like medicine bottles except without an obvious note that it was there, so I applied it according to directions remembered from the reviews on amazon but forgot to mix it first. It plugged the radiator but fixed the head gasket. overall I came out ahead but I&#x27;d like to seriously bitch about the hidden directions. A used radiator is relatively cheap but that part was unnecessary and a bother which is on the head of whoever designed the label.</li>
            <li> I bought a bottle of K&amp;W Nano Technolgy INSTANT COOLING SYSTEM STOP LEAK to repair a small leak in my Dodge Pickup.  It says it is compatible with all anti freeze.  It will NOT mix with my anti freeze and sits in the top of the radiator like a bunch of oatmeal and woodchips.  I called CRC Industries and the girl on the phone said they have been having a lot of complaints about this product.  I called their tech support line and they said &amp;#34;just flush it out&amp;#34;!!  They will refund the price of the product, but not pay for the flush out and new anti freeze!!  They know  this product is Junk and that it should be taken off the market but they just keep selling a defective product!  I hope this helps other unsuspecting customers.  Amazon doesn&#x27;t even sell this product!!!</li>
            <li> Followed instructions and it appeared to work but the car continued to run hot.</li>
            <li> I blew out the head gasket on my 390 cid V8 Ford. One bottle of the K &amp; W &#x27;block sealer&#x27; and head gasket sealer FOLLOWED all directions.  The next day poof no smoke out the tail pipe.&lt;br /&gt;In a similar situation, my wife, Donna, drove her antique 1954 Chrysler 331Hemi station wagon up the Cajon Pass.  Smoked smoke smoke. Added ONE can of K&amp;W and it was fixed.  G-R-E-A-T stuff, man,  Seriously</li>
            <li> I have not used this product since it was purchased. There is a great deal of preparation you need like cleaning and flushing out your engine; and instead of using this product... we took the old car engine out and installed a used engine with low miles. We travel up and down the east coast; I&#x27;ll keep this handy and whenever it may get used; post some better comments.</li>
