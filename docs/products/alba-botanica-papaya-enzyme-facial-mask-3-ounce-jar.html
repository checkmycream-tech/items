            <li>It is a great mask for great price.</li>
            <li>Not so great.  </li>
            <li>I thought my skin looked great until trying this product.</li>
            <li>Probably could find something just as good in the stores.</li>

            <li>soooo glad I did!  </li>
            <li>I absolutely love it!</li>
            <li>But even if you use a light moisturizer, I don&#x27;t see this being overly drying for you which is great.</li>
            <li>It is so amazing.</li>

            <li>Very mild fragrance</li>
            <li>My face always looks nice and radiant afterwards and my acne always goes away so fast!</li>
            <li>But have to admit that my face feels smooth and moisturized after use.</li>
            <li>This mask makes my skin look fantastic.  </li>
            <li>After my mother noted that I needed to take care of my skin as my daughter wouldn&#x27;t like having an &#x27;older looking mom&#x27; when she grows up (moms, gotta love them!)</li>
            <li>Very useful product, leaves the skin smooth, moisturized and rejuvinated.</li>
            <li>This product has a gel like consistency and doesn&#x27;t dry out your face, It gives a certain glow which makes the delicious smelling mask a must!</li>
            <li>This facial mask is amazing!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m prone to blemishes around my chin and my sporadic acne has lessened significantly since using this.</li>
            <li>This is a super cheap solution to that problem.</li>
            <li>After looking up numerous reviews from another site, I found the review for Alba Botanica Papaya Enzyme Facial Mask and was impressed by the reviews and the price!  </li>
            <li>I have mild acne-prone skin</li>
            <li>It leaves my skin feeling moist and LOOKING smooth -- which, at 70, is really saying something!</li>
            <li>I love Alba&#x27;s natural organic ingredients.  </li>
            <li>It allows me to apply a thin layer which is perfect without wasting product.</li>
            <li>I am getting more of this to have as a stocking stuffer for my adult daughters at Christmas.</li>
            <li>This is a nice facial mask.  </li>
            <li>Try it - it will be worth the money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>; rinses off easily; skin looks good; don&#x27;t need to slather on, a thin layer is just fine.</li>
            <li>&quot; right?  </li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t too sure about it initially.</li>
            <li>first, I thought it did not sting at all</li>
            <li>When I bought this, I was actually looking for a pumpkin enzyme facial mask, because I was impressed recently by the results in a salon with a pumpkin-based mask.  </li>
            <li>Got red for sure, but would recommend it.</li>
            <li>Make sure to wash your face thoroughly and dry with a fresh face towel before applying any mask.</li>
            <li>I had been paying an arm and a leg for a professional strength papaya enzyme mask, so I was so excited to find something over the counter (OTC) at an affordable price.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 22 with pretty oily but combination skin, and I use this as a quick pick me up when i don&#x27;t have time for a full 15 minute mask (this one takes only 5 mins)</li>
            <li>The user reviews for the same product in the single jar were pretty good, but I took the leap of faith by purchasing the 2-pack at a better discount, especially with the 15% off Subscribe-and-Save</li>
            <li>Although this mask (feels more like a gel) does not dry (as indicated on the packaging label), I believe the enzymes are effective in softening up the skin and breaking down the oils, dirt and old skin.</li>
            <li>Really.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t know how much I missed this stuff until I moved and couldn&#x27;t purchase it at Walmart anymore.</li>
            <li>I moisturize very well after using so</li>
            <li>Splurge and treat your whole body</li>
            <li>This does not dry or burn my sensitive skin but leaves it smooth and exfoliated.</li>
            <li>It is strong, so you can only leave it on no more than 5 - 10 minutes depending on your skin, but that also means you can do it super quickly.</li>
            <li>(sounds gross but when you rinse the mask off your face is so fresh).</li>
            <li>After using it the first time, I had forgotten that I did (like an hour later) and when I looked in the mirror</li>
            <li>I also bought a large fan brush, which uses a minimal amount without wasting much and effectively spreads a thin layer across my whole face.</li>
            <li>I really like the small fan shaped brush I bought to smooth it on.</li>
            <li>I generally have a T-zone with my cheeks getting drier as I get older.  </li>
            <li>... when to keep your skin clear.</li>
            <li>It leaves your skin  radiant, hydrated, and clear.</li>
            <li>The duration of the breakout was shorter and the scarring/recovery of the skin much improved than another breakout that had happened just the week before within an inch of the same spot.  </li>
            <li>I was like \\&quot;Wow</li>
            <li>I have oily skin that can be sensitive at times, but this mask did not bother me.  </li>
            <li>And I have a generally favorable opinion of Alba products.  </li>
            <li>Although it is a \\&quot;wet\\&quot; mask, meaning it does not dry after application (as clay masks do), it cleans and reduces pores.  </li>
            <li>I am about half way through the first jar, so the 2 jars may last 6-7 months</li>
            <li>I have combo skin, dry and sensitive, but my forehead and nose tend to get oily.  </li>
    </ol>

            <li> Every time, I follow up it up with a clay mask, such as mud or mint (different brand), which does dry and pull out the dirt and oils from the pores.</li>
            <li> When your skin is breaking out I use it every night for a week, actually I let it dry and sleep in it.</li>
            <li> Stays wet and does not dry out.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for years and even after trying other masks always come back to this.  </li>
            <li> You only need a thin layer applied onto your face (and neck, if you choose) and it does not dry completely.  </li>
            <li> but when I tried it again, my skin did get the expected tingling feeling.</li>
            <li> Would not really bother purchasing this product.  </li>
            <li> My skin turns pink temporarily and when the tingling sensation is gone, I wash it</li>
            <li> I have left it on for up to a few hours because it is so soothing on irritated, problem skin.  </li>
            <li> I would have given it five stars, but I found that it left my face a little dried out.</li>
            <li> It stings a little and never really dries.</li>
            <li> and i notice I get less pimples.</li>
            <li> It isn&#x27;t a peel off mask, but still gives that tight pore feel and look after use.  </li>
            <li> After one use, I could feel my skin was softer, improving the texture of my skin and it seemed to brighten it a little as well.  </li>
            <li> It does burn a little</li>
            <li> I use it everyday</li>
            <li> and I feel like its literally eating my dead skin off</li>
            <li> It seemed to bring a couple of small pimples to the surface which I didn&#x27;t expect.</li>
            <li> Well, papaya at least starts with</li>
            <li> I became obsessed and started to use this product everyday in hopes to getting rid of acne.</li>
            <li> but hey, at least you know it&#x27;s working!</li>
            <li> No matter what expensive products I try out, I always keep this around.</li>
            <li> There was one year where I had very bad acne, worse than I&#x27;ve ever had.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> It stings when you put it on. I wasn&#x27;t too sure about it initially. But have to admit that my face feels smooth and moisturized after use. Leaving it on for 5 minutes is all it takes.</li>
            <li> ... when to keep your skin clear. When your skin is breaking out I use it every night for a week, actually I let it dry and sleep in it. FYI It stings a little and never really dries.</li>
            <li> I had been paying an arm and a leg for a professional strength papaya enzyme mask, so I was so excited to find something over the counter (OTC) at an affordable price. The user reviews for the same product in the single jar were pretty good, but I took the leap of faith by purchasing the 2-pack at a better discount, especially with the 15% off Subscribe-and-Save option.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At first, I thought it did not sting at all but when I tried it again, my skin did get the expected tingling feeling. After 2 months of using it religiously 2 +/-1 times per week, Alba&#x27;s papaya enzyme mask is now part of my daily beauty regimen. I am about half way through the first jar, so the 2 jars may last 6-7 months (I think closer to 6 months, since I love this stuff). I also bought a large fan brush, which uses a minimal amount without wasting much and effectively spreads a thin layer across my whole face. If you use your fingers, then your consumption rate may be faster. Make sure to wash your face thoroughly and dry with a fresh face towel before applying any mask. Although this mask (feels more like a gel) does not dry (as indicated on the packaging label), I believe the enzymes are effective in softening up the skin and breaking down the oils, dirt and old skin. Every time, I follow up it up with a clay mask, such as mud or mint (different brand), which does dry and pull out the dirt and oils from the pores. Of course, a non-greasy moisturizer is a must as well. Bottom line: I love how this product clears up my pores and helps my skin radiate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These jars with fan brushes would make great personalized beauty gift baskets for girly Christmas gifts or stocking stuffers. With that said, I definitely would recommend this product to family and friends!</li>
            <li> No excess tingling here. Mild tingling, non-drying, great smelling gel. It seemed to bring a couple of small pimples to the surface which I didn&#x27;t expect. After just one use, my skin is softer and brighter.</li>
            <li> Fast service, excellent product</li>
            <li> My skin glows after using this product.  Has a wonderful smell.  My skin feels geat afterwards.  Will definitely continue to use. Awsome for the price!</li>
            <li> After my mother noted that I needed to take care of my skin as my daughter wouldn&#x27;t like having an &#x27;older looking mom&#x27; when she grows up (moms, gotta love them!) and after several years of neglecting my facial care, I decided to dive in to help my complexion, suppleness, and overall look.  After looking up numerous reviews from another site, I found the review for Alba Botanica Papaya Enzyme Facial Mask and was impressed by the reviews and the price!  I love Alba&#x27;s natural organic ingredients.  I had just started using a pore cleansing mask and radiance mask when I added this mask into the rotation.  After one use, I could feel my skin was softer, improving the texture of my skin and it seemed to brighten it a little as well.  I had also had one pimple that had formed on my forehead.  The duration of the breakout was shorter and the scarring/recovery of the skin much improved than another breakout that had happened just the week before within an inch of the same spot.  I generally have a T-zone with my cheeks getting drier as I get older.  It seems to work well overall to balance and manage my skin.  You only need a thin layer applied onto your face (and neck, if you choose) and it does not dry completely.  The enzyme will cause a tingling sensation as well.  You can find a mask brush to apply if you desire.  I haven&#x27;t yet and it hasn&#x27;t been a problem.</li>
            <li> This does not dry or burn my sensitive skin but leaves it smooth and exfoliated. I really like the small fan shaped brush I bought to smooth it on. It allows me to apply a thin layer which is perfect without wasting product. I am getting more of this to have as a stocking stuffer for my adult daughters at Christmas.</li>
            <li> When I bought this, I was actually looking for a pumpkin enzyme facial mask, because I was impressed recently by the results in a salon with a pumpkin-based mask.  Well, papaya at least starts with \\&quot;p,\\&quot; right?  And I have a generally favorable opinion of Alba products.  So I decided to give this a try -- soooo glad I did!  Although it is a \\&quot;wet\\&quot; mask, meaning it does not dry after application (as clay masks do), it cleans and reduces pores.  It&#x27;s also fast-acting, having the desired effect in 5 minutes.  It leaves my skin feeling moist and LOOKING smooth -- which, at 70, is really saying something!</li>
            <li> Very useful product, leaves the skin smooth, moisturized and rejuvinated. Never had any rash or irritation after using this product. The price is good and delivered very quickly.</li>
            <li> Nice peel. My face was glowing after I used it. Got red for sure, but would recommend it.</li>
            <li> I used this product before  it makes your face feel so clean I love it just wish I could buy it in the store.</li>
            <li> It is a great mask for great price. I use it everyday and I can definitely see a difference in my skin</li>
            <li> This is the most amazing beauty product. This is the BEST face mask I have ever used. I used to  use gritty scrubs to exfoliate but this mask leaves my skin smoother than anything! It tingles on your face and I feel like its literally eating my dead skin off (sounds gross but when you rinse the mask off your face is so fresh). I&#x27;m prone to blemishes around my chin and my sporadic acne has lessened significantly since using this. I&#x27;ve never raved about a facial product before but I&#x27;m so glad I found this. Bonus: its all vegetarian, no animal ingredients/testing. Alba is awesome!</li>
            <li> Not so great.  Soothing, but no big deal.  Would not really bother purchasing this product.  Probably could find something just as good in the stores.</li>
            <li> great mask! I&#x27;m 22 with pretty oily but combination skin, and I use this as a quick pick me up when i don&#x27;t have time for a full 15 minute mask (this one takes only 5 mins)</li>
            <li> Papaya enzymes are the best natural skin peel. For those of us who don&#x27;t have the time or energy to mix actual papayas to make a mask, this is a great option! I did a lot of research before I bought this mask. I&#x27;ve been on a look out for affordable papaya enzyme masks and decided to try this. I use it about once a week and use a clay mask about once a week. This product has a gel like consistency and doesn&#x27;t dry out your face, It gives a certain glow which makes the delicious smelling mask a must!</li>
            <li> Really. I can&#x27;t. No matter what expensive products I try out, I always keep this around. I am so glad I discovered this product. I used to use this department store brand enzyme peel (also organic) but it was $50 for 2oz of product. After I found Alba&#x27;s Enzyme Peel, I never looked back. I have mild acne-prone skin and I often get pigmentation afterwards. This product \\&quot;peels\\&quot; away the upper layer of skin and forces my skin to heal a lot faster. As a result, my skin is more even-toned and smoother. I use it about once or twice a week depending on how my skin&#x27;s condition is. I never go a week without it. You can tell if the product is working because you&#x27;ll get a tingly sensation. My skin turns pink temporarily and when the tingling sensation is gone, I wash it off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, I do NOT recommend using this product too often. It tends to lose its effectiveness, I noticed. There was one year where I had very bad acne, worse than I&#x27;ve ever had. I became obsessed and started to use this product everyday in hopes to getting rid of acne. While the product helped get rid of some redness from the acne, the source of my acne problem was deeper and I ended up just desensitizing my skin from the Enzyme Peel. (I had my wisdom teeth pulled out soon after and the antibiotics actually helped get rid of my acne, thankfully) Anyway, after giving my skin a break, I came back to the Alba Enzyme Peel and I continue to use it weekly as I did. I appears that if I just let my skin rest a bit, the effectiveness of the enzyme peel comes back.</li>
            <li> I actually didn&#x27;t buy this off amazon but I had to give it a rating. This facial mask is amazing! My face always looks nice and radiant afterwards and my acne always goes away so fast! It does burn a little but hey, at least you know it&#x27;s working!</li>
            <li> Love this product.  I&#x27;ve been using this for years and even after trying other masks always come back to this.  I have combo skin, dry and sensitive, but my forehead and nose tend to get oily.  This mask makes my skin look fantastic.  It isn&#x27;t a peel off mask, but still gives that tight pore feel and look after use.  I use 3-4 times week.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t know how much I missed this stuff until I moved and couldn&#x27;t purchase it at Walmart anymore. Was without for a month and noticed a difference in my skin. While using this, my face is VERY smooth, refined looking and i notice I get less pimples. I also notice post acne marks go away a tad bit faster using this 2-3 times a week. I moisturize very well after using so I don&#x27;t find that it dries me out. But even if you use a light moisturizer, I don&#x27;t see this being overly drying for you which is great. Will keep purchasing on Amazon, won&#x27;t let it run out on me again!</li>
            <li> Smells good, skin feels refreshed for a day or so.  Gentle.&lt;br /&gt;Easy to pretend you are on a tropical beach and paid a lot more for the pampering.&lt;br /&gt;Save on airfare!  Splurge and treat your whole body</li>
            <li> This is a nice facial mask.  I would have given it five stars, but I found that it left my face a little dried out.</li>
            <li> You will love this product.  It leaves your skin  radiant, hydrated, and clear. It is so amazing. I thought my skin looked great until trying this product. After using it the first time, I had forgotten that I did (like an hour later) and when I looked in the mirror I was like \\&quot;Wow, I love the way my skin looks\\&quot;.  I had forgotten for a moment there that I had just used it. You should try it. It won&#x27;t disappoint. I absolutely love it!</li>
            <li> I get Papaya Enzyme facials at a local salon, but can&#x27;t always find the time or money to go as often as I&#x27;d like. This is a super cheap solution to that problem. It is strong, so you can only leave it on no more than 5 - 10 minutes depending on your skin, but that also means you can do it super quickly. Try it - it will be worth the money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you care about my ritual...&lt;br /&gt;I use Mary Kay microderm, then this, then apply a deep moisturizing mask. Stay out of the sun for a day or 2 after you do this though.</li>
            <li> Product smells nice and is easy to use.  Stays wet and does not dry out.  I have oily skin that can be sensitive at times, but this mask did not bother me.  Seems to help with pore tightening.  I have left it on for up to a few hours because it is so soothing on irritated, problem skin.  Will continue to use and maybe up the frequency per week.  Note:  Product can also be found at your local grocery store.  Have seen it on the shelf at Giant Stores and Wegman&#x27;s, but you get the 2-pack bundle pricing through Amazon.</li>
            <li> Very mild fragrance; rinses off easily; skin looks good; don&#x27;t need to slather on, a thin layer is just fine.</li>
