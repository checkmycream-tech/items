            <li>This is okay, but it will not help wrinkles !!!</li>
            <li>A very good product.  </li>
            <li>I tried some of hers and loved it!</li>
            <li>Great for the dog&#x27;s skin problem too</li>
            <li>I truly loved the Avalon Organics CoQ10 Repair Wrinkle Defense Night Creme[[ASIN:</li>
            <li>but that seems to dissipate fairly quickly.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li>I am happy with the results and liking my appearance more and more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>She is 53, a physician, and looks amazing.</li>
            <li>I liked the feel of this product on my skin.</li>
            <li>It is a really nice cream and has a nice fragrant too.  </li>
            <li>Nice smell, great texture, and a fantastic moisturizer.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s ok wish it had a better aroma!</li>
            <li>/&gt;Since COQ10 occurs naturally in our bodies, it is the best thing to use for restoring/replacing  what the body tends to lose with age.</li>
            <li>Light weight and feel good after putting on.</li>
            <li>I love this Derma Q-Gel10.  </li>
            <li>but when I put makeup on top of it, the makeup gets stuck in that spot.  </li>
            <li>Use it as a night cream instead and you will be satisfied as I am.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>Recommended for maintaining healthy glow.  </li>
            <li>FIND THIS Q-GEL EASY TO USE, AND FEELS SO SOOTHING ON THE SKIN...</li>
            <li>goes on easy  </li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t do anything for fine lines or wrinkles you may have, but I think it probably does help in the prevention category.  </li>
            <li>If you want to get rid of fine lines, use a product with Retinol A.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Q-gel seems to be helpful for fine lines and deeper creases.</li>
            <li>It also keeps my skin smooth and soft.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Although they say this is for AM use, I use it at night time after I clean my face.  </li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s really true.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not bad</li>
            <li>recommend trying this product if you want to treat any of the conditions I mentioned or if you simply want a light, effective moisturizer that won&#x27;t contribute to break outs.</li>
            <li>I have been using this product for a few months and find that it makes my skin feel healthy and look healthy.  </li>
            <li>I am nearly 60, and notice the smoothing of fine lines and a glow to my skin.  </li>
            <li>I certainly feel this is a product worth</li>
            <li>I just got this product yesterday and used it for the first time.</li>
            <li>Everyone comments on my pretty skin</li>
            <li>I USE IT FIRST THING IN THE MORNING AFTER CLEANSING AND BEFORE MOISTURIZER...</li>
            <li>stuff is also pretty soupy - when I first opened the jar after it arrived, I had lotion all over the place.</li>
            <li>the Q-gel, I&#x27;m applying once daily with perfect hydration that lasts at least 24 hours.</li>
            <li>and I don&#x27;t get much sleep</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s a cream not a gel but absorbs reasonably.  </li>
            <li>so my skin doesn&#x27;t get much of a break from the heat that causes my rosacea.</li>
            <li>I am a new mom</li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t even place the cream near my eyes.</li>
            <li>With the Avalon product I was using very sparingly because of the price ($18-$24 for 1.75oz) and though a little seemed to go a long way, my skin wanted more hydration before 24 hours passed and twice daily application was necessary.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li> /&gt;After using it for a few months, my skin is not any smoother or firmer as it was with the old discontinued Avalon lotion.</li>

            <li> Although it&#x27;s a bit expensive, you don&#x27;t use very much.</li>
            <li> I have been using this twice daily for the past 4-5 years</li>
            <li> I was looking for something to replace the Avalon Organics product (their new formula is sub-par and their new packaging is atrocious)</li>
            <li> The only negative is the smell.</li>

            <li> I have been using this for quite a few years</li>
            <li> I did use my secret AK recipe on these for a few days which softened them up a bit, but the Q-gel seems to have taken over where my secret recipe left off.</li>
            <li> Girls if you have dry skin, you can&#x27;t go wrong with this one.  </li>
            <li> It has a slight fragrance (why why WHY do manufacturers need to add some random fragrance???)</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s not great.</li>
            <li> I have an icky oily complexion and the wrong products make me break out.  </li>
            <li> The cream is extremely irritating.</li>

            <li> to try and use this all over the face is impossible.</li>

            <li> I just got this product yesterday and used it for the first time. I liked the feel of this product on my skin. I applied it on my face and neck. It is not oily.&lt;br /&gt;It kept my skin hydrated.</li>
            <li> I discovered this while on vacation with my mom. She is 53, a physician, and looks amazing. I tried some of hers and loved it! I am a new mom and I don&#x27;t get much sleep but everyone complements me on my skin now. It seriously glows! The only negative is the smell. It&#x27;s not bad but it&#x27;s not great. My mom added lavender oil to hers but I&#x27;ve just used mine as is. U will be hooked!</li>
            <li> Nothing compares with this face cream.  I have very dry skin and nothing keeps my face from feeling tight and dry--until I tried this.  Girls if you have dry skin, you can&#x27;t go wrong with this one.  Everyone comments on my pretty skin and I am in my 50&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> FIND THIS Q-GEL EASY TO USE, AND FEELS SO SOOTHING ON THE SKIN...I USE IT FIRST THING IN THE MORNING AFTER CLEANSING AND BEFORE MOISTURIZER...STARTS THE DAY OFF BY PERKING YOU UP!</li>
            <li> I love this Derma Q-Gel10.  It is a really nice cream and has a nice fragrant too.  Although they say this is for AM use, I use it at night time after I clean my face.  I tried to use it as a day cream but when I put makeup on top of it, the makeup gets stuck in that spot.  Use it as a night cream instead and you will be satisfied as I am.</li>
            <li> Great for the dog&#x27;s skin problem too</li>
            <li> Love it. Nice smell, great texture, and a fantastic moisturizer.</li>
            <li> I had red and flaky skin on my face for quite a number of years. This is the only product (including cortisone creams) that has worked. Although it&#x27;s a bit expensive, you don&#x27;t use very much. Don&#x27;t rub, just pat it on after showering and you&#x27;ll be amazed. I know this sounds like an advertisement but it&#x27;s really true.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for a few months and find that it makes my skin feel healthy and look healthy.  It doesn&#x27;t do anything for fine lines or wrinkles you may have, but I think it probably does help in the prevention category.  I have an icky oily complexion and the wrong products make me break out.  That is not a factor with this product.  Recommended for maintaining healthy glow.  If you want to get rid of fine lines, use a product with Retinol A.</li>
            <li> I want my money back.  The cream is extremely irritating. I couldn&#x27;t even place the cream near my eyes. I tried to use the cream  under my my eyes they turned blood shot. to try and use this all over the face is impossible.</li>
            <li> We like the cream  goes on easy  won&#x27;t know if it is doing it&#x27;s job  since we just started to use it 2 weeks ago!</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s ok wish it had a better aroma! it&#x27;s a cream not a gel but absorbs reasonably.  Lots of quantity!</li>
            <li> I am not here to knock Avalon Organics in any way. I truly loved the Avalon Organics CoQ10 Repair Wrinkle Defense Night Creme[[ASIN:B000QFCQCO Avalon Organics CoQ10 Repair Wrinkle Defense Night Creme, 1.75-Ounce Bottle]] but the Q-gel seems to go a lot farther. With the Avalon product I was using very sparingly because of the price ($18-$24 for 1.75oz) and though a little seemed to go a long way, my skin wanted more hydration before 24 hours passed and twice daily application was necessary.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With the Q-gel, I&#x27;m applying once daily with perfect hydration that lasts at least 24 hours. I apply after a shower when my skin is still damp to help the cream spread. In this way, I use less cream. The bottle has lasted me about 5 months with daily application to face, neck, and decolette area. I am happy with the results and liking my appearance more and more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Q-gel seems to be helpful for fine lines and deeper creases. It seems to have made my skin healthier all around. It might even have something to do with the actinic keratoses that have disappeared. I did use my secret AK recipe on these for a few days which softened them up a bit, but the Q-gel seems to have taken over where my secret recipe left off. I haven&#x27;t noticed any improvement in areas with rosacea, but I would believe the potential to heal these areas exists. I just happen to spend a lot of time in the sun so my skin doesn&#x27;t get much of a break from the heat that causes my rosacea. I certainly feel this is a product worth it&#x27;s price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend trying this product if you want to treat any of the conditions I mentioned or if you simply want a light, effective moisturizer that won&#x27;t contribute to break outs.</li>
            <li> i can not understand why company&#x27;s have to lie to sell a product. This is okay, but it will not help wrinkles !!!</li>
            <li> I have been using this for quite a few years and i can tell that it has helped lessen the wrinkles around my eyes and face.  It also keeps my skin smooth and soft.&lt;br /&gt;I will continue to use it forever.</li>
            <li> I use this daily, it has helped to rehydrate my skin, reducing dryness, and wrinkles. I would recommend it to those with aging skin in their 40 and over.</li>
            <li> A very good product.  I have used it before and will continue too!  I am nearly 60, and notice the smoothing of fine lines and a glow to my skin.  I use it on my face, neck, and chest.</li>
            <li> I have been using this twice daily for the past 4-5 years and i can see that my wrinkles are less and my skin is smoother looking.&lt;br /&gt;Since COQ10 occurs naturally in our bodies, it is the best thing to use for restoring/replacing  what the body tends to lose with age.</li>
            <li> Light weight and feel good after putting on. I wish it had SPF so I don&#x27;t need to put sun screen lotion after I put it on on mornings.</li>
            <li> I was looking for something to replace the Avalon Organics product (their new formula is sub-par and their new packaging is atrocious) but this isn&#x27;t the replacement I was looking for.&lt;br /&gt;After using it for a few months, my skin is not any smoother or firmer as it was with the old discontinued Avalon lotion. All I&#x27;ve seen is a miniscule improvement in redness on some areas. It has a slight fragrance (why why WHY do manufacturers need to add some random fragrance???) but that seems to dissipate fairly quickly.&lt;br /&gt;This stuff is also pretty soupy - when I first opened the jar after it arrived, I had lotion all over the place.</li>
