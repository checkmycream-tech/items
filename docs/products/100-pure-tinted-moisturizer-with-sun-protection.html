            <li>And still very happy.)  </li>
            <li>Everything was wonderful.  </li>
            <li>(I find that neutral medium bieges or those designed for olive skin work best for me.)</li>
            <li>If it helps, I have olive skin tone, and this shade blends perfectly for me.</li>
            <li>What can I say their product is just excellent.</li>
            <li>The very BEST tinted moisturizer on the market.  </li>
            <li>The color begins a perfect match for my skin but transforms with continued rubbing into a bright reddish-ORANGE on the face.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m happy to say this product is a dream to work with.  </li>
            <li>Great color that blends well</li>
            <li>I have medium colored skin &amp; peach bisque works great.</li>
            <li>this could be great, but I&#x27;m not.</li>
            <li>This tinted moisturizer is amazing!  </li>
            <li>What amazing products!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried the mineral foundation and loved it, but my skin didn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li>It has good coverage.</li>
            <li>it is so good</li>
            <li>when it&#x27;s on it doesn&#x27;t look like makeup, it looks like your own</li>
            <li>It gave my face a nice matte finish.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Another nice thing to know</li>
            <li>I will never buy another kind.</li>
            <li>In my quest for better health and purify on my good and body care, I stumbled upon this product.</li>
            <li>So if you&#x27;re looking to really warm up your complexion</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t want to give up on finding a good match in this brand because the brand&#x27;s ingredients are outstanding, so I am hoping a lighter color will work better for my skin.</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s very smooth and doesn&#x27;t look cakey or smudgy.</li>
            <li>This is a very smooth foundation that feels like a moisturizer.</li>
            <li>but I can tell you that I definitely love this one.</li>
            <li>The peach bisque Concealer was perfect and did not suddenly change color.</li>
            <li>Who could want more?</li>
            <li>I use one bottle over the course of a year or more, and that is using it almost everyday.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I just can&#x27;t say enough great things about it!</li>
            <li>I like the andalou product much better.</li>
            <li>and I like even more</li>
            <li>I found this store at my local mall and am very happy with this product.  </li>
            <li>Love this product.</li>
            <li>My experience with the product is that it is just OK.  </li>
            <li>Works better than any foundation I&#x27;ve ever purchased.  </li>
            <li>I was super excited to try this and the formula was pretty nice and packaging was beautiful and quality.  </li>
            <li>I expect natural products to be more challenging to work with (which I am happy to accommodate)...</li>
            <li>It never makes me break out which is great because a lot of moisturizers do, the color is natural and never looks orange, it&#x27;s very light</li>
            <li>Love the light coverage.</li>
            <li>I do love that it has a natural look with light to medium coverage and glides on very nicely.  </li>
            <li>Originally found this on QVC and am soooooo glad I have found it &amp;#34;again&amp;#34; on Amazon.com.  </li>
            <li>Beautiful color, non-drying, looks clean and fresh all day - even in high humidity!</li>
            <li>Blends in easily and covers pretty well, you can add more for more coverage.</li>
            <li>This is a light moisturizer with a tint of color.</li>
            <li>It really feels nice and doesn&#x27;t look unnatural.</li>
            <li>It goes on smoothly and lasts all day.</li>
            <li>Feels light but covers well and gives skin a glowing look that stays all day.  </li>
            <li>The bottle design lets you see how much product is used, making it easy to know when it&#x27;s time to purchase more.  </li>
            <li>My skin is pretty fair, I buy my foundations in the White Peach shades but Peach Bisque just gives me a healthy summery glow</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never had that happen with any type of cosmetics, even the harsher ones full of chemicals.</li>
            <li>I have fair skin with a lot of red in my T zone.  </li>
            <li>I have to be quick because layering does NOT work.</li>
            <li>First off, I purchased this a my local 100% Pure store and not on Amazon, so I was able to get a good color match.  </li>
            <li>I love Peach Bisque, it looks so natural!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very light weight and looks natural.</li>
            <li>I liked that it was not too sheer, as others I&#x27;ve tried.  </li>
            <li>guessing this is quite rare</li>
            <li>Oh, the fact that it is 100% natural, 100% vegan, gluten free, colored with fruit and vegetable pigments instead of minerals or synthetic dyes is a SUPER bonus.  </li>
            <li>I think it would be too dark for fair colored skin.</li>
            <li>that it was quite a bit cheaper than from the 100% pure website!</li>
            <li>Despite my appreciation of their mostly non-toxic ingredients, there was just not enough benefit from the produce to make it worth the cost.</li>
            <li>When I first applied this tinted moisturizer, I thought it was a joke.</li>
            <li>It looked pretty orange</li>
            <li>While I have clear, smooth skin, I also don&#x27;t find this product gives me the coverage that I like (to even out redness).  </li>
            <li>and it covered redness pretty well and was hydrating.....</li>
            <li>I tried bare minerals new liquid foundation but didn&#x27;t like the way it seemed to sit right on the top of your skin.  </li>
            <li>I also love how pure and natural the 100% Pure line is; even the pigment comes from natural food sources rather than dyes.</li>
            <li>hence the reason why I gravitated to 100% Pure.  </li>
            <li>I have just replaced all of my cosmetics with 100% Pure and hope to try their skincare and bath &amp; body lines soon.  </li>
            <li>I would say this tinted moisturizer is better during dry winter months for those who have combination skin, since this product is very hydrating.  </li>
            <li>Although it does have 15% Titanium Dioxide and 10% Zinc Oxide as their Sunscreen ingredients, in case those are acutely aware of particular skin allergies.</li>
            <li>Also, I feel proud to support a company that is trying to bring pure ingredients into the unhealthy make-up industry.</li>
            <li>The white peach is too light, and the peach bisque is too orange.</li>
            <li>I find in the wintry times, I only need to lightly powder my T-zone, and the color stays put.  </li>
            <li>so it doesn&#x27;t look like you have makeup on at all really</li>
            <li>highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li>It stings my face, and doesn&#x27;t really provide any coverage</li>
            <li>I really like the coverage and feel of this tinted moisturizer.</li>
            <li>It appeared very orange, so was unwearable for me.</li>
            <li>I really like this product</li>
            <li>I was really bummed when smashbox discontinued their tinted moisturizer and was on the hunt for a replacement.  </li>
            <li>really like the idea and would purchase again if they improve the formula.</li>
            <li>I really like that it has SPF also</li>
            <li>My skin feels and looks so much healthier.  </li>
            <li>and they go very well together.  </li>
            <li>So bummed as I really think 100%</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin and can&#x27;t use many different brands and types of foundation.</li>
            <li>I like this brand, but don&#x27;t understand how anyone is giving this particular item 5 stars.</li>
            <li>There&#x27;s an optional powder to use if you need a little more matte look, and an illuminating powder to try.</li>
            <li>The shade is a little more organge-y than I&#x27;d like</li>
            <li>The tint is enough to give me a pretty, sheer coverage that is more than enough for me since I don&#x27;t like to wear foundation.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve settled on using this strictly as a moisturizer, after which, I quickly apply my beige (but not natural) foundation.</li>
            <li>I returned only because it was more orange than I expected.  </li>
            <li>The toxicity level is low and the coverage is very similar to smashbox (light coverage).  </li>
            <li>Creme in the foundation is slightly too cool toned for me, in this it&#x27;s very orange.</li>
            <li>Because I have oily skin, I do apply a sheer mineral veil on top of the moisturizer to keep shine down, though.</li>
            <li>I use the entire 100% pure line, including primer before applying this and there is no melting, shine or anything.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using Pure&#x27;s products for awhile now and finally tried this tinted moisturizer.</li>
            <li>I have been wanting to switch to natural products for my skin, but was worried that they were not going to work as well.  </li>
            <li>I ordered the Peach Bisque colored tinted moisturizer and the coloring was completely off from what the image displayed online and on the packaging.</li>
            <li>Not as young as I used to be.  </li>
            <li>By blending a little bit of the SPF and two pumps of the 100% pure my face was a bit more even, less orange but</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve recently switched from high end department store beauty products to natural products.  </li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t feel greasy or heavy, and it comes off clean.</li>
            <li>Nice product but the pump always breaks on these, I&#x27;ve bought a few, so not worth the money</li>
            <li>The first time I put it on it was very dry, so I started shaking it up before applying.  </li>
            <li>I find it lasts me much longer than I expected.</li>
            <li>The next day my face completely broke out and</li>
            <li>Especially like that it&#x27;s entirely natural...</li>
            <li>I am all about natural skin care and try to avoid toxic ingredients wherever possible,</li>
            <li>I go for a pretty natural makeup look, but if I&#x27;m going to go to the trouble to put on makeup, I do want it to make an improvement.  </li>
            <li>but just right for a little tint.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>(I normally use pressed or loose mineral powders to even skin tone.)</li>
            <li>I have light-to-medium cool asian skin tone, and sensitive combination to oily skin (dry patches in winter and oily slick in summer), so I wanted to invest in products that I can use on a daily basis that doubles for skincare.  </li>
            <li>Pure makes nice quality products...just wish my skin wasn&#x27;t so darn picky.  :(</li>
            <li>I have sensitive, dry, combo skin</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m afraid to try the golden peach because I&#x27;m sure it will be too dark for my complexion.</li>

            <li> It doesn&#x27;t feel greasy or heavy, and it comes off clean.</li>
            <li> Nice product but the pump always breaks on these, I&#x27;ve bought a few, so not worth the money</li>
            <li> The first time I put it on it was very dry, so I started shaking it up before applying.  </li>
            <li> I find it lasts me much longer than I expected.</li>

            <li> I have light-to-medium cool asian skin tone, and sensitive combination to oily skin (dry patches in winter and oily slick in summer), so I wanted to invest in products that I can use on a daily basis that doubles for skincare.  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I have used this tinted moisturizer for years! I love Peach Bisque, it looks so natural!</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and can&#x27;t use many different brands and types of foundation. I&#x27;ve tried the mineral foundation and loved it, but my skin didn&#x27;t. This is a light moisturizer with a tint of color. The color is not dark, instead it is subtle so when it&#x27;s on it doesn&#x27;t look like makeup, it looks like your own skin.&lt;br /&gt;It does not settle in lines. This is sheer so it also doesn&#x27;t cover up any acne marks, or redness. I use the entire 100% pure line, including primer before applying this and there is no melting, shine or anything. There&#x27;s an optional powder to use if you need a little more matte look, and an illuminating powder to try.</li>
            <li> This is my second one. It has good coverage.</li>
            <li> I returned only because it was more orange than I expected.  I may buy a lighter one in the future to try again, but I can attest that the peach bisque is too orange.  I liked that it was not too sheer, as others I&#x27;ve tried.  It gave my face a nice matte finish.</li>
            <li> The shade is a little more organge-y than I&#x27;d like but it&#x27;s still a solid product.</li>
            <li> My skin is bland boring beige. The white peach is too light, and the peach bisque is too orange. I&#x27;m afraid to try the golden peach because I&#x27;m sure it will be too dark for my complexion. I&#x27;ve settled on using this strictly as a moisturizer, after which, I quickly apply my beige (but not natural) foundation. I have to be quick because layering does NOT work.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve recently switched from high end department store beauty products to natural products.  I am a performer which means I have to regularly deal with heavy duty high performance stage and film makeup.  I have light-to-medium cool asian skin tone, and sensitive combination to oily skin (dry patches in winter and oily slick in summer), so I wanted to invest in products that I can use on a daily basis that doubles for skincare.  I expect natural products to be more challenging to work with (which I am happy to accommodate)... and I&#x27;m happy to say this product is a dream to work with.  Although it is a tad too orange for my skin tone (which I promptly went ahead and purchased their lighter CREME tinted moisturizer to mix with. And still very happy.)  I would say this tinted moisturizer is better during dry winter months for those who have combination skin, since this product is very hydrating.  I do love that it has a natural look with light to medium coverage and glides on very nicely.  I find in the wintry times, I only need to lightly powder my T-zone, and the color stays put.  Oh, the fact that it is 100% natural, 100% vegan, gluten free, colored with fruit and vegetable pigments instead of minerals or synthetic dyes is a SUPER bonus.  Although it does have 15% Titanium Dioxide and 10% Zinc Oxide as their Sunscreen ingredients, in case those are acutely aware of particular skin allergies.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Pure&#x27;s products for awhile now and finally tried this tinted moisturizer. I&#x27;ve never tried any other tinted moisturizer before so I can&#x27;t compare it to another product but I can tell you that I definitely love this one. It never makes me break out which is great because a lot of moisturizers do, the color is natural and never looks orange, it&#x27;s very light so it doesn&#x27;t look like you have makeup on at all really, it&#x27;s very smooth and doesn&#x27;t look cakey or smudgy. My skin is pretty fair, I buy my foundations in the White Peach shades but Peach Bisque just gives me a healthy summery glow--it would be too dark for my skin as a foundation but just right for a little tint.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another nice thing to know, it doesn&#x27;t settle into little wrinkles making them look worse. I have the start of fine lines under my eyes and when I use the foundations/concealers, they always look way, way worse! I use this under my eyes now and dust it with a little white peach powder and it doesn&#x27;t make the little lines disappear but it doesn&#x27;t make them worse, it does help cover up dark, sleepy eyes though!</li>
            <li> I like this brand, but don&#x27;t understand how anyone is giving this particular item 5 stars. The color begins a perfect match for my skin but transforms with continued rubbing into a bright reddish-ORANGE on the face. I was shocked. I looked like I walked into a tanning salon and just got my face badly tanned. I tried it several times to figure out when it was turning orange, and my husband and I realized it was after a few rubs. Maybe the heat activates something in the mix? The peach bisque Concealer was perfect and did not suddenly change color. I should have listened to the other reviews for this tinted moisturizer. I don&#x27;t want to give up on finding a good match in this brand because the brand&#x27;s ingredients are outstanding, so I am hoping a lighter color will work better for my skin.</li>
            <li> Everything was wonderful.  Came in quicker than we thought and the product was what it said it was.  Who could want more?</li>
            <li> .Love this product. Ive always had acne poblems and this product does not make me  break out. Great color that blends well</li>
            <li> This made my skin glow...but was way too orange! I am Asian and have yellow undertones and this was just terrible. I got it in peach bisque.</li>
            <li> It really feels nice and doesn&#x27;t look unnatural. It doesn&#x27;t feel greasy or heavy, and it comes off clean. It doesn&#x27;t clog my pores but it does even out my complexion. Also, I feel proud to support a company that is trying to bring pure ingredients into the unhealthy make-up industry. I find it lasts me much longer than I expected. I use one bottle over the course of a year or more, and that is using it almost everyday.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this product! I just can&#x27;t say enough great things about it!</li>
            <li> It stings my face, and doesn&#x27;t really provide any coverage (I know it&#x27;s tinted moisturizer). I like the andalou product much better.</li>
            <li> I really like the coverage and feel of this tinted moisturizer. (I normally use pressed or loose mineral powders to even skin tone.) The only thing I disliked was the color.  It appeared very orange, so was unwearable for me. (I find that neutral medium bieges or those designed for olive skin work best for me.)</li>
            <li> I really like this product and I like even more that it was quite a bit cheaper than from the 100% pure website!</li>
            <li> I was really bummed when smashbox discontinued their tinted moisturizer and was on the hunt for a replacement.  I tried bare minerals new liquid foundation but didn&#x27;t like the way it seemed to sit right on the top of your skin.  Tried Chanel&#x27;s foundation, I liked the way it went on and smelled but was disappointed when I looked up the toxicity level of their ingredients.  I found this store at my local mall and am very happy with this product.  The toxicity level is low and the coverage is very similar to smashbox (light coverage).  It moisturizes your skin but doesn&#x27;t leave it greasy.</li>
            <li> Nice product but the pump always breaks on these, I&#x27;ve bought a few, so not worth the money</li>
            <li> I have been wanting to switch to natural products for my skin, but was worried that they were not going to work as well.  This tinted moisturizer is amazing!  I will never buy another kind.</li>
            <li> In my quest for better health and purify on my good and body care, I stumbled upon this product. The look is cakes and not natural. I was disappointed.</li>
            <li> get a lighter one than you think. this is dark and orange tinted.</li>
            <li> This is the only day moisturizer I have used for a couple of years now. Because it&#x27;s tinted, I don&#x27;t have the expense or time needed to apply makeup on my skin. The tint is enough to give me a pretty, sheer coverage that is more than enough for me since I don&#x27;t like to wear foundation. Because I have oily skin, I do apply a sheer mineral veil on top of the moisturizer to keep shine down, though. I also love how pure and natural the 100% Pure line is; even the pigment comes from natural food sources rather than dyes. If it helps, I have olive skin tone, and this shade blends perfectly for me.</li>
            <li> When I first applied this tinted moisturizer, I thought it was a joke. Orange stain that did not blend well at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have a tanned/olive skin tone so I got the peach bisque knowing that it would be a gamble.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I decided to give it another chance by blending it into a vitamin E moisturizer with SPF from The Body Shop. By blending a little bit of the SPF and two pumps of the 100% pure my face was a bit more even, less orange but still streaky.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really like the idea and would purchase again if they improve the formula. But when your boyfriend asks you why there is orange stain around your lips... it&#x27;s time to put it to rest.</li>
            <li> The coverage is sheer, but I use it with the 100% concealer &amp; that combo covers my discolorations without feeling like I have a caked face. I have medium colored skin &amp; peach bisque works great. I think it would be too dark for fair colored skin. I really like that it has SPF also</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t come with a tube in it so the pump doesn&#x27;t work.  I have to store it upside down in order to get the moisturizer out.  Very thin coverage.</li>
            <li> What can I say their product is just excellent.</li>
            <li> I ordered the Peach Bisque colored tinted moisturizer and the coloring was completely off from what the image displayed online and on the packaging. It looked pretty orange so I applied very little to my face but still ended up looking like an Oompa Loompa. The next day my face completely broke out and I&#x27;ve never had that happen with any type of cosmetics, even the harsher ones full of chemicals. Needless to say I requested a refund and sent back this product. What a disappointment. :-(</li>
            <li> Love this product. It goes on smoothly and lasts all day. Blends with my skin tone. It&#x27;s very light weight and looks natural. Especially like that it&#x27;s entirely natural...literally food based ingredients as is the entire 100% product line.  My skin has become softer and well moisturized.</li>
            <li> This is a very smooth foundation that feels like a moisturizer. Blends in easily and covers pretty well, you can add more for more coverage. It leaves your skin with a dewey glow, especially when paired with the creamy lip and cheek tints.</li>
            <li> The first time I put it on it was very dry, so I started shaking it up before applying.  I do you a moisturizer under the tinted moisturize because my skin is drier.  Not as young as I used to be.  The color is very subtle and it doesn&#x27;t look like a mask.  The reason I gave it a 4 is it wasn&#x27;t moisturizing enough.  But I will buy again anyway.  I like that there are no chemicals in this make up.</li>
            <li> Originally found this on QVC and am soooooo glad I have found it &amp;#34;again&amp;#34; on Amazon.com.  The very BEST tinted moisturizer on the market.  Beautiful color, non-drying, looks clean and fresh all day - even in high humidity!</li>
            <li> Love the light coverage.</li>
            <li> First off, I purchased this a my local 100% Pure store and not on Amazon, so I was able to get a good color match.  I have fair skin with a lot of red in my T zone.  The \\&quot;creme\\&quot; color works well for my skin.    I am all about natural skin care and try to avoid toxic ingredients wherever possible, hence the reason why I gravitated to 100% Pure.  I like the ingredients in this product, except for the Titanium Dioxide.  Nano particles are a big concern for me.    My experience with the product is that it is just OK.  I&#x27;ve tried all different ways of applying -- with my fingers, with a beauty blender, applying two thin layers to build coverage, etc.  Basically, there are always some stubborn spots on my skin that just don&#x27;t want to blend out and end up looking patchy.  While I have clear, smooth skin, I also don&#x27;t find this product gives me the coverage that I like (to even out redness).  I go for a pretty natural makeup look, but if I&#x27;m going to go to the trouble to put on makeup, I do want it to make an improvement.  Despite my appreciation of their mostly non-toxic ingredients, there was just not enough benefit from the produce to make it worth the cost.</li>
            <li> I like the formula, but the colors are not the same as the foundation! Creme in the foundation is slightly too cool toned for me, in this it&#x27;s very orange. I had someone ask if I went tanning! So if you&#x27;re looking to really warm up your complexion this could be great, but I&#x27;m not. I mix this with the foundation because I don&#x27;t want to waste it. If creme matches you in the foundation, the TM isn&#x27;t for you unfortunately.</li>
            <li> Works better than any foundation I&#x27;ve ever purchased.  Feels light but covers well and gives skin a glowing look that stays all day.  My skin feels and looks so much healthier.  The bottle design lets you see how much product is used, making it easy to know when it&#x27;s time to purchase more.  One bottle has lasted me 2.5 months using it 5-6 times a week.  I bought the lip and cheek tint to go with this and they go very well together.  I have just replaced all of my cosmetics with 100% Pure and hope to try their skincare and bath &amp; body lines soon.  I hope they stay in business forever!  What amazing products!</li>
            <li> I was super excited to try this and the formula was pretty nice and packaging was beautiful and quality.  The color is definitely darker than expected and it is a bit shiny for my taste and made me want to wash my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I have sensitive, dry, combo skin and it covered redness pretty well and was hydrating.....BUT when I woke up the next day the entire lower half of my face was covered in a ton of tiny little red bumps that burned!  Over the next few days they all turned into little tiny white heads and I was putting poison ivy cream on my face to stop the itching and burning.  I&#x27;m a makeup artist and putting makeup over it before going to a client&#x27;s house was not only extremely embarrassing, but it felt like my face was on fire.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m guessing this is quite rare but I had a similar reaction on a smaller scale to another product from a different company that was also made with fruit pigments so I&#x27;m guessing I have an allergy to these kinds of cosmetics.  So bummed as I really think 100% Pure makes nice quality products...just wish my skin wasn&#x27;t so darn picky.  :(</li>
            <li> does not stay in stock it is so good</li>
