            <li>I&#x27;ve used the product before - and can vouch for it being a wonderful, super light-weight moisturizer that just feels refreshing.</li>
            <li>Each tube came in it&#x27;s own box.</li>
            <li>I love this moisturizer, and find that it keeps my rosacea under good control, which is a bonus since my prescription medication was no longer working</li>

            <li>I will definitely use this seller again and recommend them to anyone wanting a great product for a great price expedited quickly!</li>
            <li>I love this moisturizer.</li>
            <li>Fantastic bargain!</li>
            <li>Love the softness and the smell.&lt;br /&gt;Only</li>
            <li>There are better moisturizers for oily and acne prone skins.</li>
            <li>This is my favorite moisturizer.</li>
            <li>I like the idea of buying more than one tube at a time.  </li>
            <li>This stuff is the best daily for your face.</li>
            <li>Great product with reasonable price.</li>
            <li>Perfect for daily use moisturizer.</li>
            <li>but this product seems better with my skin.</li>
            <li>This time I ordered it from Amazon to get a better deal.  </li>
            <li>I love this stuff, my face feels so smooth after using it.</li>
            <li>I want the genuine Proactiv moisturizer</li>
            <li>I know it&#x27;s probably because they give these things away for free with the three step system on the website and if you call, but who cares.</li>
            <li>: it&#x27;s not oil free as the label says.</li>
            <li>and I greatly enjoy the scent.</li>
            <li>Texture is light and non greasy.</li>
            <li>And I love having a new tube in waiting instead of having to go out a buy more each time.</li>
            <li>It is a great, non-greasy product, but it doesn&#x27;t solve my dry skin problem.</li>
            <li>I received my order quickly and every one of the lot of 10 I ordered had seals.  </li>
            <li>But this particular offer is an amazing deal for what you&#x27;d normally pay through Proactiv for this much volume.</li>
            <li>I am not only saving huge deal of money but also got a good facial skin than ever before.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very light and not greasy or heavily scented like most.</li>
            <li>The green tea moisturizer is amazing in general, and this deal makes it that much better!</li>
            <li>Although you have to buy it in bulk here, it is MUCH cheaper!</li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t really solved my skin problem!</li>
            <li>Now I am using Johnson &amp; Johnson&#x27;s Clean &amp; Clear Dual action moisturizer and my skin problems are gone!!!</li>
            <li>good price and super convenience to take a little tube in your purse, make-up back, wherever</li>
            <li>Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>the price is finally reasonable.</li>
            <li>Got more than expected - seller exceeded all expectations.</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very please with my shipment.</li>
            <li>This keeps my oily, acne prone skin smooth, soft, and clear.</li>
            <li>I am in the process of testing it by eliminating particular foods,etc.</li>
            <li>Would highly recommend this.</li>
            <li>I was having trouble finding it without buying it bundled with other Proactiv products that I don&#x27;t need, so I was happy to find this offer.</li>
            <li>However, I normally order it from the vendor at the mall or thru Proactive website.</li>
            <li>I bought this exact same &amp;#34;lot of 10&amp;#34; from this buyer a year ago and paid $14 then.</li>
            <li>I have been ordering it from Proactiv directly for a couple of years.  </li>
            <li>(maybe I developed an immunity?).  </li>
            <li>Gets the job done for my 30 year-old manly, yet sensitive face.</li>
            <li>If you are familiar with the Proactiv line, you&#x27;ll know that ordering through the main company usually requires a regular delivery of products and the entire system.</li>
            <li>love this moisturizer, only complaint, the one ounce tubes don&#x27;t last long..wish it came in a 12  ounce or evenbigger!!!</li>
    </ol>

            <li> Love this lotion, but frustrated that the only way to get it is in the form of sample bottles.</li>

            <li> pack again in a few months!</li>
            <li> bad thing is the moisture does not last 12hrs like other moisturizers</li>
            <li> During the cold dry seasons, I use a lot of Green Tea Moisturizer.  </li>
            <li> Could be worse--the moisturizing properties make up for the packaging disappointment.</li>
            <li> I get a bad skin irritation from the lotion that is included in the 3-step system, so I need to order my supplies separately.</li>
            <li> the price at the kiosk in the mall is outrageous still</li>

            <li> My daughter loves this moisturizer and this bulk deal saved us money.  I&#x27;ll be looking for a similar offer the next time we need to reorder.</li>
            <li> Fantastic product!! Best on market to date! Perfect balance between moisture and not too oily. Makes my skin feel balanced.</li>
            <li> I thought this was going to be a moisturizing cream for dry hands.  It is a great, non-greasy product, but it doesn&#x27;t solve my dry skin problem.</li>
            <li> I love this moisturizer. It is not at all greasy like some moisturizers. I was having trouble finding it without buying it bundled with other Proactiv products that I don&#x27;t need, so I was happy to find this offer. It is a very nice product.</li>
            <li> This is an excellent moisturizer for acne prone skin that needs moisture without oiliness or breakouts. Each tube came in it&#x27;s own box.</li>
            <li> Fantastic bargain! Love this lotion, but frustrated that the only way to get it is in the form of sample bottles.

            <li> If you are familiar with the Proactiv line, you&#x27;ll know that ordering through the main company usually requires a regular delivery of products and the entire system. I get a bad skin irritation from the lotion that is included in the 3-step system, so I need to order my supplies separately. The green tea moisturizer is amazing in general, and this deal makes it that much better! This tiny tube of moisturizer is expensive if you are able to find it sold individually in a kiosk or a vending machine. Although you have to buy it in bulk here, it is MUCH cheaper! And I love having a new tube in waiting instead of having to go out a buy more each time. I will definitely be buying it this way from now on!</li>
            <li> Need a larger tube, like maybe a quart size....good stuff and the price is finally reasonable. the price at the kiosk in the mall is outrageous still</li>
            <li> I would give this. Nero stars if u could. It burns my skin. I can&#x27;t use it. So I got all of these 1 oz bottles for nothing.</li>
            <li> good price and super convenience to take a little tube in your purse, make-up back, wherever</li>
            <li> I love Proactiv Green Tea Moisturizer but refuse to pay the outrageous price Proactiv charges for it.  I want the genuine Proactiv moisturizer so I refuse to buy from anyone who does not guarantee the tubes are sealed.  I received my order quickly and every one of the lot of 10 I ordered had seals.  The price was also great!  I will definitely use this seller again and recommend them to anyone wanting a great product for a great price expedited quickly!</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t really solved my skin problem! There are better moisturizers for oily and acne prone skins. Now I am using Johnson &amp; Johnson&#x27;s Clean &amp; Clear Dual action moisturizer and my skin problems are gone!!! Also, using OXY and Clearasil Cleansing Pads for a cleaner skin. I am not only saving huge deal of money but also got a good facial skin than ever before.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used the product before - and can vouch for it being a wonderful, super light-weight moisturizer that just feels refreshing. But this particular offer is an amazing deal for what you&#x27;d normally pay through Proactiv for this much volume.</li>
            <li> Thank you! Got more than expected - seller exceeded all expectations. Awesome product too by the way.</li>
            <li> You cannot beat this price! I know it&#x27;s probably because they give these things away for free with the three step system on the website and if you call, but who cares. This is my favorite moisturizer. It smells like cucumber melon kind of and does a great job at keeping my skin smooth and breakout free. I use it morning and night after the three step system.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One thing though: it&#x27;s not oil free as the label says. The ingredient list on the bottle contains an oil. However, it has not clogged my pores at all.</li>
            <li> Great product! I have used this for about three years now and keep coming back for this moisturizer. Its very light and I greatly enjoy the scent.</li>
            <li> Still wish it came in bigger than 1 oz tubes, but these get the job done.</li>
            <li> This was a tremendous value...absolutely the best deal I could have hoped to find.  I love this moisturizer, and find that it keeps my rosacea under good control, which is a bonus since my prescription medication was no longer working (maybe I developed an immunity?).  I will be looking for this value pack again in a few months!</li>
            <li> I love this moisturizer and the price was excellent.  I received these quickly and am very happy with the product.  Would highly recommend this.</li>
            <li> During the cold dry seasons, I use a lot of Green Tea Moisturizer.  I like the idea of buying more than one tube at a time.  The price is great.  Thanks I&#x27;m very please with my shipment.</li>
            <li> The best thing for my skin after I put on makeup. Feels great and prevents breakouts.</li>
            <li> Same product sold online and in those kiosk machines but way cheaper.</li>
            <li> This stuff is the best daily for your face. It&#x27;s very light and not greasy or heavily scented like most. Also, this 10 pack is actually 1/10th of the price compared to buying retail!  I paid $30 for 1 oz at a mall kiosk before I found this. 1 oz will last approximately 3 weeks using 1-2 times per day.</li>
            <li> Gets the job done for my 30 year-old manly, yet sensitive face.</li>
            <li> I bought this exact same &amp;#34;lot of 10&amp;#34; from this buyer a year ago and paid $14 then.</li>
            <li> I see absolutely NO moisturizing affect using this. My skin is left feeling dry and tight. DEFINITELY NOT A MOISTURIZER. I think they need to market it as something else - like maybe a pore tightener.</li>
            <li> Great product with reasonable price. Texture is light and non greasy. Perfect for daily use moisturizer. I used to use Clinique m gel lotion but this product seems better with my skin. Smells nice too</li>
            <li> I have been using the green tea moisturizer for years because it&#x27;s the only moisturizer that works for my skin. However, I normally order it from the vendor at the mall or thru Proactive website. This time I ordered it from Amazon to get a better deal.  Since I&#x27;ve used it I broke out in an unusual and extremely bad rash on my entire face. I am in the process of testing it by eliminating particular foods,etc. in hopes that it&#x27;s a fluke incident, not the product and maybe something else that has caused the rash.  It&#x27;s very itchy and there are ugly bumps ALL over my entire face. Has anyone experienced this with ordering the product on Amazon?</li>
