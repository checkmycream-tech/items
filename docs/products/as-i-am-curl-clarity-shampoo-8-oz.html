            <li>This line is the best thing I&#x27;ve ever put on my hair.</li>
            <li>Great cleanser!!  </li>
            <li>great!</li>
            <li>This is a great cleanser for my 3b hair.</li>
            <li>These work great for me, but can build up.  </li>
            <li>GOOD</li>
            <li>I am very pleased with this product.</li>
            <li>It removes build up without drying and has a great scent - mostly coconut.  </li>
            <li>The best part is that you don&#x27;t need a whole lot to create a good lather.</li>
            <li>kind of strips hair</li>
            <li>Smells good and leaves your hair clean ans shine.</li>
            <li>My hair loves this product so much better.</li>
            <li>Its more for a looser curl woman in my opinion.</li>
            <li>This was listed on naturallycurly.com as a top clarifying shampoo, so I thought I would give it a try.  </li>
            <li>I gave it three stars because I love as I am, but this shampoo does not work for me at all.  </li>
            <li>I love As I Am products.</li>
            <li>This clarifier is perfect to use once per week followed by a deep conditioner.  </li>
            <li>I really love this shampoo.</li>
            <li>most shampoo&#x27;s that are sulfate free.</li>
            <li>I deep conditioned my hair with ic reconstructor and my hair felt great.</li>
            <li>I like the fact that it is sulfate free and does not feel like</li>
            <li>All in all it did what it was supposed to do which was clean my hair.</li>
            <li>I wanted to try it out because I heard such good things about this brand</li>
            <li>It also wasn&#x27;t super clarifying.</li>
            <li>I enjoy the product line, I received compliments from many about my hair which is natural.</li>
            <li>It leaves it super soft and easy to comb during shampooing.</li>
            <li>and their coconut cowash (also an excellent product) a few days later.</li>
            <li>I use this once a week and the oceans on a more regular basis to wash my hair.</li>
            <li>I think it worked pretty well.  </li>
            <li>so I use a hot oil treatment before wash ..</li>
            <li>but because I love the co was and the leave in conditioner I will continue to purchase this because I want to stick to the same brand.</li>
            <li>Just got the shampoo did try it yet, but if it anything like the leave in and the deep conditioner then I will love it.</li>
            <li>the first application it lathers</li>
            <li>This strips my 4b 4c hair too much.</li>
            <li>I use the whole line.</li>
            <li>I really like</li>
            <li>yet it is very cleansing.</li>
            <li>LEAVES HAIR SUPER CLEAN......just take very little for a good latter to form....</li>
            <li>There was definitely tangling, but not as much as I experienced with other brands not meant for naturally curly hair.  </li>
            <li>Just a little bit is more than enough to make a huge foam.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this shampoo.  </li>
            <li>AS I Am......you have too many other ingredients that my natural hair didn&#x27;t like.</li>
            <li>I think this did a pretty good job with less harsh ingredients, and hair didn&#x27;t seem to be as tangled.  </li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t smell good, left my hair extremely damaged and dry.</li>
            <li>Used this for the first time today following a blowout I had done about a week ago.  </li>
            <li>I need a product closer to natural ingredients.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m transitioning from a relaxer to natural hair.</li>
            <li>I rated it four stars, because the shampoo does get my hair really clean,and that&#x27;s one thing I like about the product after I use there Double butter cream,and some holding gel in my hair.</li>
            <li>The hair clarifying shampoo left my hair a little bit dry,that&#x27;s after I had washed it,and it was still kind of wet.</li>
            <li>I washed my hair twice with the shampoo,  the natural part of my hair felt clean but the relaxed ends did fell a little dry.</li>
            <li>It did not dry out my hair.</li>
            <li>The formula is thin (not drippy), but I don&#x27;t find that I use more than I would a regular shampoo.  </li>

            <li> Then I use the leave in conditioner and my thick coarse frizzy prone hair is manageable and soft.</li>

            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t say anything bad about this product.</li>

    <ol>
            <li> Like it.  It did not make my hair dry and brittle</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with this product. Would definitely recommend it to anyone!  Thank you!</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t say anything bad about this product. It was just not right for my texture of hair, to ever want to buy it again.</li>
            <li> I recently switched to this shampoo from their cleansing pudding.  My hair loves this product so much better. It leaves it super soft and easy to comb during shampooing. The best part is that you don&#x27;t need a whole lot to create a good lather. I highly recommend this shampoo.  I alternate using this once a week and their coconut cowash (also an excellent product) a few days later.</li>

            <li> Great cleanser!!  Please use a conditioner immediately after using this product, because it can and will break your hair off.</li>

This was listed on naturallycurly.com as a top clarifying shampoo, so I thought I would give it a try.  I think it worked pretty well.

            <li> LEAVES HAIR SUPER CLEAN......just take very little for a good latter to form....i would purchase this again....the other butter daily NOT</li>
            <li> This is a great cleanser for my 3b hair. I switched about a year ago and haven&#x27;t looked back. great!</li>
            <li> As I Am is all I use, however, the Curl Clarity Shampoo tangles my natural hair terribly.  I gave it three stars because I love as I am, but this shampoo does not work for me at all.  I gave the bottle away.</li>

            <li> I love As I Am products. I use the whole line.</li>
            <li> The shampoo was horrible. Doesn&#x27;t smell good, left my hair extremely damaged and dry. Oh well I suppose. I wanted to try it out because I heard such good things about this brand, I should have stuck to my creamy cleanser.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It just didn&#x27;t work out for me at all.</li>
            <li> I use hair one to cleanse daily with Ouidad styling products.  These work great for me, but can build up.  This clarifier is perfect to use once per week followed by a deep conditioner.  It removes build up without drying and has a great scent - mostly coconut.  The formula is thin (not drippy), but I don&#x27;t find that I use more than I would a regular shampoo.  I really like As I Am curl clarifying shampoo &amp; would purchase it again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**I have 3b color treated curls and am Caucasian.  I have read that folks with coarser hair find the product drying. I did not find this to be the case with my hair type.</li>
            <li> I have 4c African-American hair and I&#x27;m transitioning from a relaxer to natural hair. I washed my hair twice with the shampoo,  the natural part of my hair felt clean but the relaxed ends did fell a little dry. I deep conditioned my hair with ic reconstructor and my hair felt great. All in all it did what it was supposed to do which was clean my hair.</li>
            <li> Just got the shampoo did try it yet, but if it anything like the leave in and the deep conditioner then I will love it.</li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t need to use it a lot. Just a little bit is more than enough to make a huge foam. Smells good and leaves your hair clean ans shine.</li>
            <li> I have 4a hair and it drys my hair out like crazy! the first application it lathers but I cannot shampoo through my hair I have to rub it on with the palms of my hands -NOT GOOD AT ALL. the curls I didn&#x27;t see where they popped out at me and looked luscious like the bottle said it would look but that it just look dry with tons of Crunch!</li>
            <li> I really love this shampoo. It is not stripping of the hair and yet it is very cleansing. I like the fact that it is sulfate free and does not feel like most shampoo&#x27;s that are sulfate free. It actually have a moisturizing feeling to it. I wish I could buy it in a larger size!</li>
            <li> The hair clarifying shampoo left my hair a little bit dry,that&#x27;s after I had washed it,and it was still kind of wet.I rated it four stars, because the shampoo does get my hair really clean,and that&#x27;s one thing I like about the product after I use there Double butter cream,and some holding gel in my hair.</li>
