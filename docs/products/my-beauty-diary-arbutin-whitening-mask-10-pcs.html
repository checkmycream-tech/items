            <li>Skin looks smooth and refresh.</li>
            <li>The packaging is nice, but these masks really do nothing for your skin.</li>

            <li>[...]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These differences were also ALL true for me.</li>
            <li>have friends that tried this face mask that are not asian and they loved it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;These really do work, although it requires more than a couple of applications.</li>
            <li>I really like this mask because it&#x27;s so refreshing on my face.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m fair among Asian ppl, based on my skin care experience</li>
            <li>If I do a gentle peel beforehand, this works even better.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The mask won&#x27;t fit perfectly, so I just take sissors and make extra slits where I need them to be, not much of a problem.</li>
            <li>This mask really works!!</li>
            <li>Wow, I love it.</li>
            <li>These mask give you a translucent glow, you will notice a suttle lightening effect but not something drastic but still its worth everyyy peny .&lt;br</li>
            <li>recommended~ its worth to buy</li>
            <li>This product feels safe and I&#x27;ve noticed no side effects so far.</li>
            <li>Your skin will feel soft and smooth after one use!</li>
            <li>I have darker skin and use these masks a couple of times a week right before bed.</li>
            <li>It also makes my skin vibrant, hydrated and smooth.</li>
            <li>And my skin felt super super soft after using it.</li>
            <li>After I used it my face so smooth and soft</li>
            <li>My skin was so soft and smooth after using it...and it diffinatly whitened my skin.</li>
            <li>Love them and I will definitely be buying them again.</li>
            <li>I am married to a Taiwanese and visit Taiwan every year.</li>
            <li>My skin improved a lot after the first try.</li>
            <li>I can see a visible difference after the first use.</li>
            <li>First, I haven&#x27;t use it yet.</li>
            <li>My acne scars already look so much lighter and it soothed my eczema!</li>
            <li>This has definitely earned the privilege to be part of my beauty regime. :)</li>
            <li>The wrinkles are coming... and more white hair.</li>
            <li>I lightened up after the first use.</li>
            <li>But, if you would fit into this, it would be perfect and recommended for you, however, if you&#x27;re like me and you have a small face, it might cause ya trouble too.</li>
            <li>Anyway, u may use some products to make up  the rest of 10% to make u look better as long as u don&#x27;t let ur skin exposed under sunlight all the day.</li>
            <li>(so the product I believe are probably more geared towards asian skin types), I highly recommend buying this product even if you are not asian!!!!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to use, moisturizes, and whitens your skin--BUT, only temporarily (as in 1 day...</li>
            <li>Within time, I could tell my skin tone has evened out and minimized the large pores apparence.</li>
            <li>I have been using this kind for a little over a year</li>
            <li>I bought this at a Chinese cosmetics store in LA&#x27;s Little Tokyo (much cheaper than on here lol).</li>
            <li>Fast shipping.</li>
            <li>The masks are very moist with product and will stick to your skin without drying out.</li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t really whiten; however, it does wonders to skin.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t wear makeup, but this really gave my skin that pristine surface, just radiant, advertisement type skin.</li>
            <li>Itâ€˜s very gooooood mask!!!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Used it but cannot see much difference in the brightness part .I</li>
            <li>The produce date is 2012, but the mask is very moisture.</li>
            <li>Even if they don&#x27;t do much for the age spots/melasma, they&#x27;re very hydrating and soothing</li>
            <li>I have not noticed the lightening affect but it does moisturize very well.</li>
            <li>This is a brand that does the job with a reasonable price.  </li>
            <li>they make fakes of these, and I didn&#x27;t notice my face being any whiter after using the whole box.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;ve really helped improve my complexion.</li>
            <li>It also got rid of most of dark spots on my face.</li>
            <li>Secondly, I&#x27;m neither accounting on it to change my skin color nor to make my face super white right after first time I try it.</li>
            <li>I would love to hear what boxes other users got!</li>
            <li>Although they smell exactly the same, this store bought mask had a reasonable face shape which covered my face ear to ear, and also fit on my upper lip spot on!</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it if you are already at you goal shade and just want to maintain it and have a glowy complexion .</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>my skin looks much brighter and it feels so AMAZINGLY soft but firm.&lt;br</li>
            <li>the solution is kind of thick</li>
            <li>It can get messy as the masks are very runny,  but easy to use</li>
            <li>quite obviously the differences are right away noticeable, when compared to the picture from this seller.</li>
            <li>I normal have combination skin and very sensitive.</li>
            <li>Since one of the reviewers told me she got the exact same box as the one in the pic, I am thinking maybe this particular seller is getting the boxes from somewhere</li>
            <li>yeah it could be how the new edition looks.</li>
            <li>These masks do a great job of giving an instant boost to tired looking skin.</li>
            <li>My skin is very soft and supple after using.</li>
            <li>I have VERY sensitive skin and this stuff</li>
            <li>I got a box exact same as this one:</li>
            <li>I will keep you guys posted, but so far, two thumbs up!</li>
            <li>It definitely lightens my face and fades away my discoloration on the certain areas on my face.</li>
            <li>and I can say so far I do see brightening.</li>
            <li>However it did not cause a reaction to my sensitive skin</li>
            <li>REAL one, the difference after using it is BIG!</li>
            <li>I like how it brightens the skin and makes it soft and dewy.  </li>
            <li>During the masking time, I gently massage the facial muscles and let the lotion in the mask soak into the skin.</li>
            <li>and I always go back to My Beauty Diary because they have been the most moisturizing and always have extra essence that I can use on other parts of my body.</li>
            <li>The ones mainly sold in the U.S.A are the English version.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not sure if these are the knock offs, but they worked fabulous on my face.</li>
            <li>The upper lip area is also much smaller than the real one.  </li>
            <li>I never expected to find them at a store in US!</li>
            <li>The mask felt wayyyy more comfortable than the fake one, it wasn&#x27;t sliding down.</li>
            <li>Definitely a brightening effect directly after the mask was on.</li>
            <li>works not bad as usual...</li>
            <li>Thirdly, Summer is coming, purpose of buying this was just to relieve UV from sunshine with no expectation of completely change my skin color, however, does it really work like any other ppl&#x27;s reviews?</li>
            <li>when I use this mask at night I don&#x27;t really put on anything else because it will make my face greasy like all other sheet masks.</li>
            <li>I have tried different brands of these &#x27;tissue masks&#x27; but this one is by far my ultimate favourite!</li>
            <li>Tried one, generally the same but lack some serum in the bag.</li>
            <li>I have severely, dry, sensitive skin, with a lot of acne scars-and eczema...</li>
            <li>Like it says on the other page \\&quot;[New Edition], I thought maybe</li>

            <li> /&gt;The mask won&#x27;t fit perfectly, so I just take sissors and make extra slits where I need them to be, not much of a problem.</li>
            <li> This mask really works!!</li>
            <li> Wow, I love it.</li>
            <li> These mask give you a translucent glow, you will notice a suttle lightening effect but not something drastic but still its worth everyyy peny .&lt;br</li>
            <li> recommended~ its worth to buy</li>
            <li> This product feels safe and I&#x27;ve noticed no side effects so far.</li>
            <li> Your skin will feel soft and smooth after one use!</li>
            <li> I have darker skin and use these masks a couple of times a week right before bed.</li>
            <li> It also makes my skin vibrant, hydrated and smooth.</li>
            <li> And my skin felt super super soft after using it.</li>
            <li> After I used it my face so smooth and soft</li>
            <li> My skin was so soft and smooth after using it...and it diffinatly whitened my skin.</li>
            <li> Love them and I will definitely be buying them again.</li>
            <li> I am married to a Taiwanese and visit Taiwan every year.</li>
            <li> My skin improved a lot after the first try.</li>
            <li> I can see a visible difference after the first use.</li>
            <li> First, I haven&#x27;t use it yet.</li>
            <li> My acne scars already look so much lighter and it soothed my eczema!</li>
            <li> This has definitely earned the privilege to be part of my beauty regime. :)</li>
            <li> The wrinkles are coming... and more white hair.</li>
            <li> I lightened up after the first use.</li>
            <li> But, if you would fit into this, it would be perfect and recommended for you, however, if you&#x27;re like me and you have a small face, it might cause ya trouble too.</li>
            <li> Anyway, u may use some products to make up  the rest of 10% to make u look better as long as u don&#x27;t let ur skin exposed under sunlight all the day.</li>
            <li> (so the product I believe are probably more geared towards asian skin types), I highly recommend buying this product even if you are not asian!!!!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to use, moisturizes, and whitens your skin--BUT, only temporarily (as in 1 day...</li>
            <li> Within time, I could tell my skin tone has evened out and minimized the large pores apparence.</li>
            <li> I have been using this kind for a little over a year</li>
            <li> I bought this at a Chinese cosmetics store in LA&#x27;s Little Tokyo (much cheaper than on here lol).</li>
            <li> Fast shipping.</li>
            <li> The masks are very moist with product and will stick to your skin without drying out.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t really whiten; however, it does wonders to skin.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t wear makeup, but this really gave my skin that pristine surface, just radiant, advertisement type skin.</li>
            <li> Itâ€˜s very gooooood mask!!!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Used it but cannot see much difference in the brightness part .I</li>
            <li> The produce date is 2012, but the mask is very moisture.</li>
            <li> Even if they don&#x27;t do much for the age spots/melasma, they&#x27;re very hydrating and soothing</li>
            <li> I have not noticed the lightening affect but it does moisturize very well.</li>
            <li> This is a brand that does the job with a reasonable price.  </li>
            <li> they make fakes of these, and I didn&#x27;t notice my face being any whiter after using the whole box.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;ve really helped improve my complexion.</li>
            <li> It also got rid of most of dark spots on my face.</li>
            <li> Secondly, I&#x27;m neither accounting on it to change my skin color nor to make my face super white right after first time I try it.</li>
            <li> I would love to hear what boxes other users got!</li>
            <li> Although they smell exactly the same, this store bought mask had a reasonable face shape which covered my face ear to ear, and also fit on my upper lip spot on!</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it if you are already at you goal shade and just want to maintain it and have a glowy complexion .</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> my skin looks much brighter and it feels so AMAZINGLY soft but firm.&lt;br</li>
            <li> the solution is kind of thick</li>
            <li> It can get messy as the masks are very runny,  but easy to use</li>
            <li> quite obviously the differences are right away noticeable, when compared to the picture from this seller.</li>
            <li> I normal have combination skin and very sensitive.</li>
            <li> Since one of the reviewers told me she got the exact same box as the one in the pic, I am thinking maybe this particular seller is getting the boxes from somewhere</li>
            <li> yeah it could be how the new edition looks.</li>
            <li> These masks do a great job of giving an instant boost to tired looking skin.</li>
            <li> My skin is very soft and supple after using.</li>
            <li> I have VERY sensitive skin and this stuff</li>
            <li> I got a box exact same as this one:</li>
            <li> I will keep you guys posted, but so far, two thumbs up!</li>
            <li> It definitely lightens my face and fades away my discoloration on the certain areas on my face.</li>
            <li> and I can say so far I do see brightening.</li>
            <li> However it did not cause a reaction to my sensitive skin</li>
            <li> REAL one, the difference after using it is BIG!</li>
            <li> I like how it brightens the skin and makes it soft and dewy.  </li>
            <li> During the masking time, I gently massage the facial muscles and let the lotion in the mask soak into the skin.</li>
            <li> and I always go back to My Beauty Diary because they have been the most moisturizing and always have extra essence that I can use on other parts of my body.</li>
            <li> The ones mainly sold in the U.S.A are the English version.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if these are the knock offs, but they worked fabulous on my face.</li>
            <li> The upper lip area is also much smaller than the real one.  </li>
            <li> I never expected to find them at a store in US!</li>
            <li> The mask felt wayyyy more comfortable than the fake one, it wasn&#x27;t sliding down.</li>
            <li> Definitely a brightening effect directly after the mask was on.</li>
            <li> works not bad as usual...</li>
            <li> Thirdly, Summer is coming, purpose of buying this was just to relieve UV from sunshine with no expectation of completely change my skin color, however, does it really work like any other ppl&#x27;s reviews?</li>
            <li> when I use this mask at night I don&#x27;t really put on anything else because it will make my face greasy like all other sheet masks.</li>
            <li> I have tried different brands of these &#x27;tissue masks&#x27; but this one is by far my ultimate favourite!</li>
            <li> Tried one, generally the same but lack some serum in the bag.</li>
            <li> I have severely, dry, sensitive skin, with a lot of acne scars-and eczema...</li>
            <li> Like it says on the other page \\&quot;[New Edition], I thought maybe</li>
            <li> I recently finished my first box using the masks sporadically over the past 6 months, but whenever I used it, my skin would just glow!</li>
            <li> Not sure about how much they lighten spots yet, but time will tell.  </li>
            <li> Although the effects aren&#x27;t long term.</li>
            <li> I would definitely purchase these and any other My Beauty Diary masks over and over again.</li>
            <li> so everything that falls onto your neck will take a while to dry even if you rub it into your skin.</li>
            <li> flaky dry skin)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Helped when my skin was extremely dry and peeling.</li>
            <li> I have only used this a few times but will start using it 2x/week and will update with how I like it used regularly</li>
            <li> And it occurred to me, the differences were not just limited to what language the instructions were in or how the box looks.</li>
            <li> After getting rid of a pimple, put this on, the next day your pimple redness will have gone down by 50%,</li>
            <li> Real was oval, and fake was big squares.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> &quot; I did a Google search on them and not much turned up about them.&lt;br</li>
            <li> These masks definitely helped with my skin coloration and uneven skin tone.  </li>
            <li> Not much difference in the hyperpigmented spots, but</li>
            <li> This is only to make your skin brighter, make acne scars, dark spots and freckles less noticeable.*******&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> For starters, this mask is soooooooo big, you cannot relax while having this mask on if your face is small.</li>
            <li> And it also didnt moisturize my face like it did for other reviewers.</li>
            <li> I am purchasing this again along with some other masks to try out.</li>
            <li> Really dark, which I have no real problem with.</li>
            <li> On the other and, if you are really dark and want to be lighter dont buy these because you are not gonna obtain the result that you want .</li>
            <li> The fake mask is way longer than the real one.</li>
            <li> and they themselves don&#x27;t know which ones are real and fake.</li>
            <li> it reduces dark spots.</li>
            <li> I am dark.</li>
            <li> The fake one was also very runny and would keep sliding down my face.</li>
            <li> The facial openings are slightly off from mines which makes it really hard to keep on.</li>
            <li> Other masks are over priced and don&#x27;t work as well!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m thinking of trying the black pearl mask from this brand, hopefully that will work out instead.</li>
            <li> i like the product, it has a slight scent.</li>
            <li> I stock up on these masks as well as the Black Pearl Mask overtime</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve noticed that my skin looks brighter and the acne scars are less pronounced.</li>
            <li> Also my box had a little rectangular sticker on it that said distributed by \\&quot;Fashion City Int&#x27;l</li>
            <li> Little tip</li>
            <li> My skin is still dark, but luminous!</li>
            <li> The other one (which I am now going to call fake) would not reach all the way to my ears, and my upper lip area would come down to my chin.</li>
            <li> I use a few arbutin products in my skincare regimen, and this is one.</li>
            <li> /&gt;For those who say they are fake, this is complete bologna.</li>
            <li> I am out all day with makeup in harsh TX heat.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m not sure on the long-term benefits</li>
            <li> This makes me break out :/  </li>
            <li> And whenever I applied the \\&quot;fake mask\\&quot; before, my face would itch afterwards, feel sticky, and I also got small pimples in different parts of my face.</li>
            <li> I buy a box of these once a month for the past three months now.</li>
            <li> I am not sure if it made my face whiter</li>
            <li> In the summer, the sun used to give me a coppery glow, but now I turn darker, but not a nice darker.</li>
            <li> Not a good look.</li>
            <li> I am considering buying another box to counteract anticipated sleep deprivation--even if I was tired, this mask by virtue of glowing skin, made me look alert.</li>
            <li> and you look a bit freakish and scary while wearing it, so</li>
            <li> * Sorry for my spelling</li>
            <li> Do not interrupt this wrong.</li>
            <li> so the face tan I accumulated over the years looked really weird in the mirror when compared to my body.</li>
            <li> I tend to look muddy and ashen.</li>
            <li> I decided to try the mask even though I was skeptical.</li>
            <li> could be fake.</li>
            <li> you might say I have the worst of the skin gene pool.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Perfect to cool off with on a hot summer weather or after a stressful day at work. Keeps my face moisturized and cool. Ps (I keep mine In the refrigerator)</li>
            <li> It is an awesome price !!!!I love the mask ...it is relaxing and refreshing ...my face looks brighter&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not sure on the long-term benefits&lt;br /&gt;but I would even use this product for temporary benefits&lt;br /&gt;They are an awesome quality ...!!!</li>
            <li> After getting rid of a pimple, put this on, the next day your pimple redness will have gone down by 50%, when I use this mask at night I don&#x27;t really put on anything else because it will make my face greasy like all other sheet masks.</li>
            <li> Hey everyone,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I&#x27;m on my third use of the mask and I can say so far I do see brightening. I&#x27;m actually writing this review as I&#x27;m wearing the mask for the third time. I am using this mask in combo with the Maxi-Peel soap and today as I looked into the mirror I was like YO! my skin looks brighter, awesome! I&#x27;ll continue to use and see how well it goes. I am using the mask twice preserving the product in a plastic bag for a day then using again. I plan to review again upon completion of this pack.</li>
            <li> This definitely brightens your face but it&#x27;s temporary. The next day, it&#x27;s back to what you had before applying it on. For starters, this mask is soooooooo big, you cannot relax while having this mask on if your face is small. It slips and falls and makes it&#x27;s way into your mouth...and dripsss :3 the solution is kind of thick so everything that falls onto your neck will take a while to dry even if you rub it into your skin. The facial openings are slightly off from mines which makes it really hard to keep on. But, if you would fit into this, it would be perfect and recommended for you, however, if you&#x27;re like me and you have a small face, it might cause ya trouble too. &amp;#60;3</li>
            <li> Fast shipping. Product is good. My skin looked hydrated after use. It can get messy as the masks are very runny,  but easy to use and you look a bit freakish and scary while wearing it, so added bonus of a good scare for the kids. Muaahhh ha ha ha</li>
            <li> After I used it my face so smooth and soft</li>
            <li> These sheet masks are a great value. I have some hyperpigmentation, and using one mask did lighten, brighten, and hydrate my skin. The masks are very moist with product and will stick to your skin without drying out. Can&#x27;t beat it.</li>
            <li> This product was a gift. It didn&#x27;t really whiten; however, it does wonders to skin. I have good skin, but I saw a difference. Your skin becomes smooth, poreless, bright. It&#x27;s lovely. I don&#x27;t wear makeup, but this really gave my skin that pristine surface, just radiant, advertisement type skin. I recently finished my first box using the masks sporadically over the past 6 months, but whenever I used it, my skin would just glow! for a day or two. I wore it while I slept, so the mask was admittedly on my face for 6-8hours. I am considering buying another box to counteract anticipated sleep deprivation--even if I was tired, this mask by virtue of glowing skin, made me look alert.</li>
            <li> but as for the brightening part of it, I felt it didn&#x27;t work for me. I&#x27;m thinking of trying the black pearl mask from this brand, hopefully that will work out instead.</li>
            <li> Itâ€˜s very gooooood mask!!!&lt;br /&gt;I for two consecutive nights in use, the skin becomes glossy, moist! Feel really good!!!</li>
            <li> This makes me break out :/  Things about my skin: I have eczema and combination skin.  I got already 3 pimples from this, when I usually only get one or two, once in a while.  It&#x27;s not whitening.</li>
            <li> i like the product, it has a slight scent. nothing to noticeable. great for my skin made it so much clearer and smooth.</li>
            <li> Have not noticed any visable difference.  However it did not cause a reaction to my sensitive skin</li>
            <li> I use a few arbutin products in my skincare regimen, and this is one. I bought this at a Chinese cosmetics store in LA&#x27;s Little Tokyo (much cheaper than on here lol). I love it! My skin is noticeably brighter after applying. I use some of the excess serum and apply it all over my face~</li>
            <li> I like this mask. It&#x27;s easy to use, moisturizes, and whitens your skin--BUT, only temporarily (as in 1 day...the day you use it...)</li>
            <li> I took a chance and thought I would try this. Wow, I love it. My skin was so soft and smooth after using it...and it diffinatly whitened my skin. I will be purchasing again!</li>
            <li> I got a box exact same as this one: [[ASIN:B00ECSN38C Latest Edition My Beauty Diary]]&lt;br /&gt;And quite obviously the differences are right away noticeable, when compared to the picture from this seller. I also asked a question on this page, and there were some who said they received a similar box, except one who said she received a box same as the picture shown. Like it says on the other page \\&quot;[New Edition], I thought maybe yeah it could be how the new edition looks. And decided to ignore it. I was so wrong!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So today I was at a local Asian store and to my surprise I found My Beauty Diary masks boxes there! Yay!! I never expected to find them at a store in US! Anyways they were selling both individual masks and the boxes themselves. So I picked up the individual arbutin mask for $1.59 which btw looks just as it does in the pic for this page. (The packet of the mask I got from here looks nothing like the mask I got from the store today).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After I went home I washed my face opened up the mask and applied. And it occurred to me, the differences were not just limited to what language the instructions were in or how the box looks. The mask itself was different. Although they smell exactly the same, this store bought mask had a reasonable face shape which covered my face ear to ear, and also fit on my upper lip spot on! The other one (which I am now going to call fake) would not reach all the way to my ears, and my upper lip area would come down to my chin. So I was literally having to move that part up there, and adjust the mask around my chin. The fake mask is way longer than the real one. The upper lip area is also much smaller than the real one.  Also the eye shapes were different as well. Real was oval, and fake was big squares.&lt;br /&gt;I compared my masks to this blog post and everything was true for me..online/store bought. [...]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These differences were also ALL true for me. [...]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now moving on to the mask itself. I have acne prone skin. And whenever I applied the \\&quot;fake mask\\&quot; before, my face would itch afterwards, feel sticky, and I also got small pimples in different parts of my face. But I kept thinking maybe its just because I have acne prone skin. The fake one was also very runny and would keep sliding down my face. I used them three times to see if I would see a difference, there was no difference. And it also didnt moisturize my face like it did for other reviewers. (I have flaky dry skin)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The REAL one, the difference after using it is BIG! The mask felt wayyyy more comfortable than the fake one, it wasn&#x27;t sliding down. The serum seemed thicker. It was more proportionate to my face than the fake one. And my skin felt super super soft after using it. No itching either. And it did feel hydrated! I actually just used it 2 hours back so I will update if I still got pimples after using this one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottomline, I wouldn&#x27;t risk buying these masks online again. Since one of the reviewers told me she got the exact same box as the one in the pic, I am thinking maybe this particular seller is getting the boxes from somewhere and they themselves don&#x27;t know which ones are real and fake. Also my box had a little rectangular sticker on it that said distributed by \\&quot;Fashion City Int&#x27;l Corp.\\&quot; I did a Google search on them and not much turned up about them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am going to try my best to get my money back, lets see what happens. I would love to hear what boxes other users got!</li>
            <li> its moisturizing and i like using it when i dont have time but it doesnt do that much more than a cucumber.</li>
            <li> It feels really great on skin and makes it hydrated. It does give me a bit of a lighter look. I have tried different brands of these &#x27;tissue masks&#x27; but this one is by far my ultimate favourite! The price is great for buying 10 pieces! Other masks are over priced and don&#x27;t work as well! This one smells nice, great price, does the job, and also comes in a nice looking box!&lt;br /&gt;The mask won&#x27;t fit perfectly, so I just take sissors and make extra slits where I need them to be, not much of a problem.</li>
            <li> Makes my skin feel pretty good after use. I used it twice and I did see results. I will definitely use from time to time. I say that because during warm weather I do like a healthy light tan.</li>
            <li> These masks definitely helped with my skin coloration and uneven skin tone.  They also smelled great and improved my overall skin quality.  Love them and I will definitely be buying them again.</li>
            <li> Used it but cannot see much difference in the brightness part .I am south Asian might be this is not for my skin type .Moisturizes the skin but the glowing effect is not there .I love the c booth volcanic mud mask it used to make my skin clean ,bright and glowing even after a single use ,but I cannot find that mask anywhere don&#x27;t know why they discontinued it ,still searching for a good mask.</li>
            <li> The produce date is 2012, but the mask is very moisture. Maybe next time the seller need to pay attention to the produce date. Thx</li>
            <li> Leaves my face feeling nice and refreshed. Needed an emergency recovery from raving and this did the trick hehe</li>
            <li> * Sorry for my spelling im french *&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product is absolutely amazing ! I highly recommend it if you are already at you goal shade and just want to maintain it and have a glowy complexion . On the other and, if you are really dark and want to be lighter dont buy these because you are not gonna obtain the result that you want . These mask give you a translucent glow, you will notice a suttle lightening effect but not something drastic but still its worth everyyy peny .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* Little tip * Use these before you go to an event or a special occasion to have an heathy glow like a celibrity&lt;br /&gt;I get so many compliments when i do this&lt;br /&gt;Or&lt;br /&gt;Use it before you go to sleep keep it 1 hour and dont rince your face rub the subtitue on your face like a moisturizer ( do not moisturize after) and go to bed. :)</li>
            <li> good product, my face tune too more white after used, good!</li>
            <li> Love these!!! They&#x27;re soothing and I notice that my skin looks better when I use them.  Not sure about how much they lighten spots yet, but time will tell.  Even if they don&#x27;t do much for the age spots/melasma, they&#x27;re very hydrating and soothing and I&#x27;d repurchase again.</li>
            <li> very smooth and cool mask. I wear it once or twice a week.. it reduces dark spots. I wear the mask at night, leave it in, pat on some moisturizer after. On the next morning, my skin feels great and hydrated</li>
            <li> One of the best moisturizing/whitening masks ever made!!!!&lt;br /&gt;After every time I use this product and I rub the excess moisturizer onto my face, the morning after... I wake up and my skin looks much brighter and it feels so AMAZINGLY soft but firm.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Granted these masks will not work for some skin types and granted I am asian descent (so the product I believe are probably more geared towards asian skin types), I highly recommend buying this product even if you are not asian!!!!&lt;br /&gt;I have friends that tried this face mask that are not asian and they loved it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It makes me feel more confident with myself knowing and seeing that my skin feels and looks better!</li>
            <li> I have tried multiple brands of sheet masks and I always go back to My Beauty Diary because they have been the most moisturizing and always have extra essence that I can use on other parts of my body. The Arbutin Whitening masks leaves my skin moisturized and bright!</li>
            <li> works not bad as usual...</li>
            <li> There are already many helpful reviews available. I buy a box of these once a month for the past three months now. Results and improvement are incredible, you absolutely need these in life!</li>
            <li> ***Attention***&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For those who say they are fake, this is complete bologna. I am married to a Taiwanese and visit Taiwan every year. These masks are from Taiwan and this is the same package that is sold there. There are two versions to &amp;#34;My Beauty Diary,&amp;#34; which is the English version and the one wrote in Chinese. The ones mainly sold in the U.S.A are the English version. I stock up on these masks as well as the Black Pearl Mask overtime I come back but, when I do run out, I buy them from this seller.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Moral of the story: Don&#x27;t believe everything you read!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These really do work, although it requires more than a couple of applications. To see good results, use them 2x a week. I have been using this kind for a little over a year and it took around 1 month to see visible results. I have acne scars (they won&#x27;t heal them) but they will make them almost invisible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;***********Here is another thing that many people do not understand. This is a whitening mask. Do not interrupt this wrong. This is not to bleach your skin! This is only to make your skin brighter, make acne scars, dark spots and freckles less noticeable.*******&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyways, give it a try. :)</li>
            <li> good . makes face comfortable. i &#x27;ll keep using and see if it changes skin tone. recommended~ its worth to buy</li>
            <li> I used to buy Taiwan edition and just saw this kind on Amazon. Tried one, generally the same but lack some serum in the bag.</li>
            <li> I have not noticed the lightening affect but it does moisturize very well. I may order this product again only for the moisturizing and softness it gives to my skin.</li>
            <li> I am not sure if it made my face whiter but it made my face brighter and I don&#x27;t have any break out after using this mask. It&#x27;s good for prone skin.</li>
            <li> Love these masks. My skin is very soft and supple after using. I would definitely purchase these and any other My Beauty Diary masks over and over again.</li>
            <li> I wanted to try this product to see if I could get rid of the tan in my face or possibly reduce the visibility of some hyperpigmented spots. I&#x27;m naturally fair skinned so the face tan I accumulated over the years looked really weird in the mirror when compared to my body. After just a week of use I&#x27;ve already noticed a difference in fading the skin. Not much difference in the hyperpigmented spots, but then again, people with skin like mine already know how stubborn those could be. This product feels safe and I&#x27;ve noticed no side effects so far. This is a wonderful alternative to harsh exfoliation for those people who want to lighten their face. 5/5, I would buy again.</li>
            <li> I have VERY sensitive skin and this stuff just feels great does not irritate. Definitely a brightening effect directly after the mask was on. I have only used this a few times but will start using it 2x/week and will update with how I like it used regularly</li>
            <li> This is a brand that does the job with a reasonable price.  I have been using them for quite some time, every kind of this brand is good.</li>
            <li> Though the results are not permanent I like how it brightens the skin and makes it soft and dewy.  Especially great before a party or after a stressful event!</li>
            <li> It is wonderful! My skin improved a lot after the first try. I love it!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really feel is or experienced whitening on my face with this mask.&lt;br /&gt;but Arbutin makes my face looks healthier.</li>
            <li> I really like this mask because it&#x27;s so refreshing on my face. It doesn&#x27;t irritate my face after using it. It definitely lightens my face and fades away my discoloration on the certain areas on my face. It also makes my skin vibrant, hydrated and smooth. I would highly recommend this product. I will buy this product again...</li>
            <li> This is by far the Best Product ever! I will use it again, i recommend everyone to use it. MUST!</li>
            <li> it from taiwan. i think is so good for my face. and i like to protect my face and make it beautiful. so i suggest you can buy it.</li>
            <li> I am African-American trying to brighten my skintone all over my face. This mask really works!! I can see a visible difference after the first use. I have been using it for 2 weeks now , and I have indeed gotten lighter! Will purchase again.</li>
            <li> First, I haven&#x27;t use it yet. Secondly, I&#x27;m neither accounting on it to change my skin color nor to make my face super white right after first time I try it. I&#x27;m an Asian and I&#x27;m fair among Asian ppl, based on my skin care experience I say one&#x27;s skin color 90% depends on gene. Anyway, u may use some products to make up  the rest of 10% to make u look better as long as u don&#x27;t let ur skin exposed under sunlight all the day. Thirdly, Summer is coming, purpose of buying this was just to relieve UV from sunshine with no expectation of completely change my skin color, however, does it really work like any other ppl&#x27;s reviews? Only time can tell.</li>
            <li> after using this i used it again then noticed I had a rash. Had to make doctors appointment to get rid of what this did to me.</li>
            <li> I love My Beauty Diary!  These masks do a great job of giving an instant boost to tired looking skin.</li>
            <li> Skin looks smooth and refresh. Holes looks smaller after use.</li>
            <li> I have severely, dry, sensitive skin, with a lot of acne scars-and eczema...you might say I have the worst of the skin gene pool. After using this mask my face was so moisturized and smooth! My acne scars already look so much lighter and it soothed my eczema! I LOVE THIS PRODUCT!! This has definitely earned the privilege to be part of my beauty regime. :)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if these are the knock offs, but they worked fabulous on my face. Helped when my skin was extremely dry and peeling. I normal have combination skin and very sensitive. Although the effects aren&#x27;t long term. It did help me get back into my regular skin regimen on the days I don&#x27;t drink enough water or I am out all day with makeup in harsh TX heat. Plus I think I&#x27;ve hit the age where my skin is turning into the middle age dryer skin. The wrinkles are coming... and more white hair. This is definitely a nice little pamper me item and makes me feel beautiful. I am purchasing this again along with some other masks to try out.</li>
            <li> Love this product. Your skin will feel soft and smooth after one use!</li>
            <li> I am dark. Really dark, which I have no real problem with. In the summer, the sun used to give me a coppery glow, but now I turn darker, but not a nice darker. I tend to look muddy and ashen. Not a good look. I decided to try the mask even though I was skeptical. I lightened up after the first use. That was not the good part. The good part is I am glowing! My skin is still dark, but luminous! What a difference!  I also noticed that my blemishes has diminished. I will keep using this product and see what happens. according to the directions, you can use it 2-3 times per week. I will keep you guys posted, but so far, two thumbs up!</li>
            <li> Not my favorite, I like the moisturizing one better!</li>
            <li> could be fake. they make fakes of these, and I didn&#x27;t notice my face being any whiter after using the whole box.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this mask for over 4 months now and loved it. Within time, I could tell my skin tone has evened out and minimized the large pores apparence. It also got rid of most of dark spots on my face. I applied this mask twice a week and leave it on my face about 30 minutes every time. During the masking time, I gently massage the facial muscles and let the lotion in the mask soak into the skin. It is like spa time at home.</li>
            <li> I have darker skin and use these masks a couple of times a week right before bed. They&#x27;ve really helped improve my complexion. I&#x27;ve noticed that my skin looks brighter and the acne scars are less pronounced. The best thing about these masks is that they smell really good! I plan on buying another box.</li>
            <li> These are soooo effective. Used 2-3 times a week, they keep my face looking bright and keep my freckles in check (along with sunblock, of course). I used a mask on the night before attending a wedding, and all of my girl cousins wanted to know what I was using. If I do a gentle peel beforehand, this works even better.</li>
            <li> The packaging is nice, but these masks really do nothing for your skin.</li>
