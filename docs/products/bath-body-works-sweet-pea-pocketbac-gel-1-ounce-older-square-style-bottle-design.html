            <li> I love sugar and Figure Pleasures fragrance is that it smells so clean and every time I get someone says something about how good it smells. I could not find in stores because they only take her on holidays or something so I had to have it because I ran out of my other and I was not going to wait until they got in store. I even asked for my best friend always asked about it. OH! fast delivery and very satisfied!</li>

            <li> I haven&#x27;t got the one from BBW so I&#x27;m not 100% but I&#x27;m pretty sure this is fake. It just smells like soap, not Sweet Pea but it&#x27;s still a good hand sanitizer. The smell is too strong though</li>
            <li> Smells great, and it does the trick, wonderful product. I carry it on my bag all day as I spend so many hours outside my house.</li>
            <li> Sweet Pea from Bath Body Works is one of my wife&#x27;s favorite aromas.  This scent isn&#x27;t overpowering and it provides a soft, floral aroma.  My wife likes to use this anti-bacterial product everyday, so she leaves in next to the kitchen sink.  She also carries one in her mail car to use in case of any emergency while on her postal route.  This is definitely one of our favorite cleansers.</li>

            <li> Love the smell of this one!  I always keep one attached to my pocketbook and so glad I found this fragrance.  It is not over powering&lt;br /&gt;like some smells - just the right amount of scent.</li>
            <li> Smells good. Really girly. The thing that bothers me is it seems very cheap, but when shipping and handeling is added, the price becomes 5 dollars. NOT WORTH IT FOR FIVE DOLLARS.</li>
