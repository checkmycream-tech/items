            <li>Love Elf make-up.</li>
            <li>I love this eyebrow kit.</li>
            <li>I love that it comes with a wax-based product and a powder.</li>
            <li>This is the best eyebrow filling product I&#x27;ve found so far, and the brush that comes with it makes more precise lines than some of my $15+ sephora brushes.  </li>
            <li>Would recommend :)</li>
            <li>The product goes on smoothly and has a nice finish.</li>
            <li>and is very cost effective!</li>
            <li>So satisfied received my product fast good quality</li>
            <li>Fills in sparse eyebrows very well and is a good price.</li>
            <li>Product applies easily and wears well.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried so many different products to get my brows to look great.  </li>
            <li>It was so easy</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t use the powder as much and find the wax much more handy.</li>
            <li>I have medium dark brown hair and the light matches perfect.</li>
            <li>Even though it looks ash toned in the package, when it&#x27;s in my brows it works just fine for auburn hair.</li>
            <li>I had to get the light kit.</li>
            <li>Cheap</li>
            <li>and, as a bonus, if you contour your nose the powder is fantastic for that if you&#x27;re fair-skinned like myself.</li>
            <li>the product says light</li>
            <li>I use the darker color on the light set, and I&#x27;d consider my eyebrow color to be medium-brown.</li>
            <li>I use both the gel and powder with a stiff angled brush to get the perfect brows.</li>
            <li>a full size angle brush I used this and was amazed how easy it was.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not sure it&#x27;s the best</li>
            <li>(powder concealer) to make is look more blonde (kind of balances it out).</li>
            <li>The applicator brush gets wily pretty quickly, so I&#x27;d recommend replacing with a better one.</li>
            <li>Quick delivery.</li>
            <li>Quick to apply.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product, my brows look so good and very natural.  </li>
            <li>when I first got it and saw how lightly the cream went on I was like &amp;#34;nah, not happening&amp;#34;, but I tried it.</li>
            <li>great product, just what i needed to define slightly graying brows.  </li>
            <li>Worth the money.  </li>
            <li>Just switched over to using this instead of the maybelline eyebrow pencils which are MUCH more expensive and don&#x27;t work nearly as good as this!</li>
            <li>this hit that right on the mark.</li>
            <li>the cream definitely looks a bit too translucent at first swatch, but once you set it with the lighter powder, it&#x27;s AMAZING.</li>
            <li>I have light brown hair, or dark blonde, and quite fair skin and blue eyes, and it was a good color for me.  </li>
            <li>This colored wax and powder with a double sided brush is much better than any of them, and so much cheaper too!</li>
            <li>After trying for many different products (i.e., pencils, powders, etc.)</li>
            <li>Thanks E.L.F.!</li>
            <li>love it being vegan and low price</li>
            <li>I bought the light, but I need to use a soft touch as it can get darker than I want.</li>
            <li>Actually really like it!</li>
            <li>Does a great job of darkening pale eyebrows on pale skin without looking unnatural and is very comfortable to wear.</li>
            <li>Not too dark or too light for my light skin and hair.  </li>
            <li>You honestly don&#x27;t need so much wax to get a dark and defined eyebrow!</li>
            <li>And the color did not blend well into my brow its really sticky, makes me oily...</li>
            <li>This particular shade does really well for brunettes and even blondes.</li>
            <li>I bought a darker kit when my hair was dark brown and loved it, so when I went red</li>
            <li>I love that there are different colors because all eyebrows are not created equally.</li>
            <li>you might have to reapply a little bit more.</li>
            <li>I do my eyebrows (blonde) with this BROWN eyebrow kit (very brown even though I ordered &amp;#34;light&amp;#34;) Then, I use &amp;#34;Eye C</li>
            <li>Elf has a few products that, as a self-proclaimed makeup artist, I absolutely love.</li>
            <li>Not too dark and not too light</li>
            <li>Someone asked me if had them professionally done!</li>
            <li>wow.</li>
            <li>Nothing looked natural.  </li>
            <li>Works great,looks natural.</li>
            <li>It looks natural.  </li>
            <li>Not dark but shaped.</li>
            <li>easy to apply, lasts during my 12 hour hospital shifts (which hardly anything lasts me).</li>
            <li>picture also doesn&#x27;t give the make up case any justice, I was surprised at the overall quality when it arrived.</li>
            <li>The wax clumps, but as long as you have a few q tips on hand, you&#x27;re golden!</li>
            <li>Not only is it long wearing, but very natural looking.  </li>

            <li> Not only is it long wearing, but very natural looking.  </li>
            <li> It seems like it will last a long time too.</li>
            <li> I shave off the outer half of my eyebrow because I don&#x27;t have the time or energy to tweeze, and I don&#x27;t like my natural arch.</li>
            <li> it is too loose and flimsy</li>
            <li> Cheaply made, way too dark even though it&#x27;s called &amp;#34;light.&amp;#34; Difficult to apply the powder pay without it getting everywhere.</li>
            <li> but it is a lot darker that expected</li>
            <li> and I have pale skin w/ blue eyes).</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried a couple of other products, like Nyx brow duos and even Anastasia Beverly Hills&#x27;s Dipbrow.  </li>
            <li> Have bought other brow kits and this one</li>
            <li> Item was hard to find locally, so I ordered from Am..</li>
            <li> it was dark .</li>
            <li> It tends to run dark, though.</li>
            <li> Wish there was even a lighter in color version, as the wax part is still too dark.</li>
            <li> The wax side holds down unruly hairs also.</li>
            <li> I have tried other types of eyebrow makeup, both a plain powder and transparent wax or mascara-like brush.</li>
            <li> Read my full review on Jennbizzle.com: [...]</li>
            <li> The pale powder can also be combined with a little Vaseline on a small brush for an even subtler effect or just to hold your eyebrows in place.</li>
            <li> This product stays on well so very little touch up is needed throughout the day.  </li>
            <li> Waste of money!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used the very expensive gels to the inexpensive drugstore pencils.  </li>
            <li> Not for blondes :(</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Nice product. Quick delivery.</li>
            <li> I am using my husbands account. I use this all the time. I have medium dark brown hair and the light matches perfect. I&#x27;m not sure it&#x27;s the best but for the price it is great. You just have to appl with a lioght hand and build it up.</li>
            <li> I love this product! I bought a darker kit when my hair was dark brown and loved it, so when I went red I had to get the light kit. Even though it looks ash toned in the package, when it&#x27;s in my brows it works just fine for auburn hair. I have tried other types of eyebrow makeup, both a plain powder and transparent wax or mascara-like brush. This colored wax and powder with a double sided brush is much better than any of them, and so much cheaper too! I recommend this to everyone, and I love using it myself.</li>
            <li> Love this. Very similar to Benefit product for a fraction of the cost. Will need to use a different brow brush than the one supplied.</li>
            <li> Fills in sparse eyebrows very well and is a good price. The wax side holds down unruly hairs also. I&#x27;ve pusrchased two different products from E.L.F. and I&#x27;m thinking this may be is a good company I can depend on.  I&#x27;ll be buying more.</li>
            <li> The color did not match</li>
            <li> Finally found an inexpensive eyebrow product that works well... Had to use another brush, though, as the one that comes with it is too loose and flimsy</li>
            <li> No lasting power. And the color did not blend well into my brow its really sticky, makes me oily...just no.</li>
            <li> Waste of money! Cheap and I know why</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used more expensive kits and the only difference is brush; thus the 4-stars.  Product applies easily and wears well.</li>
            <li> when I first got it and saw how lightly the cream went on I was like &amp;#34;nah, not happening&amp;#34;, but I tried it. and. wow. I shave off the outer half of my eyebrow because I don&#x27;t have the time or energy to tweeze, and I don&#x27;t like my natural arch. so I need something opaque, but not overpowering. this hit that right on the mark. the cream definitely looks a bit too translucent at first swatch, but once you set it with the lighter powder, it&#x27;s AMAZING. and, as a bonus, if you contour your nose the powder is fantastic for that if you&#x27;re fair-skinned like myself.</li>
            <li> This is the best eyebrow fill in wax ever. The powder makes it darker and they feel nice and look nice. I&#x27;ve used it twice and I already love it. You honestly don&#x27;t need so much wax to get a dark and defined eyebrow! Totally recommend</li>
            <li> Not for blondes :( I invested in this so I found a way for it to (kind of) work. I do my eyebrows (blonde) with this BROWN eyebrow kit (very brown even though I ordered &amp;#34;light&amp;#34;) Then, I use &amp;#34;Eye C The Light Fair Under Eye Concealer Larenim Mineral Makeup&amp;#34; (powder concealer) to make is look more blonde (kind of balances it out). I don&#x27;t use the powder as much and find the wax much more handy. However, I do occasionally use the powder to outline the eyebrow shape.</li>
            <li> Love this kit!!  I&#x27;ve tried so many different products to get my brows to look great.  I&#x27;ve used the very expensive gels to the inexpensive drugstore pencils.  Nothing looked natural.  I highly recommend this product, my brows look so good and very natural.  This particular shade does really well for brunettes and even blondes. This product stays on well so very little touch up is needed throughout the day.  I use a different brush from one of my more expensive make-up kits so I would recommend using a bigger brush.  Great job, E.L.F.</li>
            <li> Love Elf make-up. This is one of my favorites from them.</li>
            <li> I have been using this eyebrow kit for years. Elf has a few products that, as a self-proclaimed makeup artist, I absolutely love. This is one of them. I use both the gel and powder with a stiff angled brush to get the perfect brows.</li>
            <li> After trying for many different products (i.e., pencils, powders, etc.) I tried E.L.F.&#x27;s Eyebrow Kit.  Not only is it long wearing, but very natural looking.  Thanks E.L.F.!</li>
            <li> I love this eyebrow kit. I love that it comes with a wax-based product and a powder. I love that there are different colors because all eyebrows are not created equally. Read my full review on Jennbizzle.com: [...]</li>
            <li> Cheaply made, way too dark even though it&#x27;s called &amp;#34;light.&amp;#34; Difficult to apply the powder pay without it getting everywhere.</li>
            <li> Bought this on the recommendation of my daughter when letting my eyebrows grow in after years of overthinning. Works great,looks natural. Item was hard to find locally, so I ordered from Am..my go to place when I can&#x27;t buy locally.</li>
            <li> the product says light but it is a lot darker that expected</li>
            <li> Love it ! It&#x27;s a great product even though light was actually light for me despite reading it was dark . Will still use it</li>
            <li> I seriously love this stuff! It was inexpensive, is easy to apply, matches my eyebrows perfectly (my hair is light blond and I have pale skin w/ blue eyes). It seems like it will last a long time too. Great purchase.</li>
            <li> best eye brows for the price!</li>
            <li> Perfect color for blondes. Not too dark and not too light</li>
            <li> honestly, i really liked this. i got exactly what i payed for and i&#x27;m really happy about that. i would recommend it to a friend.</li>
            <li> love it being vegan and low price</li>
            <li> I have never tried to do anything to my eyebrows before. They have started thinning so I thought i would try something.&lt;br /&gt;With a full size angle brush I used this and was amazed how easy it was. The gel shapes the brows and the powder adds extra color. It was so easy and they look amazing. Not dark but shaped. Someone asked me if had them professionally done!</li>
            <li> great product, just what i needed to define slightly graying brows.  would reccomend to a friend!!</li>
            <li> Love this elf powder brow!</li>
            <li> easy to apply, lasts during my 12 hour hospital shifts (which hardly anything lasts me). and is very cost effective!</li>
            <li> This is a great product for the price. The applicator brush gets wily pretty quickly, so I&#x27;d recommend replacing with a better one. It tends to run dark, though. I use the darker color on the light set, and I&#x27;d consider my eyebrow color to be medium-brown.</li>
            <li> This is the best eyebrow filling product I&#x27;ve found so far, and the brush that comes with it makes more precise lines than some of my $15+ sephora brushes.  I&#x27;ve tried a couple of other products, like Nyx brow duos and even Anastasia Beverly Hills&#x27;s Dipbrow.  I prefer this product and its accompanying applicator over both of those products.</li>
            <li> Color for my brows is &amp;#34;right on&amp;#34;.  Have bought other brow kits and this one I will definitely buy again.</li>
            <li> Does a great job of darkening pale eyebrows on pale skin without looking unnatural and is very comfortable to wear. The brush and case are functional and of nice quality. The pale powder can also be combined with a little Vaseline on a small brush for an even subtler effect or just to hold your eyebrows in place. Would recommend :)</li>
            <li> I bought the light, but I need to use a soft touch as it can get darker than I want. Wish there was even a lighter in color version, as the wax part is still too dark. Still like the results and it lasts all day..</li>
            <li> This is a great product for light eyebrows. The product goes on smoothly and has a nice finish. It stays on all day too.The brush is perfect too.</li>
            <li> I am very impressed with this kit. Just what I was looking for to give me the eyebrows i needed.</li>
            <li> Just switched over to using this instead of the maybelline eyebrow pencils which are MUCH more expensive and don&#x27;t work nearly as good as this! I&#x27;ll definitely be switching to using E.L.F from now on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The picture also doesn&#x27;t give the make up case any justice, I was surprised at the overall quality when it arrived.</li>
            <li> So satisfied received my product fast good quality</li>
            <li> This is a good product if you have thinning or overplucked eyebrows.  It looks natural.  I have light brown hair, or dark blonde, and quite fair skin and blue eyes, and it was a good color for me.  Not too dark or too light for my light skin and hair.  Quick to apply.  Inexpensive.  Worth the money.  Normally stays on all day although by night time if you want it to look perfect you might have to reapply a little bit more.</li>
            <li> I use it daily on my eyebrows. It matches perfectly and looks natural. Great price and easy to put on and match my eyebrows.</li>
            <li> Actually really like it! Very happy with my results.</li>
            <li> The wax clumps, but as long as you have a few q tips on hand, you&#x27;re golden!</li>
