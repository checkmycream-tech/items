            <li>she liked it and it did not give her any problems</li>
            <li>Its a really nice cream.  </li>
            <li>Did not work for me; but then again may work for darkened acne spots that eventually go away on their own anyway.  </li>
            <li>Either way it is certainly a nice moisture cream.</li>
            <li>and the bonus was nice also.</li>
            <li>He is a nice looking boy who has a problem with acne and scarring.  </li>
            <li>Proactiv really is effective at fading the scarring.</li>
            <li>Proactive has worked for me :)</li>
            <li>but it made my already oily face even more greasy</li>
            <li>the order arrived ontime and with a free gift which is always nice.</li>
            <li>Nice, fresh smell.</li>
            <li>and i even got a free gift ..</li>
            <li>So good so far with his skin.</li>
            <li>this stuff really does work !!!</li>
            <li>I dont see a significant change in my skin</li>
            <li>I have used this product for a few months and I have to say that it&#x27;s great</li>
            <li>so i started to use it right away ..</li>
            <li>It may not be the product, perhaps I should have consulted a dermatologist first.</li>
            <li>I really don&#x27;t think this is worth buying..</li>
            <li>This stuff really works!</li>
            <li>At first I was very livid</li>
            <li>The spots are not completely gone yet but you can&#x27;t hardly see them which is good for me because i thought that would never get rid of those spots because you were able to see them even with makeup.</li>
            <li>really wanted to know if this stuff would work or not..</li>
            <li>this stuff really helped ...</li>
            <li>&quot; thanks so much</li>
            <li>This product didn&#x27;t really work for me.  </li>
            <li>Works very well.  </li>
            <li>Once I got the package I was very content</li>
            <li>I really like this.</li>
            <li>at first i thought this would not work as well as advertised, however after only one month of use i can see a huge difference in my skin and  the old acne and sun spots.</li>
            <li>I tried another product which was much more expensive and much less effective.</li>
            <li>It was super strong with a real strong awful smell.  </li>
            <li>I have been using this product for about 3 weeks so far and starting to really see a difference.</li>
            <li>leaves skin soft.</li>
            <li>At my age(68)I don&#x27;t expect complete clearing of my skin.</li>
            <li>I use this product on top of my moisturizer at night, I apply a very generous layer over each dark area (cover the spot with enough lotion that only the white lotion is seen) and just let it dry before I head to bed.</li>
            <li>This product, used as directed, actually does reduce the facial scars of time and too much sun.</li>
            <li>I actually got two free gifts refining mask and a bonus of the green tea moisturizer</li>
            <li>There is a very marked improvement in overall skin tone and reduction of aging liver spots.&lt;br /&gt;___DrC</li>
            <li>funny, still have dark spots after using every day for three months.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using it for a little less than 2 weeks and have already seen significant improvement!</li>
            <li>it has really worked on some very dark spots i had after i had my baby.</li>

            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for a little less than 2 weeks and have already seen significant improvement!</li>
            <li> it has really worked on some very dark spots i had after i had my baby.</li>
            <li> As far as removing or lightening dark spots thats open for debate.</li>
            <li> but I was not happy because now I was going to get more dark spots on my so</li>
            <li> Goes on smoothly and makes me feel like I&#x27;m slowly lightening my dark spots for sun,age and acne scars.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t seem to be working as well as the same stuff I got directly from proactive previously.</li>
            <li> Tried it, no major improvement.  </li>
            <li> but it does fade after the lotion is dry.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t dry skin.</li>
            <li> Maybe I didn&#x27;t use it long enough, but I did use it twice a day for around 30 days and did not see any difference in my dark spots.</li>
            <li> If your dark spots are from simple aging;  I didnt see that help</li>
            <li> and then it caused a little break out on my chin wasn&#x27;t a big one</li>
            <li> Wish the bottle was a little bit bigger though.</li>
            <li> I noticed obvious lightening of age spots within a few weeks.  </li>
            <li> I get small white bumps on my face.</li>

            <li> I gave it a 4 star rating because it did work for my mom and it does lighten dark spot  </li>
            <li> No side effects noted, and the product absorbs quickly without unpleasant residue.  </li>
            <li> On my second tube results are not good as of now.not removing age spots</li>
            <li> The smell is pretty bad</li>
            <li> i have been using it for the past few weeks</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been breaking out a lot lately, and the worst part is the super dark scars that never seem to fade.</li>
            <li> I do recomend it or at least give it a try.</li>
            <li> Hydroquinone is a dangerous chemical and it can cause skin cancer, and make your skin worse off than it was before, i&#x27;ve used this product and it is not safe, NEVER</li>
            <li> Must be using it wrong, you think.</li>
            <li> i had really bad sun spots and acne marks ..</li>

            <li> I tried another product which was much more expensive and much less effective. This product, used as directed, actually does reduce the facial scars of time and too much sun. There is a very marked improvement in overall skin tone and reduction of aging liver spots.&lt;br /&gt;___DrC</li>
            <li> I have used this product for a few months and I have to say that it&#x27;s great it has really worked on some very dark spots i had after i had my baby. The spots are not completely gone yet but you can&#x27;t hardly see them which is good for me because i thought that would never get rid of those spots because you were able to see them even with makeup. I do recomend it or at least give it a try. Proactive has worked for me :)</li>
            <li> at first i thought this would not work as well as advertised, however after only one month of use i can see a huge difference in my skin and  the old acne and sun spots. i would buy this item again. gets 5 stars from me</li>
            <li> this stuff really does work !!! i got it from the seller \\&quot;OUR SHOP\\&quot; and received it in 1 day !! so i started to use it right away .. really wanted to know if this stuff would work or not.. i was debating on buying clenique and so glad i got this instead !! i have been using it for the past few weeks and i am so happy with the results .. i had really bad sun spots and acne marks .. this stuff really helped ... the seller was so great and i even got a free gift .. so i will def buy this stuff again and def from \\&quot;OUR SHOP\\&quot; thanks so much</li>
            <li> very good product. and have gotten the results its intended for as describe and acclaimed. i would recommend this product to anyone</li>
            <li> On my second tube results are not good as of now.not removing age spots like I thought nor the others spots from pimples.</li>
            <li> Proactiv is not working for me. Everytime I use it I get small white bumps on my face. I am very disappointed because I thought this would help.</li>
            <li> This product didn&#x27;t really work for me.  It was super strong with a real strong awful smell.  Skin looked darker afterward!</li>
            <li> Works very well.  I noticed obvious lightening of age spots within a few weeks.  No side effects noted, and the product absorbs quickly without unpleasant residue.  DO NOT BUY THE EQUATE GENERIC BRAND--THAT IS LIKE TOOTHPASTE!</li>
            <li> This is the best place to buy this.  Proactiv requires a membership to purchase anything from their website.  Do the math it is cheaper even if it has a discount on proactiv.com.</li>
            <li> Hydroquinone is a dangerous chemical and it can cause skin cancer, and make your skin worse off than it was before, i&#x27;ve used this product and it is not safe, NEVER EVER USE PRODUCTS WITH Hydroquinone! Or other harmful ingredients.</li>
            <li> I have been using the product twice a day for 4 weeks.  I was expecting to see an improvement in 4 weeks. It may not be the product, perhaps I should have consulted a dermatologist first.</li>
            <li> this product is nice but dont let the caption fool you,, there is NO GIFT WITH THIS ORDER</li>
            <li> At first I was very livid bc I thought I wasn&#x27;t going to receive the product. Once I got the package I was very content I actually got two free gifts refining mask and a bonus of the green tea moisturizer awesome</li>
            <li> So I used this for about 2 months now...I&#x27;ve seen only teeny tiny improvment.....and I think it even made me break out.....I&#x27;ve tried it on dark spots AND acne scars....I really don&#x27;t think this is worth buying..</li>
            <li> I bought this product because i thought it had different ingredients than the in store brands, but it doesn&#x27;t. You can pay well&lt;br /&gt;less in the store for same ingredients.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been breaking out a lot lately, and the worst part is the super dark scars that never seem to fade. I use this product on top of my moisturizer at night, I apply a very generous layer over each dark area (cover the spot with enough lotion that only the white lotion is seen) and just let it dry before I head to bed. I&#x27;ve been using it for a little less than 2 weeks and have already seen significant improvement! The smell is pretty bad but it does fade after the lotion is dry.</li>
            <li> I have used this before and loved it. Begins correcting blemishes on about two weeks. Nice, fresh smell. Doesn&#x27;t dry skin.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t seem to be working as well as the same stuff I got directly from proactive previously.</li>
            <li> funny, still have dark spots after using every day for three months. Must be using it wrong, you think.</li>
            <li> This stuff really works!</li>
            <li> Tried it, no major improvement.  All my marks are still here.  Over advertised, over hyped.  Does not work as advertised.</li>
            <li> I dont see a significant change in my skin so I am not that ecstatic that this will work but only time will tell.</li>
            <li> I bought this back in January and then I bought it in March and it did help lighten up the dark spot that were cause form acne but it made my already oily face even more greasy and then it caused a little break out on my chin wasn&#x27;t a big one but I was not happy because now I was going to get more dark spots on my so I stopped using it in May and gave it to my mom.  My mother used it and it helped her a lot,  she liked it and it did not give her any problems and it did brighten her skin tone. I gave it a 4 star rating because it did work for my mom and it does lighten dark spot  just don&#x27;t like how greasy it made my face.</li>
            <li> proactive is the only product for my skin. the order arrived ontime and with a free gift which is always nice. I never have any problems when ordering through amazon.</li>
            <li> Its a really nice cream.  leaves skin soft. As far as removing or lightening dark spots thats open for debate. Did not work for me; but then again may work for darkened acne spots that eventually go away on their own anyway.  If your dark spots are from simple aging;  I didnt see that help but then again its open for debate I guess. May work for some. Either way it is certainly a nice moisture cream.</li>
            <li> He likes the product. So good so far with his skin. A good product. Wish the bottle was a little bit bigger though.</li>
            <li> Goes on smoothly and makes me feel like I&#x27;m slowly lightening my dark spots for sun,age and acne scars.At my age(68)I don&#x27;t expect complete clearing of my skin.They have definately lightened and hopefully will continue for a clearer look.But even if they don&#x27;t I like the results.</li>
            <li> I really like this. I put it on my hands and the spots fadded.</li>
            <li> Maybe I didn&#x27;t use it long enough, but I did use it twice a day for around 30 days and did not see any difference in my dark spots.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for about 3 weeks so far and starting to really see a difference. I was hesitant before buying it since I had only read reviews about it and not actually knew anyone who used it. I would say give it a try!</li>
            <li> This is just what I needed to fade some of the age spots on my face. and the bonus was nice also.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my 16-year-old son. He is a nice looking boy who has a problem with acne and scarring.  Proactiv really is effective at fading the scarring.</li>
