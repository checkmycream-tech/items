            <li>Not hard or sticky as most curly hair products tend to be.</li>
            <li>Far better experience than we’ve had in a while.  </li>
            <li>recieved a complimentary product to review.</li>
            <li>I received a complimentary jar of this cream from the seller to review on my blog and give a YouTube how-to on.</li>
            <li>I used this on all three of my lil girls hair, they have a nice mixed texture.</li>
            <li>So overall it is a nice product.</li>
            <li>I love that it lets their hair be natural with bouncy curls!&lt;br</li>
            <li>I was not compensated for my review and all my opinions are my own, based on my personal experience with the product.</li>
            <li>I was not compensated for my review and all my opinions are my own, based on my personal experience with the product.</li>
            <li>My whole family has fallen in love with this product and highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>With some products I have tried, we have tears right away, but this was not the case with Bouncy Curls.</li>
            <li>This prodcut contains alcohol therefore, making my hair feel kind of dry.</li>
            <li>Made my hair super soft!!!  </li>
            <li>For several years I have struggled with many hair products for my daughters beautiful, curly but coarse very long hair.</li>
            <li>Definitely will buy more for my daughter and niece</li>
            <li>It took me no time at all to comb through their hair and it left the hair moisturized and frizz free!</li>
            <li>[[VIDEOID:604e304f35d596a86016e88613f9cb0f]] I was excited to try Bouncy Curls Anti-Frizz Natural Hair Moisturizer by The Roots Naturelle Bouncy Curls.  </li>
            <li>Love it so much, I&#x27;m ordering my second jar.  </li>
            <li>Love that it leaves my natural curls soft to the touch.</li>
            <li>I was very surprised at how quickly the item arrived.</li>
            <li>We have four natural heads of hair with all textures covered, this stuff didn&#x27;t do anything special for any of us.</li>
            <li>Thanks so much!</li>
            <li>I used too much the first time I applied</li>
            <li>This works even better on dry hair, in my opinion.</li>
            <li>It added and retained even more moisture to my already dry (not washed) hair.</li>
            <li>I have a lot of hair with kinky curl, but it has fine, individual strands.</li>
            <li>When I need to refresh, I simply use water in fine misting spray bottle &amp; loosen my hair with my fingers.</li>
            <li>She wanted to wear her hair straight this week, but I can’t wait to try it again.  </li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>very creamy.</li>
            <li>it works thanks a lot</li>
            <li>And I thought it worked better on lightly wet hair.</li>
            <li>like this SO much.</li>
            <li>I did not see much of a difference in how my curls looked.  </li>
            <li>This product left my hair feeling so soft and tangle free!</li>
            <li>Seems to be okay if I add other products.</li>
            <li>okay, not exactly for my hair</li>
            <li>I used a little more on dry hair to make sure the help from the water did not aid in performance.</li>
            <li>I was able to comb their hair from scalp to ends with no trouble, even though their hair is very long and very curly.</li>
            <li>Today is the first time I used this product...and so far sooooooo</li>
            <li>It has done better than any other solution I have tried for fried perm hair!</li>
            <li>I was able to comb and detangle her hair in less than 15 min.  </li>
            <li>Bouncy Curls smooth creamy texture makes application easy on wet or dry hair.</li>
            <li>Additionally, I used it daily while the hair was still twisted and after taking out my twists, I applied it from root to the ends on each section and my comb out was great!</li>
            <li>and I was able to get rid of it with a little massage of my curls.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I purchased this product because of its statement that it Hydrates the hair and that is something I was real looking for to help my hair when I wear it natural.</li>
            <li>and you can see exactly how much you have left.  </li>
            <li>It is a nice thick cream, not greasy, oily or sticky.  </li>
            <li>This product made my hair very soft, and sprung up my curls if I was light- handed with it, but if I used even a bit too much, it gave my hair a heavy, greasy feel.</li>
            <li>, perhaps, I have a very sensitive nose.  </li>
            <li>I just rub it on the outside first, then began to part their  in medium parts and apply to hair.</li>
            <li>Used for first time last night...</li>
            <li>Ready to order my second container!</li>
            <li>It is soft and shinny, and it detangles his hair in one use.</li>
            <li>and this lotion makes them looser, bouncier, touchable and soft.</li>
            <li>Would not recommend it to use as a stand alone product if you have naturally curly hair.</li>
            <li>This product adds moisture and shine to any natural hairstyle.</li>
            <li>I was not nor will I be finanically compenstated to complete this review.</li>
            <li>Wow did it leave my hair moisturized and curly.  </li>
            <li>This product has natural ingredients .  </li>
            <li>When you release the twist or knot your hair is shiny and soft.</li>
            <li>, it did not dissociate completely until I sprayed her hair with conditioning water.</li>
            <li>Even though is a cream, is not heavy or greasy and it keeps you away from the frizz.</li>
            <li>I seen in other company once they read good common</li>
            <li>Her roots are super tight and kinky, but her ends are ringlets.  </li>
            <li>I truly disliked this product not only because it was no different from so many others I have tried for my hair</li>
            <li>The writing of this review is a long time in the making because I take the care of my natural hair very seriously and in order to give a good review I needed to use the product several times.</li>
            <li>I get a lot of stretch and softening without losing my natural deep curl.</li>
            <li>My hair runs normal to dry</li>
            <li>His hair is turning red so it not only brought out his natural curly hair</li>
            <li>I initially used it on my 3 year old hair dry</li>
            <li>Before Bouncy Curls, it would nearly take me 3 hours to wash, DETANGLE, dry, and flat iron</li>
    </ol>

            <li> I am finally happy with my natural hair.</li>
            <li> , it makes it easy to get what you need</li>
            <li> The first thing you notice about this product is the delicious smell as soon as you open the jar.</li>
            <li> The price is really good for the size of the container and a it doesn&#x27;t take much to cover my full afro head of hair.</li>
            <li> As it states, it’s perfect for everyday use.</li>
            <li> So I use this for sets primarily twists and bantu knots.</li>
            <li> it is light and not overpowering.  </li>
            <li> this 42 year old woman and her hair is giving the world life right now!!!!</li>

            <li> Love bouncy curls, my curls are really tide</li>
            <li> Before I could print the return label, I was contacted by a representative of the company and was given a full refund and asked to keep the product and share it with a friend.  </li>
            <li> Not a bad product</li>
            <li> best thing about this product is that is doesn&#x27;t weight down my curls even though it&#x27;s moisture intense.</li>
            <li> IT KEEP MY HEAR VERY CURLY AND SOFT GOOD PRODUCT.</li>
            <li> Very pleased with customer service and the product overall.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried more expensive products and while they worked great, I like this one so much more.</li>
            <li> When I took her braids down, she had the most beautiful and soft waves, from the roots to the ends.  </li>
            <li> Not hard or sticky as most curly hair products tend to be.</li>
            <li> Far better experience than we’ve had in a while.  </li>
            <li> recieved a complimentary product to review.</li>
            <li> I received a complimentary jar of this cream from the seller to review on my blog and give a YouTube how-to on.</li>
            <li> I used this on all three of my lil girls hair, they have a nice mixed texture.</li>
            <li> So overall it is a nice product.</li>
            <li> I love that it lets their hair be natural with bouncy curls!&lt;br</li>
            <li> I was not compensated for my review and all my opinions are my own, based on my personal experience with the product.</li>
            <li> I was not compensated for my review and all my opinions are my own, based on my personal experience with the product.</li>
            <li> My whole family has fallen in love with this product and highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> With some products I have tried, we have tears right away, but this was not the case with Bouncy Curls.</li>
            <li> This prodcut contains alcohol therefore, making my hair feel kind of dry.</li>
            <li> Made my hair super soft!!!  </li>
            <li> For several years I have struggled with many hair products for my daughters beautiful, curly but coarse very long hair.</li>
            <li> Definitely will buy more for my daughter and niece</li>
            <li> It took me no time at all to comb through their hair and it left the hair moisturized and frizz free!</li>
            <li> [[VIDEOID:604e304f35d596a86016e88613f9cb0f]] I was excited to try Bouncy Curls Anti-Frizz Natural Hair Moisturizer by The Roots Naturelle Bouncy Curls.  </li>
            <li> Love it so much, I&#x27;m ordering my second jar.  </li>
            <li> Love that it leaves my natural curls soft to the touch.</li>
            <li> I was very surprised at how quickly the item arrived.</li>
            <li> We have four natural heads of hair with all textures covered, this stuff didn&#x27;t do anything special for any of us.</li>
            <li> Thanks so much!</li>
            <li> I used too much the first time I applied</li>
            <li> This works even better on dry hair, in my opinion.</li>
            <li> It added and retained even more moisture to my already dry (not washed) hair.</li>
            <li> I have a lot of hair with kinky curl, but it has fine, individual strands.</li>
            <li> When I need to refresh, I simply use water in fine misting spray bottle &amp; loosen my hair with my fingers.</li>
            <li> She wanted to wear her hair straight this week, but I can’t wait to try it again.  </li>
            <li> Thanks</li>
            <li> very creamy.</li>
            <li> it works thanks a lot</li>
            <li> And I thought it worked better on lightly wet hair.</li>
            <li> like this SO much.</li>
            <li> I did not see much of a difference in how my curls looked.  </li>
            <li> This product left my hair feeling so soft and tangle free!</li>
            <li> Seems to be okay if I add other products.</li>
            <li> okay, not exactly for my hair</li>
            <li> I used a little more on dry hair to make sure the help from the water did not aid in performance.</li>
            <li> I was able to comb their hair from scalp to ends with no trouble, even though their hair is very long and very curly.</li>
            <li> Today is the first time I used this product...and so far sooooooo</li>
            <li> It has done better than any other solution I have tried for fried perm hair!</li>
            <li> I was able to comb and detangle her hair in less than 15 min.  </li>
            <li> Bouncy Curls smooth creamy texture makes application easy on wet or dry hair.</li>
            <li> Additionally, I used it daily while the hair was still twisted and after taking out my twists, I applied it from root to the ends on each section and my comb out was great!</li>
            <li> and I was able to get rid of it with a little massage of my curls.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I purchased this product because of its statement that it Hydrates the hair and that is something I was real looking for to help my hair when I wear it natural.</li>
            <li> and you can see exactly how much you have left.  </li>
            <li> It is a nice thick cream, not greasy, oily or sticky.  </li>
            <li> This product made my hair very soft, and sprung up my curls if I was light- handed with it, but if I used even a bit too much, it gave my hair a heavy, greasy feel.</li>
            <li> , perhaps, I have a very sensitive nose.  </li>
            <li> I just rub it on the outside first, then began to part their  in medium parts and apply to hair.</li>
            <li> Used for first time last night...</li>
            <li> Ready to order my second container!</li>
            <li> It is soft and shinny, and it detangles his hair in one use.</li>
            <li> and this lotion makes them looser, bouncier, touchable and soft.</li>
            <li> Would not recommend it to use as a stand alone product if you have naturally curly hair.</li>
            <li> This product adds moisture and shine to any natural hairstyle.</li>
            <li> I was not nor will I be finanically compenstated to complete this review.</li>
            <li> Wow did it leave my hair moisturized and curly.  </li>
            <li> This product has natural ingredients .  </li>
            <li> When you release the twist or knot your hair is shiny and soft.</li>
            <li> , it did not dissociate completely until I sprayed her hair with conditioning water.</li>
            <li> Even though is a cream, is not heavy or greasy and it keeps you away from the frizz.</li>
            <li> I seen in other company once they read good common</li>
            <li> Her roots are super tight and kinky, but her ends are ringlets.  </li>
            <li> I truly disliked this product not only because it was no different from so many others I have tried for my hair</li>
            <li> The writing of this review is a long time in the making because I take the care of my natural hair very seriously and in order to give a good review I needed to use the product several times.</li>
            <li> I get a lot of stretch and softening without losing my natural deep curl.</li>
            <li> My hair runs normal to dry</li>
            <li> His hair is turning red so it not only brought out his natural curly hair</li>
            <li> I initially used it on my 3 year old hair dry</li>
            <li> Before Bouncy Curls, it would nearly take me 3 hours to wash, DETANGLE, dry, and flat iron</li>
            <li> /&gt;Another positive is that there is no overwhelming smell.</li>
            <li> I have naturally wavy/curly hair and due to a hectic lifestyle</li>
            <li> i prefer to be natural but because of the length it is hard to find a light product that doesnt weigh my hair down!!!</li>
            <li> But I mixed it with some other oils, such as jojoba oils, essential oils, etc.</li>
            <li> My curls were soft and fluffy after using it on wash day.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s creamy and thick but not heavy or greasy!!!</li>
            <li> My hair is permed and I&#x27;ve looked for stuff to allow my hair to move naturally without being stiff.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t do wash and go styles because it takes so long for my hair to air dry</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s any different than my other products.</li>
            <li> It was moisturized and it did not look ashy or dry.</li>
            <li> I was looking for something that doesn&#x27;t dry out my curls and this product does the job.</li>
            <li> and* I tried it on dry hair.</li>
            <li> The only reason I didn&#x27;t give it a 5-star rating was that after a few hours, I lost some of that glorious moisture from the initial application.</li>
            <li> I loose my money</li>
            <li> Second of all, unlike a lot of similar products, there is very little &amp;#34;crunch&amp;#34; when it dries.</li>
            <li> Previously, I&#x27;d tried just using only the coconut oil</li>
            <li> This product did not perform as I expected.</li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t like waking around with wet hair.</li>
            <li> The tiny bit of crunch I did have was very, very slight</li>
            <li> I can go a week adding very little extra product using this method.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t gotten that from other curl enhancers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Not worth the money.</li>
            <li> It does not leave a greasy feeling in my hair and does not weigh it down.</li>
            <li> Its also keep down frizz when you twist/bantu knot the hair after takeout.</li>
            <li> Apparently, no one has ever complained about the aroma so</li>
            <li> I think this product is intended for extremely course, thick and dry hair.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m half black and half dominican</li>
            <li> Washing her hair is a nightmare because the roots are so tight and tangled.  </li>
            <li> Curls did not stay as tight as I hoped..</li>
            <li> Smells a little waxy but not offensive.</li>
            <li> - I mix with a little hair oil</li>
            <li> I add a little (liquid gold) oil to my hair before I put the bouncy curls in that way when it dries it still has a shine to it.  </li>
            <li> i put on a little bit of shine to prevent my hair from getting puffy when it dries</li>
            <li> My daughter has super thick crazy hybrid 4C/3C hair.  </li>
            <li> My hair is very thick and coarse.</li>
            <li> It’s not sticky, or gummy (after a few days of use) and my hair feels moist every time that I use it.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t wash my hair everyday and this product has lasted me 3 1/2 months.</li>
            <li> and my curls had a stiff feel</li>
            <li> but they didn&#x27;t LOOK stiff, they were still lightweight.</li>
            <li> Stiff in beginning but softened</li>
            <li> That could be due to my state&#x27;s extremely cold and dry last-minute winter weather (single digits during the day and -2</li>
            <li> Their hair is very difficult to deal with as it locks and becomes very unmanageable.</li>
            <li> I used this on my little guy as he has curls!</li>
            <li> I usually share my hair stuff but not this one 😄.  </li>
            <li> This past week, I included Bouncy Curls to the mix….</li>
            <li> Usually by the time I finish her hair, my daughter is whining</li>
            <li> It defines my curls without making them hard.  </li>
            <li> It really stinks when you find something that finally works, and cannot order it again.</li>
            <li> and I have freezy wavy thick hair.  </li>
            <li> Not great.</li>
            <li> and I have a difficult time having my hair not look frizzy.  </li>
            <li> It smells, to me, of a faint lotion, and that goes away almost immediately.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Seriously it smells like dessert!!</li>
            <li> but the smell was atrocious.  </li>
            <li> and I’m mad!  </li>
            <li> Very disappointed!</li>

            <li> For several years I have struggled with many hair products for my daughters beautiful, curly but coarse very long hair. I bought bouncy curls for her and within a week my daughter loves her hair again. It detangles and gives her a beautiful natural curl that lasts</li>
            <li> I love, love, love the ‘Bouncy Curls’ hydrating cream! As it states, it’s perfect for everyday use. It’s not sticky, or gummy (after a few days of use) and my hair feels moist every time that I use it.  Additionally, I used it daily while the hair was still twisted and after taking out my twists, I applied it from root to the ends on each section and my comb out was great! It was moisturized and it did not look ashy or dry. Previously, I&#x27;d tried just using only the coconut oil but it seems to just sit on top of my hair. It reminds me of the former &#x27;jeri-curl&#x27; of the 80&#x27;s, oil gets on everything.  Having the coconut oil incorporated in a cream with other great ingredients is awesome.  I’ve been seeking a product like this, my hair is looking &amp; feeling great. Thanks so much!</li>
            <li> Love this product. Will order again</li>
            <li> Not a bad product but it is not for my kind of hair. But it does smell good.</li>
            <li> Not great. We have four natural heads of hair with all textures covered, this stuff didn&#x27;t do anything special for any of us. Not worth the money. Smells good that&#x27;s about it.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love the results.  Not only were my curls not frizzy they held.</li>
            <li> good moisturizer!!!!! Made my hair super soft!!!  I usually share my hair stuff but not this one 😄.  It&#x27;s creamy and thick but not heavy or greasy!!!</li>
            <li> I love this product. It does not leave a greasy feeling in my hair and does not weigh it down.</li>
            <li> This did NOT work at all for my 4c strands.</li>
            <li> Wonderful product. Hair holds moisture all day and curls are defined. Ready to order my second container! Very pleased with customer service and the product overall.</li>
            <li> Where has this product been????  I have naturally wavy/curly hair and due to a hectic lifestyle i prefer to be natural but because of the length it is hard to find a light product that doesnt weigh my hair down!!! I uses this product on my hair and babbyyyyy this 42 year old woman and her hair is giving the world life right now!!!! Definitely will buy more for my daughter and niece</li>
            <li> Great leave in conditioner and good for daily moisture to hair.</li>
            <li> My daughter has super thick crazy hybrid 4C/3C hair.  Her roots are super tight and kinky, but her ends are ringlets.  Washing her hair is a nightmare because the roots are so tight and tangled.  I condition her hair with a shea butter/coconut oil mixture.  This past week, I included Bouncy Curls to the mix…. EXCELLENT!  Far better experience than we’ve had in a while.  Usually by the time I finish her hair, my daughter is whining/crying and I’m mad!  We did 30 min with the Shea butter/Coconut Oil/Bouncy Curls deep conditioning.  I was able to comb and detangle her hair in less than 15 min.  I detangled her hair, braided it, and put the plastic cap back on for another 90 min while we cooked dinner.  When I took her braids down, she had the most beautiful and soft waves, from the roots to the ends.  She wanted to wear her hair straight this week, but I can’t wait to try it again.  Before Bouncy Curls, it would nearly take me 3 hours to wash, DETANGLE, dry, and flat iron my daughter’s hair.  I was finished in 1.5 hours!  I think that I&#x27;ve found a keeper!</li>
            <li> Absolutely love the product and it smells great.  Service was great.  I was very surprised at how quickly the item arrived.</li>
            <li> Love the smell; great customer services!!</li>
            <li> Love my Bouncy Curls!  It has revived my age-related lackluster curls. I used too much the first time I applied and my curls had a stiff feel but they didn&#x27;t LOOK stiff, they were still lightweight. It gives just enough to make my hair still look naturally curly and smells wonderful.  My 24 year old daughter loved the fragrance too!  Part of my regimen now.</li>
            <li> My hair is very fine &amp; kinky curly. This product did not perform as I expected. My hair is still wispy, kinky &amp; frizzy. I followed the directions but it was as though I hadn&#x27;t used this product. Very disappointed!</li>
            <li> I purchased this product for my son and my daughter. They are both Multi Racial. They are African American, Irish, German, and Indian. Their hair is very difficult to deal with as it locks and becomes very unmanageable. I tried this One time on my son and it worked wonders. His hair is turning red so it not only brought out his natural curly hair it brought out the color in his hair. It is soft and shinny, and it detangles his hair in one use. I just rub it on the outside first, then began to part their  in medium parts and apply to hair. I leave it on for 5 minutes to soften and detangle then I can comb through their hair without any problem. Thanks</li>
            <li> Love bouncy curls, my curls are really tide and this lotion makes them looser, bouncier, touchable and soft. i recommend Bouncy Curls to all of you ladies with curly hair.</li>
            <li> I have a lot of hair with kinky curl, but it has fine, individual strands. This product made my hair very soft, and sprung up my curls if I was light- handed with it, but if I used even a bit too much, it gave my hair a heavy, greasy feel. I think this product is intended for extremely course, thick and dry hair.</li>
            <li> This prodcut contains alcohol therefore, making my hair feel kind of dry. But I mixed it with some other oils, such as jojoba oils, essential oils, etc. Seems to be okay if I add other products. Would not recommend it to use as a stand alone product if you have naturally curly hair.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff!!! Keeps my curls all day... not greasy and doesn&#x27;t leave a film. Highly recommended! !!!!</li>
            <li> My hair is very thick and coarse. Bouncy Curl made my hair more manageable. Before going to bed, I simply put Bouncy Curls on my hair, braided it, and took out the braids when I got up. My hair looked shiny and had beautiful curls. I love this product and will buy again.  I also received same day delivery.</li>
            <li> Did not work for me at all. Left flakes in my hair and didn&#x27;t promote curls. Maybe it&#x27;ll work for the person I gave it to...</li>
            <li> Used for first time last night...very creamy. Smells a little waxy but not offensive. Woke up to nicely defined bouncy curls. Will keep using for rest of week</li>
            <li> Love it very nice it works thanks a lot</li>
            <li> I truly disliked this product not only because it was no different from so many others I have tried for my hair but the smell was atrocious.  It is going back to the seller! Update: Before I could print the return label, I was contacted by a representative of the company and was given a full refund and asked to keep the product and share it with a friend.  Apparently, no one has ever complained about the aroma so, perhaps, I have a very sensitive nose.  Nonetheless, I appreciate the gracious response and am trying the product once more as I type.</li>
            <li> My hair is permed and I&#x27;ve looked for stuff to allow my hair to move naturally without being stiff. This stuff is great, I can run my hands through my hair if I want and I don&#x27;t end the day with a flaky substance in my hair.</li>
            <li> I got this product free to try and give an honest review! I used this on my little guy as he has curls! I loved the scent and so did he! It def made his curls super cute and bouncy!! Wasn&#x27;t greasy or oily and that is wonderful!</li>
            <li> Works well - I mix with a little hair oil</li>
            <li> My hair runs normal to dry and I have a difficult time having my hair not look frizzy.  This worked wonders!  I actually have bouncy curls!  I also have added volume which I love for my fine hair.  I would recommend this to anyone.  Unavailable?  That IS a bummer.  It really stinks when you find something that finally works, and cannot order it again.</li>
            <li> Love it! It has done better than any other solution I have tried for fried perm hair!</li>
            <li> The Bouncy Curls Ultra Hydrating Cream so far is the best product I have used. It moistures my hair greatly and it feels soft. Keep up the good work on this product. I purchased this product because of its statement that it Hydrates the hair and that is something I was real looking for to help my hair when I wear it natural. Its also keep down frizz when you twist/bantu knot the hair after takeout.</li>
            <li> I like bouncy curls very good product</li>
            <li> okay, not exactly for my hair</li>
            <li> The writing of this review is a long time in the making because I take the care of my natural hair very seriously and in order to give a good review I needed to use the product several times. And after multiple uses on myself and my family members hair I can definitely say... Bouncy Curls ultra hydrating creme by The Roots Naturelle is a must have product and with a price tag under $15 it is already in my cart. The first thing you notice about this product is the delicious smell as soon as you open the jar. Seriously it smells like dessert!! Bouncy Curls smooth creamy texture makes application easy on wet or dry hair. This ultra hydrating creme is a great stand alone product for Naturalistias like myself who want to simplify their natural hair care routine. This product adds moisture and shine to any natural hairstyle. The Roots Naturelle have this product the perfect name because it definitely adds bounce, along with a touchable gold that you don&#x27;t get when you use gel.My whole family has fallen in love with this product and highly recommend it. My sons love that it makes it easier for me to brush their hair and my daughter loves Bouncy Curls so much that she happily made a video for my Youtube channel.&lt;br /&gt;I recieved a complimentary product to review. The opinions expressed in this review are mine and mine alone. I was not nor will I be finanically compenstated to complete this review.</li>
            <li> Best natural hair product I have used.</li>
            <li> Love it so much, I&#x27;m ordering my second jar.  This time I&#x27;m ordering two jars.  It defines my curls without making them hard.  I add a little (liquid gold) oil to my hair before I put the bouncy curls in that way when it dries it still has a shine to it.  Love that it leaves my natural curls soft to the touch.</li>
            <li> My lil girls hair is just loving this!!!!!! Thank you for the amazing and fast service!!!</li>
            <li> The shipment for this product came ASAP.  I loved this product. I&#x27;m half black and half dominican and I have freezy wavy thick hair.  As soon as I washed my hair i put on a little bit of shine to prevent my hair from getting puffy when it dries, then I put on the bouncy curls ultra hydrating cream.  Wow did it leave my hair moisturized and curly.  After drying my hair it stay curly. This product has natural ingredients .  Love the product. Please don&#x27;t raise the price of the product....I seen in other company once they read good common they get greedy by raising the price.  I will keep buying more.</li>
            <li> This product left my hair feeling so soft and tangle free! I love this product and it last all day!</li>
            <li> Not hard or sticky as most curly hair products tend to be. Nice mellow fragrance.</li>
            <li> Today is the first time I used this product...and so far sooooooo good!&lt;br /&gt;Packaging was good and it arrived quickly! The product is wonderful on my&lt;br /&gt;natural curly hair! Definately a favorite and I will order again! Thank you!</li>
            <li> Did not like this product but who knows it probably works wonders with others.</li>
            <li> I received a complimentary jar of this cream from the seller to review on my blog and give a YouTube how-to on. I also used the pomade from the seller and the two together gave me the best kinky curly fro hawk to date! My curls were soft and fluffy after using it on wash day. I used a little more on dry hair to make sure the help from the water did not aid in performance. This works even better on dry hair, in my opinion. My bantu knot out was springy and my hair had flexible hold. I had movement. I don&#x27;t do wash and go styles because it takes so long for my hair to air dry and I don&#x27;t like waking around with wet hair. So I use this for sets primarily twists and bantu knots. When you release the twist or knot your hair is shiny and soft. I just love it!</li>
            <li> Curly haired ladies and gents you need this product! It smells like coconut and it leaves your hair silky smooth and amazing. I&#x27;m in love with their products now! It does help the hair to have a curlier finish and hold on the curls. I noticed my hair was as puffy when this product is applied. It doesn&#x27;t not leave your hair greasy!</li>
            <li> It is a great product. It really makes my hair curly and fluffy. I like it and it even last a couple of days after you put it in your hair. I&#x27;d give it a 5 stars.</li>
            <li> I love this product on my hair smells good and doesn&#x27;t friz my hair</li>
            <li> IT KEEP MY HEAR VERY CURLY AND SOFT GOOD PRODUCT.</li>
            <li> I used this on all three of my lil girls hair, they have a nice mixed texture. And I thought it worked better on lightly wet hair. I initially used it on my 3 year old hair dry and it turned her hair white, it did not dissociate completely until I sprayed her hair with conditioning water. So I guess it works best on damp hair. But it does bring out the curls nicely. So overall it is a nice product.</li>
            <li> I have tried so many products in my lifetime. This product is it for me. I&#x27;ve tried more expensive products and while they worked great, I like this one so much more. The cost is awesome and no frizz in this humidity. I don&#x27;t wash my hair everyday and this product has lasted me 3 1/2 months.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s any different than my other products.</li>
            <li> Curls did not stay as tight as I hoped.. Stiff in beginning but softened</li>
            <li> I found my cream open in the box. I loose my money</li>
            <li> [[VIDEOID:604e304f35d596a86016e88613f9cb0f]] I was excited to try Bouncy Curls Anti-Frizz Natural Hair Moisturizer by The Roots Naturelle Bouncy Curls.  I like that it comes in this type of car, it makes it easy to get what you need and you can see exactly how much you have left.  I love the scent. it is light and not overpowering.  It is a nice thick cream, not greasy, oily or sticky.  It applies nicely and absorbs in the hair quickly.  I like that I was able to comb their hair from scalp to ends with no trouble, even though their hair is very long and very curly. With some products I have tried, we have tears right away, but this was not the case with Bouncy Curls. It took me no time at all to comb through their hair and it left the hair moisturized and frizz free! I think this would be a great product for anyone with curly hair. I love that it lets their hair be natural with bouncy curls!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I received this product in exchange for a review.

            <li> I love the product!  Works well on my daughter&#x27;s hair and my hair as well.  Timely service too</li>
            <li> The product is very good! So far I am happy with it. I was looking for something that doesn&#x27;t dry out my curls and this product does the job. Even though is a cream, is not heavy or greasy and it keeps you away from the frizz. Will buy it again!</li>
            <li> I was really happy with the delivery time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I actually love the smell of this product. I was happy with how soft my hair felt. I have 4C hair and this product made my twist out nicely defined with bouncy curls! My hair was not frizzy which is a plus plus plus for me. This product is definitely a great moisturizer for my natural hair. Another plus is that this product comes in a great size jar.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this product in exchange for a review.

            <li> Yet another awesome product. My hair looks great. I haven&#x27;t said that in years. I am finally happy with my natural hair.</li>
            <li> UPDATE: I am upgrading this to 5 stars because I have learned how to use it for maximum benefits. The trick for deeply nappy hair like mine is to condition well beforehand. I get a lot of stretch and softening without losing my natural deep curl. When I need to refresh, I simply use water in fine misting spray bottle &amp; loosen my hair with my fingers. I can go a week adding very little extra product using this method. I have also used this with some shine oil when I want to highlight my edges.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4 1/2 stars with potential!&lt;br /&gt;I like this SO much. The only reason I didn&#x27;t give it a 5-star rating was that after a few hours, I lost some of that glorious moisture from the initial application. That could be due to my state&#x27;s extremely cold and dry last-minute winter weather (single digits during the day and -2 last night).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The best thing about this product is that is doesn&#x27;t weight down my curls even though it&#x27;s moisture intense. Second of all, unlike a lot of similar products, there is very little &amp;#34;crunch&amp;#34; when it dries. The tiny bit of crunch I did have was very, very slight and I was able to get rid of it with a little massage of my curls.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another positive is that there is no overwhelming smell. It smells, to me, of a faint lotion, and that goes away almost immediately.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So glad that there is a quality product for curly hair wearers. The price is really good for the size of the container and a it doesn&#x27;t take much to cover my full afro head of hair. By the way, I tried this as instructed *and* I tried it on dry hair. It added and retained even more moisture to my already dry (not washed) hair. This is great because I don&#x27;t wash more than once per week, but I still like getting some curl definition and softness added in between. I provided photos of my tamed and untamed look. I like both, but I think using Bouncy Curls will help curb some breakage. I haven&#x27;t gotten that from other curl enhancers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Disclaimer: I was reimbursed for providing a fair and honest review of this product.w of this product.</li>
            <li> Not for me.  Turned my hair white.  I did not see much of a difference in how my curls looked.  Will not be purchasing again.</li>
