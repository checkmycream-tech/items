            <li>I need to order more</li>

            <li>and i love them to death.</li>
            <li>Planning on buying more as my lipstick collection grows :)</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>My friends love it too.</li>
            <li>Love this.</li>
            <li>I love that I can now have my lipsticks and glosses all organized in one place.  </li>
            <li>Love the graduated incline.  </li>
            <li>so I could organize the many lipsticks I have in my drawer.  </li>
            <li>It also looks really nice all filled up.</li>
            <li>looks cute in my vanity and the tier shape makes it wasy to look for my colors</li>
            <li>I have since ordered 2 more.  </li>
            <li>Love it for holding lipsticks.</li>
            <li>I love them</li>
            <li>I seem to be a lipstick addict :)</li>
            <li>I worked in retail many years and have tons of lipsticks</li>
            <li>This arrived in such PERFECT condition!</li>
            <li>I recommend this :)</li>
            <li>You can&#x27;t beat the easy access factor :)</li>
            <li>All my lipsticks fit perfectly in the slots and I like how the rows are on different levels.</li>
            <li>I am able to fit all my MAC lipsticks into these and have them stand upright w/o leaning.  </li>
            <li>The 3-tiers make it easy to see every color that I am displaying.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s simple, sturdy, and looks great on top of my muji acrylic organizers.</li>
            <li>It makes access to my lipsticks so easy.</li>
            <li>I can easily see what tube I am grabbing and the color.  </li>
            <li>If you like to place your MAC lipsticks upside down, they won&#x27;t sit perfect and will tip sideways.</li>
            <li>Its not one of those cheap acrylic that will break easily if dropped.</li>
            <li>This has not come threw the mail yet ,but it&#x27;s what I have been looking for to put my stickles bottles in and its going to work out just fine .I&#x27;m</li>
            <li>I like the product just fine.</li>
            <li>I have a large lipstick selection and this holds all of my standard sized lipsticks perfectly!</li>
            <li>Great product especially for the price!</li>
            <li>Tubes of OCC Lip Tars fit snugly diagonally.  </li>
            <li>They cant all fit in my vanity.</li>
            <li>Hope y&#x27;all enjoy this.</li>
            <li>fit)</li>
            <li>and they are almost filled up...</li>
            <li>Loved it actually thought it was completely flat as leveled not tiered but was so happy that it was..</li>
            <li>These holders arrived exactly as pictured, and fit all my lipsticks (although I don&#x27;t own any really unusual shapes).  </li>
            <li>and it makes them more accessible when I am getting ready.</li>
            <li>just glad I found this on your site Thanks</li>
            <li>It came quickly after being ordered.  </li>
            <li>The acrylic is very sturdy ad easy to clean.</li>
            <li>I love, love, love this little implement.  </li>
            <li>This holder is great, you put your lipsticks in it upside down</li>
            <li>Really keeps lipstick , lip gloss, mascaras easy to see.</li>
            <li>and now I have 24 lipsticks displayed for easy access while I am getting ready and</li>
            <li>It was EXACTLY what I needed for my lip stick collection!</li>
            <li>Recently realized I owned too many lipsticks to just keep them in a pile in a drawer, and needed some way to figure out what I had and easily see to choose.  </li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s very spacious and all my lipsticks fit</li>
            <li>Its really sturdy &amp; it does not feel cheap at all.</li>
            <li>, think it&#x27;s def worth to buy and made my vanity look so organized</li>
            <li>This lipstick holder is as advertised----very sturdy, useful and well designed.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s worth the money</li>
            <li>It really looks so adorable when you put all your lipsticks/lip glosses in it and makes finding them much easier.</li>
            <li>Clear, cute, and so convenient to store my lipsticks</li>
            <li>Priced right on Amazon, I recommend this product.</li>
            <li>I have 2 of these on my vanity right now</li>
            <li>and you can fit pretty much any lipstick in it (MAC, Bobbi Brown, Revlon &amp; L&#x27;Oreal</li>
            <li>this was a very easy purchase for me because I needed something simple and neat to store my lip sticks in.</li>
            <li>just what i wanted: high quality acrylic, holds 24 lipsticks, and significantly cheaper than the version at bed, bath &amp; beyond or container store.</li>
            <li>The clear plastic makes it easy to see the organized lipsticks.</li>
            <li>and have 4 extra slots left (guess I need to go shopping, lol)</li>
            <li>The only problem is that it doesn&#x27;t fit all my lipsticks!</li>
            <li>Looking to purchase more in the future.</li>
            <li>and this made it so much easier to organize it all!</li>
            <li>You&#x27;ll be able to put items like glosses, liners and such in the rear and lipsticks on front.</li>
            <li>Pretty on my vanity.</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>SHe keeps her lipsticks all organized, it doesn&#x27;t take so much space on vanity table and is always at hand!</li>
            <li>Exactly as described.  </li>
            <li>This does exactly what it needs to do.</li>
            <li>Also fits perfect in the IKEA alex 9 drawer except for tall lipsticks such as wet and wild unless you put them in one of the deeper drawers.</li>
            <li>I actually got two of them and could of almost used one more.</li>
            <li>this is the second one I buy I love this organizer</li>
            <li>You can&#x27;t really complain.</li>
            <li>I looked REALLY close at the picture before making the purchase.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I really like this, for $3</li>
            <li>I ordered this acrylic organizer and it shipped fast</li>
            <li>and it is well made, better than expected.</li>
            <li>The material used for this was so much more sturdy and shiny than I expected.</li>
            <li>but I would always forget to use some of them because I had them in a drawer and would be in a rush getting ready without time to sort through and pick one.  </li>
            <li>I still really like it</li>
            <li>Product is better then I expected.</li>
            <li>Definitely does not look cheap.</li>
            <li>It made my morning get ready routine so much easier.</li>
            <li>so you can read the color on the bottom, keeps you very organzied.</li>
            <li>I should have really looked at this item.  </li>
            <li>VERY sturdy</li>
            <li>and it is very convenient.</li>
            <li>so some tall lipstick containers sway one way or another not straight up (such as the MAC lipsticks--very good example).  </li>
            <li>It can fit a lipstick that is flat on both ends</li>
            <li>Because it&#x27;s clear, it should go with pretty much any decor.&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;The quality of this is nice, though, and it really has a small footprint, while holding a lot.</li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t always find the particular item I was looking for.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Classic.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this product for lipstick storage as well as re purchase</li>
            <li>It seems very sturdy and you can&#x27;t beat the price, other ones of the same are much more pricey.</li>
            <li>The individual slots are the right size to hold a full-sized lipstick.</li>
            <li>The third row is higher than the second, which is higher than the front (like stadium seating).  </li>
            <li>As one rater stated, it is not angled as the picture depicts, it is straight and flat, the picture is very deceiving and almost caused me not to purchase it.  </li>
            <li>The sides give the appearance of the items in the back sitting up higher than the items in the front</li>
            <li>I gave four stars because when it says tiered, it really means higher as in the container holder not higher as in elevated in the rear which means towards the front you have a shorter shaft</li>
            <li>Until the seller change the item&#x27;s picture: I bought this because I thought there WAS NO graduated steps on each row, which would make the holders in the back row deeper, capable of holding things like lip glosses and mascaras.</li>
            <li>, the item I was sent has the graduated steps, making all holders on all rows the same depth, my lip glosses don&#x27;t stand very well in them.  </li>
            <li>and I like it so far.</li>
            <li>Sturdy and seems durable so far.</li>
            <li>and so far I haven&#x27;t had any issues with it.</li>
            <li>Although it&#x27;s not exactly what I was looking for, it was cheap enough that I will still keep the item.</li>
            <li>Too shallow for most lipsticks.</li>
            <li>I have a particular affinity for lip products, and I&#x27;ve amassed quite a collection of lip stains, lipsticks, lip glosses, and related products.</li>
            <li>I purchased this for my everyday lipsticks that I want to see right away and not go into my normal storage container of lipsticks.  </li>
            <li>They do not rise so that each row is higher than the other.</li>
            <li>I also have Revlon and Maybelline tubes that I have been buying as of late that fit with no problems.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;really thick lipsticks won&#x27;t fit</li>
            <li>I chose the 4 star rating for this product because it is exactly like the high-end organizers but it extremely affordable!</li>
            <li>I have seen other models and some cover up the lipstick too much .</li>
            <li>Ordered this b/c wanted my lipsticks to be easier to pick out, had them in a cute leather bag b4 but always hated how I had to look thru so many b4</li>
            <li>It sounds better in theory but is overall, unnecessary.</li>
            <li>(The bottom is not completely flat; there&#x27;s a lip around the edge.)</li>
    </ol>

            <li> My friends love it too.</li>
            <li> Love this.</li>
            <li> I love that I can now have my lipsticks and glosses all organized in one place.  </li>
            <li> Love the graduated incline.  </li>
            <li> so I could organize the many lipsticks I have in my drawer.  </li>
            <li> It also looks really nice all filled up.</li>
            <li> looks cute in my vanity and the tier shape makes it wasy to look for my colors</li>
            <li> I have since ordered 2 more.  </li>
            <li> Love it for holding lipsticks.</li>
            <li> I love them</li>
            <li> I seem to be a lipstick addict :)</li>
            <li> I worked in retail many years and have tons of lipsticks</li>
            <li> This arrived in such PERFECT condition!</li>
            <li> I recommend this :)</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t beat the easy access factor :)</li>
            <li> All my lipsticks fit perfectly in the slots and I like how the rows are on different levels.</li>
            <li> I am able to fit all my MAC lipsticks into these and have them stand upright w/o leaning.  </li>
            <li> The 3-tiers make it easy to see every color that I am displaying.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s simple, sturdy, and looks great on top of my muji acrylic organizers.</li>
            <li> It makes access to my lipsticks so easy.</li>
            <li> I can easily see what tube I am grabbing and the color.  </li>
            <li> If you like to place your MAC lipsticks upside down, they won&#x27;t sit perfect and will tip sideways.</li>
            <li> Its not one of those cheap acrylic that will break easily if dropped.</li>
            <li> This has not come threw the mail yet ,but it&#x27;s what I have been looking for to put my stickles bottles in and its going to work out just fine .I&#x27;m</li>
            <li> I like the product just fine.</li>
            <li> I have a large lipstick selection and this holds all of my standard sized lipsticks perfectly!</li>
            <li> Great product especially for the price!</li>
            <li> Tubes of OCC Lip Tars fit snugly diagonally.  </li>
            <li> They cant all fit in my vanity.</li>
            <li> Hope y&#x27;all enjoy this.</li>
            <li> fit)</li>
            <li> and they are almost filled up...</li>
            <li> Loved it actually thought it was completely flat as leveled not tiered but was so happy that it was..</li>
            <li> These holders arrived exactly as pictured, and fit all my lipsticks (although I don&#x27;t own any really unusual shapes).  </li>
            <li> and it makes them more accessible when I am getting ready.</li>
            <li> just glad I found this on your site Thanks</li>
            <li> It came quickly after being ordered.  </li>
            <li> The acrylic is very sturdy ad easy to clean.</li>
            <li> I love, love, love this little implement.  </li>
            <li> This holder is great, you put your lipsticks in it upside down</li>
            <li> Really keeps lipstick , lip gloss, mascaras easy to see.</li>
            <li> and now I have 24 lipsticks displayed for easy access while I am getting ready and</li>
            <li> It was EXACTLY what I needed for my lip stick collection!</li>
            <li> Recently realized I owned too many lipsticks to just keep them in a pile in a drawer, and needed some way to figure out what I had and easily see to choose.  </li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s very spacious and all my lipsticks fit</li>
            <li> Its really sturdy &amp; it does not feel cheap at all.</li>
            <li> , think it&#x27;s def worth to buy and made my vanity look so organized</li>
            <li> This lipstick holder is as advertised----very sturdy, useful and well designed.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s worth the money</li>
            <li> It really looks so adorable when you put all your lipsticks/lip glosses in it and makes finding them much easier.</li>
            <li> Clear, cute, and so convenient to store my lipsticks</li>
            <li> Priced right on Amazon, I recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I have 2 of these on my vanity right now</li>
            <li> and you can fit pretty much any lipstick in it (MAC, Bobbi Brown, Revlon &amp; L&#x27;Oreal</li>
            <li> this was a very easy purchase for me because I needed something simple and neat to store my lip sticks in.</li>
            <li> just what i wanted: high quality acrylic, holds 24 lipsticks, and significantly cheaper than the version at bed, bath &amp; beyond or container store.</li>
            <li> The clear plastic makes it easy to see the organized lipsticks.</li>
            <li> and have 4 extra slots left (guess I need to go shopping, lol)</li>
            <li> The only problem is that it doesn&#x27;t fit all my lipsticks!</li>
            <li> Looking to purchase more in the future.</li>
            <li> and this made it so much easier to organize it all!</li>
            <li> You&#x27;ll be able to put items like glosses, liners and such in the rear and lipsticks on front.</li>
            <li> Pretty on my vanity.</li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> SHe keeps her lipsticks all organized, it doesn&#x27;t take so much space on vanity table and is always at hand!</li>
            <li> Exactly as described.  </li>
            <li> This does exactly what it needs to do.</li>
            <li> Also fits perfect in the IKEA alex 9 drawer except for tall lipsticks such as wet and wild unless you put them in one of the deeper drawers.</li>
            <li> I actually got two of them and could of almost used one more.</li>
            <li> this is the second one I buy I love this organizer</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t really complain.</li>
            <li> I looked REALLY close at the picture before making the purchase.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I really like this, for $3</li>
            <li> I ordered this acrylic organizer and it shipped fast</li>
            <li> and it is well made, better than expected.</li>
            <li> The material used for this was so much more sturdy and shiny than I expected.</li>
            <li> but I would always forget to use some of them because I had them in a drawer and would be in a rush getting ready without time to sort through and pick one.  </li>
            <li> I still really like it</li>
            <li> Product is better then I expected.</li>
            <li> Definitely does not look cheap.</li>
            <li> It made my morning get ready routine so much easier.</li>
            <li> so you can read the color on the bottom, keeps you very organzied.</li>
            <li> I should have really looked at this item.  </li>
            <li> VERY sturdy</li>
            <li> and it is very convenient.</li>
            <li> so some tall lipstick containers sway one way or another not straight up (such as the MAC lipsticks--very good example).  </li>
            <li> It can fit a lipstick that is flat on both ends</li>
            <li> Because it&#x27;s clear, it should go with pretty much any decor.&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;The quality of this is nice, though, and it really has a small footprint, while holding a lot.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t always find the particular item I was looking for.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Classic.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this product for lipstick storage as well as re purchase</li>
            <li> It seems very sturdy and you can&#x27;t beat the price, other ones of the same are much more pricey.</li>
            <li> The individual slots are the right size to hold a full-sized lipstick.</li>
            <li> The third row is higher than the second, which is higher than the front (like stadium seating).  </li>
            <li> As one rater stated, it is not angled as the picture depicts, it is straight and flat, the picture is very deceiving and almost caused me not to purchase it.  </li>
            <li> The sides give the appearance of the items in the back sitting up higher than the items in the front</li>
            <li> I gave four stars because when it says tiered, it really means higher as in the container holder not higher as in elevated in the rear which means towards the front you have a shorter shaft</li>
            <li> Until the seller change the item&#x27;s picture: I bought this because I thought there WAS NO graduated steps on each row, which would make the holders in the back row deeper, capable of holding things like lip glosses and mascaras.</li>
            <li> , the item I was sent has the graduated steps, making all holders on all rows the same depth, my lip glosses don&#x27;t stand very well in them.  </li>
            <li> and I like it so far.</li>
            <li> Sturdy and seems durable so far.</li>
            <li> and so far I haven&#x27;t had any issues with it.</li>
            <li> Although it&#x27;s not exactly what I was looking for, it was cheap enough that I will still keep the item.</li>
            <li> Too shallow for most lipsticks.</li>
            <li> I have a particular affinity for lip products, and I&#x27;ve amassed quite a collection of lip stains, lipsticks, lip glosses, and related products.</li>
            <li> I purchased this for my everyday lipsticks that I want to see right away and not go into my normal storage container of lipsticks.  </li>
            <li> They do not rise so that each row is higher than the other.</li>
            <li> I also have Revlon and Maybelline tubes that I have been buying as of late that fit with no problems.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;really thick lipsticks won&#x27;t fit</li>
            <li> I chose the 4 star rating for this product because it is exactly like the high-end organizers but it extremely affordable!</li>
            <li> I have seen other models and some cover up the lipstick too much .</li>
            <li> Ordered this b/c wanted my lipsticks to be easier to pick out, had them in a cute leather bag b4 but always hated how I had to look thru so many b4</li>
            <li> It sounds better in theory but is overall, unnecessary.</li>
            <li> (The bottom is not completely flat; there&#x27;s a lip around the edge.)</li>
            <li> It is small and will carry the most common lipstick shapes.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It does hold my Nars, Revlon, and other lipsticks just fine, but is too shallow for long lipgloss tubes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The holder itself is shaped in tiers but the lipsticks lie flat.  </li>
            <li> Just three  flat rows.  </li>
            <li> Made out of a heavy clear plastic.</li>
            <li> Also, the lipstick holders themselves are not really that deep</li>
            <li> I agree with other reviews, it does seem in the picture that it would be taller in the back, but it&#x27;s all one level.</li>
            <li> My disappointment is not with the product quality as it is heavy duty and quite nice in that regard.  </li>
            <li> This is made of VERY clear, thick, and durable acrylic.</li>
            <li> This sturdy little case holds just enough - I use it for lipsticks, lip pencils and mascara.</li>
            <li> you can&#x27;t fit Burberry or Marc Jacobs lipsticks in these compartments, which stinks.</li>
            <li> /&gt;This came sooner than expected.</li>
            <li> I also put a few brushes and liners into some of the open spaces.</li>
            <li> But bought the other 2 from someone else that was way cheaper and is gonna take like a yr to get here...</li>
            <li> (Note: I see from the other reviews there may be some variation in this product.  </li>
            <li> If you don&#x27;t get what you expected based on the photo, contact Amazon!)</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re a bit big for narrow, long gloss containers and lip pencils, but I have been making that work (often by putting several lip pencils or thin gloss containers in one slot).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Not worth my time to go return it.</li>
            <li> so my cats don&#x27;t knock it down.</li>
            <li> It holds my Macs (upside down) Revlon and loreal lipsticks.</li>
            <li> I like to display my lipsticks upside down</li>
            <li> Based on previous reviews that said that this would hold MAC&#x27;s rounded bullet lipstick tubes upside down, I bought this holder, but the MAC lipsticks wobble around, and don&#x27;t stat put in it.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ll keep this for my other brands, but will be on the hunt again for something for my MAC tubes so that they stay firmly in place.&lt;br</li>
            <li> some where else for less than half a price, but didn&#x27;t, because I wanted something</li>
            <li> All on the same level at eye level it makes it difficult to see in the back.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t have to hunt through the mess.</li>
            <li> My make-up drawer, counter, and bags were a mess.</li>
            <li> I use it for all of my little roll on bottles of oils.</li>
            <li> I do wish the compartments were a little bit deeper.</li>
            <li> I have all size lipsticks round, squared , slim</li>
            <li> Although it came in a package with two heavy cases of canned dog food, it was all in one piece and didn&#x27;t have a scratch on it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been putting them into cosmetics bags, which usually end up in my purse, and that was getting heavy -- plus</li>
            <li> The arylic is nicr and thick and heavy.</li>
            <li> so my lipsticks are evenly behind each other.  </li>
            <li> In an effort to organize my cosmetics and skincare items, I have been buying a lot of organizers lately.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s the only the I was afraid of.</li>
            <li> Serves the purpose and you can even put up to two lip crayons in each square if they aren&#x27;t too thick.</li>
            <li> I mean, $7?</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s too shallow.  </li>
            <li> Feeling cheated sucks!</li>
            <li> This seller&#x27;s intentional (or untentional) misleading picture sucks!</li>
            <li> Arrived broken.</li>
            <li> /&gt;So: false advertisement.</li>
            <li> My disappointment is that it looks in the picture (shown) to be tiered.  </li>
            <li> you cant go wrong!</li>
            <li> Disappointed.  </li>
            <li> What makes this annoying is that I could have bought this (WITH the graduated steps)</li>
    </ol>

            <li> Helps me keep my lipstick nicely organized.</li>
            <li> Great product especially for the price!</li>
            <li> This is a very handy organizer. I use it for all of my little roll on bottles of oils. Priced right on Amazon, I recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Recently realized I owned too many lipsticks to just keep them in a pile in a drawer, and needed some way to figure out what I had and easily see to choose.  These holders arrived exactly as pictured, and fit all my lipsticks (although I don&#x27;t own any really unusual shapes).  Tubes of OCC Lip Tars fit snugly diagonally.  Will buy again when needed. :)</li>
            <li> Love love it. The only problem is that it doesn&#x27;t fit all my lipsticks! I need to order more! lol</li>
            <li> Loved it actually thought it was completely flat as leveled not tiered but was so happy that it was..if I would have know I would of order 2 more. But bought the other 2 from someone else that was way cheaper and is gonna take like a yr to get here...but well now I know!! Thank again very nice and beautiful!!</li>
            <li> The holder that I received was the same one that was shown in the picture. After reading the reviews saying that the product received was not always the product shown, I was hesitant to order it. But, my holder is as shown and I love it! Looks like it is very nice quality.</li>
            <li> This is the best idea ever! I have a lot of make up and this is the best way to organize it and have easy access view your lip color without having to for it in a kaboodle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This came sooner than expected. It is small and will carry the most common lipstick shapes. Looks great on my bathroom counter</li>
            <li> Buying again asap! I love this! Very cute way to display my most used lipsticks. Will hold MAC, Chanel, Nars sizes.</li>
            <li> good acrylic quality. serves its purpose of organization for lip sticks-mac-clinique-lancome. and mac lip glosses.&lt;br /&gt;cute to organize your lipsticks</li>
            <li> This product fits most sizes of lipstick tubes and it helps me stay organized while looking sleek. The 3-tiers make it easy to see every color that I am displaying.</li>
            <li> Works great for storing my lipsticks. It&#x27;s simple, sturdy, and looks great on top of my muji acrylic organizers.</li>
            <li> If you would like to organize your makeup, this is definitely a product to have ! All my lipsticks fit perfectly in the slots and I like how the rows are on different levels. A must have on your vanity.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s good for what you&#x27;re getting for the price. I mean, $7? You can&#x27;t really complain. I do wish the compartments were a little bit deeper. And heads up - you can&#x27;t fit Burberry or Marc Jacobs lipsticks in these compartments, which stinks. All that being said - I&#x27;ve bought three of these so obviously I&#x27;m overall happy with these!</li>
            <li> Until the seller change the item&#x27;s picture: I bought this because I thought there WAS NO graduated steps on each row, which would make the holders in the back row deeper, capable of holding things like lip glosses and mascaras. I looked REALLY close at the picture before making the purchase.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Welp, the item I was sent has the graduated steps, making all holders on all rows the same depth, my lip glosses don&#x27;t stand very well in them.  What makes this annoying is that I could have bought this (WITH the graduated steps) some where else for less than half a price, but didn&#x27;t, because I wanted something WITHOUT graduated steps.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So: false advertisement. Not worth my time to go return it. Feeling cheated sucks! This seller&#x27;s intentional (or untentional) misleading picture sucks!</li>
            <li> Very nice and compact. Serves the purpose and you can even put up to two lip crayons in each square if they aren&#x27;t too thick. Looking to purchase more in the future.</li>
            <li> i purchased this gift for a friends birthday , she said thanks.so she likes her gift.she must not like it alot cause i havent heard from her since her birthday.</li>
            <li> Omg I love it ! , it&#x27;s very spacious and all my lipsticks fit n I have all size lipsticks round, squared , slim , think it&#x27;s def worth to buy and made my vanity look so organized</li>
            <li> This lipstick holder is as advertised----very sturdy, useful and well designed. It can be  put on a counter or stored in a drawer.  I am waiting for Amazon to replenish their stock so I can order two more.  Who has just 24 lipsticks????  I have way more.  Love it!</li>
            <li> Rebecca&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have so many lipsticks and lipglosses and this made it so much easier to organize it all! I need to order more</li>
            <li> I chose the 4 star rating for this product because it is exactly like the high-end organizers but it extremely affordable!</li>
            <li> this was a very easy purchase for me because I needed something simple and neat to store my lip sticks in. In this container, you can see all of your selections. It makes the process easier.</li>
            <li> I really like this, for $3 you cant go wrong! Its really sturdy &amp; it does not feel cheap at all. Super happy with it</li>
            <li> I love this holder! It was EXACTLY what I needed for my lip stick collection! Definitely will order another one.</li>
            <li> My husband doesnt like clutter and i keep all my makeup inside my vanity. But i have almost 100 lipsticks. They cant all fit in my vanity. This is a stylish way that keeps all your lipsticks organized. The quality of the product is great too. It doesnt feel like some flimsy piece of plastic. I have 2 of these on my vanity right now and i love them to death.</li>
            <li> I love this lipstick holder, it displays beautifully and for the price, it is a steal! Planning on buying more as my lipstick collection grows :) Two Thumbs Up!</li>
            <li> In an effort to organize my cosmetics and skincare items, I have been buying a lot of organizers lately. I have a particular affinity for lip products, and I&#x27;ve amassed quite a collection of lip stains, lipsticks, lip glosses, and related products. I&#x27;ve been putting them into cosmetics bags, which usually end up in my purse, and that was getting heavy -- plus I couldn&#x27;t always find the particular item I was looking for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I got the 3 x 8 organizer that&#x27;s shown on this page. Although it came in a package with two heavy cases of canned dog food, it was all in one piece and didn&#x27;t have a scratch on it. It fits perfectly on my bathroom counter, even though I don&#x27;t have a lot of space. I&#x27;m securing it with some 3M sticky pads so my cats don&#x27;t knock it down. (The bottom is not completely flat; there&#x27;s a lip around the edge.) Because it&#x27;s clear, it should go with pretty much any decor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The slots are all the same size; the ones in the back are the same depth as the ones in the front. The individual slots are the right size to hold a full-sized lipstick. They&#x27;re a bit big for narrow, long gloss containers and lip pencils, but I have been making that work (often by putting several lip pencils or thin gloss containers in one slot).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At any rate, this is a nice solution if you have a lot of lip products and not a lot of space, and want to have everything visible and collected together in one spot.  (Note: I see from the other reviews there may be some variation in this product.  I have bought three of these and they all have tiers.  But it sounds like that is not the case for everyone.  If you don&#x27;t get what you expected based on the photo, contact Amazon!)</li>
            <li> Made out of a heavy clear plastic. It makes access to my lipsticks so easy. The clear plastic makes it easy to see the organized lipsticks.</li>
            <li> Love it. Keeps all my lip sticks together and the display looks great! Good product. My friends love it too.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s worth the money and I&#x27;m getting organized.</li>
            <li> I am in love!!! I been collecting Mac lipsticks and I finally wanted to display them, instead of throwing them in my make up bag. The arylic is nicr and thick and heavy. Its not one of those cheap acrylic that will break easily if dropped. I ordered this acrylic organizer and it shipped fast and I received it today on a sunday!!! Tomorrow I&#x27;ll be receiving another Mac order and I can&#x27;t wait to fill this baby up all the way.</li>
            <li> I am not using it as a lipstick holder but it fit my needs perfectly-  May even get another one!!!&lt;br /&gt;Serves my purpose!</li>
            <li> Love this. Perfect for holding and displaying my lip stick collection. I would recommend it and it is at a good price.</li>
            <li> The product is just what it is described for.&lt;br /&gt;Holding lipstick.&lt;br /&gt;Just got it and I like it so far.</li>
            <li> This is a very nice lipstick holder and it arrived in perfect condition. Looks great on my vanity. I only gave it 3 stars because the picture shows the tiers to be raised, however the product I received, the tiers all on the same level. Although it&#x27;s not exactly what I was looking for, it was cheap enough that I will still keep the item. I will definitely be contacting the company about posting misleading product information.</li>
            <li> Ordered this b/c wanted my lipsticks to be easier to pick out, had them in a cute leather bag b4 but always hated how I had to look thru so many b4 I found the one I wanted to use for the day. NOW, Im so happy I got this holder. LOVE IT! and have 4 extra slots left (guess I need to go shopping, lol) It looks great on my counter and it is well made, better than expected. Very happy with this purchase.</li>
            <li> Great item. Really keeps lipstick , lip gloss, mascaras easy to see. Don&#x27;t have to hunt through the mess. Would recommend.</li>
            <li> I like the quality and it looks very nice also. Holds all types of lipsticks from any brands, I also store my urban decay eye shadow primer in it.</li>
            <li> The material used for this was so much more sturdy and shiny than I expected. From a distance it almost looks like crystal. I was extremely pleased!</li>
            <li> I love that I can now have my lipsticks and glosses all organized in one place.  I can easily see what tube I am grabbing and the color.  The lipstick slots are at one level.  They do not rise so that each row is higher than the other.</li>
            <li> just what i wanted: high quality acrylic, holds 24 lipsticks, and significantly cheaper than the version at bed, bath &amp; beyond or container store.</li>
            <li> I gave four stars because when it says tiered, it really means higher as in the container holder not higher as in elevated in the rear which means towards the front you have a shorter shaft so sticks may tobble. You&#x27;ll be able to put items like glosses, liners and such in the rear and lipsticks on front. It holds my Macs (upside down) Revlon and loreal lipsticks. I&#x27;m happy with the quality and sturdiness of this product. Pretty on my vanity. Hope y&#x27;all enjoy this.</li>
            <li> Arrived broken. Using anyway. Holds square tubes.</li>
            <li> So I have a ton of lipsticks but I would always forget to use some of them because I had them in a drawer and would be in a rush getting ready without time to sort through and pick one.  I bought this and now I have 24 lipsticks displayed for easy access while I am getting ready and it looks great on my vanity.  Now all of my friends want one.  I will purchase another one in the future when I reorganize my vanity.  The only problem I had with this was that in the picture it shows the lipsticks are stacked in tiers but the tiers are actually on the same level so my lipsticks are evenly behind each other.  The holder itself is shaped in tiers but the lipsticks lie flat.  I still really like it and it makes them more accessible when I am getting ready.</li>
            <li> I SELL BEAUTI-CONTROL COSMETICS AND IT HOLDS ALL OF MY LIPSTICKS AND THERE IS ROOM FOR EVEN MORE!  JUST SLIP IT INSIDE MY ROLLING COSMETIC CASE AND EVERYTHING STAYS NEAT AND ORGANIZED.</li>
            <li> Holds 24 lipsticks/lip glosses as advertised. Sturdy and seems durable so far. I recommend it to keep your lipsticks organized.</li>
            <li> This fits all sorts of lipsticks perfectly!!!</li>
            <li> Product is better then I expected. Really nice and sturdy. I also received it about a week before the estimated delivery time!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s too shallow.  I like to display my lipsticks upside down so I can see the colour. It can fit a lipstick that is flat on both ends but it won&#x27;t hold a lipstick that is rounded at the tip like ones from MAC or Bite Beauty.  Those flop all over the place. The square tubes from Nars are perfect. The third row is higher than the second, which is higher than the front (like stadium seating).  It sounds better in theory but is overall, unnecessary.</li>
            <li> Great product, exactly as described. Thanks!</li>
            <li> Love the graduated incline.  Every type of lipstick that I own fits in this holder.  This is made of VERY clear, thick, and durable acrylic.</li>
            <li> This has not come threw the mail yet ,but it&#x27;s what I have been looking for to put my stickles bottles in and its going to work out just fine .I&#x27;m just glad I found this on your site Thanks</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t tell from the picture whether the lipsticks would be on different levels, but thought the use of the term &amp;#34;tier&amp;#34; indicated that there were levels...  Instead I got an organizer that just has three rows.  No levels.  Just three  flat rows.  Going to return.</li>
            <li> I LOVE this product!!  I wanted something to hold my tubes while I am filling them with lip balm.  It works PERFECTLY!!</li>
            <li> This is a must have for any makeup collection.This item came in handy to organise my many  lipsticks and to have them where I can see and use them more efficiently. You can&#x27;t beat the easy access factor :)</li>
            <li> Definitely does not look cheap. That&#x27;s the only the I was afraid of. The light reflects on it great and I like how it has different heights. I have seen other models and some cover up the lipstick too much . This one does not it perfectly displays and holds the lipsticks . Perfect lipstick holder ! (:</li>
            <li> Perfect storage, doesn&#x27;t feel cheap or anything.</li>
            <li> I bought it as a gift for my daughter - she is very happy with it! SHe keeps her lipsticks all organized, it doesn&#x27;t take so much space on vanity table and is always at hand! WE love it!</li>
            <li> Works great.  Exactly as described.  Convenient to have.  Would recommend.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been on the search for a lipstick holder so I could organize the many lipsticks I have in my drawer.  Based on previous reviews that said that this would hold MAC&#x27;s rounded bullet lipstick tubes upside down, I bought this holder, but the MAC lipsticks wobble around, and don&#x27;t stat put in it.  (I&#x27;m also having the same problem with my Julie Hewett lippies since they have the same rounded top.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does hold my Nars, Revlon, and other lipsticks just fine, but is too shallow for long lipgloss tubes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll keep this for my other brands, but will be on the hunt again for something for my MAC tubes so that they stay firmly in place.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The quality of this is nice, though, and it really has a small footprint, while holding a lot.</li>
            <li> This holds all my lipsticks perfectly and is the right size for what I was needing. Great quality too and so far I haven&#x27;t had any issues with it.</li>
            <li> I have a large lipstick selection and this holds all of my standard sized lipsticks perfectly! It also looks really nice all filled up.</li>
            <li> This product was just what I was looking for, for my m.a.c. lipstick collection. It made my morning get ready routine so much easier. The holes are big enough for the lipsticks as well as the lip glass line. I also put a few brushes and liners into some of the open spaces.</li>
            <li> I purchased this for my everyday lipsticks that I want to see right away and not go into my normal storage container of lipsticks.  My disappointment is not with the product quality as it is heavy duty and quite nice in that regard.  My disappointment is that it looks in the picture (shown) to be tiered.  However, it is not.  So, if you are looking for a tiered container, don&#x27;t purchase this.  Also, the lipstick holders themselves are not really that deep so some tall lipstick containers sway one way or another not straight up (such as the MAC lipsticks--very good example).  I did not send it back but it is not 100% in my book.</li>
            <li> Great product, great quality.</li>
            <li> looks cute in my vanity and the tier shape makes it wasy to look for my colors&lt;br /&gt;really thick lipsticks won&#x27;t fit</li>
            <li> I am able to fit all my MAC lipsticks into these and have them stand upright w/o leaning.  I also have Revlon and Maybelline tubes that I have been buying as of late that fit with no problems.  As one rater stated, it is not angled as the picture depicts, it is straight and flat, the picture is very deceiving and almost caused me not to purchase it.  It came quickly after being ordered.  Great buy for the price.</li>
            <li> My make-up drawer, counter, and bags were a mess. I needed something where I could put all of my lipsticks in one place so when I need them, I can find them. I order this along with another organizer and it did the trick…now everything is in one place.</li>
            <li> This holder is great, you put your lipsticks in it upside down so you can read the color on the bottom, keeps you very organzied.</li>
            <li> I needed a nice way to store my lipsticks without them just being thrown in a drawer. Storing them like this is perfect, now I can see what I have and it is nicely displayed in one place. The acrylic is very sturdy ad easy to clean. I would highly recommend this product for lipstick storage as well as re purchase</li>
            <li> Perfect for lipsticks and lip glosses. I have since ordered 2 more.  (Yes I have a lipstick addiction)</li>
            <li> This does exactly what it needs to do. I&#x27;ll probably order another one!</li>
            <li> Fits my lipsticks, lip glosses and crayon lippies perfectly. It seems very sturdy and you can&#x27;t beat the price, other ones of the same are much more pricey.</li>
            <li> I feel so cheated. My merchandise came cracked. The item is not as described. The description does not say that it may come damaged. I sent pictures of it and no one would respond accordingly. I would never purchase this item again. I feel so cheated out my money.</li>
            <li> Love it for holding lipsticks. Definitely not angeled though. It&#x27;s all one size, doesn&#x27;t get taller like it looks in the picture. Also fits perfect in the IKEA alex 9 drawer except for tall lipsticks such as wet and wild unless you put them in one of the deeper drawers.</li>
            <li> Holds my lipstick perfect nice way to keep things organized</li>
            <li> See my profile for how I use these. I love them</li>
            <li> Disappointed.  I should have really looked at this item.  It looks tiered but it&#x27;s not.  The sides give the appearance of the items in the back sitting up higher than the items in the front but that is not the case.  All on the same level at eye level it makes it difficult to see in the back.</li>
            <li> I love, love, love this little implement.  Just wish it was a bigger.  I seem to be a lipstick addict :)</li>
            <li> This was great...I worked in retail many years and have tons of lipsticks, I needed a place to store them so that I could actually see them and use them and this worked.  I actually got two of them and could of almost used one more.</li>
            <li> this is the second one I buy I love this organizer</li>
            <li> This arrived in such PERFECT condition! It really looks so adorable when you put all your lipsticks/lip glosses in it and makes finding them much easier. VERY sturdy and you can fit pretty much any lipstick in it (MAC, Bobbi Brown, Revlon &amp; L&#x27;Oreal fit) I recommend this :)</li>
            <li> Best quality for the price! It is heavy-duty and amazing for lipstick!  I wouldn&#x27;t suggest using it for lipgloss because it does tip over.  Mine holds MAC, Maybelline, NYX, Rimmel, Inglot... If you like to place your MAC lipsticks upside down, they won&#x27;t sit perfect and will tip sideways.</li>
            <li> An excellent item. Sparkly and elegant and good quality. I own two and they are almost filled up... I will be ordering more, for sure!</li>
            <li> holds my lipsticks, lip glosses - regardless of the size. Great investment!</li>
            <li> Too shallow for most lipsticks.</li>
            <li> This sturdy little case holds just enough - I use it for lipsticks, lip pencils and mascara. You could put it on the counter but I use it in a drawer and it is very convenient. Classic.</li>
            <li> Simply awesome! Clear, cute, and so convenient to store my lipsticks :) I would honestly recommend this to anyone who doesn&#x27;t like having cluttered makeup!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great, it helps me keep track of my lipsticks and great with organizing too!!</li>
            <li> I agree with other reviews, it does seem in the picture that it would be taller in the back, but it&#x27;s all one level. I like the product just fine. It displays my lipsticks very nicely.</li>
