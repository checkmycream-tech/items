            <li>It&#x27;s amazing.</li>
            <li>Amazing product.  </li>
            <li>The consistency is close if not identical, but it doesn&#x27;t seem to be nearly as effective in protecting my hair from all the heat sources it has to endure.</li>
            <li>Also great to dab on during the day for a quick pick me up .</li>
            <li>Changed to this as I moved north for the winter and my hair needs more protection.</li>
            <li>It is more &amp;#34;moisturizing&amp;#34; in that it does keep fly-aways to a minimum and makes it shiny.</li>
            <li>It does a much better job than anything I&#x27;ve ever tried.  </li>
            <li>I love this stuff.  </li>
            <li>Makes my hair so healthy and sleek looking.</li>
            <li>Also, it&#x27;s more pungent, which isn&#x27;t the end of the world, but I thought the fragrance of the other was just perfect.  </li>
            <li>Love this product and it was received quickly</li>
            <li>Wonderful and does not leave my hair feeling heavy or greasy.</li>
            <li>Keeps my hair looking and feeling healthy, shiny and soft even though I use heat-producing appliances on it every day.  </li>
            <li>company shipped it super fast too.</li>
            <li>Also I may add that I live in super sticky sweaty humid Florida and it will keep my hair pretty straight in the summer.</li>
            <li>This is the only product that really protects my super fine hair and makes it have a nice texture when blow drying it with a round brush.</li>
            <li>It really protects the hair and gives smoothness and silk like feeling.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t like this nearly as much as I used to, and suspect they may have altered the formula when they changed the packaging.  </li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t really tell a difference</li>
            <li>I have long and blonde hair, and I love it !</li>
            <li>Smells Fabulous and protects your hair from blow dryer and flat iron use.  </li>
            <li>This helps me get my hair straight, soft and flowing.</li>
            <li>I took one star off because it is really easy to use slightly too much and end up with flat, greasy hair.</li>
            <li>Help styling and make your hair really soft and shining.</li>
            <li>, I came home applied this cream, the balm and used the iron, it was instantly soft and straight.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I live in California which is dry and my hair is also bleached so it works really well.</li>
            <li>I do not notice the formula being any different from when it was in the old packaging.</li>

            <li> Yes, they are expensive, but I&#x27;ve spent much more money over the years on crappy products, plus you need much less product compared to other ones.  </li>

            <li> Was using the regular Ciment Thermique. Changed to this as I moved north for the winter and my hair needs more protection. This helps me get my hair straight, soft and flowing. It is more &amp;#34;moisturizing&amp;#34; in that it does keep fly-aways to a minimum and makes it shiny. I took one star off because it is really easy to use slightly too much and end up with flat, greasy hair. Also smells wonderful.</li>
            <li> Excelent product. For use with hair dryer</li>
            <li> It does a much better job than anything I&#x27;ve ever tried.  I hardly need to flat iron anymore.</li>
            <li> This is the only product that really protects my super fine hair and makes it have a nice texture when blow drying it with a round brush.</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing!</li>
            <li> I been used this nutritive conditioner for long time and I never order through amazon I was concern with all the kerastase products I order because it was a big saving and I always spend a lot money for all this products ,so I took the risk and I&#x27;m VERY HAPPY IS LEGITIMATE !! I will order again thank you !!</li>
            <li> It really protects the hair and gives smoothness and silk like feeling.</li>
            <li> Very good product. Help styling and make your hair really soft and shining.</li>
            <li> I have long and blonde hair, and I love it !</li>
            <li> Great product. Use a bit of it on damp hair - it protects when you use hairdryers and curling irons.</li>
            <li> Love this product and it was received quickly</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like this nearly as much as I used to, and suspect they may have altered the formula when they changed the packaging.  The consistency is close if not identical, but it doesn&#x27;t seem to be nearly as effective in protecting my hair from all the heat sources it has to endure. The end result is not where I need it to be. Also, it&#x27;s more pungent, which isn&#x27;t the end of the world, but I thought the fragrance of the other was just perfect.  Long story short, this is my last purchase...after all these years...</li>
            <li> I love this stuff.  I flip between this brand and Davines only cause my hair likes change every now and again.  Protects, softens, and shines.  Also I may add that I live in super sticky sweaty humid Florida and it will keep my hair pretty straight in the summer.</li>
            <li> Great product at a good value!</li>
            <li> Smells Fabulous and protects your hair from blow dryer and flat iron use.  Also great to dab on during the day for a quick pick me up .</li>

            <li> This stuff is the greatest. Makes my hair so healthy and sleek looking. Will always use this as long as they&#x27;re making it</li>
            <li> Keastase never disappoints. Its a great product!</li>
            <li> Kerastase did away with the Nectar Thermique I was using and replaced it with this one. It&#x27;s basically the same product I&#x27;ve used for the last 8 years. Wonderful and does not leave my hair feeling heavy or greasy.</li>
            <li> Best hair product ever!! I do not notice the formula being any different from when it was in the old packaging.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s amazing. I live in California which is dry and my hair is also bleached so it works really well. My hair now is so shiny!</li>
            <li> Amazing product.  I recently started using Kerastase products, and I&#x27;m kicking myself for not doing it earlier.  Yes, they are expensive, but I&#x27;ve spent much more money over the years on crappy products, plus you need much less product compared to other ones.  And I have a TON of frizzy, dry hair.&lt;br /&gt;Last time I went to my hairdresser she styled my hair and it was sooo crunchy and ugly, I came home applied this cream, the balm and used the iron, it was instantly soft and straight.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t think twice, get this!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The company shipped it super fast too.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t really tell a difference</li>
