    <ol>
            <li>This stuff works great!  </li>
            <li>Great product!</li>
            <li>She is very happy with the results.  </li>
            <li>Both were amazing!!!!!!</li>
            <li>This is the BEST product ever made for scars!!!!!</li>
            <li>I purchased this for my sister and it has worked great on her acne scars.  </li>
            <li>I hope she will have good results eventually.</li>
            <li>You will not be able to return this product, or get a refund, so you will be stuck with a $30 product that does nothing.</li>
            <li>sure if I&#x27;ll purchase it again,</li>
            <li>so I didn&#x27;t really expect this product to work as great as it has.</li>
            <li>My scars and brushing seem so much lighter already!!!!</li>
            <li>Not sure if its helping or my scar is looking better because of time and a great doctor.</li>
            <li>This product is definitely worth the money.</li>
            <li>Well worth the wait.</li>
            <li>I started applying this right after my stiches were removed from my 4&amp;#34</li>
            <li>My boyfriend had no clue that I was using new products and on my second day my skin looked so much better!  </li>
            <li>I like it because it hasn&#x27;t caused more pimples, and though I&#x27;ve only used it for just over a month</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had pretty severe acne scarring from years of acne damage</li>
            <li>The Kinerase Scar Healing Therapy prevents the formation of most new scars for me if applied directly after the pimple starts shrinking</li>
            <li>darkness of the scars has definitely lightened after 3 weeks of usage, but more have to be seen for the dented scars which forms a large portion of my complexion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I liked how light the application is (didn&#x27;t feel like it was sticky or it took too long to dry)</li>
            <li>On top of that, it heals new breakouts faster, preventing further scarring.</li>
            <li>purchased this product in the hopes that it could improve, even a slight improvement I would have been happy with, some teenage acne scarring that I still had.  </li>
            <li>I have been using for awhile now, don&#x27;t see much of a difference in my scare.</li>
            <li>UNEQUIVOCALLY, THIS PRODUCT DOES ABSOLUTELY NOTHING FOR ACNE SCARRING.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m interested in smoothing scars and ensuring their colour returns to normal skin colour.  </li>
            <li>none of which really did the trick.</li>
            <li>An added benefit is that I started applying it on all of my new zits and they heal much faster and don&#x27;t scar at all!    </li>
            <li>For new dark scars, it does lighten but takes around 4 weeks or more.</li>
            <li>She said she highly recommend trying out this product.</li>
            <li>I googled alot of sites for the bet acne cream and Kinerase was highly rated cos of the silicon formula.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t have high hopes for this but stuck with it.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s useful for new facial scars (those damn pimples) if you are patient to wait.</li>
            <li>The scar is large and raised and red.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s said to be better for raised scars, which is bad news for most of my dented scars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It does nothing much for old facial indented scars.</li>
            <li>I bought kinerase hoping that it would get rid of my old scars and have been very pleasantly surprised with the results.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not greasy and makes your face feel really soft.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s still too early to say if this product does all this, but there is some smoothing.</li>
            <li>There&#x27;s a 3 year old motobike burn scar on my thigh which has not lighten at all; I&#x27;ve given up hope on</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used things like Mederma, Acnefree scar cream, even all natural stuff like vitamin E oil, coconut oil, and olive oil...</li>
            <li>but I have used it on old scars and it does not reduce their size or change their color at all for me.</li>
            <li>I never expected this!</li>
            <li>This lotion is the only thing I have come across that actually makes my skin look normal.</li>
            <li>I have dark acne scars from cystic acne and was pretty upset about the sudden breakout.</li>

            <li> Over 6 months of consistent, twice daily use should be a long enough time to at least see a minor amount of improvement and without question, I&#x27;ve seen ZERO.</li>
            <li> this goes a long way, applied 2X daily.</li>
            <li> I agree with previous reviewer&#x27;s that it does leave your skin feeling soft, however I am not paying close to $40 for a 1 oz. tube of product to make my skin feel</li>

            <li> I must start with the fact that I have dry skin,acne-prone skin,uneven skin and sometimes cystic acne break-outs.</li>
            <li> I have been using it for three and a half months, morning and night, and there has been a big difference!</li>
            <li> I used it until the tube was empty</li>

            <li> I have been using for awhile now, don&#x27;t see much of a difference in my scare.</li>
            <li> I had terrible acne in high school, and after doing a round of accutane was left with slightly less terrible acne and a tendency towards scarring. Every zit I get leaves a dark red-pigmentented mark that fades over six months or longer and often leaves an impression.  I bought kinerase hoping that it would get rid of my old scars and have been very pleasantly surprised with the results. I have been using it for three and a half months, morning and night, and there has been a big difference! My scars are not completely gone, but it has reduced their appearance and the amount of time it takes for them to heal dramatically. An added benefit is that I started applying it on all of my new zits and they heal much faster and don&#x27;t scar at all!    This product is definitely worth the money. It isn&#x27;t an overnight miracle, but it does work. Well worth the wait.</li>
            <li> I used it a couple of months and couldn&#x27;t tell any difference. I did like how it felt on my face though. It&#x27;s not greasy and makes your face feel really soft.</li>
            <li> My skin drinks this up each time I use it. Living in MN the air has zero moisture in the winter months. This lotion is the only thing I have come across that actually makes my skin look normal.</li>
            <li> I purchased this for my sister and it has worked great on her acne scars.  Some of her scars were ice pick scars and this smoothed those out as well.  She said she highly recommend trying out this product.</li>
            <li> Tried it for a month, no difference</li>
            <li> Kinerase Scar Healing Therapy also did not work for me.  I used it until the tube was empty but I DID NOT NOTICE ANY RESULTS.</li>
            <li> This stuff is not very good, and it can break you out. When I bought it, it was shipped through amazon, which usually means you can return it, if there is a problem. Well, not this stuff. You will not be able to return this product, or get a refund, so you will be stuck with a $30 product that does nothing. This is the second time I have paid $30#or more for a horrible product that I can´t use.</li>
            <li> I liked how light the application is (didn&#x27;t feel like it was sticky or it took too long to dry) and I applied it twice a day for three weeks...but the scar just doesn&#x27;t seem to look much different to me.</li>
            <li> Didnt make any difference</li>
            <li> no difference using product</li>
            <li> I bought this product from a beauty internet site, due to it being cheaper there than on Amazon, and started using the product on 09.05.13.  I used this product as directed 2 times every day for the next 6+ months.  I agree with previous reviewer&#x27;s that it does leave your skin feeling soft, however I am not paying close to $40 for a 1 oz. tube of product to make my skin feel soft.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I purchased this product in the hopes that it could improve, even a slight improvement I would have been happy with, some teenage acne scarring that I still had.  UNEQUIVOCALLY, THIS PRODUCT DOES ABSOLUTELY NOTHING FOR ACNE SCARRING.

            <li> I&#x27;m interested in smoothing scars and ensuring their colour returns to normal skin colour.  It&#x27;s still too early to say if this product does all this, but there is some smoothing.</li>
            <li> I cannot believe the results I achieved with this gel. I must start with the fact that I have dry skin,acne-prone skin,uneven skin and sometimes cystic acne break-outs. I had a terrible cystic acne scar that was 4 years old,gone. I have been getting little break-outs and apply it to the braak-outs,gone. I now use a regular facial wash instead of all of the acne crap and my skin has become a little dry, I put a little gel on the dry area,gone. I don&#x27;t care what negative reviews I read about this gel,nonsense this gel is a miracle.</li>
            <li> I like it because it hasn&#x27;t caused more pimples, and though I&#x27;ve only used it for just over a month, I feel that it has reduced the size of my acne scars. On top of that, it heals new breakouts faster, preventing further scarring.</li>
            <li> This stuff works great!  I started applying this right after my stiches were removed from my 4&amp;#34; frankenstein scar on my neck and you can tell it has worked just in the few months I&#x27;ve been applying it.  And that&#x27;s missing an application here or there. Don&#x27;t be alarmed about the size...this goes a long way, applied 2X daily.</li>
            <li> Have been using this gel for the past 3 weeks. I have dark acne scars from cystic acne and was pretty upset about the sudden breakout. The pimples have mostly healed but the scars were terrible, and makeup is a must to hide the imperfections. I googled alot of sites for the bet acne cream and Kinerase was highly rated cos of the silicon formula. It&#x27;s said to be better for raised scars, which is bad news for most of my dented scars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The darkness of the scars has definitely lightened after 3 weeks of usage, but more have to be seen for the dented scars which forms a large portion of my complexion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;addendum: been using this for past 4 months. It does nothing much for old facial indented scars. For new dark scars, it does lighten but takes around 4 weeks or more. There&#x27;s a 3 year old motobike burn scar on my thigh which has not lighten at all; I&#x27;ve given up hope on it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not sure if I&#x27;ll purchase it again, but it&#x27;s useful for new facial scars (those damn pimples) if you are patient to wait.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had pretty severe acne scarring from years of acne damage so I didn&#x27;t really expect this product to work as great as it has. I&#x27;ve used things like Mederma, Acnefree scar cream, even all natural stuff like vitamin E oil, coconut oil, and olive oil...none of which really did the trick. I didn&#x27;t have high hopes for this but stuck with it. Within 3 weeks, I could slowly see a difference in my skin. My face seemed fuller where there once were indentations, and the pock marks looked smaller. The dark marks also started to disappear. I&#x27;ve used it for about a month now, and bought another bottle from amazon. My friends have noticed a significance change in the complexion of my skin as well. Great product!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for about one month, I did not see the results, but I think you have to follow the instructions.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product for my daughter.  She is very happy with the results.  There has been noteable visible improvement in her acne scars from using this product on her face.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Cocoa Butter,  Mederma,  Mederma PM, Scar Away......EVERYTHING you can buy! Then one day a girl at Ulta told me about this. I was skeptical,  but figured I&#x27;d try it since nothing else was working.&lt;br /&gt;I also bought the trial size face wash/cream set. Both were amazing!!!!!! My boyfriend had no clue that I was using new products and on my second day my skin looked so much better!  I never expected this! My scars and brushing seem so much lighter already!!!! I use it twice a day, and very little.  This is the BEST product ever made for scars!!!!!</li>
            <li> using on a surgical scar, I had stage two malignant melanoma and use this where the surgeon remove the cancer. The scar is large and raised and red. Not sure if its helping or my scar is looking better because of time and a great doctor. I will keep using it anyway.</li>
            <li> I bought this cream for my daughter she is 22 and she has lots of small scars from acnes on her face. She has used that for 3 weeks already but I don&#x27;t see any changes on her skin. I hope she will have good results eventually.</li>
            <li> I get small keloids very easily, such as from acne. The Kinerase Scar Healing Therapy prevents the formation of most new scars for me if applied directly after the pimple starts shrinking but I have used it on old scars and it does not reduce their size or change their color at all for me.</li>
