            <li>the mirror is a great addition to my toiletries.</li>
            <li>but hey, what can you do but works great</li>
            <li>/&gt;it&#x27;s a great thing to have.</li>
            <li>its not as great as thought it would be.</li>
            <li>MORE THAN THE MIRROR!!</li>
            <li>all though for the money the product well be good if taken care of.</li>
            <li>When I found this one at Amazon, I was thrilled.  </li>
            <li>so I could cut my own hair.</li>
            <li>I paid a very fair price and it is made very poorly.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>IT IS VERY CHEAPLY MADE.</li>
            <li>Love it, just like the one I broke, that I have been using for more years than I care to count.  </li>
            <li>Most people do not have anyone that can MAYBE fix the problem.</li>
            <li>For many years I have used the Rucci neck mirrors.  </li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t have more to say about it.</li>
            <li>It would be better if the top swirled around.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s okay</li>
            <li>I wish it bent more</li>
            <li>but it is okay</li>
            <li>A metal frame would have been more stable for my need of this mirror.  </li>
            <li>This version is cheap, cheap, cheap!</li>
            <li>Its cheap</li>
            <li>This type of mirror is great to cut the back of your hair.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s cheaply made.</li>
            <li>it.&lt;br /&gt;It was  just cheaply made.</li>
            <li>MY OTHERS WRAPPED AROUND FROM THE RIGHT AND WERE ALOT MORE ADJUSTABLE THAN THIS ONE.  </li>
            <li>The old metal frame from these type of mirrors made many years ago was so much better.  </li>
            <li>I turn it to tighten it and it quickly loosens.  </li>
            <li>They arrived so quickly</li>
            <li>I had a mirror of this type previously and loved it.  </li>
            <li>The mirror is the same type but very light weight.  </li>
            <li>exactly what I wanted.  </li>
            <li>When I opened the first one I began to use it and the mirror fell out, hit the sink, and broke.  </li>
            <li>Actually, if I had purchased this in metal rather than the plastic framing, it would be a lot more usable.  </li>
            <li>I purchased this as an aid to be able to trim my hair, and view the back of my head while doing so.  </li>
            <li>the plastic isn&#x27;t strong enough to hold the mirror around your neck.</li>
            <li>This mirror isn&#x27;t strong enough to stay on your neck!!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a nice little mirror.  </li>
            <li>I isn&#x27;t made very well</li>
            <li>Thanks for asking how good/bad it is.</li>
            <li>She did call me and said the mirrors are what she expected  and is well pleased.</li>
            <li>There is only one bottom screw holding the neck of the mirror on whereas the old ones had another screw at the top to hold &amp;  adjust the mirror.  </li>
            <li>have no small children playing with</li>
            <li>I have been using Around The Neck Mirrors since I was 15 years old, and I am now 70 years of age.  </li>
            <li>it surprised both of us.  </li>
            <li>(By the way, when looking at the larger picture of them on the Amazon website, it shows the old version with the 2 screws and hinges in place.!!!</li>
            <li>It is useful in other ways, though.  </li>
            <li>Its just too flimsy to hold a position long enough for a steady view during this process.  </li>

            <li> Mirror is to small and it doesn&#x27;t stay on your neck ,because you move around to much to try and see the back of your head.</li>
            <li> The mirror is smaller than i expected which is my fault because the dimensions were advertised by the seller.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I am wondering if I can send the other two back as I know</li>
            <li> Around the neck mirror, regular and 3x viewing, Black Color Frame    </li>
            <li> Would like something a little stronger and larger  </li>
            <li> and it is always slipping</li>
            <li> only real complaint about the product is that when using my hands while the mirror is hanging around my neck, the screw piece loosens by itself and I have to continually stop what I am doing to readjust it back in order to maintain the same viewpoint I had before .</li>
            <li> HOWEVER, the part that fits on your chest is not wide enough and you are constantly having to work with it before cutting any hair.</li>
            <li> It was very small around neck and only one screw.</li>
            <li> The shipping was too expensive, it cost as high as the mirror itself.</li>
            <li> The mirror was actually smaller than I expected provided an awkward view from the back</li>
            <li> I wish I had bought another round the neck mirror.  </li>
            <li> But this cheap crap is still here online, it should be taken off.</li>
            <li> color does not fit the bathroom</li>
            <li> The mirror was too small, and very hard to maneuver, you can hardly see the back of your head</li>
            <li> THE MIRROR IS WAY TO SMALL</li>
            <li> When it&#x27;s small like this, it tends to tip.  </li>
            <li> It seems that there was a little bit of glue or rubber cement on each side holding it in place along with a couple of small pieces of cardboard!!.  </li>
            <li> The plastic frame makes the mirror very inflexible and not very steady at all.  </li>
            <li> I know it&#x27;s to late now.</li>
            <li> I wish the bottom base was a little larger though.  </li>
            <li> they are no good.  </li>
            <li> Did not like it all, poor quality, it hurts my neck.</li>
            <li> I will be wary of making purchases through Amazon.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s impossible to adjust the mirror around the neck</li>
            <li> I am disappointed in this product.</li>
            <li> This product is crap, i bought bought this in july 2011</li>
            <li> I was really disappointed, the price was&amp;#34;nt bad but, with the shipping cost, I would never have ordered it!!</li>
            <li> Very disappointed.</li>

    <ol>
            <li> It won&#x27;t stay up.  I turn it to tighten it and it quickly loosens.  The mirror part turns all the time and you can&#x27;s tighten it.  I wish I had bought another round the neck mirror.  I had one that I broke similar to this and never had this problem.</li>
            <li> The mirror was too small, and very hard to maneuver, you can hardly see the back of your head which is what I use the neck mirror for.  The shipping was too expensive, it cost as high as the mirror itself.</li>
            <li> Around the neck mirror, regular and 3x viewing, Black Color Frame    I had a mirror of this type previously and loved it.  When I found this one at Amazon, I was thrilled.  The mirror is the same type but very light weight.  Also the screw doesn&#x27;t hold the mirror and it is always slipping and then I can&#x27;t see the back of my head which is the PURPOSE of the mirror.  I am disappointed in this product.</li>
            <li> This product is crap, i bought bought this in july 2011 and it broke in 2 days. I never returned it. It was very small around neck and only one screw.Now am looking for another. But this cheap crap is still here online, it should be taken off.</li>
            <li> I isn&#x27;t made very well the plastic isn&#x27;t strong enough to hold the mirror around your neck. Its cheap but thats what I got.</li>
            <li> The plastic frame makes the mirror very inflexible and not very steady at all.  The old metal frame from these type of mirrors made many years ago was so much better.  I would not recommend this neck mirror at all.  Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> Mirror is to small and it doesn&#x27;t stay on your neck ,because you move around to much to try and see the back of your head. I was really disappointed, the price was&amp;#34;nt bad but, with the shipping cost, I would never have ordered it!! This mirror isn&#x27;t strong enough to stay on your neck!! Thanks for asking how good/bad it is. I have it stuck away in a drawer. It&#x27;s no-where like the one we had in the Day!!!  1st time I&#x27;ve ordered from the internet, did&#x27;nt know how or possibly to return. I know it&#x27;s to late now. Will only purchase  merchandise I can see and touch.</li>
            <li> THE MIRROR IS WAY TO SMALL AND IT WRAPS AROUND FROM THE LEFT.  MY OTHERS WRAPPED AROUND FROM THE RIGHT AND WERE ALOT MORE ADJUSTABLE THAN THIS ONE.  IT IS VERY CHEAPLY MADE. I WOULD NOT ORDER ANOTHER.  BESIDES THAT HE SHIPPING COST MORE THAN THE MIRROR!!</li>
            <li> Love it, just like the one I broke, that I have been using for more years than I care to count.  I have been using Around The Neck Mirrors since I was 15 years old, and I am now 70 years of age.  Can&#x27;t comb my hair without one.</li>
            <li> the mirror is a great addition to my toiletries. when you have artheritis and a short arm reach you need all the help you can get.</li>
            <li> its what I was looking for!</li>
            <li> It should be bigger my fault for not reading the size.</li>
            <li> all though for the money the product well be good if taken care of. Like anything  else it can not be abused.</li>
            <li> exactly what I wanted.  color does not fit the bathroom but hey, what can you do but works great&lt;br /&gt;  thank you  violet</li>
            <li> I purchased the mirror so I could cut my own hair. This type of mirror is great to cut the back of your hair. HOWEVER, the part that fits on your chest is not wide enough and you are constantly having to work with it before cutting any hair. I think when I can get it to my father he can do something to help. Most people do not have anyone that can MAYBE fix the problem. Whoever makes this product needs to fix the problem.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a nice little mirror.  I wish the bottom base was a little larger though.  When it&#x27;s small like this, it tends to tip.  Otherwise,&lt;br /&gt;it&#x27;s a great thing to have.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not at all up to expectation. It&#x27;s impossible to adjust the mirror around the neck so one can view the back of the head. It&#x27;s cheaply made. I will be wary of making purchases through Amazon.</li>
            <li> For many years I have used the Rucci neck mirrors.  So I ordered 3 of them again this time.  WHOA!!! This version is cheap, cheap, cheap! The neck &amp; all are lighter weight plastic.  There is only one bottom screw holding the neck of the mirror on whereas the old ones had another screw at the top to hold &amp;  adjust the mirror.  When I opened the first one I began to use it and the mirror fell out, hit the sink, and broke.  It seems that there was a little bit of glue or rubber cement on each side holding it in place along with a couple of small pieces of cardboard!!.  I am wondering if I can send the other two back as I know they are no good.  (By the way, when looking at the larger picture of them on the Amazon website, it shows the old version with the 2 screws and hinges in place.!!! Not so!!!)</li>
            <li> For the price it is functional however considered quality to be on the low end! The neck piece is very fragile one has to be carful in use.</li>
            <li> Would like something a little stronger and larger  Will consider ordering something else.  Don&#x27;t have more to say about it.</li>
            <li> I paid a very fair price and it is made very poorly.&lt;br /&gt;I expect it to break at any minute.&lt;br /&gt;I have no small children playing with it.&lt;br /&gt;It was  just cheaply made.</li>
            <li> The mirror was actually smaller than I expected provided an awkward view from the back</li>
            <li> its not as great as thought it would be.</li>
            <li> It would be better if the top swirled around.  The screw that is to tighten on the bottom, does not keep the mirror from tilting.</li>
            <li> Did not like it all, poor quality, it hurts my neck.</li>
            <li> The mirror is smaller than i expected which is my fault because the dimensions were advertised by the seller.&lt;br /&gt;My only real complaint about the product is that when using my hands while the mirror is hanging around my neck, the screw piece loosens by itself and I have to continually stop what I am doing to readjust it back in order to maintain the same viewpoint I had before .</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s okay describes it perfectly it does what it is said to do. I wish it bent more but it is okay</li>
            <li> Mirror could be bigger</li>
            <li> I helped our neighbor who wanted me to order these mirrors.  They arrived so quickly it surprised both of us.  She did call me and said the mirrors are what she expected  and is well pleased.</li>
            <li> Actually, if I had purchased this in metal rather than the plastic framing, it would be a lot more usable.  But, the plastic is flimsy.  I purchased this as an aid to be able to trim my hair, and view the back of my head while doing so.  Its just too flimsy to hold a position long enough for a steady view during this process.  It is useful in other ways, though.  A metal frame would have been more stable for my need of this mirror.  kc cascone</li>
