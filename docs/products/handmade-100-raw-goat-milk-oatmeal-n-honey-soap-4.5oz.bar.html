            <li>It&#x27;s so nice to find a moisturizing, skin-friendly soap that doesn&#x27;t reek of cloying perfumes.</li>
            <li>and it lathered up nice on my sponge.</li>
            <li>wonderful soap and great for dry skin</li>

            <li>I love this soap and think everyone who uses it will see a difference in their skin.</li>
            <li>I guess the soap is ok</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>I love the oatmeal texture on my skin.  </li>
            <li>but I will be buying more</li>
            <li>I have severe allergies to perfumes, so it pleased me greatly to find that these soaps are gentle on my skin and my nose.  </li>
            <li>but I do love it.</li>
            <li>I had no idea that soaps can have oatmeal, although we have it for breakfast on most mornings.</li>
            <li>Both my mom and my daughter used it and it really helped both of them greatly.</li>
            <li>My boyfriend and I love this soap, we&#x27;ve been on the goat milk kick for about a year.</li>
            <li>I like this better than the &amp;#34;fancy&amp;#34; soaps from department stores.  </li>
            <li>The smell is okay, lathers well</li>
            <li>I love this soap and so do my daughters.</li>
            <li>It is more a wax than anything else and the bar deteriorates in the shower even when it is not being used.</li>
            <li>Pretty good soap, but for the price you better seal it up after every use otherwise your bar might become microscopic.</li>
            <li>I usually am not a big review writer, but I was sort of compelled to write this one since we are so happy with this amazing product.</li>
            <li>The Oatmeal &#x27;n Honey had a really nice, kind of early smell to it that I enjoyed</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s amazing how much softer my skin feels.  </li>
            <li>I really enjoy this soap.  </li>
            <li>nice soap but gets very bumpy ans</li>
            <li>Very nice product, will be re-ordering as soon as I get low.</li>
            <li>It gets you clean, makes suds, smells good, and leaves your skin feeling soft.</li>
            <li>My mom, being a cancer patient for years, develop skin rashes easily and they become severe quick.</li>
            <li>And, I even got a tiny sample bar - how nice!</li>
            <li>I enjoy the lather, and fresh smell.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s perfect for dry and sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>With a little internet search, found out that oatmeal is actually really good for many skin problems.</li>
            <li>The soap is pretty good, but seems to wear down rather quickly, so you have to make sure you put it away after you lather up.  </li>
            <li>I like this flavor particularly because it barely has a scent, just good old &#x27;clean&#x27; :)</li>
            <li>The scent of the soap is light, but very nice for male or female.  </li>
            <li>It left my skin feeling nice and smooth instead of dry like most soaps do and the smell lingered on me for a while.</li>
            <li>A very gentle soap.</li>
            <li>My skin has changed and Im actually online now attempting to buy more for my husband and kids.</li>
            <li>after using this product my skin feels so smooth and soft</li>
            <li>Love it doesn&#x27;t dry out skin</li>
            <li>But the order got to my home fast and the goat milk soap worked wonders on my kids and My skin.</li>
            <li>What I really like about this soap is that the oatmeal acts as an exfoliator and the milk acts as a moisturizer.  </li>
            <li>Really what can you say about soap.</li>
            <li>my beard is much softer.</li>
            <li>Its smell is fresh and natural, and doesn&#x27;t leave a perfumey smell, which is one of the reasons I purchased it.  </li>
            <li>I use it on my face and it has really helped my acne.  </li>
            <li>and I plan on buying more in the near future</li>
            <li>For the price just got to an organic store like Whole  Foods or Earth Fare and get a decent product.</li>
            <li>The smell is mild if not next to non-existent</li>
            <li>This costs more but well worth it and an average bar last me about 6 weeks</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this soap.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>I love this soap it lathers really well and leaves your skin soft unlike the big batch made commercial goats milk soap.</li>
            <li>I am a man with sensitive skin and wash my face with it before I shave and after, it really helps with razor burn.</li>
            <li>Live and learn.</li>
            <li>The breakouts are under control and new skin is taking its place.  </li>
            <li>Be sure not to leave it where can get even a little bit wet in the shower, or it will disappear very fast!</li>
            <li>I could tolerate the oatmeal being ground a little finer, as some pieces are rather large and are scratchier than I would like sometimes, especially when using on my face, but I do love this soap.  </li>
            <li>If it would last a bit longer and was cheaper, I would rate it higher.</li>
            <li>just make sure after using it, put it a dry place,  away from shower and or faucet to keep it from getting wet</li>
            <li>dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After a couple days of using this I can clearly see and feel the difference.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin and the oatmeal in the soap is too abrasive for me.</li>
            <li>my skin is way to sensitive for anything else.</li>
            <li>Hurts when you use it directly in your skin</li>
            <li>So when one of our friends suggested oatmeal soap for my mom and daughter, we were surprised.</li>
            <li>My daughter, being a teenager, gets acne and rashes on her face frequently.</li>
            <li>Big thanks goes to the manufacturers.</li>
            <li>I particularly chose this soap not only for the oatmeal, but for the combination of it with goat milk and honey.</li>
            <li>Each bar lasts a little longer than two weeks for me (every day use and sometimes more than once a day, single user).  </li>
            <li>I like this soap, so far I&#x27;m on my second bar</li>
            <li>and it removed all my makeup and left my face feeling soft and moisturized.</li>
            <li>I have only used this product a few times but so far I really like it.</li>

            <li> I have only used this product a few times but so far I really like it.</li>
            <li> but I can barely stand to use it because the oatmeal is so rough on my skin.</li>
            <li> This one leaves my skin soft and slightly exfoliated without making me smell like potpourri.</li>
            <li> doesn&#x27;t last as long as some other reviews said they did.</li>
            <li> Feels sharp enough to sand wood.</li>
            <li> I keep it it on a bristled brush so that it stays dry between uses, and there are A LOT of uses!  </li>
            <li> It does not lather excessively like a lot of commercial soaps, but it does enough to get the job done.  </li>
            <li> I have very dry skin and this soap has helped me a lot with the flaky skin.  </li>
            <li> When I ordered it I was curious about it due to 1)</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve followed the recommendation from other reviewers to keep this shielded from being splashed or wet when not needed so that it lasts longer.</li>
            <li> only thing I can complain about is that the bars are a little small, but if this product helps with our KP</li>
            <li> This soap is not worth the money.</li>
            <li> Zero flaking as we enter the cold, dry season here in New England and</li>
            <li> or else you&#x27;ll use it all up in just a few days.</li>
            <li> but the soap dried my skin out.</li>
            <li> I used each bar for no more than a week and a half tops.</li>
            <li> If I buy it again I would get a plain soap.</li>
            <li> A little expensive</li>
            <li> a little painful to use.</li>
            <li> I mean ZERO!!!</li>
            <li> I purchased this for a friend with very bad eczema.  </li>

            <li> Aloha:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used your Handmade Milk Soap Oatmeal &#x27;n Honey Soap for a shower once and found that the best soap I have ever used. I also use this to shave with.&lt;br /&gt;Sincerely,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Louis B.</li>
            <li> I loved the product...  When I ordered it I was curious about it due to 1) I have never used goat milk soap before  2) I didn&#x27;t know when I would even receive the order...  But the order got to my home fast and the goat milk soap worked wonders on my kids and My skin. I would recommend this product to everyone and I plan on buying more in the near future</li>
            <li> Love this product. I&#x27;ve recommended it to anyone and everyone. My skin has changed and Im actually online now attempting to buy more for my husband and kids. Thank you for this product!</li>
            <li> I purchased this for a friend with very bad eczema.  They have been using it regularly and having excellent results.  The breakouts are under control and new skin is taking its place.  Awesome product!</li>
            <li> Love this soap!  I&#x27;m about to order more of it so that I&#x27;ve always got a spare!  I keep it it on a bristled brush so that it stays dry between uses, and there are A LOT of uses!  It&#x27;s amazing how much softer my skin feels.  Very happy to have found this soap, and plan on being a repeat customer for quite some time.</li>
            <li> Nice soap!! All I could ask for in a bar of soap!!</li>
            <li> after u shower u can feel the difference ....</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this soap on my face 2 or 3 yrs. now handmade by Horse&#x27;O Peace Ranch and purchased at Amazon.  What I really like about this soap is that the oatmeal acts as an exfoliator and the milk acts as a moisturizer.  I stop using it for a while when I ran out, but my skin didn&#x27;t feel or look as well.  I love this soap and think everyone who uses it will see a difference in their skin.</li>
            <li> My boyfriend seems to like it.</li>
            <li> I am a man with sensitive skin and wash my face with it before I shave and after, it really helps with razor burn. I also have some sun damage and it has helped to heal that.</li>
            <li> Neutral scent, does not irritate my dermatitis, but I do not like the harshness/scratchiness of the oatmeal bits. If I buy it again I would get a plain soap.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and the oatmeal in the soap is too abrasive for me. I guess the soap is ok but I can barely stand to use it because the oatmeal is so rough on my skin. Feels sharp enough to sand wood. I wont purchase again.</li>
            <li> wonderful soap and great for dry skin</li>
            <li> Love it. Really what can you say about soap. It gets you clean, makes suds, smells good, and leaves your skin feeling soft. Great soap.</li>
            <li> I love this soap it lathers really well and leaves your skin soft unlike the big batch made commercial goats milk soap. This costs more but well worth it and an average bar last me about 6 weeks</li>
            <li> Each bar lasts a little longer than two weeks for me (every day use and sometimes more than once a day, single user).  I love the oatmeal texture on my skin.  It does not lather excessively like a lot of commercial soaps, but it does enough to get the job done.  I will continue buying.</li>
            <li> I love the soap, it&#x27;s great.  Also, the oatmeal acts as a exfoliant.  Will buy again</li>
            <li> I like this soap, so far I&#x27;m on my second bar and I haven&#x27;t had a break out or even itchy skin!!!!!!!  A little expensive but I will be buying more my skin is way to sensitive for anything else.</li>
            <li> Smells delicious and feels very nourishing to the skin.  It&#x27;s not the cheapest soap in the world, but you get what you pay for!  This is good stuff and I will continue to purchase for my family and as gifts.</li>
            <li> I have severe allergies to perfumes, so it pleased me greatly to find that these soaps are gentle on my skin and my nose.  I highly recommend this soap.</li>
            <li> Love it doesn&#x27;t dry out skin</li>
            <li> wasnt&#x27; thrilled with the product.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t care for the smell and very coarse and bumpy. Hurts when you use it directly in your skin</li>
            <li> Great product! Arrived as promised, on time and everything.</li>
            <li> I bought this after reading about tips on keeping your beard from flaking and itching and that goats milk based soaps were the solution. Using brand name face washes from Target and the like never seemed to do the trick and left my skin feeling dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After a couple days of using this I can clearly see and feel the difference. Zero flaking as we enter the cold, dry season here in New England and my beard is much softer. The smell is mild if not next to non-existent which is nice and I&#x27;ve followed the recommendation from other reviewers to keep this shielded from being splashed or wet when not needed so that it lasts longer.</li>
            <li> This soap was nice for our skin, but dissolves so quickly!!! We went through two bars in two weeks..... Be sure not to leave it where can get even a little bit wet in the shower, or it will disappear very fast!</li>
            <li> It is great with my skin &amp; hair.  I will buy it again.  I wish it was cheaper but I do love it.</li>
            <li> Very nice product, will be re-ordering as soon as I get low. A very gentle soap.</li>
            <li> This soap is lovely! The scent of the soap is light, but very nice for male or female.  It lathers up well!  It arrived very quickly, as well!  And, I even got a tiny sample bar - how nice! I am very pleased.  Will order Horse &#x27;O Peace Ranch soap again!</li>
            <li> I really enjoy this soap.  The goats milk leaves my skin feeling soft and moisturized, and the oatmeal exfoliates wonderfully.  I could tolerate the oatmeal being ground a little finer, as some pieces are rather large and are scratchier than I would like sometimes, especially when using on my face, but I do love this soap.  Its smell is fresh and natural, and doesn&#x27;t leave a perfumey smell, which is one of the reasons I purchased it.  Will definitely be ordering again!</li>
            <li> Pretty good soap, but for the price you better seal it up after every use otherwise your bar might become microscopic. The soap is pretty good, but seems to wear down rather quickly, so you have to make sure you put it away after you lather up.  If it would last a bit longer and was cheaper, I would rate it higher.</li>
            <li> This soap is great.  I have very dry skin and this soap has helped me a lot with the flaky skin.  I love it!!</li>
            <li> nice soap but gets very bumpy ans it gets smaller...a little painful to use.</li>
            <li> The soap size is a lot smaller than the featured picture.</li>
            <li> I had no idea that soaps can have oatmeal, although we have it for breakfast on most mornings. So when one of our friends suggested oatmeal soap for my mom and daughter, we were surprised. With a little internet search, found out that oatmeal is actually really good for many skin problems. My mom, being a cancer patient for years, develop skin rashes easily and they become severe quick. My daughter, being a teenager, gets acne and rashes on her face frequently. I particularly chose this soap not only for the oatmeal, but for the combination of it with goat milk and honey. Both my mom and my daughter used it and it really helped both of them greatly. I usually am not a big review writer, but I was sort of compelled to write this one since we are so happy with this amazing product. Big thanks goes to the manufacturers. Only if this was a bit cheaper, I would buy it for the whole family for even everyday use, no question.</li>
            <li> Goat soap is the bomb for butt eczema! Use it and keep using it...</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so nice to find a moisturizing, skin-friendly soap that doesn&#x27;t reek of cloying perfumes. This one leaves my skin soft and slightly exfoliated without making me smell like potpourri. I&#x27;ll be ordering it again!</li>
            <li> I received if 3 days after purchase which was great and once I opened the package, there was a sample of unscented soap for me to try. The Oatmeal &#x27;n Honey had a really nice, kind of early smell to it that I enjoyed and it lathered up nice on my sponge. It left my skin feeling nice and smooth instead of dry like most soaps do and the smell lingered on me for a while. My boyfriend thought it smelt great. I used the unscented soap on my face since I tend to break out a lot there and it removed all my makeup and left my face feeling soft and moisturized. I really loved the product and I will be ordering it again.</li>
            <li> great stuff. doesn&#x27;t last as long as some other reviews said they did.</li>
            <li> I have only used this product a few times but so far I really like it. I especially like the bits of oatmeal. I bought this soap for my &amp;#34;chicken skin&amp;#34; - my daughter and I both have this on our arms. I read that goats milk soap with oatmeal is supposed to be great for Keratosis Polaris.&lt;br /&gt;The only thing I can complain about is that the bars are a little small, but if this product helps with our KP I will purchase again.</li>
            <li> best and effective goat milk soap I&#x27;ve ever used!</li>
            <li> after using this product my skin feels so smooth and soft i didnt even have to put lotion on. just make sure after using it, put it a dry place,  away from shower and or faucet to keep it from getting wet or else you&#x27;ll use it all up in just a few days.</li>
            <li> My boyfriend and I love this soap, we&#x27;ve been on the goat milk kick for about a year. It&#x27;s perfect for dry and sensitive skin. This soap came very quickly and was prime eligible (thank you!!). I like this flavor particularly because it barely has a scent, just good old &#x27;clean&#x27; :)</li>
            <li> Great soap.  I use it on my face and it has really helped my acne.  I like this better than the &amp;#34;fancy&amp;#34; soaps from department stores.  Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> The smell is okay, lathers well but the soap dried my skin out.</li>
            <li> I love this soap and so do my daughters.What a great find.I have been getting it from Amazon</li>
            <li> This soap is not worth the money. The overall quality is sub par... It is more a wax than anything else and the bar deteriorates in the shower even when it is not being used. I used each bar for no more than a week and a half tops. Literally the bar got smaller and smaller each day between showers. For the price just got to an organic store like Whole  Foods or Earth Fare and get a decent product.</li>
