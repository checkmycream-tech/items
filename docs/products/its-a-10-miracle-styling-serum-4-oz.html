            <li>Very good product.</li>
            <li>I am so happy I found it online for a great price (cheaper than ordering through the beauty store catalogue.)</li>
            <li>Great product.</li>
            <li>Great product for helping with tangled hair and damaged hair.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a 10 is a great product; no frizz, non-greasy on my hair, and it holds up for two days.</li>
            <li>The result was amazing!  </li>
            <li>most amazing hair serum!!!!!!!</li>
            <li>Smells good.</li>
            <li>It was good but not for my hair, my sister ended up using it and loves it</li>
            <li>OMG - This is the best product for my hair when I want to have it smooth and it is not greasy at all.</li>
            <li>Will surely buy again!</li>
            <li>Love this!</li>
            <li>so I ordered my own bottle of this serum.  </li>
            <li>So hopefully you are ok with complete strangers wanting a sniff of your beautiful hair!</li>
            <li>Which makes it even better.</li>
            <li>way better than bio silk and Than the ones from hair salons.</li>
            <li>I have tried SO many hair products to do what this does.</li>
            <li>And huge plus, it seems DEVINE.</li>
            <li>This product makes my hair shiny and makes it look fresh and healthy</li>
            <li>Everyone asks me why I smell so good and are surprised when I tell them it&#x27;s my hair.</li>
            <li>My hair stayed smooth and nice the whole day</li>
            <li>I have my hair streaked and this product brought the unique color of the streaks in my hair.  </li>
            <li>Nice product for frizz keeps hair soft and helps keep it straightened.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very pleased and when the bottle is gone, I&#x27;ll definitely be buying this again!</li>
            <li>It won&#x27;t leave your hair greasy, even feels great on your skin and hands and will not weigh your hair down.</li>
            <li>I love all of the products, but I especially love the serum because it gives me a tangible product I can manipulate through my dry hair and ends and feel the smooth and silkiness while I am blow drying or just giving my hair a heat break and let it dry naturally.</li>
            <li>I love this product, great for when hair when wet or done styling to smooth out dry ends.</li>
            <li>this is my second shipment of this product and I am very pleased Thanks</li>
            <li>I am an avid &#x27;</li>
            <li>Love this product but you have to be careful with amount you use as it is a thicker oil.</li>
            <li>I bought a bottle for my mom too and she has really frizzy/wiry hair</li>
            <li>I have very curly hair and after a shower this is what I use to get a brush through it.</li>
            <li>My hair is always misbehaving - gets a lot of frizz no matter how much hair product I use.  </li>
            <li>Also it has a very light smell so it doesn&#x27;t interfere with other fragranced products or perfume.</li>
            <li>I am a platinum blonde and take my hair through a drill course every three weeks, so finding a product that puts my hair back into tip top shape is a never ending search.</li>
            <li>Does what it says and it definitely takes care of my very frizzy Puerto Rican hair!!</li>
            <li>I bought this to replace the wen hair serum I used up (worked great but too expensive).</li>
            <li>It makes my hair so soft just like when my hairstylist does my hair.</li>
            <li>It enhanced the beauty of my hair completely.</li>
            <li>I usually have somewhat dry/frizzy ends, especially after blow-drying and straightening my hair, and I dye my hair too, so this really works well to help keep the ends smooth.  </li>
            <li>You only need a small pea-sized drop for shoulder length hair, and it really smooths your hair and makes it super soft!  </li>
            <li>4 oz. goes a long way as well, and lasts much longer than the leave in product sprays which is a big plus on the wallet.</li>
            <li>I originally purchased it at the salon in May 2011, and this small bottle lasted me over 2 1/2 years!  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this product for a few years, and this is the first time I have bought a replacement bottle.  </li>

            <li> I am an avid &#x27;It&#x27;s a 10&#x27; user. I am a platinum blonde and take my hair through a drill course every three weeks, so finding a product that puts my hair back into tip top shape is a never ending search. Until I found this product line. It is so hard to find the serum in stores, even in our local beauty store so  I am so happy I found it online for a great price (cheaper than ordering through the beauty store catalogue.) I love all of the products, but I especially love the serum because it gives me a tangible product I can manipulate through my dry hair and ends and feel the smooth and silkiness while I am blow drying or just giving my hair a heat break and let it dry naturally.

My mother snags this from me all the time (along with all my other hair products). It won&#x27;t leave your hair greasy, even feels great on your skin and hands and will not weigh your hair down. I only wish it came in a bigger size.</li>
            <li> Great product. Smells good. Relieves those edging hairs and smoothes them out. Would reccomend the product. Try and buy online, it tends to be cheaper that a beauty/or drug store.</li>
            <li> It was good but not for my hair, my sister ended up using it and loves it</li>
            <li> Love this product but you have to be careful with amount you use as it is a thicker oil.</li>

You only need a small pea-sized drop for shoulder length hair, and it really smooths your hair and makes it super soft!  I use it after blow-drying and straightening as a finishing smoother.  It smells amazing too!!  I usually have somewhat dry/frizzy ends, especially after blow-drying and straightening my hair, and I dye my hair too, so this really works well to help keep the ends smooth.  Beware if you use too much, it will make your hair dirty and greasy feeling!  I bought a bottle for my mom too and she has really frizzy/wiry hair and she is hooked on the stuff!</li>
            <li> Nice product for frizz keeps hair soft and helps keep it straightened. I will purchase this item again. Rated it a five star.</li>
            <li> Very good product. Definitely helps to create slippage when combing out my wet colored hair.</li>
            <li> I struggle with dry hair.. My hairstylist introduced me to this product. It makes my hair so soft just like when my hairstylist does my hair.</li>
            <li> Great product for helping with tangled hair and damaged hair. A little goes a long way... smaller than a pea size for medium thick hair &amp; medium length.</li>

            <li> I have tried everything for my hair and they Always leaves my hair greasy looking limp dull or even make my hair gather lint. This product makes my hair shiny and makes it look fresh and healthy</li>
            <li> this product tamed by frizzy hair and left my hair shining and curly.  No more dry friz.  I have my hair streaked and this product brought the unique color of the streaks in my hair.  It enhanced the beauty of my hair completely.</li>
            <li> Gives my hair shine, and smooths out the fly-away strands.  The smell is divine!  This is the only product that keeps my hair silky after straightening it.</li>
            <li> My hair is always misbehaving - gets a lot of frizz no matter how much hair product I use.  One of my niece has this and I tried it.  The result was amazing!  My hair stayed smooth and nice the whole day so I ordered my own bottle of this serum.  No more bad hair day for me.  My only complain is the pump - not working.</li>
            <li> most amazing hair serum!!!!!!! way better than bio silk and Than the ones from hair salons.</li>
            <li> Love this! It&#x27;s a must. I have tried SO many hair products to do what this does. I&#x27;m very pleased and when the bottle is gone, I&#x27;ll definitely be buying this again!</li>
            <li> Perfection. I bought this to replace the wen hair serum I used up (worked great but too expensive). It&#x27;s a 10 is a great product; no frizz, non-greasy on my hair, and it holds up for two days. Also it has a very light smell so it doesn&#x27;t interfere with other fragranced products or perfume.</li>
            <li> The It&#x27;s a 10 products are the best products I&#x27;ve ever used on my hair. The serum and the styling cream together are awesome.</li>
