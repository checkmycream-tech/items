    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>Works great!  </li>
            <li>It was the perfect gift for my girlfriend.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s so perfect when you have a lack of counter space.  </li>
            <li>All in all, great product</li>
            <li>I think it would make a great gift.</li>
            <li>Great travel bag</li>
            <li>I also am thrilled that I can use it so nicely for travel AND have storage for my jewelery as well:)&lt;br /&gt;Great investment and wonderful idea for Christmas giving too!</li>
            <li>Works good.</li>
            <li>and it has been working good.  </li>
            <li>Fit our needs perfectly.</li>
            <li>but I recommend that it&#x27;s just good sense to put &#x27;liquids&amp;#34; in a zip lock separate from this.</li>
            <li>I was expecting a bag that would be good for travel to carry cosmetics and toiletries.  </li>
            <li>LOVE this cosmetics bag!</li>
            <li>Ingenious!</li>
            <li>LOVE IT!</li>
            <li>LOVE IT!  </li>
            <li>Very cool concept!</li>
            <li>She loved it and clearly is very useful.</li>
            <li>They are the best for traveling and I&#x27;m amazed at how much I can fit in</li>
            <li>You&#x27;d be better off putting your stuff in a grocery bag.</li>
            <li>I believe this would be perfect for when I travel..which is why I gave this item only 4 stars...</li>
            <li>Maybe if you work the fabric more.</li>
            <li>But then it is ingenious and I love it.</li>
            <li>Great new colors too!</li>
            <li>My vanity top loves it, and my husband really loves that I own it!</li>
            <li>When you&#x27;re done, just pull the drawstring and easily stash your make-up somewhere else, leaving the vanity counter top uncluttered and available for your traveling companion to use.</li>
            <li>Ease of use...there is a video if you can&#x27;t figure it out, but it is easy.  </li>
            <li>It is super easy to find brushes, lipstick etc and the items are a million times easier to find.  </li>
            <li>I just love it, so much nicer than makeup strewn all over the bathroom!</li>
            <li>so much I bought 2 more for friends as gifts.  </li>
            <li>and i agreed w/ her the very first day i put my make up in it.</li>
            <li>---I travel extensively and wanted to be able to keep my makeup in an &amp;#34;everyday&amp;#34; bag at home that also travels easily.</li>
            <li>still a great product if you have a small amount of makeup for travel.</li>
            <li>Very handy to be able to see everything laid down flat rather than digging!</li>
            <li>neat idea, kind of looks a little cheap.</li>
            <li>At first, you have to tease the sides up a bit to make a lip to hold everything in.  </li>
            <li>what u see is exactly what u get.</li>
            <li>It takes up so much space, and it doesn&#x27;t close all the way - so skinny cosmetics like eyeliner will fall right out.</li>
            <li>Then pull the draw string and everything is bundled up nice and tight.</li>
            <li>The Layngo makes it easy to see and access your make-up when flat.  </li>
            <li>I love pink, so it doesn&#x27;t really matter.  </li>
            <li>I really like this makeup bag.</li>
            <li>You just load it up and when you arrive at your destination, you just lay it all out and have no trouble finding exactly what you need.</li>
            <li>I get ready at the gym everyday &amp; it is nice to be able to uncinch it &amp; automatically have my makeup laid out for me in one small area.</li>
            <li>I love this little cosmetic bag.</li>
            <li>the Layngo comes in a pink pouch which can be used for numerous items like travel sized bottles of your favorite shampoo, cleanser etc...</li>
            <li>But I ordered in the hot pink and received the silver.</li>
            <li>It really isn&#x27;t anything you would carry in your purse, and too small to hold much of anything.  </li>

            <li> When the bag is folded up but empty, it&#x27;s enormous!</li>
            <li> The cord is a bit long, so I trimmed mine and fused the frayed end with a lighter.  </li>
            <li> The stitching is not as close which in the long run may comprise the longevity of the item.  </li>
            <li> This is pretty small and stiff.</li>
            <li> Minus one star because the cinch cord is unnecessarily long &amp; often gets caught onto other items in my gym bag.</li>
            <li> and i can only hold a few products in it.</li>
            <li> closed.  </li>
            <li> I like to lay the COSMO flat on my lap with a little gather on the sides so the items don&#x27;t roll off.  </li>
            <li> This Lay-N-Go Cosmo is everything I expected!</li>
            <li> The rim keeps pencils, lipstick and other items from rolling into the sink or on the floor.  </li>
            <li> The reason I really wanted this was I continually digging to the bottom of my bag and never finding what I needed without dumping out the entire bad.  </li>
            <li> It is very small, only holds a  small amount of items.  </li>
            <li> Not sure.</li>
            <li> Also, small items have slipped out of the opening even when fully cinched.</li>
            <li> No more changing makeup bags.</li>
            <li> No more digging or dumping my make up and</li>
            <li> The fabric was not as thick as I would have thought it should be.  </li>
            <li> It is a bit expensive for what it is.</li>
            <li> He found it looking through my wishlist, but failed to notice the color I wanted was the snakeskin pattern.  </li>
            <li> This product is terrible.</li>

    <ol>
            <li> neat idea, kind of looks a little cheap. Works good. It&#x27;s made out of a cheaper quality nylon...</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t yet comment on the quality of this product, since I just received it. But I ordered in the hot pink and received the silver. My only option was a refund, not an exchange like I&#x27;d hoped. I&#x27;m still keeping it, but I don&#x27;t care for silver.</li>
            <li> LOVE this cosmetics bag! You just load it up and when you arrive at your destination, you just lay it all out and have no trouble finding exactly what you need.</li>
            <li> This product is terrible. When the bag is folded up but empty, it&#x27;s enormous! It takes up so much space, and it doesn&#x27;t close all the way - so skinny cosmetics like eyeliner will fall right out. You&#x27;d be better off putting your stuff in a grocery bag.</li>
            <li> This Lay-N-Go Cosmo is everything I expected! I just love it, so much nicer than makeup strewn all over the bathroom! I also am thrilled that I can use it so nicely for travel AND have storage for my jewelery as well:)&lt;br /&gt;Great investment and wonderful idea for Christmas giving too!</li>
            <li> I adore the concept of the Layngo.  I believe this would be perfect for when I travel..which is why I gave this item only 4 stars...it needs to be &amp;#34;road tested.&amp;#34;  BTW...the Layngo comes in a pink pouch which can be used for numerous items like travel sized bottles of your favorite shampoo, cleanser etc...</li>
            <li> i like this product because it is so nifty and helpful but it was considerably smaller then i was expecting and i can only hold a few products in it. still a great product if you have a small amount of makeup for travel.</li>
            <li> Works great!  My only issue was a part of the drawstring was sewn into seam of the lay n go so initially it wouldn&#x27;t cinch closed.  I got it to release and it has been working good.  Seller was efficient.</li>
            <li> It was the perfect gift for my girlfriend. She loved it and clearly is very useful. All in all, great product and I would recommend this product for anyone.</li>
            <li> Fit our needs perfectly.</li>
            <li> Hotel bathroom vanities are usually not big enough to set up your cosmetics and toiletries, and leave them out for the duration of the stay, especially if two people are sharing the bathroom. The Layngo makes it easy to see and access your make-up when flat.  When you&#x27;re done, just pull the drawstring and easily stash your make-up somewhere else, leaving the vanity counter top uncluttered and available for your traveling companion to use.</li>
            <li> This is pretty small and stiff. I bought it for my daughter and I don&#x27;t think she even used it once. Maybe if you work the fabric more. Not sure. I would not buy again.</li>
            <li> I really like this makeup bag. I get ready at the gym everyday &amp; it is nice to be able to uncinch it &amp; automatically have my makeup laid out for me in one small area. Minus one star because the cinch cord is unnecessarily long &amp; often gets caught onto other items in my gym bag. Also, small items have slipped out of the opening even when fully cinched. But I would purchase again. I think it would make a great gift. And it&#x27;s machine washable!</li>
            <li> I used to put my cosmetics on a towel when I traveled this folds up and is all there when I need it!</li>
            <li> Initially got this for travel but ended up using it every day!  It frees up surface space.  At first, you have to tease the sides up a bit to make a lip to hold everything in.  The cord is a bit long, so I trimmed mine and fused the frayed end with a lighter.  Have given a couple of these as gifts too.</li>
            <li> Very handy to be able to see everything laid down flat rather than digging!</li>
            <li> what u see is exactly what u get. my friend coudn&#x27;t stop raving about this product and i agreed w/ her the very first day i put my make up in it. it is bulky, tho.</li>
            <li> I love this little cosmetic bag. When it is open and everything is laid out where I can see it, the short sides keep things from rolling away. Then pull the draw string and everything is bundled up nice and tight. Ingenious! It is a bit expensive for what it is. But then it is ingenious and I love it.</li>
            <li> Great travel bag---I travel extensively and wanted to be able to keep my makeup in an &amp;#34;everyday&amp;#34; bag at home that also travels easily. No more changing makeup bags. This is big enough for my essentials, it travels well but I recommend that it&#x27;s just good sense to put &#x27;liquids&amp;#34; in a zip lock separate from this. I take this bag in the car, to the gym and in my suitcase. LOVE IT!</li>
            <li> I got this for my daughter, after she had raved about the Layngo bag she had bought for her kids Legos.  That is about 20 times the size of this bag.  It is very small, only holds a  small amount of items.  I was expecting a bag that would be good for travel to carry cosmetics and toiletries.  It really isn&#x27;t anything you would carry in your purse, and too small to hold much of anything.  Not recommended.</li>
            <li> Bought 3 last year for myself and daughters.  Like it so much I bought 2 more for friends as gifts.  They are the best for traveling and I&#x27;m amazed at how much I can fit in and it&#x27;s so perfect when you have a lack of counter space.  The rim keeps pencils, lipstick and other items from rolling into the sink or on the floor.  Great new colors too!</li>
            <li> LOVE IT!  My vanity top loves it, and my husband really loves that I own it!</li>
            <li> This was given to me as a gift from my husband.  He found it looking through my wishlist, but failed to notice the color I wanted was the snakeskin pattern.  I love pink, so it doesn&#x27;t really matter.  The fabric was not as thick as I would have thought it should be.  The stitching is not as close which in the long run may comprise the longevity of the item.  Ease of use...there is a video if you can&#x27;t figure it out, but it is easy.  The reason I really wanted this was I continually digging to the bottom of my bag and never finding what I needed without dumping out the entire bad.  I like to lay the COSMO flat on my lap with a little gather on the sides so the items don&#x27;t roll off.  It is super easy to find brushes, lipstick etc and the items are a million times easier to find.  No more digging or dumping my make up and all the brushes out every time I apply make up.  Very cool concept!</li>
