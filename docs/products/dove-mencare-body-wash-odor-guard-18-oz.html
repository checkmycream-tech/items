            <li>Favorite body wash.</li>
            <li>I was expecting a bit more &amp;#34;scent&amp;#34; - probably because I just switched from Axe -</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d go 5 Stars if it had more &amp;#34;Dove-like&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>My oldest son&#x27;s favorite body wash.</li>
            <li>The smell is excellent and lasts a long time.</li>
            <li>Very effective, particularly for the price.</li>
            <li>The scent is nice and clean and it rinses easily.</li>
            <li>Leaves you smelling good and leaves that fresh clean feeling.</li>
            <li>It is nice to be able to try higher priced items at a discounted price.</li>
            <li>But it does what it advertises, effective way to control odor and leaves your skin feeling fresh and moisturized.</li>
            <li>I got it because recently my husband had tried it and loved it!</li>
            <li>Husband had Never used this before but when it became available for such an INCREDIBLE price....</li>
            <li>This is hands down the best body wash I have ever used.</li>
            <li>Smells great and does last.  </li>
            <li>Smells nice, but really dries the skin every time I use it.</li>
            <li>So far so good I will be ordering this again</li>
            <li>Nice smell, does not dry out your skin, rinses easily.</li>
            <li>works as expected and great price.</li>
            <li>Good for the big boys.</li>
            <li>Wash lathers well and rinses off easily, strong almost overbearing smell with a likeness to an incredibly manly cologne which if you&#x27;re ensitive enough can lead to massive migraines.</li>
            <li>Worth the buy.</li>
            <li>I love the smell of this stuff, always leaves me feeling clean and smelling like a million bucks (not actually... thankfully).</li>
            <li>I love dove products in general.</li>
            <li>I like it, the smell is a bit strong, but that&#x27;s the point of the odor guard, minus one star for a powerful, axe-like smell that lingers and it stings the eye a bit, but it does leave me feeling clean and at elast I don&#x27;t smell like B.O.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t like the manly musky smell at first, but it grows on you.</li>
            <li>Just need to get my brother to stop using it ;)</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve received much positive feedback on the scent.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s okay for dry skin, however does nothing for body odor, my dad still smell like a garbage dump.</li>
            <li>My husband is very picky when it comes to scents/smells.</li>
            <li>works as expected now sbscribed for even better pricing.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a girl and very athletic</li>
            <li>dOVE IS VERY SCENTILATING</li>
            <li>but I really like it.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a &#x27;luxurious&#x27; lather which rinses clean and easy, leaves my normally rough, dry sun-exposed skin much smoother and moisturized.</li>
            <li>I highly recomend.</li>
            <li>I have used it for a while  Highly recommended</li>
            <li>/&gt;Pleasant smell, subtle, but effective.</li>
            <li>Sometimes you don&#x27;t even have to wear deodorant with this body wash because that&#x27;s how strong and long lasting it is.</li>
            <li>However, he likes the way it cleans and keeps him smelling fresh all day long.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin towards dyes and perfumes and this gives me no problems</li>
            <li>While I really like the scent of this body wash, I&#x27;m not the one that has to use it regularly.</li>

            <li> I&#x27;ve been through a couple bottles of this body wash (I don&#x27;t use it as a dedicated face wash, although the package indicates one could) and have been happy with it. The scent is nice and clean and it rinses easily.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s definitely pricey in my opinion but I think it works well and in dry Colorado keeps your skin hydrated.&lt;br /&gt;Pleasant smell, subtle, but effective. I&#x27;ve received much positive feedback on the scent.</li>

            <li> Every year I struggle to find something to give to all the guys in my family as a stocking stuffer. This year I got this and they all loved it!!! It may be my go-to for the future!!! I got it because recently my husband had tried it and loved it! Great product!!!</li>
            <li> This is a great body wash.I have received 3 compliments on how good it smells. Does not dry out my skin and during the winter I have problems with dry skin. I highly recomend.</li>
