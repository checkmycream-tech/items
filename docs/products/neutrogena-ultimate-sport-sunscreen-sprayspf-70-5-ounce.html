            <li>I feel this is the best product on the market for protecting your skin during high heat months in the sun.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;the product is very easy to use; yet i wish i could spray it on my face</li>
            <li>The spray application of Neutrogena&#x27;s popular Ultimate Sport Sunblock is an excellent addition to your sun protection arsenal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t swam with it, but for walking around on a hot day, its great.</li>
            <li>very light but not oily.  </li>
            <li>The spray bottle makes it easy to apply, which was nice.</li>
            <li>I love this brand.  </li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m rather pleased with this.</li>
            <li>I fell in love with spray bottles after using another sunblock product, so that this came in spray bottle form</li>
            <li>EXCELLENT  UVA PROTECTION MODERATE  </li>
            <li>I started using spray ons as soon as they appeared on the market and tried many, finding this one maybe four years ago.</li>
            <li>A favorite for softball.</li>
            <li>I love using neutrogena products.</li>
            <li>Most sunscreen can have a oily feeling and make me break out.</li>
            <li>The spray gives better coverage in this area and is easier to apply than the cream.</li>
            <li>I love Neutrogena.</li>
            <li>Neutrogena is one of the most trusted names in cosmetics.</li>
            <li>/&gt;it makes your skin attractively shiny; and protects you from summer&#x27;s most direct sun:</li>
            <li>Pleasant smell, not too much sticky residue.</li>
            <li>In fact I liked it a ton, and the sunscreen was quickly applied.  </li>
            <li>This product goes on easily, dries quickly, and is effective.</li>
            <li>so you can enjoy more without getting</li>
            <li>but rather a light floral smell appropriate for both sexes.</li>
            <li>easy to apply.</li>
            <li>IT&#x27;S ALSO EASY TO APPLY AND DOESN&#x27;T LEAVE YOU WITH THAT \\&quot;GREASY\\</li>
            <li>Convienant sunblock, easy to apply and use.</li>
            <li>It does not appear to wash off easily even with soap, ensuring it continues to protect during rigorous sporting activities.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>IT&#x27;S IMPORTANT TO ME</li>
            <li>When using the spray, I apply it to the underside of my hand and quickly smooth it on my face.</li>
            <li>Admittedly, it&#x27;s early in the season, but so far the results have been wonderful.</li>
            <li>We consistently get compliments on this sunblock on how good it smells, and personally I won&#x27;t buy anything else going forward because this sunblock is great for our whole family.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It may sound like a small point but regarding the spray version, the spray button is one of the best I have seen on any product.</li>
            <li>Spent a lot of time in the sun this Summer and this held up great.</li>
            <li>I even lived in Colorado Springs where the elevation makes the sun even more intense.  </li>
            <li>Thanks :)</li>
            <li>IT DRIES QUICKLY</li>
            <li>I would recommend pointing it away fron any surfaces because it tends to adhere quickly.</li>
            <li>thing to note is that you will run through the bottle quickly.  </li>
            <li>THAT THE PRODUCT GIVES GOOD LONG TERM PROTECTION WHICH IT DOES.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t detect any aroma when applying and the feel of the mist is not unpleasant on my skin.  </li>
            <li>Very water resistant and the smell isn&#x27;t strong when you spray it .</li>
            <li>I was out in direct sun in very hot and humid weather, so I ended up applying it more than I might have otherwise done.</li>
            <li>applied nicely and evenly and got Sharpie out of several pieces of furniture and spots on the walls where my 3-year-old son had gone street artist.</li>
            <li>/&gt;As far as sunblock goes, it did its job for the most part.</li>
            <li>The spray version goes on in a very fine mist and dries instantly which is also true for the lotion version, leaving no residue or greasy feeling.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried several other products, this is the best, in my opinion.</li>
            <li>THIS PRODUCT IS MUCH SUPERIOR TO ANY OF THE OTHER SUNBLOCK PRODUCTS ON THE MARKET.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It is fantastic for &amp;#34;Sport&amp;#34; as the name says but if you want a non-icky high protection this is for you.</li>
            <li>It is very practical, easy to use, non sticky and really protects.</li>
            <li>doesn&#x27;t last too long for the price, but easy to use and good protection for UVA and UVB</li>
            <li>I still live and love the Texas Sun particularly down in our Rio Grande Valley where we own a pad in an RV resort.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>can use this in the pool and it is a quick and gentle rup in liquid that is not greasy, oily, and will not leave my face looking like my wifes night cream.  </li>
            <li>Love this product; the only thing my husband will use.</li>
            <li>I have tried many different sunscreens.</li>
            <li>SUNSCREEN STABILITY EXCELLENT  HEALTH CONCERN  OTHER CONCERNS contains oxybenzone, contains vitamin A, spray, misleading SPF    OXYBENZONE  active ingredient 6%    </li>
            <li>The top twists with a positive &amp;#34;click&amp;#34; - two clicks actually</li>
            <li>/&gt;As sunscreens perform differently for different skin types it is difficult to say what will work best for you, however with an SPF of 70 it will certainly do an effective job of protecting the skin from harmful effects.</li>
            <li>We still like to actually rub it on to the skin though as it&#x27;s easy for it to accumulate on the surface or on body hair, and rubbing it in after spraying assures an even application.  </li>
            <li>When I think of Neutrogena I think of a product that is gentle to the skin and made with pure ingredients.</li>
            <li>This didn&#x27;t have much of a scent that I could detect, which will probably be a selling point for some.</li>
            <li>I really like their line of Sun screen products.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended!</li>
            <li>But I still get sunburn and tanned skin after reapplying it for the whole day.</li>
            <li>This spray  really works, and it&#x27;s convenient to use.</li>
            <li>So in the end, this product doesn&#x27;t preclude cream based sunscreens, especially for the face, but application is a lot more complete and easier for the trunk and limbs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>They make several others which are similar and they are just as good, giving a broad range of protection.</li>
            <li>I am an avid marathon runner and spend lots of time training in the sun and have Vitiligo (loss of skin pigment) which leaves me VERY sensitive to the sun.  </li>
            <li>&quot; FEELING MANY OTHER PRODUCTS DO.</li>
            <li>I particularly like it when I&#x27;m in the water -</li>
            <li>Easy to apply and convenient to carry and very convenient for those leading an active lifestyle.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not highly scented - especially not of artificial cocoanut as another major brand does.</li>
            <li>Luckily I&#x27;ve found it on Amazon so as long as I can get it</li>
            <li>All of us applied this to our faces, with none of us having any new acne appear.</li>
            <li>(There are other concerns about this class of organics for sunscreen use, but they are generally significantly safer that sunburns and skin cancers.)  </li>
            <li>Never bothers my sensitive skin - it&#x27;s Neutrogena afer all!  </li>
            <li>Neither does it leave a white film like many other sunscreens do.</li>
            <li>I will generally re-apply after a few hours just to make sure I am still covered.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s clear.</li>
            <li>Please do not use this sunblock if your skin is even remotely sensitive.  </li>
            <li>Also, after spraying it on my skin, I then spread it to ensure complete coverage.</li>
            <li>and you can visually see when it is in the ready to spray position or when it is locked.</li>
            <li>When you&#x27;re as white as me, it really makes a</li>
            <li>I like a little scent with my sunscreen, but whatever scent this had ended up fading away rather quickly.</li>
            <li>Had a Sunday season ticket plan for my local professional baseball team.  </li>
            <li>This sprays evenly without being too wet and protects against the sun very well.  </li>
            <li>Normal sunscreen typically will last much longer from a single container.</li>
            <li>It has no unpleasant odors and isn&#x27;t greasy once it has dried, which takes about two minutes in our dry climate.  </li>
            <li>Spray-on sunscreen is the secret to removing Sharpie markers from almost all surfaces, including fine furniture.</li>
            <li>I am very dark complected, use this every day in the summer, Las Vegas, very high heat.....</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Works well. easy to apply. I used it daily during the summer for an hour-long swim (or splash and swim).</li>
            <li> didn&#x27;t like it. the feel, the smell.</li>
            <li> i received my order promptly, and that is why i use amazon.&lt;br /&gt;the product is very easy to use; yet i wish i could spray it on my face: only, don&#x27;t do that because the fumes are a bit noxious (like hairspray) so hold your breath.&lt;br /&gt;it makes your skin attractively shiny; and protects you from summer&#x27;s most direct sun: so you can enjoy more without getting burned.&lt;br /&gt;i have tried this product extensively (before making this recommendation) and will use it again.</li>
            <li> I always get burnt if I put this on alone, but it&#x27;s great after I applied a lotion sunblock and re-apply with this. I particularly like it when I&#x27;m in the water - I just put it in the cupholder of my floatie and spray it every 30-60 minutes.</li>
            <li> I have had 18 skin cancers removed just from my head and face.  (total count is over 50)  I still live and love the Texas Sun particularly down in our Rio Grande Valley where we own a pad in an RV resort.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can use this in the pool and it is a quick and gentle rup in liquid that is not greasy, oily, and will not leave my face looking like my wifes night cream.  It just disapears, is waterproof (I play water volley ball 4 days a week) I also play tennis 5 times a week and the effectivness will not sweat off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is fantastic for &amp;#34;Sport&amp;#34; as the name says but if you want a non-icky high protection this is for you.</li>
            <li> The spray application of Neutrogena&#x27;s popular Ultimate Sport Sunblock is an excellent addition to your sun protection arsenal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First off, a few notes on usage.  We use this on arms, legs, fronts and backs.  It&#x27;s ease of application assures we don&#x27;t miss spots that rub on creams often do.  We still like to actually rub it on to the skin though as it&#x27;s easy for it to accumulate on the surface or on body hair, and rubbing it in after spraying assures an even application.  Also, don&#x27;t use this on the face or in poorly ventilated areas,  you probably don&#x27;t want to inhale all the organic compounds in this or any other sunscreen.  Finally, this sunscreen has oxybenzone in it which can cause skin sensitivity in some folks.  (There are other concerns about this class of organics for sunscreen use, but they are generally significantly safer that sunburns and skin cancers.)  So in the end, this product doesn&#x27;t preclude cream based sunscreens, especially for the face, but application is a lot more complete and easier for the trunk and limbs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Results with this sunscreen have been great for us.  When applied evenly (and reapplied every two to three hours when in the sun) we have not gotten burned once.  It has no unpleasant odors and isn&#x27;t greasy once it has dried, which takes about two minutes in our dry climate.  We buy it in bulk from amazon and save a lot over the drugstore prices. We always keep a can on hand for outside activities.</li>
            <li> I love this brand.  It doesn&#x27;t smell awful (not great, but not awful), isn&#x27;t greasy, and lasts a long time.  It&#x27;s great for sport use.</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t tried it yet, as the weather has not required it. Only problem I have with it is it is listed as sunblock, but labeled as sunscreen.</li>
            <li> Spray-on sunscreen is the secret to removing Sharpie markers from almost all surfaces, including fine furniture. The Neutrogena brand was excellent...applied nicely and evenly and got Sharpie out of several pieces of furniture and spots on the walls where my 3-year-old son had gone street artist. Pleasant smell, not too much sticky residue.</li>
            <li> I ended up purchasing this for my niece out of fear that regular sunblock would clog her pores and I&#x27;m rather pleased with this. (I got this on the last day of her visit with us even though the previous sunblock showed no signs of messing with her skin.) This didn&#x27;t have much of a scent that I could detect, which will probably be a selling point for some. I like a little scent with my sunscreen, but whatever scent this had ended up fading away rather quickly. The spray bottle makes it easy to apply, which was nice. I fell in love with spray bottles after using another sunblock product, so that this came in spray bottle form was a big factor for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As far as sunblock goes, it did its job for the most part. I was out in direct sun in very hot and humid weather, so I ended up applying it more than I might have otherwise done. I ended up with no sunburn, nor did any of my other family members. All of us applied this to our faces, with none of us having any new acne appear. (So if you&#x27;re wondering if you could use this on your face in a pinch, you can.)</li>

            <li> I really like their line of Sun screen products. Easy to apply and convenient to carry and very convenient for those leading an active lifestyle. I carry these on my bike pouches if going on medium to long rides in the summer</li>
            <li> Had a Sunday season ticket plan for my local professional baseball team.  I also play rugby.  Spent a lot of time in the sun this Summer and this held up great.</li>
            <li> It did not meet my expectations as it was not the product ordered.</li>
            <li> Avobenzone/Avobenzene in Neutrogena Ultimate Sport SPF 70 caused irremovable dark orange stains on all clothing worn while using this product. I have since found that the Oxybenzone in this product causes developmental/reproductive toxicity, endocrine/immunotoxicity, persistence and bioaccumulation, enhanced skin absorption, and biochemical or cellular level changes. In addition, the SPF rating is misleading, the FDA has determined that any SPF over 50+ is unnecessary. The UVA/UVB balance is only moderate, allowing skin damage (possibly skin cancer risk) without sunburning. Also, the fragrance used in NUS-SPF70 received a Hazard Score of 8 out of 10 for neurotoxicity and allergies/immunotoxicity. I would not recommend this sunscreen based on my own experience.</li>
            <li> Please do not use this sunblock if your skin is even remotely sensitive.  I purchased this because Neutrogena products typically work well on my somewhat sensitive skin.  I put this on and within one hour had a horrible rash all over my face, neck, and chest. I have never experienced anything so awful.  I stopped using it and (2 days later) the rash is still pretty bad.</li>
            <li> Works great!  Not sticky at all. And it breathes well.</li>
            <li> Best spray sunscreen I have used . Very water resistant and the smell isn&#x27;t strong when you spray it .</li>
            <li> great sunscreen spray for sport players.  very light but not oily.  i used them for lax practice every day.  thank you amazon!!!</li>
            <li> I kiteboard for hours at a time. I have been using the 70 Neutrogena for a year now and it works. I waste no time getting on the water since spraying is much faster than spreading a sunscreen. Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> It came to me damaged and one bottle was completely empty, with 2 others only half full - sprayed out mess in a bag is what I received!!</li>
            <li> Love this product; the only thing my husband will use.</li>
            <li> I am an avid marathon runner and spend lots of time training in the sun and have Vitiligo (loss of skin pigment) which leaves me VERY sensitive to the sun.  I even lived in Colorado Springs where the elevation makes the sun even more intense.  Use Neutrogena Ultimate almost daily; it protects my skin even after hours of exposure and sweat and even tears sometimes.  And it doesn’t stain my cloths like other products I’ve tried.  Living in Chicago now, I’ve been relegated to dark and gloomy winter runs with no risk of sunburn, but when Spring returns so will my use of Neutrogena Ultimate Sport Sunblock.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, I believe this has been discontinued. I have not found it in stores for two seasons now. Luckily I&#x27;ve found it on Amazon so as long as I can get it I will keep using it. I dislike sunscreen in lotion form - and unless you&#x27;re with other people when applying it, you&#x27;re out of luck getting it on hard to reach areas. I started using spray ons as soon as they appeared on the market and tried many, finding this one maybe four years ago. I like that is doesn&#x27;t have to be rubbed in after spraying, as some do, which makes no sense - you might as well use a lotion! It&#x27;s not highly scented - especially not of artificial cocoanut as another major brand does. Never bothers my sensitive skin - it&#x27;s Neutrogena afer all!  They make several others which are similar and they are just as good, giving a broad range of protection. You can&#x27;t go wrong with Neutrogena.</li>
            <li> I have tried many different sunscreens. This sunscreen provides great protection for hours. It doesn&#x27;t leave an oily residue. Neither does it leave a white film like many other sunscreens do. I will continue to use it for the days when I spend hours in the sun.</li>
            <li> THIS PRODUCT IS MUCH SUPERIOR TO ANY OF THE OTHER SUNBLOCK PRODUCTS ON THE MARKET. I AM FAIR SKINNED SO IT&#x27;S IMPORTANT TO ME THAT THE PRODUCT GIVES GOOD LONG TERM PROTECTION WHICH IT DOES. IT&#x27;S ALSO EASY TO APPLY AND DOESN&#x27;T LEAVE YOU WITH THAT \\&quot;GREASY\\&quot; FEELING MANY OTHER PRODUCTS DO. IT DRIES QUICKLY AND YOU DON&#x27;T FEEL LIKE YOU ARE USING SUNBLOCK.</li>
            <li> It is a good Sunblock but when you sweat it gets into eyes and make it burn.</li>
            <li> it is a good protection for you to avoid sun shine. however, it stimulates my eyes and I have no choice to stop using it.</li>
            <li> Works great.  The only thing I wasn&#x27;t too crazy about was the smell....didn&#x27;t smell like your typical sunscreen. But it works so that&#x27;s all that matters!</li>
            <li> Convienant sunblock, easy to apply and use. As a transplant receipant I am a target for skin cancers - this product exceeds the doctors recommendations</li>
            <li> Is a little bit too small, but I read the review and I think it&#x27;s good product. Even though I haven&#x27;t used it as yet, I know that Neutrogena sunblock spray are one of the best sunblock.</li>
            <li> It does what it is supposed to do. Sun protection for all over without being sticky! I use it daily.</li>
            <li> I am very dark complected, use this every day in the summer, Las Vegas, very high heat.....I just don&#x27;t burn when I load up with this spray. I feel this is the best product on the market for protecting your skin during high heat months in the sun.  I&#x27;ve tried several other products, this is the best, in my opinion. Kent Oram</li>
            <li> A favorite for softball.</li>
            <li> Get what you expected, delivery a little late</li>
            <li> I love using neutrogena products. Most sunscreen can have a oily feeling and make me break out. This product goes on easily, dries quickly, and is effective. I will generally re-apply after a few hours just to make sure I am still covered.</li>
            <li> This product was delivered on time and has been an excellent sunscreen. I am about to re-order it for this season&#x27;s sun protection.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t leave any sticky feels on your skin and it&#x27;s clear. But I still get sunburn and tanned skin after reapplying it for the whole day. I&#x27;d rather go back to the Neutrogena ultra sheer sunscreen spf 100.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a nationally ranked tennis player in the senior divisions, living and playing in Florida. I use the Neutrogena Ultimate Sport Sunblock Spray, SPF 70+ every day. I put it on in the morning after I shower--whether I&#x27;m playing tennis or not. In Florida, one can pick up sun driving, walking, or sitting next to a window in the house. This spray  really works, and it&#x27;s convenient to use. I would recommend pointing it away fron any surfaces because it tends to adhere quickly. Also, after spraying it on my skin, I then spread it to ensure complete coverage. I also spray it into the crown of my scalp--even though I wear a hat. The spray gives better coverage in this area and is easier to apply than the cream. Sometimes I use the spray on my face, and sometimes I use the cream. When using the spray, I apply it to the underside of my hand and quickly smooth it on my face. I have a fair complexion, and my dermatologist, whom I see at 3-month intervals, is pleased with the results that I&#x27;m getting.</li>
            <li> This is a great product.  It had all the proctection that I needed and I will definately purchase again and again.</li>
            <li> Sprays on well; dries in a few minutes, and because its SPF 70, provides all-day protection. I haven&#x27;t swam with it, but for walking around on a hot day, its great.</li>
            <li> We consistently get compliments on this sunblock on how good it smells, and personally I won&#x27;t buy anything else going forward because this sunblock is great for our whole family. Thanks :)</li>
            <li> My husband and I use it. It is very practical, easy to use, non sticky and really protects. I love Neutrogena.</li>
            <li> Neutrogena is one of the most trusted names in cosmetics. When I think of Neutrogena I think of a product that is gentle to the skin and made with pure ingredients. So when I saw that they are making sunscreen spray (they may have been making it for a while, I just have never seen it) I knew I had to try it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While I think Neutrogena products have one of the nicest scents on Earth, thankfully their sunscreen does not share it but rather a light floral smell appropriate for both sexes. The spray version goes on in a very fine mist and dries instantly which is also true for the lotion version, leaving no residue or greasy feeling. Thank you! Finally a sunscreen that doesn&#x27;t feel like you just got an oil change for your car dumped all over you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As sunscreens perform differently for different skin types it is difficult to say what will work best for you, however with an SPF of 70 it will certainly do an effective job of protecting the skin from harmful effects. It does not appear to wash off easily even with soap, ensuring it continues to protect during rigorous sporting activities.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It may sound like a small point but regarding the spray version, the spray button is one of the best I have seen on any product. The top twists with a positive &amp;#34;click&amp;#34; - two clicks actually and you can visually see when it is in the ready to spray position or when it is locked. The double-click adds a layer of security that it won&#x27;t accidentally open and spray in your purse or backpack.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like this sunscreen and intend to make it my preferred brand going forward and for that reason I recommend it as a 5-star product.</li>
            <li> It works as advertised. We used it all up on vacation and it protected us both. It is not greasy or messy once applied</li>
            <li> I bought this for my uncle because he likes this product for golf and other outdoor sports. But for me, I think it is too oil for girls.</li>
            <li> The sun has finally appeared locally and I received this order just in time.  This product is easy to use and has proven very effective in providing good sun protection during my outdoor activities.  I can&#x27;t detect any aroma when applying and the feel of the mist is not unpleasant on my skin.  It seems to last through hours of outdoor activity.  Admittedly, it&#x27;s early in the season, but so far the results have been wonderful.</li>
            <li> Good product... works as advertised.</li>
            <li> Great product.  Have tried other sunscreen/sunblock sprays and others tend to spray too wet.  This sprays evenly without being too wet and protects against the sun very well.  My two kids use it during swim team practice and never seem to burn.  I use it too and don&#x27;t seem to burn.  I also spray it on my scalp (on my part) because otherwise I would burn there too.  Even though the once size is smaller than some competing brands, the bottle seems to last longer because it sprays so evenly. Higly recommended!</li>
            <li> No es el producto que estaba buscando,requiero la devolución del dinero y enviar por el producto a la dirección entregada. Gracias</li>
            <li> doesn&#x27;t last too long for the price, but easy to use and good protection for UVA and UVB alike.- I recommend it</li>
            <li> I have no complaints about the sunscreen or the spraying mechanism.  In fact I liked it a ton, and the sunscreen was quickly applied.  When you&#x27;re as white as me, it really makes a difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One thing to note is that you will run through the bottle quickly.  I brought two on a 16 day white water rafting trip, and each bottle only lasted 4-5 days (and I was the only one using it!).  Normal sunscreen typically will last much longer from a single container.</li>
