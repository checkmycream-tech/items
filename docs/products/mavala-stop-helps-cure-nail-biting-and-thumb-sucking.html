            <li>and I&#x27;m happy she&#x27;s not biting anymore.  </li>
            <li>It works great as a reminder for her to keep he thumb out of her mouth.  </li>
            <li>Great product, but also</li>
            <li>Great rating--horrid taste.  </li>

            <li>I am so happy.  </li>

            <li>Very effective stuff.</li>
            <li>This product is amazing!</li>
            <li>but this one was amazing!</li>
            <li>Work perfectly, my son doesn&#x27;t suck his thumb any more</li>
            <li>had I known how effective it would be!  </li>
            <li>and her nails are growing so nicely!  </li>
            <li>Therefore, my crusade against nailbiting has not been as successful as I had hoped.</li>
            <li>I think it&#x27;s best to make sure your child is over the age of 3-4.</li>
            <li>yes, but effective!</li>
            <li>yes, is it pleasant...</li>
            <li>Really good product.</li>
            <li>Really good for someone that need to stop biting their nails.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Surprisingly, it happened in about a week.</li>
            <li>She started joking and saying it taste good.</li>
            <li>This worked soooo good.</li>
            <li>She loved how shiny her nails looked</li>
            <li>For $11.00 is really good  </li>
            <li>GOD is good.</li>
            <li>very good product.my daugther quit in 4 days.very easy</li>
            <li>I am the most happy person now.</li>
            <li>This habit was a torture for me and her father and every time I tried to talk some sense into her, she would tell me that her thumb was too good and that she liked it, end of story.  </li>
            <li>I LOVE THIS PRODUCT!</li>
            <li>So glad the orthodontist recommended this before installing a $300.00 wire to stop thumb sucking!</li>
            <li>It ruined more than one meal in my household!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so glad I found this on amazon!</li>
            <li>and I think it is safe to say the habit has been broke!</li>
            <li>This polish sure does leave its mark!</li>
            <li>and it did work immediately,  like magic!</li>
            <li>Love this!  </li>
            <li>I must say, that this stuff provides amazing results.</li>
            <li>This product did amazing.</li>
            <li>Absolutely amazing.</li>
            <li>Amazing.</li>
            <li>then but this product is amazing.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t tried it on my own nails</li>
            <li>but I honestly didn&#x27;t expect this to work.</li>
            <li>hope it is an effective deterrent.</li>
            <li>I tried the stuff you can get at Walmart, and in terms of being effective, there is no comparison.</li>
            <li>Mavala Stop is absolutely the best product of it&#x27;s type on the market today.</li>
            <li>But, he did acknowledge on his own that he wanted help to stop sucking his thumb.</li>
            <li>but honestly I&#x27;ve had an increased amount of stomach pain</li>
            <li>It dries quickly which is great.  </li>
            <li>But it worked wonderfully for my almost 4 year old!</li>
            <li>We applied every morning and night for a week to be sure, and he didn&#x27;t touch his thumb after the first day!!!!  </li>
            <li>This product worked wonderfully for my four-year old.  </li>
            <li>A great product that, to me, is worth every penny.</li>
            <li>So far so good!!!!!</li>
            <li>I tried this on my 2 year old and it works great!  </li>
            <li>This product is so easy to put on and it is working!  </li>
            <li>It has worked very fine even though I had my desicion made about leaving nail bitting.</li>
            <li>I thought this product was very good, but it didn&#x27;t work for my 3 year old son.</li>
            <li>He has not sucked his thumb at all for over a week, which is a huge deal!  </li>
            <li>This stuff&#x27;s been around for years, and now I&#x27;m wondering why more parents don&#x27;t use it before thumb-sucking becomes harmful to their kid&#x27;s bite.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve never been able to stop.</li>
            <li>, I ordered Mavala just to \\&quot;try one more thing\\&quot; and could not believe it...</li>
            <li>So for the most part the polish worked, but mostly as a threat to quit chewing.</li>
            <li>should I ever run out. :)</li>
            <li>The best part is that it only takes one brushful of this stuff to permeate the tips of each finger, and then some!</li>
            <li>If you want a lifetime of support and a push in the direction of a better you, and a better chance at opening those dreaded cans of beer you&#x27;ve always loathed, buy a bottle of Mavala.  </li>
            <li>It really works and has been great for him.</li>
            <li>i love it</li>
            <li>/&gt;Every once in a while now he will say, \\&quot;Look my thumb is all better now, \\&quot; or \\&quot;I</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s best to have one aside for back up.</li>
            <li>After the use the habit is corrected and do not need most of the unused product.</li>
            <li>Its a bit comical to because he keeps asking for juice and and making himself drool.</li>
            <li>It seems to be able to survive many hand-washings also.</li>
            <li>I may put it on the top of a trophy and display it for all who enter my home to see.</li>
            <li>Love it (-:</li>
            <li>She pulled a tantrum the day we put it on for the idea that she would not be able to suck it any longer but after 2 weeks, she was cured.</li>
            <li>he had a nail-biting free day and earned a sleep-over with a friend within 2 weeks!  </li>
            <li>Better than others weve tried</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t sure it would work.  </li>
            <li>I tried to stop biting my nails unsuccessfully for many years.</li>
            <li>But I told him if she vomited for more than two days I would stop giving it to her.  </li>
            <li>Now when I see my son thinking of sticking his thumb in his mouth he remembers the taste and thinks better of it.</li>
            <li>I have to make sure to apply it often</li>
            <li>but now she seems to be ok with not sucking her thumb.</li>
            <li>so she had to make adjustments to prevent her fingers from touching her mouth.</li>
            <li>it works great and they are all much healthier.</li>
            <li>and they feel better and the taste goes away.</li>
            <li>and that is the longest I have gone without touching them.</li>
            <li>I also bought some nail polish to paint my nails to help me even more.</li>
            <li>Put this on twice and magic.</li>
            <li>when she turned four i ordered some more and it worked after one application.</li>
            <li>Works better than most.</li>
            <li>First day she said, \\&quot;my fingers are spicy!\\&quot;  Amazing results!</li>
            <li>(he is now 8).</li>
            <li>I personally love this product.</li>
            <li>Someone suggested we give this a try, and I&#x27;m so glad they did.</li>
            <li>My friend recommended this and it works like magic.</li>
            <li>I just bought some more and will try to be more diligent about putting it on her every day (she is 6).</li>
            <li>/&gt;I am sure with the bottle, you could apply easily once every three days for a month and stop any kid from sucking their thumb.</li>
            <li>Her habit was so strong that she would spend most of the hours in her day with her thumb in her mouth.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so far a happy customer.</li>
            <li>THis is the best sixteen dollars I have ever spent.</li>
            <li>This worked great on my 4-yr old for about 2 days.</li>
            <li>Worked great for my 10-year old.</li>
            <li>I just wish I was more consistent! :)</li>
            <li>So that probably reduced the resistance to applying mavala since her friend thought the thumb-guard was cool!</li>
            <li>I gave this 2 stars because it was easy to apply...</li>
            <li>Easy application....</li>
            <li>it doesn&#x27;t work as easily.</li>
            <li>This stuff is like nail polish and cannot be easily removed like a bandage.  </li>
            <li>The solution does not wash off easily when she washes her hands or takes a bath.</li>
            <li>And, it came off easily with nail polish remover.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Super strong - lasts through hand washing and even baths.</li>
            <li>I decided to try Mavala Stop after seeing glowing reviews and strong testimonials.</li>
            <li>This stuff is strong,  but with one application, my four-year-old stopped sucking his thumb.  </li>
            <li>Its too strong and my son gags and throws up almost everytime</li>
            <li>You do need to reapply every day or 2 to keep the taste strong.</li>
            <li>The flavor it leaves in your mouth is strong and long-lasting.</li>
            <li>I feel nice to have tried it first.</li>
            <li>Our son sucked his thumb with it on and he sure spit it out quick.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not very common that you find a product where you can call it good for being awful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Perfect for the little ones who want to bite their nails or suck their thumb.</li>
            <li>However, he would only comment on how it didn&#x27;t taste great, but he continued to bite his nails.  </li>
            <li>So happy she has finally stopped!</li>
            <li>It worked really good until my 3 year old learned to wash her hands to avoid the taste.</li>
            <li>I bought this stuff, used for 6 days and now have beautiful long nails!</li>
            <li>I HIGHLY recommend this product!!!!</li>
            <li>I decided to give it a shot after reading reviews and I&#x27;m so glad I did!&lt;br /&gt;Highly highly recommended:)</li>
            <li>Oh wow!!!!!!</li>
            <li>This was well worth the money!</li>
            <li>I tried this on myself first and for sure thought this would kick my daughters habit because I could taste it for days.</li>
            <li>It is worth a try!</li>
            <li>My boy doesn&#x27;t like it and throws a fit because he wants to be able to suck his thumb.  </li>
            <li>It went right in the trash!</li>
            <li>It seemed to work which was good since this was a last resort.</li>
            <li>Well, she is glad to stop sucking her thumb so much that now if she realizes she may want to put her thumb in her mouth she asks me to put this on.</li>
            <li>As long as you are consistent about putting this one it really does a great job!</li>
            <li>But surprisingly it make her vomit for only two days.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s an ok product but didn&#x27;t really work.</li>
            <li>For best results I would suggest to reapply the polish at least every 4 days</li>
            <li>and now I can see her beautiful face instead of always seeing her hands in her mouth covering half her face.  </li>
            <li>Wish it was mild.</li>
            <li>Thusfar, it&#x27;s working perfectly, but I&#x27;m saving the extra star for a later date.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>We purchased this product when he was 2 and realized it&#x27;s best to wait until a child is at least 3 to make sure the taste buds are fully developed.  </li>
            <li>but there were times when I stuck the edge of my finger near my mouth and it made me aware and more focused to keep my hands off my face!</li>
            <li>I just have to be very consistent about putting it on.  </li>
            <li>As long as you remember to put it on every week it works good.</li>
            <li>and I have nails for the first time in my life!  </li>
            <li>Really miraculous!!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s been two weeks since we first tried Mavala Stop, and she has not sucked her thumb one time!  </li>
            <li>Mavala made it much easier than I thought it was going to be!!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so grateful because I not only saved thousands from braces, but her teeth will be able to grow the way they are supposed to now!</li>
            <li>It did the job fast and stress free.</li>
            <li>Our now 4 year old had been sucking two fingers for many months.  </li>
            <li>This is the 3rd kind of quit thumb sucking solution that I have tried.</li>
            <li>She is old enough that she was able to stop her thumb sucking during the day of her own accord, but it was night-time that was the problem.  </li>
            <li>I was worried that my 7yr old finger-sucker would be able to outsmart this stuff by washing it off.  </li>
            <li>I will continue using it for another month or two just to make sure the habit is completely gone.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been a nail biter since I was in elementary</li>
            <li>but I constantly rinse it out with warm water and apply moisture to them</li>
            <li>My nice starting eating her nails, so I found this product.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m going to try again when my daughter turns 3 years old and see if the taste bothers her more then.</li>
            <li>We had tried lots of other ideas, including Thumbusters and Thum liquid, none of which did much good.  </li>
            <li>, I now have long healthy nails!</li>
            <li>You paint it right on your nail like nail polish.</li>
            <li>he bit right though it .</li>
            <li>This product didn&#x27;t work right from the start.  </li>
            <li>right...</li>
            <li>But my son bites right through it.</li>
            <li>my daughter sucked the stuff right off the tip of her finger.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After talking to an Orthodontist...</li>
            <li>No one in their right minds would put their fingers in their mouths when they&#x27;re painted with the Mavala.</li>
            <li>MY CHILD IS 5 YEARS OLD AND THINKS THIS WAS A FUN GAMES TO PLAY!!</li>
            <li>After many New Years resolutions to stop biting that weren&#x27;t met and many different &amp;#34;bad</li>
            <li>We also have a 7 &amp; 9 yr old that enjoyed biting finger nails and after one application, after much weeping, wailing and gnashing of teeth, Done!</li>
            <li>My daughter is almost 7 years old and has sucked her thumb since she was first able to pop it in her mouth.  </li>
            <li>I googled it and apparently this has happened to many others.</li>
            <li>Purchased this for my 10 year old son who has been a nail biter for as long as I can remember and it has been working amazingly!</li>
            <li>Her reading levels jumped and she became more talkative and social.  </li>
            <li>The only bummer is I wash my hands so many times a day that I have to re apply this every morning.</li>
            <li>I have a sever problem chewing my nails &amp; this helped me at first</li>
            <li>He stopped after the first time the Mavala was applied.</li>
            <li>My daughter is an avid fingernail biter.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;I will definitely buy more Mavala Stop</li>
            <li>Recommend hot sauce flavor as additional product offering.</li>
            <li>It really works!</li>
            <li>At first,  we couldn&#x27;t risk him knowing we put it on</li>
            <li>This product really works!</li>
            <li>It worked for the first night but after that nothing.</li>
            <li>This stuff really works!  </li>
            <li>My low rating may reflect my daughter&#x27;s stubbornness more than the product.</li>
            <li>At first everyone thought it was such a cute thing.  </li>
            <li>She did not like it at first, but within 3 days she stopped sucking her thumb.</li>
            <li>The first time this did not work.</li>
            <li>Well, it did make my daughter vomit the water she was drinking the first time I put it on her.</li>
            <li>This stuff really works!</li>
            <li>It tastes mostly like nail polish remover and has the same lingering effect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>As an avid nail biter for almost a quarter of a century, yesterday, for the first time in my life, i had to cut my fingernails.  </li>
            <li>We first taste-tested it together with a tube of toothpaste nearby.  </li>
            <li>She thought it was so funny</li>
            <li>Prior my trick to get her to stop sucking her thumb was putting cute</li>
            <li>But on the second day she made sure she did not suck thumb.</li>
            <li>This stuff really works!</li>
            <li>He attempted 2 to 3 times to suck his thumb the first day, and that was it.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve tried hot sauce and bitter apple spray (the kind you use to keep dogs from gnawing the furniture), germ-x, nail polish remover, along with nail polish, acrylics, you name it...</li>
            <li>;  Needless to say, my wife and I are very happy with the results.</li>
            <li>but this product really works!</li>
            <li>This product is very harmful !</li>
            <li>No potato chips, hot wings, pizza, cookies, cinnamon buns, popcorn, etc.</li>
            <li>We have tried everything to get our child to stop sucking their thumb and this stuff really works!</li>
            <li>I bought this for her and for the first time in her life, she has fingernails and skin around her fingers.  </li>
            <li>The first bottle helped me more than the second one...</li>
            <li>but this definitely deserved it!:-)</li>
            <li>This product does exactly what it claims it will do.  </li>
            <li>One bottle will do the trick if you are consistent.</li>
            <li>We put it on her two favorite fingers at night and she went to bed and ended up vomiting (several times) when she put her fingers in her mouth.</li>
            <li>It worked on the first time on my son when he was 2</li>
            <li>She gagged and began spitting and whipping off her tongue the first time she tried to suck her thumb after applying it</li>
            <li>My daughter only tried sucking her thumbs a couple more times.</li>
            <li>Wow!!!!</li>
            <li>Only other nail biters out there know what a beautiful problem this is for me to have.  </li>
            <li>This would work better on an older child or adult who WANTS to give up thumb-sucking/fingernail biting.</li>
            <li>I quickly inhibited my habits and soon found myself cleaning and filing my nails, letting them grow young and wild and free for the first time in my life.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s only really strong for the first day or two, so I make sure not to apply it if I know I&#x27;ll be cooking that night (or even the next).  </li>
            <li>hoping to stop a young nail biter... goes on matte clear, and works on top of nail polish.</li>
            <li>, I&#x27;m almost 100% positive it&#x27;ll work.</li>
            <li>I decided to order this after reading all the positive reviews.  </li>
            <li>We tried positive reinforcement, rewards for not sucking his thumb etc, that didn&#x27;t work.  </li>
            <li>Worked great for about 3 weeks, as the flavor is appalling and long-lasting.</li>
            <li>We bribed her with all sorts of things she would love, we safety pinned long socks over the sleeves of her Pjs, we tried a thumb guard...  </li>
            <li>This stuff stopped her pretty much immediately.  </li>
            <li>I have tried pretty much everything to get my daughter to stop sucking her thumb.  </li>
            <li>The only issue is that if you are eating something with your hands (like a hot dog), you have to be very careful to keep your nails from touching your lips or you won&#x27;t be able to get the taste out of your mouth.  </li>
            <li>My wife and I were so surprised that she just stopped so quickly.</li>
            <li>But once I determined how strong it was I only put one brush on each thumb.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried a couple of others, but they just weren&#x27;t strong enough to deter me from biting my nails.</li>
            <li>Punishing him or yelling at him for doing it certainly didn&#x27;t work either.  </li>
            <li>My four year old has not sucked thumb since first try after Mavala was put on nail!</li>
            <li>It worked so great that I thought I&#x27;d try it on my 2 year old who sucks his thumb, but it did not work.</li>
            <li>but he didn&#x27;t really complain.</li>
            <li>and my sister wants her to stop.&lt;br /&gt;My</li>
            <li>It worked better than we expected.</li>
            <li>Buy this product for my goddaughter, works very well</li>
            <li>but it was becomeing a real problem during meal times.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t expect it to work so fast, but it did....</li>
            <li>My son got used to the taste after it made him get really spitty.</li>
            <li>Her thumb nail is growing normally for the first time in her life and she no longer has that huge, red bump on her thumb knuckle.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend giving this a try to stop thumb sucking!</li>
            <li>THE WHOLE POINT OF STOPPING THE HABBIT OF NAIL BITING..</li>
            <li>I did, however, only use a light amount to start because I knew I could increase it if needed.  </li>
            <li>I even tried coating the whole tip of the thum all the way around.</li>
            <li>This formula works really well.  </li>
            <li>We highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li>highly recommend this product - and I wish that we had found it about two years ago!</li>
            <li>When I realized her thumb sucking could really affect her teeth, I ordered Mavala and it was a saving grace.</li>
            <li>As a parent I am very ashamed that I resulted in using this product for my child.  </li>
            <li>REALLY WORKS....</li>
            <li>Probably need to make it more bitter than it already is..</li>
            <li>he did stop, I don&#x27;t know if it was because he grew out of it or if the stuff really worked.</li>
            <li>but after I used this stuff, she really didnt like this taste compared to Thum and stopped sucking her thumb, when she thinks about sucking her thumb</li>
            <li>I had to re-apply every day for about 2 weeks for it to REALLY work.</li>
            <li>my 2 and 1/2 year old sucked his thumb all the time including while he was eating!!!</li>
            <li>This was amazing, we used on our 4-year old daughter and she cried a little the first night but did not suck her thumb again.&lt;br</li>
            <li>and I just need to be more careful when eating!</li>
            <li>, the downside (at least, for me) for this product (and any like it) to solve this kind of problem is that it also kind of ruins any finger foods you might be trying to eat for the ~1-2 weeks you have an application on your fingers.</li>
            <li>He was very much attached to both his fingers and security blanket, but seamlessly gave both up without much fuss.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>but I know my sister did a few times because it was very strong on her</li>
            <li>after the first night applying the nail polish she stopped sucking her thumb completely.</li>
            <li>and my son completely stopped biting his fingers (cuticle) and nails on the first time I applied Mavala.</li>
            <li>Her hands would get full of dirt when she would roll around the grass with our puppies, and suddenly she would stick her thumb in her mouth.  </li>
            <li>I have been biting my nails since I was a young girl and the first day I applied this</li>
            <li>/&gt;This is the most horrible thing I&#x27;ve ever tasted and yet the best thing that has ever happened to my nails.</li>
            <li>but she is getting older now</li>
            <li>This worked for my older daughter who wanted to stop sucking her thumb.  </li>
            <li>Mainly on his fingers not his nails.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m thinking about trying with my older son to stop nail biting.</li>
            <li>I would recommend waiting until they are older (like the directions state...</li>
            <li>Hopefully my older ones will stop buying their nails as well.</li>
            <li>Smells a little strong but really works well!</li>
            <li>My son wasn&#x27;t to happy about having to wear it on his nails because it does dry clear however its shinny just like any other clear polish.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product to anyone</li>
            <li>Would highly recommend to anyone trying to get their child to stop thumb sucking.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s been almost 6 months since I bought and used this for my 5 yr old who we tried many other stop thumb sucking things.</li>
            <li>and you really have to stick with it for about 90 days until you completely deprogram.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Wow this stuff really worked.</li>
            <li>My 4 year old daughter was very attached to her thumb.  </li>
            <li>I did put the Mavala on a few more nights.  </li>
            <li>It did make finger foods unbearable for several days, but stopping nailbiting was well worth that temporary price.</li>
            <li>a hair dryer on cool high setting to dry the hands</li>
            <li>Our son has been sucking on his right hand index and middle fingers since he was in the womb (ultrasounds always showed him sucking on them!).  </li>
            <li>I did not bite my nails when I had it on, but as soon as I stopped using it, I found my nails were right back in my mouth.</li>
            <li>I LOVE how this is not easily removable.  </li>
            <li>A little bribery is allowing me to put Mavala Stop on his thumb a  little more easily.  </li>
            <li>If you put it on fresh every day (and reapply whenever you wash your hands or they get wet), this nail biting solution really does work.</li>
            <li>First review I have ever left on Amazon after shopping here for 4 years.</li>
            <li>My 10-year old has been sucking her thumb for... 10 years!  </li>
            <li>This was just the product my 9 year old son needed to kick his nail-biting habit!  </li>
            <li>and here we are no more sucking his thumb :)</li>
            <li>She made a face at first and then proceeded to stick her thumb back in her mouth.</li>
            <li>Since I have gotten this product I haven&#x27;t even thought of biting my nails, and its better then other products that add a yellow tint to your nail.</li>
            <li>My daughter (4 yrs old) can&#x27;t stand the taste!  </li>
            <li>Stopped my six year old from sucking when nothing else worked!</li>
            <li>Her teacher said she &amp;#34;checked out&amp;#34; and wasn&#x27;t getting her work done when her thumb went in her mouth (which was a pretty constant behavior).  </li>
            <li>My daughter doesn&#x27;t suck her thumb any more with just a few applications of this stuff!</li>
            <li>10 years later and pursuing a career as a nurse I&#x27;ve realized this really needs to end!</li>
            <li>My 5 year old son LOVES his thumb!</li>
            <li>But it definitely serves its purpose very well!</li>
            <li>When I found this stuff, I was put off at first by the mixed reviews.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s potent, it&#x27;s very bitter, and it makes you stop biting your nails (if you use it regularly!).</li>
            <li>Hopefully in a few weeks I will have nice long nails!!</li>
            <li>It stays on just a little bit better than other stuff I bought, but it&#x27;s pretty much the same.</li>
            <li>She had a hard couple of nights but we are now thumb free!</li>
            <li>I am so excited I bought this, especially since I was considering not buying it due to the high price.</li>
            <li>and I sat down for a special session of nail painting.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s just like I have clear polish on.  </li>
            <li>I used Mavala on my 3 year old son&#x27;s thumb in my attempt to stop him from sucking his thumb</li>
            <li>Completely ruined finger</li>
            <li>my 6 year old has stopped sucking her thumb...</li>
            <li>my 2 year old has not...</li>
            <li>We bought this product to help our 7yr old break his habit of thump sucking.  </li>
            <li>I got it for my 2 year old grandson who would not stop sucking his thumb.</li>
            <li>My 4.5 year old stopped sucking her thumb completely with two applications.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Even for myself, a 24 year old.</li>
            <li>I have been biting my nails since I was 3 years old.</li>
            <li>My daughter is almost 3 years old and has been sucking her thumb since she was born.</li>
            <li>I put this stuff on his nails and he does not put his fingers anywhere near his mouth.</li>
            <li>because their taste buds are not yet fully developed so</li>
            <li>I gave it to my sister in law and her 4 yr old stopped in 2 days.</li>
            <li>Much stronger than similar products on the market.</li>
            <li>Bought to stop thumb sucking, and so far after 1 week of use the thumb has not been sucked.  </li>
            <li>I know he&#x27;s still young but</li>
            <li>We had tried everything...and with the child being 7 yrs old, we had to give this a shot.</li>
            <li>I bought Mavala for my 7 year old who has sucked her thumb since she could find it.</li>
            <li>Do you have a 4 year old that suck their thumb for 5+ hours a day?  </li>
            <li>old daughter to stop sucking her thumb.  </li>
            <li>Developed calluses on those fingers.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been getting acrylic nails since I was 13 because the pain of my bitten nails was too much and acrylics were the ONLY WAY I couldnt bite them.</li>
            <li>Used this for my 6 year old that sucked her thumb all the time.</li>
            <li>I tried this on my child too early.</li>
            <li>In two days she completely stop sucking on her finger.</li>
            <li>Now I am wondering what&#x27;s the shelf life of this product because my soon to be one year old</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s been nearly 2 months now since he dropped the habit.  </li>
            <li>(she&#x27;s 3.5 years old).</li>
            <li>We had tried everything to stop my 8 year old from sucking his thumb.  </li>
            <li>I completely recommend it to anyone who has a nail biting habit or a child who does.  </li>
            <li>But when i apply it on my 4Yrs old daughter she beg me not to put on her tumb even after three days since she still feels the bitterness on her tumb.</li>
            <li>It really helped her self esteem because she was starting to get embarrassed about it.</li>
            <li>(she lets me do it because I don&#x27;t think she wants to suck her thumb either because big non thumb sucking girls get nail polish).</li>
            <li>It stops my 4 year old from biting his nails.</li>
            <li>It worked for my 2 yr old, but not my stubborn 4yr old.</li>
            <li>The habit is completely gone.</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t work with my 7-year old daughter.  </li>
            <li>That way she knew if she made a mistake, it could be fixed by toothpaste.  </li>
            <li>I have twin 7 year old girls that for some reason both of them just started biting their nails.  </li>
            <li>They did this when they were 4 years old, then I used rubbing alcohol on their nails every night and it worked, so I tried that again</li>
            <li>Used this for our 4 yr old son who sucked his thumb since birth.  </li>
            <li>In about three weeks he had stopped sucking during the day, and by five weeks he stopped completely.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s the initial taste that really gets me, but the aftertaste.  </li>
            <li>My wife and I have a four year old that has been sucking her thumb to comfort herself since she was born.</li>
            <li>but so far it seems to be working.</li>
            <li>My daughter, now three years old sucked her thumb for comfort before naps and bedtime.</li>
            <li>but I also do know I have a sensitive stomach.</li>
            <li>bought to get three year old to stop sucking thumb.</li>
            <li>So far this is working for my daughter.  </li>
            <li>My 3 yr old daughter sucked her thumb a lot...</li>
            <li>I got this product to help my 3 year old stop sucking her thumb.</li>
            <li>My 4 year old is now on her 10th day of no thumb sucking.  </li>
            <li>I was hoping this would work for my 5 year old to stop biting his nails.  </li>
            <li>My daughter developed this nail biting habit and I have no idea</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve heard children don&#x27;t have developed taste buds until about 3.</li>
            <li>I tried it for 3 days straight, with it constantly on her, and</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not working with my 3 years old son.</li>
            <li>My 4 year old was sucking his thumb since infancy.</li>
            <li>Five year old stopped sucking thumb after one day of application.</li>
            <li>I have a 5 year old who has been sucking on her fingers and biting her nails for forever...</li>
            <li>I have been putting this on my 4 year old&#x27;s thumb for about two weeks.  </li>
            <li>I used this on my 3 year old and she didn&#x27;t even seem to mind that it was on her fingers.  </li>
            <li>how much it affected daily living even for a non-thumbsucker.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It lasted for over a week before wearing off completely.</li>
            <li>you only need to reapply it every other day, where as the cheap stuff needs to be reapplied twice a day, I used it to stop my child from sucking his fingers and it works like a charm</li>
            <li>We had to use this only 2 times (One time on the first day and second time after a week).</li>
            <li>The thing that sucks is I have a barely used product that I don&#x27;t need any more because it worked.</li>
            <li>The only draw back is that it wears off after 2 or 3 days so you have to be consistent...</li>
            <li>It definitely worked and I highly recommend buying this product if you have the habit as well.</li>
            <li>and I didn&#x27;t deduct any because it&#x27;s really helping me in the long run</li>
            <li>and I just need to be more careful when eating!she is 13, so once again be careful when giving it to the younger kids!</li>
            <li>and I didn&#x27;t deduct any because it&#x27;s really helping me in the long run</li>
            <li>Let me keep this short and sweet or should I say BITTER as all get out!</li>
            <li>It only took me about 2 days to completely stop putting my fingers near my mouth and after about a month</li>
            <li>Nails would grow after acrylics but I would quickly start biting after a few days of them being off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>However, it did not stop my 5 year old with Down Syndrome from sucking her thumb, but it did make her pretty upset when her food was tasting like her thumb.</li>
            <li>When I first put it on, I only put one layer to start off with and put a layer on my younger sister because she&#x27;s starting to bite the tips of her nails.</li>
            <li>After only three applications, he has completely stopped thumb sucking!</li>
            <li>It is much different than the bitter polish my mom would buy me when I was a kid, which would wash right off when you wash your hands.</li>
            <li>Honestly, the thirteen dollars is so worth it to stop such a bad habit.</li>
            <li>I had a feeling it wouldn&#x27;t because the label clearly state that it would not work on kids younger than three</li>
            <li>loop early enough to stop biting.</li>
            <li>the bitter taste does not bother them as much.</li>
            <li>Our six year old daughter got the final warning from the dentist - quit sucking her thumb or else!  </li>
            <li>It only took her about 3 days for her to completely stop.  </li>
            <li>2 months later, can report he has completely kicked the habit.  </li>
            <li>Our three year old has always sucked his thumb, especially to sleep at night.</li>
            <li>Finally my five year old is done sucking her thumb.</li>
            <li>Mints barely kill the taste.</li>
            <li>Our four year old was starting to suck her thumb</li>
            <li>I apply it daily to my 4 year old child&#x27;s finger nails.  </li>
            <li>My daugter does also sleep with an Angel Dear &amp;#34;Lovey&amp;#34;  she has become much more dependent on that at night and when she is tired.</li>
            <li>He has agreed to keep using this until we are sure the habit is behind him.  </li>
            <li>We have tried multiple products similar to ths one, and this one surpasses all of the others, by far!</li>
            <li>I would usually paint her thumbs while she is sleeping, this product dries quickly as well.  </li>
            <li>Our 4 yr old had been a consistent thumb sucker since he was about 6 months old.  </li>
            <li>Which I really liked because I&#x27;m one of those people who put my hands on my face too much which is really bad because of all the portals of entry.</li>
            <li>bummer is getting bitterness on finger foods (and social companions)</li>
            <li>Buy this ONLY if you have a three old or above .</li>
            <li>I have only used this 1 or 2 times on my thumb-loving 3 year old, but it was enough to detract her from sucking on her thumb.</li>
            <li>I managed to taste it accidentally several times over the week, so it shouldn&#x27;t be used on anyone sensitive enough to throw up if they get it in their mouth.</li>
            <li>She&#x27;s usually skeptical about my recommendations in this area, but she bought it through Amazon, and my TWO-YEAR OLD grandson was free from thumb-sucking in just three days!</li>
            <li>and you have to keep on applying the product constantly throughout the day, or else your child will start sucking on their thumb as soon as the product taste is not applied freshly every few hours.</li>
            <li>We tried it last night right before she went to bed telling her it was nail polish for little princesses.</li>
            <li>Did not work for my 2 year old kid in long run ...</li>
            <li>but it seems like I&#x27;ve gotten used to it after a month &amp; doesnt work as well anymore as it did the first few weeks.</li>
            <li>Although I did not appreciate the spitting that occurred after the thumb was put in the mouth the first few times after it was applied.  </li>
            <li>I have successfully quit nailbiting about 37 times since I began using this star-stunning product, and by my estimates I still have about 1400 applications left of this nose-clearing bad boy.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;d previously trued the brand &amp;#34;Thum&amp;#34; and really couldn&#x27;t tell there was anything on my nails, then I purchased Malava Stop and it was night and day.</li>
            <li>So far I am not really sure whether it is really working or not.</li>
            <li>Dad using it too and has long finger nails for the first time in thirty some odd years.</li>
            <li>I first used this for my 10 year old that still sucked her thumb after she was asleep, it frustrated her so much and this product worked amazingly fast.</li>
            <li>Got it for my 2 yr old little girl and since is recommended  for 3 yrs old and up I was worried that it wouldn&#x27;t work for her</li>
            <li>I have to start saying that I never bother to leave reviews for any product I buy, whether good or bad, but this product deserved a 5 start review.  </li>

            <li> She&#x27;s happy b/c she can paint them</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m happy she&#x27;s not biting anymore.  </li>
            <li> It works great as a reminder for her to keep he thumb out of her mouth.  </li>
            <li> Great product, but also</li>
            <li> Great rating--horrid taste.  </li>
            <li> I feel like I have to add my voice to the chorus of great reviews for Mavala.  </li>
            <li> Works great.</li>
            <li> It worked great.</li>
            <li> worked great on my nephew sand</li>

            <li> After reading all the great reviews I decided to try this</li>
            <li> But he&#x27;s proud of himself now that he&#x27;s stopped.  </li>
            <li> I am so happy.  </li>

            <li> Very effective stuff.</li>
            <li> This product is amazing!</li>
            <li> but this one was amazing!</li>
            <li> Work perfectly, my son doesn&#x27;t suck his thumb any more</li>
            <li> had I known how effective it would be!  </li>
            <li> and her nails are growing so nicely!  </li>
            <li> Therefore, my crusade against nailbiting has not been as successful as I had hoped.</li>
            <li> I think it&#x27;s best to make sure your child is over the age of 3-4.</li>
            <li> yes, but effective!</li>
            <li> yes, is it pleasant...</li>
            <li> Really good product.</li>
            <li> Really good for someone that need to stop biting their nails.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Surprisingly, it happened in about a week.</li>
            <li> She started joking and saying it taste good.</li>
            <li> This worked soooo good.</li>
            <li> She loved how shiny her nails looked</li>
            <li> For $11.00 is really good  </li>
            <li> GOD is good.</li>
            <li> very good product.my daugther quit in 4 days.very easy</li>
            <li> I am the most happy person now.</li>
            <li> This habit was a torture for me and her father and every time I tried to talk some sense into her, she would tell me that her thumb was too good and that she liked it, end of story.  </li>
            <li> I LOVE THIS PRODUCT!</li>
            <li> So glad the orthodontist recommended this before installing a $300.00 wire to stop thumb sucking!</li>
            <li> It ruined more than one meal in my household!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so glad I found this on amazon!</li>
            <li> and I think it is safe to say the habit has been broke!</li>
            <li> This polish sure does leave its mark!</li>
            <li> and it did work immediately,  like magic!</li>
            <li> Love this!  </li>
            <li> I must say, that this stuff provides amazing results.</li>
            <li> This product did amazing.</li>
            <li> Absolutely amazing.</li>
            <li> Amazing.</li>
            <li> then but this product is amazing.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t tried it on my own nails</li>
            <li> but I honestly didn&#x27;t expect this to work.</li>
            <li> hope it is an effective deterrent.</li>
            <li> I tried the stuff you can get at Walmart, and in terms of being effective, there is no comparison.</li>
            <li> Mavala Stop is absolutely the best product of it&#x27;s type on the market today.</li>
            <li> But, he did acknowledge on his own that he wanted help to stop sucking his thumb.</li>
            <li> but honestly I&#x27;ve had an increased amount of stomach pain</li>
            <li> It dries quickly which is great.  </li>
            <li> But it worked wonderfully for my almost 4 year old!</li>
            <li> We applied every morning and night for a week to be sure, and he didn&#x27;t touch his thumb after the first day!!!!  </li>
            <li> This product worked wonderfully for my four-year old.  </li>
            <li> A great product that, to me, is worth every penny.</li>
            <li> So far so good!!!!!</li>
            <li> I tried this on my 2 year old and it works great!  </li>
            <li> This product is so easy to put on and it is working!  </li>
            <li> It has worked very fine even though I had my desicion made about leaving nail bitting.</li>
            <li> I thought this product was very good, but it didn&#x27;t work for my 3 year old son.</li>
            <li> He has not sucked his thumb at all for over a week, which is a huge deal!  </li>
            <li> This stuff&#x27;s been around for years, and now I&#x27;m wondering why more parents don&#x27;t use it before thumb-sucking becomes harmful to their kid&#x27;s bite.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve never been able to stop.</li>
            <li> , I ordered Mavala just to \\&quot;try one more thing\\&quot; and could not believe it...</li>
            <li> So for the most part the polish worked, but mostly as a threat to quit chewing.</li>
            <li> should I ever run out. :)</li>
            <li> The best part is that it only takes one brushful of this stuff to permeate the tips of each finger, and then some!</li>
            <li> If you want a lifetime of support and a push in the direction of a better you, and a better chance at opening those dreaded cans of beer you&#x27;ve always loathed, buy a bottle of Mavala.  </li>
            <li> It really works and has been great for him.</li>
            <li> i love it</li>
            <li> /&gt;Every once in a while now he will say, \\&quot;Look my thumb is all better now, \\&quot; or \\&quot;I</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s best to have one aside for back up.</li>
            <li> After the use the habit is corrected and do not need most of the unused product.</li>
            <li> Its a bit comical to because he keeps asking for juice and and making himself drool.</li>
            <li> It seems to be able to survive many hand-washings also.</li>
            <li> I may put it on the top of a trophy and display it for all who enter my home to see.</li>
            <li> Love it (-:</li>
            <li> She pulled a tantrum the day we put it on for the idea that she would not be able to suck it any longer but after 2 weeks, she was cured.</li>
            <li> he had a nail-biting free day and earned a sleep-over with a friend within 2 weeks!  </li>
            <li> Better than others weve tried</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure it would work.  </li>
            <li> I tried to stop biting my nails unsuccessfully for many years.</li>
            <li> But I told him if she vomited for more than two days I would stop giving it to her.  </li>
            <li> Now when I see my son thinking of sticking his thumb in his mouth he remembers the taste and thinks better of it.</li>
            <li> I have to make sure to apply it often</li>
            <li> but now she seems to be ok with not sucking her thumb.</li>
            <li> so she had to make adjustments to prevent her fingers from touching her mouth.</li>
            <li> it works great and they are all much healthier.</li>
            <li> and they feel better and the taste goes away.</li>
            <li> and that is the longest I have gone without touching them.</li>
            <li> I also bought some nail polish to paint my nails to help me even more.</li>
            <li> Put this on twice and magic.</li>
            <li> when she turned four i ordered some more and it worked after one application.</li>
            <li> Works better than most.</li>
            <li> First day she said, \\&quot;my fingers are spicy!\\&quot;  Amazing results!</li>
            <li> (he is now 8).</li>
            <li> I personally love this product.</li>
            <li> Someone suggested we give this a try, and I&#x27;m so glad they did.</li>
            <li> My friend recommended this and it works like magic.</li>
            <li> I just bought some more and will try to be more diligent about putting it on her every day (she is 6).</li>
            <li> /&gt;I am sure with the bottle, you could apply easily once every three days for a month and stop any kid from sucking their thumb.</li>
            <li> Her habit was so strong that she would spend most of the hours in her day with her thumb in her mouth.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so far a happy customer.</li>
            <li> THis is the best sixteen dollars I have ever spent.</li>
            <li> This worked great on my 4-yr old for about 2 days.</li>
            <li> Worked great for my 10-year old.</li>
            <li> I just wish I was more consistent! :)</li>
            <li> So that probably reduced the resistance to applying mavala since her friend thought the thumb-guard was cool!</li>
            <li> I gave this 2 stars because it was easy to apply...</li>
            <li> Easy application....</li>
            <li> it doesn&#x27;t work as easily.</li>
            <li> This stuff is like nail polish and cannot be easily removed like a bandage.  </li>
            <li> The solution does not wash off easily when she washes her hands or takes a bath.</li>
            <li> And, it came off easily with nail polish remover.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Super strong - lasts through hand washing and even baths.</li>
            <li> I decided to try Mavala Stop after seeing glowing reviews and strong testimonials.</li>
            <li> This stuff is strong,  but with one application, my four-year-old stopped sucking his thumb.  </li>
            <li> Its too strong and my son gags and throws up almost everytime</li>
            <li> You do need to reapply every day or 2 to keep the taste strong.</li>
            <li> The flavor it leaves in your mouth is strong and long-lasting.</li>
            <li> I feel nice to have tried it first.</li>
            <li> Our son sucked his thumb with it on and he sure spit it out quick.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not very common that you find a product where you can call it good for being awful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Perfect for the little ones who want to bite their nails or suck their thumb.</li>
            <li> However, he would only comment on how it didn&#x27;t taste great, but he continued to bite his nails.  </li>
            <li> So happy she has finally stopped!</li>
            <li> It worked really good until my 3 year old learned to wash her hands to avoid the taste.</li>
            <li> I bought this stuff, used for 6 days and now have beautiful long nails!</li>
            <li> I HIGHLY recommend this product!!!!</li>
            <li> I decided to give it a shot after reading reviews and I&#x27;m so glad I did!&lt;br /&gt;Highly highly recommended:)</li>
            <li> Oh wow!!!!!!</li>
            <li> This was well worth the money!</li>
            <li> I tried this on myself first and for sure thought this would kick my daughters habit because I could taste it for days.</li>
            <li> It is worth a try!</li>
            <li> My boy doesn&#x27;t like it and throws a fit because he wants to be able to suck his thumb.  </li>
            <li> It went right in the trash!</li>
            <li> It seemed to work which was good since this was a last resort.</li>
            <li> Well, she is glad to stop sucking her thumb so much that now if she realizes she may want to put her thumb in her mouth she asks me to put this on.</li>
            <li> As long as you are consistent about putting this one it really does a great job!</li>
            <li> But surprisingly it make her vomit for only two days.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s an ok product but didn&#x27;t really work.</li>
            <li> For best results I would suggest to reapply the polish at least every 4 days</li>
            <li> and now I can see her beautiful face instead of always seeing her hands in her mouth covering half her face.  </li>
            <li> Wish it was mild.</li>
            <li> Thusfar, it&#x27;s working perfectly, but I&#x27;m saving the extra star for a later date.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> We purchased this product when he was 2 and realized it&#x27;s best to wait until a child is at least 3 to make sure the taste buds are fully developed.  </li>
            <li> but there were times when I stuck the edge of my finger near my mouth and it made me aware and more focused to keep my hands off my face!</li>
            <li> I just have to be very consistent about putting it on.  </li>
            <li> As long as you remember to put it on every week it works good.</li>
            <li> and I have nails for the first time in my life!  </li>
            <li> Really miraculous!!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s been two weeks since we first tried Mavala Stop, and she has not sucked her thumb one time!  </li>
            <li> Mavala made it much easier than I thought it was going to be!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so grateful because I not only saved thousands from braces, but her teeth will be able to grow the way they are supposed to now!</li>
            <li> It did the job fast and stress free.</li>
            <li> Our now 4 year old had been sucking two fingers for many months.  </li>
            <li> This is the 3rd kind of quit thumb sucking solution that I have tried.</li>
            <li> She is old enough that she was able to stop her thumb sucking during the day of her own accord, but it was night-time that was the problem.  </li>
            <li> I was worried that my 7yr old finger-sucker would be able to outsmart this stuff by washing it off.  </li>
            <li> I will continue using it for another month or two just to make sure the habit is completely gone.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been a nail biter since I was in elementary</li>
            <li> but I constantly rinse it out with warm water and apply moisture to them</li>
            <li> My nice starting eating her nails, so I found this product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m going to try again when my daughter turns 3 years old and see if the taste bothers her more then.</li>
            <li> We had tried lots of other ideas, including Thumbusters and Thum liquid, none of which did much good.  </li>
            <li> , I now have long healthy nails!</li>
            <li> You paint it right on your nail like nail polish.</li>
            <li> he bit right though it .</li>
            <li> This product didn&#x27;t work right from the start.  </li>
            <li> right...</li>
            <li> But my son bites right through it.</li>
            <li> my daughter sucked the stuff right off the tip of her finger.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After talking to an Orthodontist...</li>
            <li> No one in their right minds would put their fingers in their mouths when they&#x27;re painted with the Mavala.</li>
            <li> MY CHILD IS 5 YEARS OLD AND THINKS THIS WAS A FUN GAMES TO PLAY!!</li>
            <li> After many New Years resolutions to stop biting that weren&#x27;t met and many different &amp;#34;bad</li>
            <li> We also have a 7 &amp; 9 yr old that enjoyed biting finger nails and after one application, after much weeping, wailing and gnashing of teeth, Done!</li>
            <li> My daughter is almost 7 years old and has sucked her thumb since she was first able to pop it in her mouth.  </li>
            <li> I googled it and apparently this has happened to many others.</li>
            <li> Purchased this for my 10 year old son who has been a nail biter for as long as I can remember and it has been working amazingly!</li>
            <li> Her reading levels jumped and she became more talkative and social.  </li>
            <li> The only bummer is I wash my hands so many times a day that I have to re apply this every morning.</li>
            <li> I have a sever problem chewing my nails &amp; this helped me at first</li>
            <li> He stopped after the first time the Mavala was applied.</li>
            <li> My daughter is an avid fingernail biter.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;I will definitely buy more Mavala Stop</li>
            <li> Recommend hot sauce flavor as additional product offering.</li>
            <li> It really works!</li>
            <li> At first,  we couldn&#x27;t risk him knowing we put it on</li>
            <li> This product really works!</li>
            <li> It worked for the first night but after that nothing.</li>
            <li> This stuff really works!  </li>
            <li> My low rating may reflect my daughter&#x27;s stubbornness more than the product.</li>
            <li> At first everyone thought it was such a cute thing.  </li>
            <li> She did not like it at first, but within 3 days she stopped sucking her thumb.</li>
            <li> The first time this did not work.</li>
            <li> Well, it did make my daughter vomit the water she was drinking the first time I put it on her.</li>
            <li> This stuff really works!</li>
            <li> It tastes mostly like nail polish remover and has the same lingering effect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> As an avid nail biter for almost a quarter of a century, yesterday, for the first time in my life, i had to cut my fingernails.  </li>
            <li> We first taste-tested it together with a tube of toothpaste nearby.  </li>
            <li> She thought it was so funny</li>
            <li> Prior my trick to get her to stop sucking her thumb was putting cute</li>
            <li> But on the second day she made sure she did not suck thumb.</li>
            <li> This stuff really works!</li>
            <li> He attempted 2 to 3 times to suck his thumb the first day, and that was it.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve tried hot sauce and bitter apple spray (the kind you use to keep dogs from gnawing the furniture), germ-x, nail polish remover, along with nail polish, acrylics, you name it...</li>
            <li> ;  Needless to say, my wife and I are very happy with the results.</li>
            <li> but this product really works!</li>
            <li> This product is very harmful !</li>
            <li> No potato chips, hot wings, pizza, cookies, cinnamon buns, popcorn, etc.</li>
            <li> We have tried everything to get our child to stop sucking their thumb and this stuff really works!</li>
            <li> I bought this for her and for the first time in her life, she has fingernails and skin around her fingers.  </li>
            <li> The first bottle helped me more than the second one...</li>
            <li> but this definitely deserved it!:-)</li>
            <li> This product does exactly what it claims it will do.  </li>
            <li> One bottle will do the trick if you are consistent.</li>
            <li> We put it on her two favorite fingers at night and she went to bed and ended up vomiting (several times) when she put her fingers in her mouth.</li>
            <li> It worked on the first time on my son when he was 2</li>
            <li> She gagged and began spitting and whipping off her tongue the first time she tried to suck her thumb after applying it</li>
            <li> My daughter only tried sucking her thumbs a couple more times.</li>
            <li> Wow!!!!</li>
            <li> Only other nail biters out there know what a beautiful problem this is for me to have.  </li>
            <li> This would work better on an older child or adult who WANTS to give up thumb-sucking/fingernail biting.</li>
            <li> I quickly inhibited my habits and soon found myself cleaning and filing my nails, letting them grow young and wild and free for the first time in my life.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s only really strong for the first day or two, so I make sure not to apply it if I know I&#x27;ll be cooking that night (or even the next).  </li>
            <li> hoping to stop a young nail biter... goes on matte clear, and works on top of nail polish.</li>
            <li> , I&#x27;m almost 100% positive it&#x27;ll work.</li>
            <li> I decided to order this after reading all the positive reviews.  </li>
            <li> We tried positive reinforcement, rewards for not sucking his thumb etc, that didn&#x27;t work.  </li>
            <li> Worked great for about 3 weeks, as the flavor is appalling and long-lasting.</li>
            <li> We bribed her with all sorts of things she would love, we safety pinned long socks over the sleeves of her Pjs, we tried a thumb guard...  </li>
            <li> This stuff stopped her pretty much immediately.  </li>
            <li> I have tried pretty much everything to get my daughter to stop sucking her thumb.  </li>
            <li> The only issue is that if you are eating something with your hands (like a hot dog), you have to be very careful to keep your nails from touching your lips or you won&#x27;t be able to get the taste out of your mouth.  </li>
            <li> My wife and I were so surprised that she just stopped so quickly.</li>
            <li> But once I determined how strong it was I only put one brush on each thumb.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried a couple of others, but they just weren&#x27;t strong enough to deter me from biting my nails.</li>
            <li> Punishing him or yelling at him for doing it certainly didn&#x27;t work either.  </li>
            <li> My four year old has not sucked thumb since first try after Mavala was put on nail!</li>
            <li> It worked so great that I thought I&#x27;d try it on my 2 year old who sucks his thumb, but it did not work.</li>
            <li> but he didn&#x27;t really complain.</li>
            <li> and my sister wants her to stop.&lt;br /&gt;My</li>
            <li> It worked better than we expected.</li>
            <li> Buy this product for my goddaughter, works very well</li>
            <li> but it was becomeing a real problem during meal times.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t expect it to work so fast, but it did....</li>
            <li> My son got used to the taste after it made him get really spitty.</li>
            <li> Her thumb nail is growing normally for the first time in her life and she no longer has that huge, red bump on her thumb knuckle.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend giving this a try to stop thumb sucking!</li>
            <li> THE WHOLE POINT OF STOPPING THE HABBIT OF NAIL BITING..</li>
            <li> I did, however, only use a light amount to start because I knew I could increase it if needed.  </li>
            <li> I even tried coating the whole tip of the thum all the way around.</li>
            <li> This formula works really well.  </li>
            <li> We highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> highly recommend this product - and I wish that we had found it about two years ago!</li>
            <li> When I realized her thumb sucking could really affect her teeth, I ordered Mavala and it was a saving grace.</li>
            <li> As a parent I am very ashamed that I resulted in using this product for my child.  </li>
            <li> REALLY WORKS....</li>
            <li> Probably need to make it more bitter than it already is..</li>
            <li> he did stop, I don&#x27;t know if it was because he grew out of it or if the stuff really worked.</li>
            <li> but after I used this stuff, she really didnt like this taste compared to Thum and stopped sucking her thumb, when she thinks about sucking her thumb</li>
            <li> I had to re-apply every day for about 2 weeks for it to REALLY work.</li>
            <li> my 2 and 1/2 year old sucked his thumb all the time including while he was eating!!!</li>
            <li> This was amazing, we used on our 4-year old daughter and she cried a little the first night but did not suck her thumb again.&lt;br</li>
            <li> and I just need to be more careful when eating!</li>
            <li> , the downside (at least, for me) for this product (and any like it) to solve this kind of problem is that it also kind of ruins any finger foods you might be trying to eat for the ~1-2 weeks you have an application on your fingers.</li>
            <li> He was very much attached to both his fingers and security blanket, but seamlessly gave both up without much fuss.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> but I know my sister did a few times because it was very strong on her</li>
            <li> after the first night applying the nail polish she stopped sucking her thumb completely.</li>
            <li> and my son completely stopped biting his fingers (cuticle) and nails on the first time I applied Mavala.</li>
            <li> Her hands would get full of dirt when she would roll around the grass with our puppies, and suddenly she would stick her thumb in her mouth.  </li>
            <li> I have been biting my nails since I was a young girl and the first day I applied this</li>
            <li> /&gt;This is the most horrible thing I&#x27;ve ever tasted and yet the best thing that has ever happened to my nails.</li>
            <li> but she is getting older now</li>
            <li> This worked for my older daughter who wanted to stop sucking her thumb.  </li>
            <li> Mainly on his fingers not his nails.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m thinking about trying with my older son to stop nail biting.</li>
            <li> I would recommend waiting until they are older (like the directions state...</li>
            <li> Hopefully my older ones will stop buying their nails as well.</li>
            <li> Smells a little strong but really works well!</li>
            <li> My son wasn&#x27;t to happy about having to wear it on his nails because it does dry clear however its shinny just like any other clear polish.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product to anyone</li>
            <li> Would highly recommend to anyone trying to get their child to stop thumb sucking.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s been almost 6 months since I bought and used this for my 5 yr old who we tried many other stop thumb sucking things.</li>
            <li> and you really have to stick with it for about 90 days until you completely deprogram.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Wow this stuff really worked.</li>
            <li> My 4 year old daughter was very attached to her thumb.  </li>
            <li> I did put the Mavala on a few more nights.  </li>
            <li> It did make finger foods unbearable for several days, but stopping nailbiting was well worth that temporary price.</li>
            <li> a hair dryer on cool high setting to dry the hands</li>
            <li> Our son has been sucking on his right hand index and middle fingers since he was in the womb (ultrasounds always showed him sucking on them!).  </li>
            <li> I did not bite my nails when I had it on, but as soon as I stopped using it, I found my nails were right back in my mouth.</li>
            <li> I LOVE how this is not easily removable.  </li>
            <li> A little bribery is allowing me to put Mavala Stop on his thumb a  little more easily.  </li>
            <li> If you put it on fresh every day (and reapply whenever you wash your hands or they get wet), this nail biting solution really does work.</li>
            <li> First review I have ever left on Amazon after shopping here for 4 years.</li>
            <li> My 10-year old has been sucking her thumb for... 10 years!  </li>
            <li> This was just the product my 9 year old son needed to kick his nail-biting habit!  </li>
            <li> and here we are no more sucking his thumb :)</li>
            <li> She made a face at first and then proceeded to stick her thumb back in her mouth.</li>
            <li> Since I have gotten this product I haven&#x27;t even thought of biting my nails, and its better then other products that add a yellow tint to your nail.</li>
            <li> My daughter (4 yrs old) can&#x27;t stand the taste!  </li>
            <li> Stopped my six year old from sucking when nothing else worked!</li>
            <li> Her teacher said she &amp;#34;checked out&amp;#34; and wasn&#x27;t getting her work done when her thumb went in her mouth (which was a pretty constant behavior).  </li>
            <li> My daughter doesn&#x27;t suck her thumb any more with just a few applications of this stuff!</li>
            <li> 10 years later and pursuing a career as a nurse I&#x27;ve realized this really needs to end!</li>
            <li> My 5 year old son LOVES his thumb!</li>
            <li> But it definitely serves its purpose very well!</li>
            <li> When I found this stuff, I was put off at first by the mixed reviews.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s potent, it&#x27;s very bitter, and it makes you stop biting your nails (if you use it regularly!).</li>
            <li> Hopefully in a few weeks I will have nice long nails!!</li>
            <li> It stays on just a little bit better than other stuff I bought, but it&#x27;s pretty much the same.</li>
            <li> She had a hard couple of nights but we are now thumb free!</li>
            <li> I am so excited I bought this, especially since I was considering not buying it due to the high price.</li>
            <li> and I sat down for a special session of nail painting.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s just like I have clear polish on.  </li>
            <li> I used Mavala on my 3 year old son&#x27;s thumb in my attempt to stop him from sucking his thumb</li>
            <li> Completely ruined finger</li>
            <li> my 6 year old has stopped sucking her thumb...</li>
            <li> my 2 year old has not...</li>
            <li> We bought this product to help our 7yr old break his habit of thump sucking.  </li>
            <li> I got it for my 2 year old grandson who would not stop sucking his thumb.</li>
            <li> My 4.5 year old stopped sucking her thumb completely with two applications.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Even for myself, a 24 year old.</li>
            <li> I have been biting my nails since I was 3 years old.</li>
            <li> My daughter is almost 3 years old and has been sucking her thumb since she was born.</li>
            <li> I put this stuff on his nails and he does not put his fingers anywhere near his mouth.</li>
            <li> because their taste buds are not yet fully developed so</li>
            <li> I gave it to my sister in law and her 4 yr old stopped in 2 days.</li>
            <li> Much stronger than similar products on the market.</li>
            <li> Bought to stop thumb sucking, and so far after 1 week of use the thumb has not been sucked.  </li>
            <li> I know he&#x27;s still young but</li>
            <li> We had tried everything...and with the child being 7 yrs old, we had to give this a shot.</li>
            <li> I bought Mavala for my 7 year old who has sucked her thumb since she could find it.</li>
            <li> Do you have a 4 year old that suck their thumb for 5+ hours a day?  </li>
            <li> old daughter to stop sucking her thumb.  </li>
            <li> Developed calluses on those fingers.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been getting acrylic nails since I was 13 because the pain of my bitten nails was too much and acrylics were the ONLY WAY I couldnt bite them.</li>
            <li> Used this for my 6 year old that sucked her thumb all the time.</li>
            <li> I tried this on my child too early.</li>
            <li> In two days she completely stop sucking on her finger.</li>
            <li> Now I am wondering what&#x27;s the shelf life of this product because my soon to be one year old</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s been nearly 2 months now since he dropped the habit.  </li>
            <li> (she&#x27;s 3.5 years old).</li>
            <li> We had tried everything to stop my 8 year old from sucking his thumb.  </li>
            <li> I completely recommend it to anyone who has a nail biting habit or a child who does.  </li>
            <li> But when i apply it on my 4Yrs old daughter she beg me not to put on her tumb even after three days since she still feels the bitterness on her tumb.</li>
            <li> It really helped her self esteem because she was starting to get embarrassed about it.</li>
            <li> (she lets me do it because I don&#x27;t think she wants to suck her thumb either because big non thumb sucking girls get nail polish).</li>
            <li> It stops my 4 year old from biting his nails.</li>
            <li> It worked for my 2 yr old, but not my stubborn 4yr old.</li>
            <li> The habit is completely gone.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t work with my 7-year old daughter.  </li>
            <li> That way she knew if she made a mistake, it could be fixed by toothpaste.  </li>
            <li> I have twin 7 year old girls that for some reason both of them just started biting their nails.  </li>
            <li> They did this when they were 4 years old, then I used rubbing alcohol on their nails every night and it worked, so I tried that again</li>
            <li> Used this for our 4 yr old son who sucked his thumb since birth.  </li>
            <li> In about three weeks he had stopped sucking during the day, and by five weeks he stopped completely.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s the initial taste that really gets me, but the aftertaste.  </li>
            <li> My wife and I have a four year old that has been sucking her thumb to comfort herself since she was born.</li>
            <li> but so far it seems to be working.</li>
            <li> My daughter, now three years old sucked her thumb for comfort before naps and bedtime.</li>
            <li> but I also do know I have a sensitive stomach.</li>
            <li> bought to get three year old to stop sucking thumb.</li>
            <li> So far this is working for my daughter.  </li>
            <li> My 3 yr old daughter sucked her thumb a lot...</li>
            <li> I got this product to help my 3 year old stop sucking her thumb.</li>
            <li> My 4 year old is now on her 10th day of no thumb sucking.  </li>
            <li> I was hoping this would work for my 5 year old to stop biting his nails.  </li>
            <li> My daughter developed this nail biting habit and I have no idea</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve heard children don&#x27;t have developed taste buds until about 3.</li>
            <li> I tried it for 3 days straight, with it constantly on her, and</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not working with my 3 years old son.</li>
            <li> My 4 year old was sucking his thumb since infancy.</li>
            <li> Five year old stopped sucking thumb after one day of application.</li>
            <li> I have a 5 year old who has been sucking on her fingers and biting her nails for forever...</li>
            <li> I have been putting this on my 4 year old&#x27;s thumb for about two weeks.  </li>
            <li> I used this on my 3 year old and she didn&#x27;t even seem to mind that it was on her fingers.  </li>
            <li> how much it affected daily living even for a non-thumbsucker.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It lasted for over a week before wearing off completely.</li>
            <li> you only need to reapply it every other day, where as the cheap stuff needs to be reapplied twice a day, I used it to stop my child from sucking his fingers and it works like a charm</li>
            <li> We had to use this only 2 times (One time on the first day and second time after a week).</li>
            <li> The thing that sucks is I have a barely used product that I don&#x27;t need any more because it worked.</li>
            <li> The only draw back is that it wears off after 2 or 3 days so you have to be consistent...</li>
            <li> It definitely worked and I highly recommend buying this product if you have the habit as well.</li>
            <li> and I didn&#x27;t deduct any because it&#x27;s really helping me in the long run</li>
            <li> and I just need to be more careful when eating!she is 13, so once again be careful when giving it to the younger kids!</li>
            <li> and I didn&#x27;t deduct any because it&#x27;s really helping me in the long run</li>
            <li> Let me keep this short and sweet or should I say BITTER as all get out!</li>
            <li> It only took me about 2 days to completely stop putting my fingers near my mouth and after about a month</li>
            <li> Nails would grow after acrylics but I would quickly start biting after a few days of them being off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> However, it did not stop my 5 year old with Down Syndrome from sucking her thumb, but it did make her pretty upset when her food was tasting like her thumb.</li>
            <li> When I first put it on, I only put one layer to start off with and put a layer on my younger sister because she&#x27;s starting to bite the tips of her nails.</li>
            <li> After only three applications, he has completely stopped thumb sucking!</li>
            <li> It is much different than the bitter polish my mom would buy me when I was a kid, which would wash right off when you wash your hands.</li>
            <li> Honestly, the thirteen dollars is so worth it to stop such a bad habit.</li>
            <li> I had a feeling it wouldn&#x27;t because the label clearly state that it would not work on kids younger than three</li>
            <li> loop early enough to stop biting.</li>
            <li> the bitter taste does not bother them as much.</li>
            <li> Our six year old daughter got the final warning from the dentist - quit sucking her thumb or else!  </li>
            <li> It only took her about 3 days for her to completely stop.  </li>
            <li> 2 months later, can report he has completely kicked the habit.  </li>
            <li> Our three year old has always sucked his thumb, especially to sleep at night.</li>
            <li> Finally my five year old is done sucking her thumb.</li>
            <li> Mints barely kill the taste.</li>
            <li> Our four year old was starting to suck her thumb</li>
            <li> I apply it daily to my 4 year old child&#x27;s finger nails.  </li>
            <li> My daugter does also sleep with an Angel Dear &amp;#34;Lovey&amp;#34;  she has become much more dependent on that at night and when she is tired.</li>
            <li> He has agreed to keep using this until we are sure the habit is behind him.  </li>
            <li> We have tried multiple products similar to ths one, and this one surpasses all of the others, by far!</li>
            <li> I would usually paint her thumbs while she is sleeping, this product dries quickly as well.  </li>
            <li> Our 4 yr old had been a consistent thumb sucker since he was about 6 months old.  </li>
            <li> Which I really liked because I&#x27;m one of those people who put my hands on my face too much which is really bad because of all the portals of entry.</li>
            <li> bummer is getting bitterness on finger foods (and social companions)</li>
            <li> Buy this ONLY if you have a three old or above .</li>
            <li> I have only used this 1 or 2 times on my thumb-loving 3 year old, but it was enough to detract her from sucking on her thumb.</li>
            <li> I managed to taste it accidentally several times over the week, so it shouldn&#x27;t be used on anyone sensitive enough to throw up if they get it in their mouth.</li>
            <li> She&#x27;s usually skeptical about my recommendations in this area, but she bought it through Amazon, and my TWO-YEAR OLD grandson was free from thumb-sucking in just three days!</li>
            <li> and you have to keep on applying the product constantly throughout the day, or else your child will start sucking on their thumb as soon as the product taste is not applied freshly every few hours.</li>
            <li> We tried it last night right before she went to bed telling her it was nail polish for little princesses.</li>
            <li> Did not work for my 2 year old kid in long run ...</li>
            <li> but it seems like I&#x27;ve gotten used to it after a month &amp; doesnt work as well anymore as it did the first few weeks.</li>
            <li> Although I did not appreciate the spitting that occurred after the thumb was put in the mouth the first few times after it was applied.  </li>
            <li> I have successfully quit nailbiting about 37 times since I began using this star-stunning product, and by my estimates I still have about 1400 applications left of this nose-clearing bad boy.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;d previously trued the brand &amp;#34;Thum&amp;#34; and really couldn&#x27;t tell there was anything on my nails, then I purchased Malava Stop and it was night and day.</li>
            <li> So far I am not really sure whether it is really working or not.</li>
            <li> Dad using it too and has long finger nails for the first time in thirty some odd years.</li>
            <li> I first used this for my 10 year old that still sucked her thumb after she was asleep, it frustrated her so much and this product worked amazingly fast.</li>
            <li> Got it for my 2 yr old little girl and since is recommended  for 3 yrs old and up I was worried that it wouldn&#x27;t work for her</li>
            <li> I have to start saying that I never bother to leave reviews for any product I buy, whether good or bad, but this product deserved a 5 start review.  </li>
            <li> My daughter sucks right through</li>
            <li> It only took about a week, applying this every other day as the directions say, to get my 4-year-old to completely stop sucking her thumb.  </li>
            <li> Was a little apprehensive since the product says 3 and older</li>
            <li> Now all the scabs from many years of biting are gone and within 1 week the new nails grow healthy and the bad HABBIT is broken!</li>
            <li> Does exactly what you need my daughter is just having a hard time with it.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately now Im stuck with a full bottle of it but the best thing, I dont have to worry about her continuing with such a nasty habit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My nine year old did not stop sucking her thumb after using this for a period of time , she said it did not taste that bad any more</li>
            <li> The negative reviews are all parents saying it didn&#x27;t stop their toddler from biting their nails -- it clearly states on the package that it doesn&#x27;t work on young children.</li>
            <li> When I read the reviews the best indication was that Mava Stop has a bitter and disgusting taste.</li>
            <li> I tried it for several nights, one time I blew it dry, the second I let it air dry.</li>
            <li> I think he put thumb in his mouth before it was dry because he he has never vomited prior to this.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It only took a few days of using this before he stopped completely.  </li>
            <li> also bought the pink j glove to help her through the first few days!</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, my daughter&#x27;s habit was too strong and she eventually sucked her fingers again anyway.</li>
            <li> Its a hassle as you have to hold their thumb long enough for it to completely dry.</li>
            <li> It definitely has a bad taste, and for moderate thumb suckers it probably works great.</li>
            <li> 5 year old little girl no longer sucking thumb or bitting fingernails....</li>
            <li> I got excited at first with Mavala Stop because my 4 year old hated the taste and wouldn&#x27;t put his thumb in his mouth for two days.</li>
            <li> He&#x27;s almost 6 and really wants to stop but habits are hard to break.  </li>
            <li> Having tried all the options to avoid thumb sucking habit for my 3 year old, Was not very confident that this product would work.</li>
            <li> I brushed a very little on my 2 year old&#x27;s finger tips.  </li>
            <li> I have tried everything: willpower, Hoof Anti-bite, Sinful Colors nail treatments and pictures of beautifully long and manicured nails.</li>
            <li> and she is 13, so once again be careful when giving it to the younger kids!</li>
            <li> and now my nails are long.</li>
            <li> but we are desperate her teeth are starting to grow crooked) and if possible, not with a full stomach.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s not a fight all day long.</li>
            <li> I used this on my 3 year old and she had quit sucking her thumb within a few days of use.</li>
            <li> It has a very bitter, long lasting  taste, that discourages you from putting your fingers in your mouth.</li>
            <li> Believe it or not I saw dramatic results after my first application!</li>
            <li> She did say that she could taste it when eating with her fingers the next day, but she just used a fork or ate finger foods with her other hand for those two weeks.  </li>
            <li> I have to apply it daily rather than every other day as is directed.</li>
            <li> Weeks later she has still not restarted, as she did with other methods we tried.</li>
            <li> apply and dry</li>
            <li> One night I even let it dry and put on another coat, nothing.</li>
            <li> A week before we received this, I prepped her mentally by telling her if she sucks her thumb too much</li>
            <li> And it has stuck for the last few months, so I even have product left in case my youngest picks up the habit, too.</li>
            <li> After one Single use he stopped biting them.</li>
            <li> My daughter quit sucking her thumb with one single use of this stuff.</li>
            <li> But, his overwhelming desire to suck his thumb overruled the unpleasant taste and even though I put Mavala stop on his thumb every day he continues to suck it.</li>
            <li> No more thumb sucking for my 3 year old.</li>
            <li> However, I didn&#x27;t consider when purchasing this product that 7 year olds have loose teeth that they like/need to wiggle.</li>
            <li> So we have to take breaks from the product when he has loose teeth.</li>
            <li> In only three days my one and a half year-old stop sucking her thumb</li>
            <li> It worked for us and I would highly recommend it if you are serious about having your child stop sucking their thumb.</li>
            <li> I literally must say that this stuff is absolutely horrid to get on your tongue, so you will try so very hard to not do it.</li>
            <li> Just a little tiny dot does the job.  </li>
            <li> It developed into a habit that was so hard to break.  </li>
            <li> We decided on this product because we needed to do something as the habit had gotten so bad his thumb was bleeding most days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I bought this for our 6 yr old who still secretly sucks his thumb at night and at school.</li>
            <li> Background Info: 23 year old nail/cuticle biter from a mixture of anxiety and boredom for at least 10 years or more.&lt;br</li>
            <li> My seven year old nailbiter will not bite his nails for at least 3 days after this has been applied.</li>
            <li> My 3.5yr old is a chronic thumb sucker.  </li>
            <li> My six year old son complained about the taste but still sucked his thumb.</li>
            <li> I also have a 2.5 year old that sucks his thumb.</li>
            <li> I have only been using a few days and every time I bite my nails</li>
            <li> I received an empty box, no product.</li>
            <li> When I applied 1 coat of this product, it had a bitter aftertaste.</li>
            <li> He continued to bite his nails even with the bitter taste.</li>
            <li> I only applied it 2 times in and in just a few days</li>
            <li> We had a few slip ups but only when it&#x27;d wear off.</li>
            <li> I have been a full-blown nail bitter forever now.</li>
            <li> My daugher&#x27;s dentist put some of this on her nail in the hopes that it would be too bitter to bear.</li>
            <li> but it wasn&#x27;t until a few minutes later that she tried to suck her thumb like she always did as part of her bedtime ritual.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t kicked the habit, but I&#x27;ve used Malava Stop a few times to try and tone it back.</li>
            <li> A lifelong nail biter, I had this on my nails for two days and haven&#x27;t put my fingers in my mouth since (that was 2 weeks ago).</li>
            <li> We only had to use it a couple of times, my son stoped sucking his thumb within a few days.</li>
            <li> I ended up buying something called bitter nail</li>
            <li> When I use the product she stops and will stop for a few weeks after, but she keeps reverting back.</li>
            <li> I tasted it and it is SO BITTER</li>
            <li> This stuff is heavy duty it will last for 1-2 days</li>
            <li> It got to a point where she was conscious of it at home but in daycare (with the plethora of other kids who are also thumb suckers)</li>
            <li> But if your fingers get wet, it comes off on whatever they&#x27;re touching, which can get pretty nasty if, for example, you&#x27;re eating a messy sandwich.  </li>
            <li> Not for very small children whose taste is not yet developed--</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m not sure if it isn&#x27;t bitter enough, or if my daughter is just that determined.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 28 and have been seriously biting my nails since I was 6 years old.</li>
            <li> I referred other parents to your site.  </li>
            <li> I applied it every other day and he quit.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this product anyway, as it deterred her for awhile when other products didn&#x27;t even phase her.</li>
            <li> We re-applied it every other day.</li>
            <li> If you use it like nail polish, it get all over the other fingers.  </li>
            <li> Does not prevent the tearing off of fingernails with other fingernails.</li>
            <li> Which one other did work,</li>
            <li> My daughter could just suck her thumb despite the other two.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It does need to be reapplied every other day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I put it on them every other day.  </li>
            <li> It helped me in the anxious times when I wanted to go back.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s not exactly helpful</li>
            <li> I have tried other products to stop thumb sucking and they didn&#x27;t work (my kids sucked through them)</li>
            <li> In other words, it works.</li>
            <li> Just use a small tiny quantity and reapply every night et</li>
            <li> However, this product keeps him from putting his thumb in his mouth at all, it only needs to be applied to his thumbnail once every day or two, and it is only bitter, not spicy, so it doesn&#x27;t cause irritation when he rubs his tired eyes.</li>
            <li> Orthodontist recommended based on results from other patients.  </li>
            <li> Seems to work for a lot of other people</li>
            <li> She drank a little water after each time, and a few minutes later, told me her tummy hurt.... and then proceeded to throw up on me.</li>
            <li> Of course you can try to be very careful but you&#x27;re bound to get that one bite where your fingers hit your tongue or lip</li>
            <li> Worked very quickly and the taste was bad, but not nauseating.</li>
            <li> My 6 1/2 year old son has had a very hard time when it comes to thumb sucking.  </li>
            <li> The first few days were tough to get through, as my son cried during the night as he attempted to put his thumb in his mouth while sleeping, and discovered how bad it tasted, but after about two weeks of consistent use, he was done sucking his thumb!</li>
            <li> Which is not fun</li>
            <li> Soooooooo a few weeks after his third birthday we applied a small amount of the Mavala Stop to his thumb</li>
            <li> My son was a thumb sucker since infancy, and this finally got him to stop his habit.</li>
            <li> you&#x27;re dilligent about reapplying this crap and are okay not eating finger foods for a while</li>
            <li> He described his thumb as &amp;#34;sour&amp;#34; and thought that when you turn 4, your thumbs automatically turn sour.</li>
            <li> Tastes terrible, but that&#x27;s a good thing</li>
            <li> There is nothing in this product that is going to hurt a child in a few tries.</li>
            <li> sister paints the Mavala on my niece&#x27;s finger and it must taste pretty awful because the finger comes right</li>
            <li> Never slowed her down.</li>
            <li> I think it has slowed down his nail biting</li>
            <li> And I mean biting them so low that they bleed and hurt to touch!</li>
            <li> /&gt;The 7 bottles cost less than the (down the road) dental work needed to fix the issue without Mavala.</li>
            <li> You do have to reapply everyday or every other day.</li>
            <li> but I haven&#x27;t even not gotten to use even half of them until they are glued shut.</li>
            <li> 4 Year old did not mind the bitter taste rendering the product useless.</li>
            <li> Our 4 year old daughter desperately wanted to stop sucking her thumb---and we also were of the same mindset.  </li>
            <li> Cured my daughter from biting her nails in less than a week.</li>
            <li> I used it for less than a month and applied it every two days.  </li>
            <li> My Daughter stopped sucking her thumb in less than a week.</li>
            <li> First night, worked, following night son was &amp;#34;use to it.&amp;#34; He has now adapted to the taste and it no longer works :(</li>
            <li> Ordered a bottle of Mavala Stop and the taste was so bad it got their attention quick.</li>
            <li> And I stated the age factor because she was able to associate the bad taste with thumb sucking, curbing the habit!</li>
            <li> We put it on after the little one went to sleep.</li>
            <li> It does deter him a little because</li>
            <li> We had no intention of stopping him at night seeing as he was still so little</li>
            <li> Bought this and, seeing the advice posted by other Amazon users, put one small drop on one fingernail.  </li>
            <li> The taste is SO terrible that accidentally touching my fingers to my mouth makes me want to throw up!</li>
            <li> The dentist told her to quit and she got a little breakdown of her skin on her thumb one winter.  </li>
            <li> However, she did put her thumb in her mouth a little too soon maybe.</li>
            <li> One little dab on the nail is all that is needed, and it needs to be re-applied after a couple of days.  </li>
            <li> As soon as she did she immediately pulls it out and says, &amp;#34;yucky.&amp;#34; My wife and I pretend we&#x27;re not paying attention but believe me, we were observing every little detail.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I guess it wears off a little at a time unless you remove it with nail polish remover.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t bitten my nails in a little over a week</li>
            <li> I used this on my son for a little bit because he was sucking his thumb.</li>
            <li> I have tried for years to make my little daughter to stop sucking her thumbs and NOTHING worked before.</li>
            <li> I took my little one to the dentist and the dentist recommend this product.</li>
            <li> It helped my little ones stop thumb sucking, though they do need to be on board with the idea, otherwise they will chew it off.</li>
            <li> , my daughter it is a little tougher to break the habit of sucking her fingers/thumb.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It was very hard for him, even though it tasted gross.</li>
            <li> One day I decided I was tired of having gross looking hand and wanted to look like a lady.</li>
            <li> I am gonna try again in a few months.</li>
            <li> It has been a few months,and I never even see her try to suck her thumb anymore.</li>
            <li> He used to only to do it when he was tired but it moved on to almost any time he was sitting stationary (car, TV).  </li>
            <li> my daughter went to rub her eyes after putting this on and was crying for hours.</li>
            <li> She claimed she did it only when she was tired</li>
            <li> After a few weeks I went in one night at 11 and put some Mavala on her thumb nail.  </li>
            <li> We even stopped using the product a few days ago</li>
            <li> started using this a few days ago.</li>
            <li> this stuff is deadly, and WILL stop you from chewing your nails</li>
            <li> was crying for a while.</li>
            <li> We put this product on as directed and about three weeks later the habit was broken.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have to apply it everyday but the taste still lingers until I apply it again.</li>
            <li> I hate writing reviews, but it&#x27;s important for others to know about this product.</li>
            <li> He woke up early because he was unable to sleep without sucking his fingers.</li>
            <li> I never thought my daughter would stop sucking her thumb, but this worked in a few days.</li>
            <li> and she stopped sucking her thumb within a few days....</li>
            <li> I have to reapply every few days</li>
            <li> I was told that this would help my 4 year old son to stop sucking his thumb butt sadly it did not work.</li>
            <li> My 6 year old daughter hated this so much she quit biting her nails.  </li>
            <li> Her Dentist recommended we try this and in less than a week, SHE STOPPED!</li>
            <li> For only $11 I was skeptical at first, but in a desperate cry for help I purchased a .3 fl oz bottle.</li>
            <li> Some brands don&#x27;t deter him at all because the taste is not bad enough, others wore off after a few hours, and one even burned his eyes very badly when he rubbed them at night!</li>
            <li> but I felt impelled to do so with this product for the simple fact that it actually helped my oldest daughter change an unpleasant and unsanitary behavior that had become habitual.  </li>
            <li> At first my son didn&#x27;t bite his nails because he knew the stuff was on there and was told that it would taste really bad</li>
            <li> His face and eyes look normal and he hasn&#x27;t caught a cold since.</li>
            <li> However, the next time we tried it, she still sucked her thumb, claiming it didn&#x27;t taste bad enough to deter her from sucking her thumb!</li>
            <li> It tastes bad enough and is durable enough</li>
            <li> This stuff makes it IMPOSSIBLE for you to suck your thumb because of the fast.</li>
            <li> My 2 year old had a bad habit of sucking her thumb especially when she was tired.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve usually gone to about four weeks</li>
            <li> TASTES TERRIBLE :-)</li>
            <li> I was skeptical of buying this for my daughter but since it arrived, I only had to use it one time on her</li>
            <li> we put this on his thumb for 3 days and he had no more desire to do it.</li>
            <li> Reapplied twice over the course of 7-8 days and since then no more fingers in the mouth.</li>
            <li> She seemed unable to eat without this occurring several times per meal.  </li>
            <li> No more fighting or excuses and no more accidental thumb sucking.</li>
            <li> I tasted it and its disgusting, but obviously my son was willing to endure to suck it anyways.</li>
            <li> And my 5 year old daughter desperately wanted to quit sucking her thumb as well.</li>
            <li> Also, I go past the nail and cover their cuticles too with the polish, the area around all their nails looks better.&lt;br /&gt;Highly</li>
            <li> After first application my daughter cried in the middle of night saying her thumb tastes horrible.</li>
            <li> no more thumb sucking.</li>
            <li> We have attempted everything we could think of in the past 18 months and none worked.  </li>
            <li> in the past I tried using Thum Thumb Sucking Nail Biting Treatment but after awhile my kid kept sucking her thumb</li>
            <li> no more sucking for him.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I may be a lost cause at stopping my nail biting but at least I kicked smoking &amp; dipping tobacco a year and half ago!</li>
            <li> so I can just imagine how children feel if they taste too much of it and become sick.</li>
            <li> The first day I had chicken and there was no direct contact of my nail to my food but the bottom of my finger did touch it and left that horrible taste on it.</li>
            <li> a habitual nail-biter, which is an awful habit I picked up back in high school.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, I have had to keep applying it every two or three days because she will continue to suck her thumb when it wears off, but every week she still sucks her thumb less and less and not at all when it&#x27;s on her nail.  </li>
            <li> We started with a little dab on the tip of his thumb, this was enough to put a bad taste in his mouth.</li>
            <li> His thumb was changing in appearance and developed hard  skin; this was how bad and often he sucked his thumb.</li>
            <li> , my niece sucks her finger</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, it hasn&#x27;t worked like I expected.</li>
            <li> Bought this product by a recommendation from my dentist for my 4 yo daughter who sucks her fingers.</li>
            <li> He still sucks his thumb after months of using this product.</li>
            <li> I suggest this to all parents that have thumb suckers at home.</li>
            <li> sucks two of her fingers.</li>
            <li> I had a thumb sucker.  </li>
            <li> My daughter WAS a thumb sucker.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m still picking my nails and cuticles, but at least I&#x27;m keeping my hands out of my mouth for now.  </li>
            <li> It made for some dramatic mid-night crying as my son stuck his thumb in his mouth.</li>
            <li> Apparently, it leaves a bad taste in the mouth.</li>
            <li> She at first hated the taste, now it doesn&#x27;t bother her at all.  </li>
            <li> I also have sensitive lips and this just lingers on them like crazy!</li>
            <li> Her habit was getting so bad that her hands were literally in her mouth over half the time, and this stuff is so bitter it keeps them away!</li>
            <li> So, I took the leap to try something dramatic and based on some other reviews this did seem to be dramatic.</li>
            <li> The awful taste stuck with me and made an instant and lasting impression.</li>
            <li> The worse part about it was that she would go play outside and get all dirty.  </li>
            <li> My daughter had a serious thumb sucking habit.</li>
            <li> This definitely has put a bad taste in her mouth and has forced her to stop.</li>
            <li> When I asked him if it tasted bad, he said yeah, but obviously not enough for him to stop putting his thumb in his mouth.</li>
            <li> I feel bad but at the same time I am relieved!</li>
            <li> it either came off enough that she didn&#x27;t care about it, or she got used to the taste or stopped caring that it tasted bad.</li>
            <li> I felt it too harsh to continue, but removing it was difficult.  </li>
            <li> Since we aren&#x27;t allowed to use fake nails in the workplace, I&#x27;ve been searching for a polish to destroy this habit.</li>
            <li> It was bitter and unpleasant.  </li>
            <li> I thought that has long as he had the nail polish on it would taste so bad he would not bite, but he still does.  </li>
            <li> And the taste of the stuff did not even phase my thumb sucker!</li>
            <li> Makes it tough for him to eat ginger foods.</li>
            <li> We were both curious to how bad it tasted</li>
            <li> The sucking decreased until he just stopped, it taste on finger food</li>
            <li> The habit was broken.</li>
            <li> It was so frustrating and her nail was getting so thin.  </li>
            <li> It hasn&#x27;t broken his habit yet, but I hope it will in time.  </li>
            <li> Well- needless to say all my kids wear this everyday during cold and flu season to keep their hands off their face</li>
            <li> and after a few uses makes it impossible to get the cap</li>
            <li> She chewed on her nails in the AM, cringed and complained about the awful taste as she got on her school-bus, and was still complaining about the taste 8 hours later when she got off the bus.  </li>
            <li> My 2 year old stopped for a couplr days but after that she didnt care about the horrible taste and started sucking her thumbs again.</li>
            <li> Awful chemical taste that lingered in my mouth for at least half an hour and lasts on the fingers for days.</li>
            <li> I just don&#x27;t know what&#x27;s wrong with my kid.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical</li>
            <li> I said &#x27;sorry</li>
            <li> I was extremely skeptical about this product.</li>
            <li> The only thing about it is if you eat food with your fingers you may get that horrible taste in your mouth as well.</li>
            <li> any time I taste-tested something with the wrong hand.  </li>
            <li> , I bit my thumbnail around 4 hours ago and still faintly taste</li>
            <li> I was so afraid to try it, thinking it would be cruel, but it really was not that bad.  </li>
            <li> Just pay attention when they eat, be careful that the thumb do not touch their food otherwise it will taste awful too!</li>
            <li> The very awful bitter taste will linger if you do take a bite.</li>
            <li> I was desperate, I didn&#x27;t know what else to do, he sucked it even in his sleep.</li>
            <li> On cold winter days he refused to wear a glove because he wanted to suck his thumb.</li>
            <li> The taste is awful and you taste it for a few minutes.  </li>
            <li> My son was prone to cold and infections because of this habit.  </li>
            <li> I am in my 30&#x27;s, so that is depressing, but  </li>
            <li> they sent me the wrong product!</li>
            <li> We were desperate and very skeptical</li>
            <li> I applied the nail polish that goes on clear and dries on contact does taste horrible and gives a horrible after taste for a while</li>
            <li> I thought I would have to wear it for weeks, but the taste was so unpleasant and stubborn, that in 2 days, I was done biting.</li>
            <li> At night I would lay with him, because it was VERY difficult.</li>
            <li> This stuff tastes so bad that when you have it on your nails it is impossible to bite them.</li>
            <li> Tastes bad, but he seems to get around it</li>
            <li> it is so bad, it was in my finger for two days.</li>
            <li> I told her that one day her thumb would start to taste bad.  </li>
            <li> am saying her thumb tasted bad.  </li>
            <li> This is helping him break a bad habit.</li>
            <li> Even in her sleep it tastes bad and she would take her thumb out of her</li>
            <li> We explained that the medicine will taste really, really bad..  </li>
            <li> Even though it&#x27;s not as bad as me</li>
            <li> The bad about this product is that when eating if your finger touches your food, I feel as if it spreads on it and if you eat it you&#x27;ll regret it.</li>
            <li> PLUS,bitter taste lasts for days and is so bad that it does discourage nail biting.</li>
            <li> but eventually he bit them anyway and said the taste wasn&#x27;t that bad.</li>
            <li> and i feel bad to use and let him with his thumb</li>
            <li> Frankly, it bothered me and my wife to the point of annoyance that we would find ourselves getting frustrated.</li>
            <li> She quit chewing on her fingernails, because she was sick of having to sit still to have the polish applied.  </li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t make him sick, it just made him not want to put his thumb in his mouth.  </li>
            <li> :(&lt;br /&gt;Other</li>
            <li> Our dentist recommended it and we weren&#x27;t disappointed at all.</li>
            <li> As others have noted, this stuff tastes nasty, but my son never became ill because of it.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m disappointed.</li>
            <li> No matter how bloody and painful my hands are, I still pick and bite.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> this product didn&#x27;t work for me :(</li>
            <li> Disappointed.</li>
            <li> My bad habit subsides with this nasty, bitter, horrible, terrible, disgusting product.</li>
            <li> and I hate to see my child have to go through that.</li>
            <li> I got this for my son who bites his nails so bad that his nails are almost gone!</li>
            <li> I am still shocked it worked so well!</li>
            <li> and he naturally hated it.  </li>
            <li> He hated having this on his nails.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s some nasty crap.  </li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve always hated the habit.</li>
            <li> It made her very sick.  </li>
            <li> Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> It is so disgusting tasting that I cant even swallow it after I bite..</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really nasty and works well.  </li>
            <li> but it tastes utterly disgusting.</li>
            <li> This stuff tastes nasty and works like a charm!</li>
            <li> It leaves a nasty taste in their mouth.</li>
            <li> I have the WORST nail biting problem in my Family.</li>
            <li> One application and my kid was so disgusted that he stopped sucking his thumb immediately!</li>
            <li> We had one horrific meal watching him try to eat with his hands, and that was it, its  been 3 months</li>
            <li> The taste of this product is positively nasty!</li>
            <li> He&#x27;s soooooo disgusted.</li>
            <li> Its very nasty and the taste just lingers.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s awful</li>
            <li> It tastes terrible so it works.  </li>
            <li> (He pranked me by saying it doesn&#x27;t taste like anything and gave me a lick, I couldn&#x27;t get the horrible taste out of my mouth for 20 minutes).</li>
            <li> and YES IT SUPPOSED TO TASTE NASTY THATS</li>

            <li> Tastes nasty</li>
            <li> but he decided that he wanted to suck his thumb no matter how bad the taste was!!</li>
            <li> Well, it was very nasty to the taste.</li>
            <li> As soon as my daughter tasted it she made a horrible face and projectile vomited.</li>
            <li> It takes like the worst thing you could ever imagine.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> The product worked in 2 days.  He has put his tumb in his mouth again.  I referred other parents to your site.  Thanks&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;P. Maryland</li>
            <li> This stuff is SOOO gross. I have only been using a few days and every time I bite my nails I immediately regret it. It is so disgusting tasting that I cant even swallow it after I bite.. I have to spit it out in the sink!!!! Hopefully in a few weeks I will have nice long nails!! The only bummer is I wash my hands so many times a day that I have to re apply this every morning. Otherwise than that, I would recommend this to anyone who is trying to get out of the habit of biting their nails!!!</li>
            <li> First review I have ever left on Amazon after shopping here for 4 years. All I can say; 30 year habit, gone.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really nasty and works well.  The only problem I noted is it has a propensity to spread to your fingers and surprise you when you are eating.</li>
            <li> Great product! Work perfectly, my son doesn&#x27;t suck his thumb any more</li>
            <li> Two weeks and counting. This is my third try. I think for me I&#x27;ve usually gone to about four weeks and you really have to stick with it for about 90 days until you completely deprogram.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Only bummer is getting bitterness on finger foods (and social companions) that is unpleasant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Definitely does the job though if you&#x27;re like me and can&#x27;t interrupt the habit behavior  loop early enough to stop biting.</li>
            <li> I am writing a review only because that&#x27;s what I read that helped me to make a decision in buying  this product. I was desperate, I didn&#x27;t know what else to do, he sucked it even in his sleep. On cold winter days he refused to wear a glove because he wanted to suck his thumb. I used this for a 1 to 2 weeks on and off. The sucking decreased until he just stopped, it taste on finger food but he didn&#x27;t really complain. I am so happy that I bought this, I hope my review will help another parent that has the same issue.</li>
            <li> I have a sever problem chewing my nails &amp; this helped me at first but it seems like I&#x27;ve gotten used to it after a month &amp; doesnt work as well anymore as it did the first few weeks. I would reccommend though to a friend &amp; have purchased for someone else as a gift already. I may be a lost cause at stopping my nail biting but at least I kicked smoking &amp; dipping tobacco a year and half ago!</li>
            <li> Order this recently to stop my sons thumb sucking. We&#x27;ve tried almost all herbal methods and none of them worked. We had to use this only 2 times (One time on the first day and second time after a week). Its been almost a month and I never saw my son sucking his thumb.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks Mavala.</li>
            <li> I suggested this to my daughter for my grandson. She&#x27;s usually skeptical about my recommendations in this area, but she bought it through Amazon, and my TWO-YEAR OLD grandson was free from thumb-sucking in just three days! This stuff&#x27;s been around for years, and now I&#x27;m wondering why more parents don&#x27;t use it before thumb-sucking becomes harmful to their kid&#x27;s bite. I don&#x27;t think it does anything for their bite...</li>
            <li> Does not work and also non-refundable. Which was not stated prior to purchase. Rip Off</li>
            <li> I used Mavala on my 3 year old son&#x27;s thumb in my attempt to stop him from sucking his thumb and it did not work. He did not like the taste but he did not care... he just kept sucking his thumb. When I asked him if it tasted bad, he said yeah, but obviously not enough for him to stop putting his thumb in his mouth.</li>
            <li> I have been biting my nails since I was 7. I&#x27;ve tried everything...no bite, acrylic nails, etc. and I&#x27;ve never been able to stop. Nails would grow after acrylics but I would quickly start biting after a few days of them being off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, I ordered Mavala just to \\&quot;try one more thing\\&quot; and could not believe it...I stopped bitting my nails on day 1. I don&#x27;t know what is in it but it tastes utterly disgusting. Awful chemical taste that lingered in my mouth for at least half an hour and lasts on the fingers for days. Completely ruined finger foods.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But here we are, 5 weeks later, and my nails are longer than I&#x27;ve seen them in years. I stopped using Mavala about 2 weeks ago and have not wanted to bite my nails since. that is big! But as a safety, I keep the bottle in my purse just in case I get an inkling to bite.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is the most horrible thing I&#x27;ve ever tasted and yet the best thing that has ever happened to my nails.</li>
            <li> I LOVE THIS PRODUCT! My Husband had been biting his nails for 20 years. He would bite them till they became nubs and Bled. After one Single use he stopped biting them. His Nails are now Growing beautifully. I already recommended this product to everyone i know. AWESOME PRODUCTTTTTTTTTT!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been a nail biter for decades. One day I decided I was tired of having gross looking hand and wanted to look like a lady. I bought this stuff, used for 6 days and now have beautiful long nails! This stuff tastes nasty and works like a charm!</li>
            <li> This item works well, my niece sucks her finger but she is getting older now and my sister wants her to stop.&lt;br /&gt;My sister paints the Mavala on my niece&#x27;s finger and it must taste pretty awful because the finger comes right&lt;br /&gt;out of the mouth.</li>
            <li> It only took about a week, applying this every other day as the directions say, to get my 4-year-old to completely stop sucking her thumb.  We had tried lots of other ideas, including Thumbusters and Thum liquid, none of which did much good.  This was well worth the money!</li>
            <li> I got excited at first with Mavala Stop because my 4 year old hated the taste and wouldn&#x27;t put his thumb in his mouth for two days. But, his overwhelming desire to suck his thumb overruled the unpleasant taste and even though I put Mavala stop on his thumb every day he continues to suck it. Now what?</li>
            <li> my 6 year old has stopped sucking her thumb... my 2 year old has not... but product says for ages 5 and up....product is on shelf waiting to try again later.</li>
            <li> We bought this product to help our 7yr old break his habit of thump sucking.  We should have bought this product years ago.  After only 1 application he stopped sucking his thump!</li>
            <li> Perfect for the little ones who want to bite their nails or suck their thumb. We put it on after the little one went to sleep. Smells a little strong but really works well! TASTES TERRIBLE :-)</li>
            <li> I was skeptical of buying this for my daughter but since it arrived, I only had to use it one time on her and she has never sucked her thumb or even her fingers since. (That was back in Nov. and its Dec. now.) Unfortunately now Im stuck with a full bottle of it but the best thing, I dont have to worry about her continuing with such a nasty habit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  I HIGHLY recommend this product!!!!</li>
            <li> This Product worked wonderfully! I got it for my 2 year old grandson who would not stop sucking his thumb. He stopped after the first time the Mavala was applied. Great product!</li>
            <li> Would have purchased this years ago had I known how effective it would be!  My 4.5 year old stopped sucking her thumb completely with two applications.&lt;br /&gt;Super strong - lasts through hand washing and even baths.</li>
            <li> My daughter sucked her thumb until she was 5 and tried this stuff. It worked great. She never stuck her thumb in her mouth. You do have to reapply everyday or every other day. It leaves a nasty taste in their mouth. Which is not fun and I hate to see my child have to go through that. But all it took was one time.</li>
            <li> Really good product. Really good for someone that need to stop biting their nails.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But... The liquid acts like a glue and after a few uses makes it impossible to get the cap off.&lt;br /&gt;Bought this product twice because of the effectiveness but I haven&#x27;t even not gotten to use even half of them until they are glued shut.</li>
            <li> I brushed a very little on my 2 year old&#x27;s finger tips.  After only three times putting on the stuff during an episode of about 10 days, my kid has the fingernails that I can clip!!</li>
            <li> Our daughter does not suck her finger anymore. Surprisingly, it happened in about a week. It worked better than we expected.</li>
            <li> Best deterrent I&#x27;ve ever used. Even for myself, a 24 year old. My bad habit subsides with this nasty, bitter, horrible, terrible, disgusting product. If it works for me, it&#x27;ll work for you.</li>
            <li> My daughter is an avid fingernail biter.  She just said this was yucky and kept on biting.  Never slowed her down.</li>
            <li> I received an empty box, no product. Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my son because he would just not stop biting his nails to the point they would hurt and bleed. I applied it every other day and he quit. If I forget to apply it and I don&#x27;t catch it he will go back to biting them but I think over time it will break the habit.</li>
            <li> I put this on my four year olds fingernails, and after a while she began to not mind the taste.  She quit chewing on her fingernails, because she was sick of having to sit still to have the polish applied.  So for the most part the polish worked, but mostly as a threat to quit chewing.</li>
            <li> I have the WORST nail biting problem in my Family. I have been biting my nails since I was 3 years old. I have tried everything: willpower, Hoof Anti-bite, Sinful Colors nail treatments and pictures of beautifully long and manicured nails. None of them stopped my horrendous habit from happening over and over again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I needed a Stronger product to end my nail-biting habit. I decided to try Mavala Stop after seeing glowing reviews and strong testimonials. I must say, that this stuff provides amazing results. When I applied 1 coat of this product, it had a bitter aftertaste. When I applied 2 coats, it was even stronger! I have not bitten my nails and I am seeing results. Every time I apply Mavala Stop, I don&#x27;t bite my nails anymore.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will definitely buy more Mavala Stop should I ever run out. :)</li>
            <li> I have been biting my nails since I can remember...this product has made me stop.  Not only have I stopped but I can&#x27;t even put my finger in my mouth at all.  Even if you have icing or something on your finger, don&#x27;t taste it!  The taste is awful and you taste it for a few minutes.  This totally works!!</li>
            <li> In pursuit of curbing my tenacious lifetime nailbiting habit, I stumbled upon Mavala Stop.  For only $11 I was skeptical at first, but in a desperate cry for help I purchased a .3 fl oz bottle. Believe it or not I saw dramatic results after my first application! I quickly inhibited my habits and soon found myself cleaning and filing my nails, letting them grow young and wild and free for the first time in my life. The best part is that it only takes one brushful of this stuff to permeate the tips of each finger, and then some! I have successfully quit nailbiting about 37 times since I began using this star-stunning product, and by my estimates I still have about 1400 applications left of this nose-clearing bad boy.  If you want a lifetime of support and a push in the direction of a better you, and a better chance at opening those dreaded cans of beer you&#x27;ve always loathed, buy a bottle of Mavala.  And Stop.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;P.S. 4 Star Rating for fear of eating any food that has been touched by my fingers when using this product.  Recommend hot sauce flavor as additional product offering.</li>
            <li> My daughter is almost 3 years old and has been sucking her thumb since she was born. A week before we received this, I prepped her mentally by telling her if she sucks her thumb too much it will start to taste bad.&lt;br /&gt;Literally after the first night applying the nail polish she stopped sucking her thumb completely. My wife and I were so surprised that she just stopped so quickly.</li>
            <li> I thought this product was very good, but it didn&#x27;t work for my 3 year old son. He continued to bite his nails even with the bitter taste. It does deter him a little because when I say I&#x27;m going to put it on, he says \\&quot;No\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> So glad the orthodontist recommended this before installing a $300.00 wire to stop thumb sucking! It really works!</li>
            <li> One application and my kid was so disgusted that he stopped sucking his thumb immediately! 3 weeks later he started up again and I had to put it on again, but that was it!</li>
            <li> I ordered this product to help my child stop sucking her thumb and it didn&#x27;t work at all and I cannot return it.</li>
            <li> Buy this product for my goddaughter, works very well, she did not put their fingers in her mouth when using it, the problem now is that she use it</li>
            <li> This nail polish is great!  It tastes so gross that it detracts people from putting their fingers in their mouth.  The only issue is that if you are eating something with your hands (like a hot dog), you have to be very careful to keep your nails from touching your lips or you won&#x27;t be able to get the taste out of your mouth.  It ruined more than one meal in my household!</li>
            <li> I got this for my son who bites his nails so bad that his nails are almost gone! I put this stuff on his nails and he does not put his fingers anywhere near his mouth. It really works and has been great for him. It worked so great that I thought I&#x27;d try it on my 2 year old who sucks his thumb, but it did not work. I had a feeling it wouldn&#x27;t because the label clearly state that it would not work on kids younger than three because their taste buds are not yet fully developed so the bitter taste does not bother them as much. And the taste of the stuff did not even phase my thumb sucker! But it worked wonderfully for my almost 4 year old!</li>
            <li> very good product.my daugther quit in 4 days.very easy&lt;br /&gt;to apply and dry fast.&lt;br /&gt;just taste is baddddd....&lt;br /&gt;that is what have to be..bad tastei .... i love it</li>
            <li> I bought this for our 6 yr old who still secretly sucks his thumb at night and at school. (Found out through a school picture) we put this on his thumb for 3 days and he had no more desire to do it. I wish I had found this product sooner. I gave it to my sister in law and her 4 yr old stopped in 2 days. For us this product worked great!!! Thank you</li>
            <li> 4 Year old did not mind the bitter taste rendering the product useless. I would not advise for a youngster.</li>
            <li> Did not work on my child who suck her thumb.</li>
            <li> This stuff is strong,  but with one application, my four-year-old stopped sucking his thumb.  We decided on this product because we needed to do something as the habit had gotten so bad his thumb was bleeding most days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Every once in a while now he will say, \\&quot;Look my thumb is all better now, \\&quot; or \\&quot;I don&#x27;t think that stuff is on my thumb any more.\\&quot;  But, he hasn&#x27;t started sucking it again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am sure with the bottle, you could apply easily once every three days for a month and stop any kid from sucking their thumb.</li>
            <li> It worked really good until my 3 year old learned to wash her hands to avoid the taste. I will keep trying though.</li>
            <li> It did the job fast and stress free. Our son sucked his thumb with it on and he sure spit it out quick. At first,  we couldn&#x27;t risk him knowing we put it on so we put it on when he&#x27;s asleep and it worked wonders!</li>
            <li> Still trying it. My son still bites his nails. He says that the taste stays on his fingers for two days. Tastes bad, but he seems to get around it some how. Makes it tough for him to eat ginger foods.</li>
            <li> This stuff works great for nail biters or in my case toddlers that suck their thumbs. One taste and my toddler was put off from sucking her thumb immediately!</li>
            <li> I tried this on myself first and for sure thought this would kick my daughters habit because I could taste it for days. Unfortunately, it hasn&#x27;t worked like I expected. It deters her for the day but she is back at it the next day.</li>
            <li> If you want to stop biting your nails, BUY THIS.  It works!</li>
            <li> I could not believe this product worked in one day but it did. my 2 and 1/2 year old sucked his thumb all the time including while he was eating!!! We had no intention of stopping him at night seeing as he was still so little but it was becomeing a real problem during meal times.I put mavala stop on 15 min before dinner time. he came in shaking his head saying no like it, no like it. We had one horrific meal watching him try to eat with his hands, and that was it, its  been 3 months and he has not put his thumb in is mouth since. Not even at night. Wow!!!! Now what do I do with the rest of the bottle????</li>
            <li> If you know someone with this type of behavior, this works! Keep in mind if you start running out it&#x27;s best to have one aside for back up.</li>
            <li> Wish it was mild. Its too strong and my son gags and throws up almost everytime he puts his finger in his mouth.</li>
            <li> Did work for me to kick the habit of nail biting. After the use the habit is corrected and do not need most of the unused product.</li>
            <li> Got it for my 2 yr old little girl and since is recommended  for 3 yrs old and up I was worried that it wouldn&#x27;t work for her but it was perfect! I used to applied this every night for about two weeks while she was sleeping, and after that maybe like 3 times per week and it worked like magic,highly recommended! Just pay attention when they eat, be careful that the thumb do not touch their food otherwise it will taste awful too! :(&lt;br /&gt;Other than that this is awesome!</li>
            <li> Bought this product by a recommendation from my dentist for my 4 yo daughter who sucks her fingers. Worked great for about 3 weeks, as the flavor is appalling and long-lasting. Much stronger than similar products on the market. Unfortunately, my daughter&#x27;s habit was too strong and she eventually sucked her fingers again anyway. I would recommend this product anyway, as it deterred her for awhile when other products didn&#x27;t even phase her.</li>
            <li> I have tried to help my daughter stop biting her nails for almost a year now.  Nothing was working.  This product is so easy to put on and it is working!  8 days later and her nails are growing so nicely!  She&#x27;s happy b/c she can paint them and I&#x27;m happy she&#x27;s not biting anymore.  I would recommend this product to anyone trying to stop nail biting or thumb sucking.</li>
            <li> Bought to stop thumb sucking, and so far after 1 week of use the thumb has not been sucked.  Although I did not appreciate the spitting that occurred after the thumb was put in the mouth the first few times after it was applied.  Works great!</li>
            <li> This worked for my older daughter who wanted to stop sucking her thumb.  It works great as a reminder for her to keep he thumb out of her mouth.  She has even brought it to me to apply, saying it helps.</li>
            <li> My daughter is 14 and been biting her nails and after 2 days she stop biting her nails. I recommend this product to everyone that has the same problem</li>
            <li> The taste of this product is positively nasty! I bought it to help my youngest child wean herself from thumbsucking. Before I let her use it I wanted to see what I was putting her through. Once on my nails everything I touched tasted like the product, so be warned! After several washings and nail polish remover there was still a hint of the flavor on my hands. Does it work...yes, is it pleasant...no. I can&#x27;t get my daughter to let me put it on her again either, not that I blame her!</li>
            <li> This stuff has been on my 20 month sons thumb for like 20 minutes. He&#x27;s soooooo disgusted. I feel bad but at the same time I am relieved! Its a bit comical to because he keeps asking for juice and and making himself drool. His dad and I tried it too. Its very nasty and the taste just lingers. I&#x27;m so far a happy customer.</li>
            <li> Our son has been sucking on his right hand index and middle fingers since he was in the womb (ultrasounds always showed him sucking on them!).  He&#x27;s almost 6 and really wants to stop but habits are hard to break.  He has NOT sucked his fingers since we received the product.  We are going on one week now.  He doesn&#x27;t even suck them at night in his sleep.  Great product, but also factor in that he&#x27;s 6 and has the DESIRE to stop.  If a child is younger, it may or may not work.</li>
            <li> This product really works! My daughter quit sucking her thumb after one week of use. We re-applied it every other day.</li>
            <li> My son just turned two and had been sucking his two fingers. I know he&#x27;s still young but thought it would be easier to break his habit sooner rather than later. Was a little apprehensive since the product says 3 and older but I used it anyway. I only applied it 2 times in and in just a few days I noticed he was no longer sucking his fingers. I then decided to do away with his snoedel security blanket as well. He was very much attached to both his fingers and security blanket, but seamlessly gave both up without much fuss.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product was recommended to me by my kids&#x27; pediatric dentist. I would definitely recommend this product.</li>
            <li> It worked for the first night but after that nothing. She started joking and saying it taste good. I&#x27;ve tasted it and it&#x27;s awful I just don&#x27;t know what&#x27;s wrong with my kid. It didn&#x27;t worked for us.</li>
            <li> The best stop biting Polish on the market. The very awful bitter taste will linger if you do take a bite. Very effective stuff. Follow the simple application instructions and you will stop biting.</li>
            <li> I like this as it helps me to not bite fingernails while watching TV or driving.  It tastes terrible so it works.  I wish it didn&#x27;t need to be reapplied every couple of days.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t stop my daughter from biting off her nails....</li>
            <li> Does exactly what you need my daughter is just having a hard time with it. I am gonna try again in a few months.</li>
            <li> Our 4 yr old had been a consistent thumb sucker since he was about 6 months old.  We purchased this product when he was 2 and realized it&#x27;s best to wait until a child is at least 3 to make sure the taste buds are fully developed.  Soooooooo a few weeks after his third birthday we applied a small amount of the Mavala Stop to his thumb and he naturally hated it.  That was literally it.  One application and he was done.  He put his thumb in his mouth 3, maybe 4 times and then just altogether stopped.  We couldn&#x27;t believe it but that was all it took.  It didn&#x27;t make him sick, it just made him not want to put his thumb in his mouth.  Could not be happier.</li>
            <li> This stuff really works!  I&#x27;ve been using it regularly and I have nails for the first time in my life!  It&#x27;s potent, it&#x27;s very bitter, and it makes you stop biting your nails (if you use it regularly!).</li>
            <li> My low rating may reflect my daughter&#x27;s stubbornness more than the product. I have put this on my daughter&#x27;s nails three times and each time her fingers go immediately to her mouth. I haven&#x27;t tried it on my own nails yet so I&#x27;m not sure if it isn&#x27;t bitter enough, or if my daughter is just that determined.</li>
            <li> I have to start saying that I never bother to leave reviews for any product I buy, whether good or bad, but this product deserved a 5 start review.  My daughter is four and since before she turned one she had suck her thumb.  At first everyone thought it was such a cute thing.  After she turned three I began to try everything out there to help her stop.  Her habit was so strong that she would spend most of the hours in her day with her thumb in her mouth.  This habit was a torture for me and her father and every time I tried to talk some sense into her, she would tell me that her thumb was too good and that she liked it, end of story.  Mavala Stop was my last resort.  I was skeptical but I tried it... I never told her about the product, I put it on her while she was asleep.  I didn&#x27;t want her to know it was me doing it because then she will know I had control over it.  I told her that her thumb was &amp;#34;getting bad&amp;#34; because of all her sucking. She bought it.  Guess what, day one she stop sucking, two days later the habit was eradicated. Only two days? I didn&#x27;t expect it to work so fast, but it did.... Definitely try this product.  If it worked on my stubborn daughter it will work for you too.</li>
            <li> My son got used to the taste after it made him get really spitty. He still sucks his thumb after months of using this product.</li>
            <li> We had tried everything...and with the child being 7 yrs old, we had to give this a shot. Ordered this...it came quickly...put it on and she stopped. We had a few slip ups but only when it&#x27;d wear off. Apparently, it leaves a bad taste in the mouth. I also, on recommendation from  the pedi, applied on skin around nail too. I will tell anyone about this product! Wish we&#x27;d have found years earlier!</li>
            <li> I bought Mavala for my 7 year old who has sucked her thumb since she could find it. She did not like it at first, but within 3 days she stopped sucking her thumb. It has been a few months,and I never even see her try to suck her thumb anymore. I suggest this to all parents that have thumb suckers at home. THis is the best sixteen dollars I have ever spent.</li>
            <li> Great rating--horrid taste.  Not for very small children whose taste is not yet developed--if for a child read the warnings please.  Otherwise even a tiny bit acts as a deterrent (or for some--just a reminder, which may be enough for a nail biter).  It seems to be able to survive many hand-washings also.</li>
            <li> Amazing!! Our son has sucked his thumb since birth. After applying Mavala just three times. The habit was broken.</li>
            <li> Do you have a 4 year old that suck their thumb for 5+ hours a day?  This is the Miracle in a bottle. Let me keep this short and sweet or should I say BITTER as all get out! One application lasted for two days. That&#x27;s all it took.  Done! We also have a 7 &amp; 9 yr old that enjoyed biting finger nails and after one application, after much weeping, wailing and gnashing of teeth, Done! Now we have 0.29 oz of Mavala Stop Miracle left. I may put it on the top of a trophy and display it for all who enter my home to see. Great product! Thank you!!</li>
            <li> I feel like I have to add my voice to the chorus of great reviews for Mavala.  Over the course of a year, we tried all sorts of tricks to try and get my 7 yr. old daughter to stop sucking her thumb.  We bribed her with all sorts of things she would love, we safety pinned long socks over the sleeves of her Pjs, we tried a thumb guard...  Ultimately, all to no avail.  She eventually out-smarted each of them.  Then we found Mavala Stop and applied it every night for two weeks.  She stopped sucking her thumb immediately and hasn&#x27;t sucked it in a month!  Her thumb nail is growing normally for the first time in her life and she no longer has that huge, red bump on her thumb knuckle.  She did say that she could taste it when eating with her fingers the next day, but she just used a fork or ate finger foods with her other hand for those two weeks.  I highly recommend giving this a try to stop thumb sucking!</li>
            <li> Works great. You don&#x27;t need to paint it on like nail polish.  I made that mistake.  Just a little tiny dot does the job.  If you use it like nail polish, it get all over the other fingers.  But all in all, it does its Jon perfectly!</li>
            <li> This product did amazing. I have been a full-blown nail bitter forever now. I did not bite my nails when I had it on, but as soon as I stopped using it, I found my nails were right back in my mouth.</li>
            <li> Absolutely amazing. I&#x27;m 17, still suck my thumb.. But now I dont. I haven&#x27;t for one week. This stuff makes it IMPOSSIBLE for you to suck your thumb because of the fast. You paint it right on your nail like nail polish. Dont have to repaint for weeks. Love it (-:</li>
            <li> After years of trying to get my son to stop sucking his finger, he quit after 2 DAYS of wearing Malava Stop.  Really miraculous!!</li>
            <li> Our now 4 year old had been sucking two fingers for many months.  He used to only to do it when he was tired but it moved on to almost any time he was sitting stationary (car, TV).  Developed calluses on those fingers.  Bought this and, seeing the advice posted by other Amazon users, put one small drop on one fingernail.  Worked like a charm.  He tasted it once or twice and that was all it took.  Reapplied twice over the course of 7-8 days and since then no more fingers in the mouth.</li>
            <li> The reviews from customers convinced me to buy this product because my boyfriend was a habitual nail biter. He&#x27;s 31 and I tried thumbs in the beginning thinking that&#x27;ll help but that product had no taste he said it was actually tasty. When I read the reviews the best indication was that Mava Stop has a bitter and disgusting taste. I applied the nail polish that goes on clear and dries on contact does taste horrible and gives a horrible after taste for a while (He pranked me by saying it doesn&#x27;t taste like anything and gave me a lick, I couldn&#x27;t get the horrible taste out of my mouth for 20 minutes). I highly recommend this product to anyone and YES IT SUPPOSED TO TASTE NASTY THATS THE WHOLE POINT OF STOPPING THE HABBIT OF NAIL BITING..Now all the scabs from many years of biting are gone and within 1 week the new nails grow healthy and the bad HABBIT is broken!</li>
            <li> My toddler stopped sucking her thumb in 3 weeks</li>
            <li> Put on my son&#x27;s jacket to get him to quit chewing on it. It worked great.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 28 and have been seriously biting my nails since I was 6 years old. And I mean biting them so low that they bleed and hurt to touch! I&#x27;ve been getting acrylic nails since I was 13 because the pain of my bitten nails was too much and acrylics were the ONLY WAY I couldnt bite them. After many New Years resolutions to stop biting that weren&#x27;t met and many different &amp;#34;bad tasting stop biting&amp;#34; products, I&#x27;ve finally found ones that worked!! I wish I had taken a before picture but I honestly didn&#x27;t expect this to work. That is my nails after a month of not biting! The taste is SO terrible that accidentally touching my fingers to my mouth makes me want to throw up! It&#x27;s awful tasting!!!! But it works! And that&#x27;s all that matters! I decided to give it a shot after reading reviews and I&#x27;m so glad I did!&lt;br /&gt;Highly highly recommended:)</li>
            <li> My 10-year old has been sucking her thumb for... 10 years!  We tried thumb guards, tobassco, socks, gloves, BRIBERY, everything! This broke her habit instantly.</li>
            <li> my daughter went to rub her eyes after putting this on and was crying for hours. I will NEVER use this again. yes it stopped her from sucking on her thumb but at risk to her health, I wont use it again!</li>
            <li> I got refunded for this I used it on my grandson for nail biting he bit right though it . IMO it didn&#x27;t work</li>
            <li> Definitely prevents biting fingernails if it is applied every 3 - 4 days. Does not prevent the tearing off of fingernails with other fingernails. That&#x27;s what we&#x27;ve discovered as we try to break our sons&#x27; habit.</li>
            <li> Used this for my 6 year old that sucked her thumb all the time. She claimed she did it only when she was tired but it was constant. She pulled a tantrum the day we put it on for the idea that she would not be able to suck it any longer but after 2 weeks, she was cured.</li>
            <li> My daughter quit sucking her thumb with one single use of this stuff. Impressive! Our dentist recommended it and we weren&#x27;t disappointed at all.</li>
            <li> I tried this on my child too early. The first time this did not work. But at age four I decided to try it again since she loves getting her fingernails polish and it worked. In two days she completely stop sucking on her finger. Now I am wondering what&#x27;s the shelf life of this product because my soon to be one year old sucks two of her fingers.</li>
            <li> I think this is one of the best products out there, but my son still manages to put his thumb in his mouth at times. Some nights he asks for me to paint his thumbs with the Mavala.</li>
            <li> This product didn&#x27;t work right from the start.  My son puts his thumb back in his mouth after about one minute.</li>
            <li> My daugher&#x27;s dentist put some of this on her nail in the hopes that it would be too bitter to bear. It seemed to work which was good since this was a last resort. (The plastic thumb guard only lasted while she was asleep, but as soon as it came off, the thumb was back in the mouth.) However, the next time we tried it, she still sucked her thumb, claiming it didn&#x27;t taste bad enough to deter her from sucking her thumb! Whatever.</li>
            <li> My son is almost 8 and bites his fingers and nails since he was 2. I have tried tons of stuffs and nothing ever worked. I read lots of reviews here at Amazon and decided to give it a try. It has been 4 weeks and my son completely stopped biting his fingers (cuticle) and nails on the first time I applied Mavala. It&#x27;s a miracle in a bottle. I&#x27;m so thankful I found this product.</li>
            <li> hoping to stop a young nail biter... goes on matte clear, and works on top of nail polish. hope it is an effective deterrent.</li>
            <li> This product worked wonderfully for my four-year old.  Unfortunately, I have had to keep applying it every two or three days because she will continue to suck her thumb when it wears off, but every week she still sucks her thumb less and less and not at all when it&#x27;s on her nail.  Worked very quickly and the taste was bad, but not nauseating.</li>
            <li> This stuff works!  It tastes bad enough and is durable enough I only have to put it on every two or three days.  I&#x27;m so glad I found this on amazon!</li>
            <li> This was just the product my 9 year old son needed to kick his nail-biting habit!  With one use and a LOT of self-control and motivation on my son&#x27;s part, it only took 2 weeks for him to re-train himself to keep his fingers out of his mouth.  As others have noted, this stuff tastes nasty, but my son never became ill because of it.  I did, however, only use a light amount to start because I knew I could increase it if needed.  That one use was all it took!  He put a sticker on the calendar each day he had a nail-biting free day and earned a sleep-over with a friend within 2 weeks!  It&#x27;s been nearly 2 months now since he dropped the habit.  So proud of him!!!</li>
            <li> worked great on my nephew sand we were about tto give up ..but saw all the gresat reviews and bought it and here we are no more sucking his thumb :)</li>
            <li> I bought this product to help my 4 year-old kick her thumb-sucking habit.  She did NOT suck her thumb while it was on her.  However, she still uses her hands to eat with, and just brushing her thumb across her lips produced gagging and fussing.  She seemed unable to eat without this occurring several times per meal.  I felt it too harsh to continue, but removing it was difficult.  This would work better on an older child or adult who WANTS to give up thumb-sucking/fingernail biting.</li>
            <li> Better than others weve tried</li>
            <li> This is the only stuff that works for my son to stop sucking his thumb!</li>
            <li> Works like a charm for thumb sucking!</li>
            <li> I gave this 2 stars because it was easy to apply... but otherwise it did NOT work for my daughter. I applied it over nail polish to help her stop sucking her thumb (she&#x27;s 3.5 years old). She put her thumb in her mouth twice and told me her mouth was burning. She drank a little water after each time, and a few minutes later, told me her tummy hurt.... and then proceeded to throw up on me. Definitely NOT the result I was looking for from this product! It went right in the trash!</li>
            <li> Stuff works great.  I now have nails.  Quit biting in 2 days after 30 yrs!</li>
            <li> After reading all the great reviews I decided to try this but my daughter still bites her nails.  Even one daily application isn&#x27;t doing the trick.  I&#x27;m disappointed.</li>
            <li> We had tried everything to stop my 8 year old from sucking his thumb.  This was recommended to me by another Mom with the same problem.  It only took a few days of using this before he stopped completely.  You do need to reapply every day or 2 to keep the taste strong.</li>
            <li> My son stopped biting his nails in 2 days!!!  He hated having this on his nails.  I tried it too.  It tastes awful.  Terrible.  I completely recommend it to anyone who has a nail biting habit or a child who does.  I wasn&#x27;t sure it would work.  My son has been biting his nails for years.  But he&#x27;s proud of himself now that he&#x27;s stopped.  He loves to show me his nails growing back.  And he knows the Mavala is coming back if I see evidence of biting again.</li>
            <li> My daughter bites her nails and she started using this and now I can see her beautiful face instead of always seeing her hands in her mouth covering half her face.  Her habit was getting so bad that her hands were literally in her mouth over half the time, and this stuff is so bitter it keeps them away!</li>
            <li> Did not work for my 4yo. She made a face at first and then proceeded to stick her thumb back in her mouth. I even tried coating the whole tip of the thum all the way around.</li>
            <li> It is a wonderful product but my child is still socking his thumb. I don&#x27;t know he do it because I tried this product before to put in his thumb ant it is so bad, it was in my finger for two days.</li>
            <li> I had a thumb sucker.  The dentist told her to quit and she got a little breakdown of her skin on her thumb one winter.  I told her that one day her thumb would start to taste bad.  After a few weeks I went in one night at 11 and put some Mavala on her thumb nail.  She woke at 3am saying her thumb tasted bad.  I said &#x27;sorry that&#x27;s what happens&amp;#34;.  SHE NEVER SUCKED HER THUMB AGAIN.  I did put the Mavala on a few more nights.  My daugter does also sleep with an Angel Dear &amp;#34;Lovey&amp;#34;  she has become much more dependent on that at night and when she is tired.</li>
            <li> Did not work for my 2 year old kid in long run ... probably work for 2 days and then she grew accustomed to the taste.</li>
            <li> Oh wow!!!!!! This worked soooo good. It&#x27;s been almost 6 months since I bought and used this for my 5 yr old who we tried many other stop thumb sucking things. Which one other did work, but then she started school and towards the middle of the school year the thumb sucking came back. So, I took the leap to try something dramatic and based on some other reviews this did seem to be dramatic. Well, it did make my daughter vomit the water she was drinking the first time I put it on her. However, she did put her thumb in her mouth a little too soon maybe. But once I determined how strong it was I only put one brush on each thumb. Well, she is glad to stop sucking her thumb so much that now if she realizes she may want to put her thumb in her mouth she asks me to put this on. I tell you, what a relief. No more fighting or excuses and no more accidental thumb sucking. It definitely seems over.</li>
            <li> As long as you are consistent about putting this one it really does a great job! I just wish I was more consistent! :)</li>
            <li> I applied it every day for 3 days to my 19 month olds thumb and she was done trying to suck her thumb forever. A miracle worker.</li>
            <li> I tried to stop biting my nails unsuccessfully for many years. Mavala made me stop immediately. The awful taste stuck with me and made an instant and lasting impression. It did make finger foods unbearable for several days, but stopping nailbiting was well worth that temporary price.</li>
            <li> I was extremely skeptical about this product. My daughter sucked on her thumb day and night.  The worse part about it was that she would go play outside and get all dirty.  Her hands would get full of dirt when she would roll around the grass with our puppies, and suddenly she would stick her thumb in her mouth.  I felt like she just ate all these germs and dirt.  It was so frustrating and her nail was getting so thin.  So I ordered this product.  My husband almost may me quit giving her the product because she had been vomiting.  But I told him if she vomited for more than two days I would stop giving it to her.  But surprisingly it make her vomit for only two days.  I would see her attempt to put her thumb in her mouth but she would hesitate.  It&#x27;s been three month and she has not sucked on her thumb.  I am so happy.  The downfall I seen in this product was that it makes your kids vomit and you have to keep on applying the product constantly throughout the day, or else your child will start sucking on their thumb as soon as the product taste is not applied freshly every few hours.</li>
            <li> Taste absolutely horrible.  It ribs on your food even though I only placed it on her nails. My 2 year old stopped for a couplr days but after that she didnt care about the horrible taste and started sucking her thumbs again.</li>
            <li> Couldn&#x27;t get my son to keep his thumb out of his mouth or my husband to stop chewing his nails. Ordered a bottle of Mavala Stop and the taste was so bad it got their attention quick. (Just like it&#x27;s supposed to do.) Now when I see my son thinking of sticking his thumb in his mouth he remembers the taste and thinks better of it. This is helping him break a bad habit. It reminds my husband to stop chewing/biting his nails as well.</li>
            <li> This formula works really well.  I&#x27;ve tried a couple of others, but they just weren&#x27;t strong enough to deter me from biting my nails. The only drawback is that when you touch food, you can taste the bitterness on the food. But hey, if that&#x27;s what it takes to kick the habit, I&#x27;ll take it.</li>
            <li> Buy this ONLY if you have a three old or above . If you buy this for a younger child it wouldn&#x27;t work. I used it on my 2 1/2yrs and did not feel a thing about it. He suck his tumb immediately I apply and did not feel it at all. But when i apply it on my 4Yrs old daughter she beg me not to put on her tumb even after three days since she still feels the bitterness on her tumb.</li>
            <li> My daughter is a diehard thumbsucker and at 3.5 we decided something needed to be done.  This stuff stopped her pretty much immediately.  She had a hard couple of nights but we are now thumb free!</li>
            <li> son found way to rub it off and man though the foul taste so he could suck his thumb. I tasted it and its disgusting, but obviously my son was willing to endure to suck it anyways. Its a hassle as you have to hold their thumb long enough for it to completely dry.</li>
            <li> Since I have gotten this product I haven&#x27;t even thought of biting my nails, and its better then other products that add a yellow tint to your nail.</li>
            <li> Got this for my Mother. It is working like a charm. Every time she puts her nails to her mouth, she immediately complains of the foul tasting product. She immediately stops biting.</li>
            <li> Easy application....and it works!  My daughter (4 yrs old) can&#x27;t stand the taste!  I has curbed her chewing dramatically....eventually she has chewed it off but reapplication fixes that!</li>
            <li> Worked wonder. My daughter WAS a thumb sucker. My wife and I tried everything to get her to stop. And my 5 year old daughter desperately wanted to quit sucking her thumb as well. It developed into a habit that was so hard to break.  It has been over a month now since she has sucked her thumb! She officially feels like a big girl too! It really helped her self esteem because she was starting to get embarrassed about it. We even stopped using the product a few days ago and I think it is safe to say the habit has been broke! We highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> This worked great on my 4-yr old for about 2 days. Now he can power through it and is sitll sucking his thumb. Bummer.</li>
            <li> My son has been sucking his thumb for 3 years .(he&#x27;s 3) His thumb was changing in appearance and developed hard  skin; this was how bad and often he sucked his thumb. In one day that all changed, he didn&#x27;t dare to suck that thumb. I have put it on sparingly(when I remembered) and have not had a reason to use it any longer. he is officially over that phase... The thing that sucks is I have a barely used product that I don&#x27;t need any more because it worked.</li>
            <li> 5 year old little girl no longer sucking thumb or bitting fingernails....Dad using it too and has long finger nails for the first time in thirty some odd years.</li>
            <li> This is the 3rd kind of quit thumb sucking solution that I have tried. My daughter could just suck her thumb despite the other two. This one worked! I have to make sure to apply it often (she lets me do it because I don&#x27;t think she wants to suck her thumb either because big non thumb sucking girls get nail polish). I also put it on two chronic nail bitters and they aren&#x27;t biting either. The only thing about it is if you eat food with your fingers you may get that horrible taste in your mouth as well. It works tho!</li>
            <li> they sent me the wrong product! I wanted the mavala stop and instead I got some nail strengthening polish. I couldn&#x27;t send it back because it looked so similar so I threw away the packaging. It was only after I used it that I noticed it was different.</li>
            <li> This stuff really works! It stops my 4 year old from biting his nails.</li>
            <li> It worked for my 2 yr old, but not my stubborn 4yr old.</li>
            <li> Our 4 year old daughter desperately wanted to stop sucking her thumb---and we also were of the same mindset.  We tried *everything*....but nothing worked.  It broke our hearts that she wanted to stop but just couldn&#x27;t.  I bought this product as sort of a last-ditch attempt before buying one of those contraptions that the child wears.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All that said, we put it on her and she stopped.  Literally.  Put the thumb in her mouth once.  Made a face.  Took a drink of water.  AND NEVER SUCKED HER THUMB AGAIN.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We applied one additional day just to make sure---and that is it.  Two applications.  The habit is completely gone.</li>
            <li> Been biting my nails for over 15 years. Nothing worked. Thum was crap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just started using this a few days ago. It tastes mostly like nail polish remover and has the same lingering effect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have accidentally put my fingers in my mouth numerous times, unconsciously, but each time seems further and further apart. Thusfar, it&#x27;s working perfectly, but I&#x27;m saving the extra star for a later date.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re dilligent about reapplying this crap and are okay not eating finger foods for a while, I&#x27;m almost 100% positive it&#x27;ll work.</li>
            <li> Yes it works but you must use it on a regular basis to break the cycle. I recommend it to all who have battled nail bitters.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t work with my 7-year old daughter.  She at first hated the taste, now it doesn&#x27;t bother her at all.  It was recommended by her dentist, who had several patients which were helped by it.</li>
            <li> Our six year old daughter got the final warning from the dentist - quit sucking her thumb or else!  We ordered this product and have been very, very happy.  She is old enough that she was able to stop her thumb sucking during the day of her own accord, but it was night-time that was the problem.  She would begin sucking her thumb after she had fallen asleep.  This product was perfect!  Even in her sleep it tastes bad and she would take her thumb out of her mouth!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She did complain about the taste when eating finger foods, but it wasn&#x27;t that big of a problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does need to be reapplied every other day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this product - and I wish that we had found it about two years ago!</li>
            <li> As an avid nail biter for almost a quarter of a century, yesterday, for the first time in my life, i had to cut my fingernails.  Only other nail biters out there know what a beautiful problem this is for me to have.  It only took me about 2 days to completely stop putting my fingers near my mouth and after about a month I had some legitimate nail growth.  I still get the urge to bite every now then so I just put on a coat and the urge is eradicated.  A great product that, to me, is worth every penny.</li>
            <li> Worked instantly. No more thumb sucking for my 3 year old.</li>
            <li> The negative reviews are all parents saying it didn&#x27;t stop their toddler from biting their nails -- it clearly states on the package that it doesn&#x27;t work on young children. Though it does leave a shiny coating on the nails, it tastes terrible and even thickens the nail bud so when I go to pick my nails it doesn&#x27;t work as easily. I recommend this product</li>
            <li> My daughter is almost 7 years old and has sucked her thumb since she was first able to pop it in her mouth.  I tried everything to get her to stop, including sticker charts and the ThumbBuster.  It&#x27;s been two weeks since we first tried Mavala Stop, and she has not sucked her thumb one time!  I was so afraid to try it, thinking it would be cruel, but it really was not that bad.  A couple of things that worked for us:  One little dab on the nail is all that is needed, and it needs to be re-applied after a couple of days.  We first taste-tested it together with a tube of toothpaste nearby.  That way she knew if she made a mistake, it could be fixed by toothpaste.  Any time I put it on my daughter&#x27;s thumb, I did the same to mine.  That way, we shared in our accidental taste misery.  She thought it was so funny any time I taste-tested something with the wrong hand.  So it has been two weeks - I will post an update if the streak continues!</li>
            <li> If this stuff wont stop you from biting your nails, you may as well get your teeth pulled. I tried the stuff you can get at Walmart, and in terms of being effective, there is no comparison. Mavala Stop is absolutely the best product of it&#x27;s type on the market today.</li>
            <li> I have tried pretty much everything to get my daughter to stop sucking her thumb.  It got to a point where she was conscious of it at home but in daycare (with the plethora of other kids who are also thumb suckers) she picked the habit back up while not in my presence.  I decided to order this after reading all the positive reviews.  I LOVE how this is not easily removable.  Prior my trick to get her to stop sucking her thumb was putting cute (Hello Kitty, Strawberry Shortcake, etc.) band aids on her thumbs to serve as a reminder...but once at daycare she would just remove them and go to town!  This stuff is like nail polish and cannot be easily removed like a bandage.  It only took her about 3 days for her to completely stop.  I would usually paint her thumbs while she is sleeping, this product dries quickly as well.  Would highly recommend to anyone trying to get their child to stop thumb sucking.</li>
            <li> I have only used this 1 or 2 times on my thumb-loving 3 year old, but it was enough to detract her from sucking on her thumb. I started with allowing her to just to suck at nap time and bedtime, and plan to eventually wean her all together. Mavala made it much easier than I thought it was going to be!!</li>
            <li> this stuff is deadly, and WILL stop you from chewing your nails</li>
            <li> I have twin 7 year old girls that for some reason both of them just started biting their nails.  They did this when they were 4 years old, then I used rubbing alcohol on their nails every night and it worked, so I tried that again but this time they still kept biting.&lt;br /&gt;There was nothing in the stores so I read the reviews on amazon about this product and went from there.  The girls IMMEDIATELY stopped biting.  The girls said the taste was &#x27;aweful.&#x27;  Well it&#x27;s about a month and their nails have grown.  I put it on them every other day.  It dries quickly which is great.  Also, I go past the nail and cover their cuticles too with the polish, the area around all their nails looks better.&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> It tastes horrible!!!...but that&#x27;s why it works.</li>
            <li> Tastes nasty so it will keep their fingers out of their mouths!</li>
            <li> Amazing. Stopped my six year old from sucking when nothing else worked!</li>
            <li> Having tried all the options to avoid thumb sucking habit for my 3 year old, Was not very confident that this product would work. But it worked wonders. After first application my daughter cried in the middle of night saying her thumb tastes horrible. She did not sleep for day was crying for a while. But on the second day she made sure she did not suck thumb. After 3 applications we had successes in breaking her thumb sucking habit.  This is a wonderful product..</li>
            <li> I have been a nail biter since I was a child. Tried everything. This works. Wear plastic gloves when eating with hands.</li>
            <li> My son stop sucking his finger about a week after I bought this Mavala. Thank you! It&#x27;s been nine years.</li>
            <li> This product worked for my second grade child.  Her teacher said she &amp;#34;checked out&amp;#34; and wasn&#x27;t getting her work done when her thumb went in her mouth (which was a pretty constant behavior).  We put this product on as directed and about three weeks later the habit was broken.  Her reading levels jumped and she became more talkative and social.  SOOO HAPPY!</li>
            <li> This stuff really works! I was worried that my 7yr old finger-sucker would be able to outsmart this stuff by washing it off.  Guess what?  It does not wash off...it lasts for several days and then wears off.  I just reapply at night while she was sleeping.</li>
            <li> I ordered this to stop my son from sucking his thumb. It worked for 5 hours but he decided that he wanted to suck his thumb no matter how bad the taste was!! I gave it to a friend of mine for her son who chews on the skin around his fingernails. It has worked for her!</li>
            <li> Used this for our 4 yr old son who sucked his thumb since birth.  We tried positive reinforcement, rewards for not sucking his thumb etc, that didn&#x27;t work.  Punishing him or yelling at him for doing it certainly didn&#x27;t work either.  We were about to give up and let him &amp;#34;grow out of it&amp;#34; as we heard from our laid back DR and friends/family.  Frankly, it bothered me and my wife to the point of annoyance that we would find ourselves getting frustrated. It seemed he was the only one in his age group that still sucked his thumb.  We received the product, had him put on the &amp;#34;magic medicine&amp;#34; immediately. We explained that the medicine will taste really, really bad..  He attempted 2 to 3 times to suck his thumb the first day, and that was it.  We applied every morning and night for a week to be sure, and he didn&#x27;t touch his thumb after the first day!!!!  Amazed.  2 months later, can report he has completely kicked the habit.  Don&#x27;t hesitate with this product.  My son was prone to cold and infections because of this habit.  His eyes were puffy and had bags under them when sucking his thumb.  His face and eyes look normal and he hasn&#x27;t caught a cold since.</li>
            <li> It has worked very fine even though I had my desicion made about leaving nail bitting.It helped me in the anxious times when I wanted to go back. I shared a bit with a friend and she&#x27;s very happy with her results. totally recommended.</li>
            <li> DON&#x27;T BUY THIS!!! MY CHILD IS 5 YEARS OLD AND THINKS THIS WAS A FUN GAMES TO PLAY!! DON&#x27;T BUY!!</li>
            <li> Our three year old has always sucked his thumb, especially to sleep at night. We have been trying to encourage him to stop without an aid, but it wasn&#x27;t working out. But, he did acknowledge on his own that he wanted help to stop sucking his thumb. We called the Mavala medicine that would help. We started with a little dab on the tip of his thumb, this was enough to put a bad taste in his mouth. We ended up re-applying it every two days. In about three weeks he had stopped sucking during the day, and by five weeks he stopped completely. We are very happy with the product and the results!</li>
            <li> It did help my daughter to stop sucking her thump. It works. Period</li>
            <li> Background Info: 23 year old nail/cuticle biter from a mixture of anxiety and boredom for at least 10 years or more.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve tried hot sauce and bitter apple spray (the kind you use to keep dogs from gnawing the furniture), germ-x, nail polish remover, along with nail polish, acrylics, you name it... Nothing has been keeping me from biting and tearing my nails and the skin around my nails to the point of sores.  No matter how bloody and painful my hands are, I still pick and bite.&lt;br /&gt;I just got the Mavala today.  It&#x27;s some nasty crap.  It&#x27;s like nail polish remover, mixed with some sort of rotten food.  I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s the initial taste that really gets me, but the aftertaste.  Once this stuff mixes with saliva it STAYS...for...HOURS.  I kid you not, I bit my thumbnail around 4 hours ago and still faintly taste it.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s not exactly helpful if you&#x27;re a &amp;#34;picker&amp;#34; in addition to a &amp;#34;biter&amp;#34; though. I&#x27;m still picking my nails and cuticles, but at least I&#x27;m keeping my hands out of my mouth for now.  I&#x27;ll update the review later if anything changes!</li>
            <li> My daughter doesn&#x27;t suck her thumb any more with just a few applications of this stuff!</li>
            <li> Well, it was very nasty to the taste. However, it did not stop my 5 year old with Down Syndrome from sucking her thumb, but it did make her pretty upset when her food was tasting like her thumb. I could see it working on some. The idea is good, I just have a stubborn one!</li>
            <li> My 6 1/2 year old son has had a very hard time when it comes to thumb sucking.  We have tried incentives, punishments, reasoning and charts.  Nothing has seemed to work.  He agreed to try this and it is totally working!  He has not sucked his thumb at all for over a week, which is a huge deal!  He has agreed to keep using this until we are sure the habit is behind him.  I definitely recommend this to anyone.  It is worth a try!</li>
            <li> My wife and I have a four year old that has been sucking her thumb to comfort herself since she was born. She also has the habit of biting her nails and keeps doing both despite our verbal attempts to get her to stop.  We bought this nail application out of desperation. We tried it last night right before she went to bed telling her it was nail polish for little princesses. She loved how shiny her nails looked but it wasn&#x27;t until a few minutes later that she tried to suck her thumb like she always did as part of her bedtime ritual. As soon as she did she immediately pulls it out and says, &amp;#34;yucky.&amp;#34; My wife and I pretend we&#x27;re not paying attention but believe me, we were observing every little detail.&lt;br /&gt;We have not seen her suck her thumb or bite her nails since then. Granted, it has been two days but so far it seems to be working. I&#x27;ve asked our daughter if she would like to suck her thumb and she replied, &amp;#34;I don&#x27;t suck my thumb, it&#x27;s yucky and I&#x27;m a big girl now.&amp;#34;  Needless to say, my wife and I are very happy with the results.</li>
            <li> Works great with my daughter. She hates the taste and knows to not suck her thumb.</li>
            <li> This product is awesome! My daughter, now three years old sucked her thumb for comfort before naps and bedtime. I tried several times to entice her to stop but was unsuccessful. This product was recommended by her dentist. When I realized her thumb sucking could really affect her teeth, I ordered Mavala and it was a saving grace. The only draw back is that it wears off after 2 or 3 days so you have to be consistent...but this product really works!</li>
            <li> I have been using this product on my daughter&#x27;s thumb to break her thumb sucking habit. It has been 2 weeks and she has not sucked her thumb once. The solution does not wash off easily when she washes her hands or takes a bath. I guess it wears off a little at a time unless you remove it with nail polish remover. I don&#x27;t have to apply it everyday but the taste still lingers until I apply it again. She would lick her thumb every now and then to see if it is still there but now she seems to be ok with not sucking her thumb. I will continue using it for another month or two just to make sure the habit is completely gone. So far so good!!!!!</li>
            <li> I first used this for my 10 year old that still sucked her thumb after she was asleep, it frustrated her so much and this product worked amazingly fast. I then discovered an added bonus, she was healthier no constant cough and runny nose. She told me that when she eats with her fingers the product gets in her mouth, if she touched her face it got in her mouth so she had to make adjustments to prevent her fingers from touching her mouth. Well- needless to say all my kids wear this everyday during cold and flu season to keep their hands off their face it works great and they are all much healthier. I can&#x27;t stop their cubby buddy from coughing all over them but I can keep the germs for the markers for getting into their mouth.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been a nail biter since I was in elementary and I&#x27;ve always hated the habit. My parents would always try to snap me out of it but I couldn&#x27;t help myself at all! 10 years later and pursuing a career as a nurse I&#x27;ve realized this really needs to end! Since we aren&#x27;t allowed to use fake nails in the workplace, I&#x27;ve been searching for a polish to destroy this habit. This polish sure does leave its mark! When I first put it on, I only put one layer to start off with and put a layer on my younger sister because she&#x27;s starting to bite the tips of her nails. Even though it&#x27;s not as bad as me I wanted to help prevent it from growing into a habit. We were both curious to how bad it tasted and she actually licked her entire nail and well.. it wasn&#x27;t very pleasant! I haven&#x27;t been tempted to bite my nails but there were times when I stuck the edge of my finger near my mouth and it made me aware and more focused to keep my hands off my face! Which I really liked because I&#x27;m one of those people who put my hands on my face too much which is really bad because of all the portals of entry. The bad about this product is that when eating if your finger touches your food, I feel as if it spreads on it and if you eat it you&#x27;ll regret it. The first day I had chicken and there was no direct contact of my nail to my food but the bottom of my finger did touch it and left that horrible taste on it. So, yes meals would be ruined! This product does make my stomach hurt so I can just imagine how children feel if they taste too much of it and become sick. It says harmless but honestly I&#x27;ve had an increased amount of stomach pain but I also do know I have a sensitive stomach. I also have sensitive lips and this just lingers on them like crazy! It&#x27;s made them chapped but I constantly rinse it out with warm water and apply moisture to them and they feel better and the taste goes away. I never had to wash it out with soap but I know my sister did a few times because it was very strong on her and she is 13, so once again be careful when giving it to the younger kids! 5 stars for this excellent product and I didn&#x27;t deduct any because it&#x27;s really helping me in the long run and I just need to be more careful when eating!she is 13, so once again be careful when giving it to the younger kids! 5 stars for this excellent product and I didn&#x27;t deduct any because it&#x27;s really helping me in the long run and I just need to be more careful when eating!</li>
            <li> I hate writing reviews, but it&#x27;s important for others to know about this product. As soon as my daughter tasted it she made a horrible face and projectile vomited. I thought it was a one time thing, but a couple of hours later the same thing happened.  I immediately removed it from her nails. I googled it and apparently this has happened to many others. It needs to be listed as a side effect!! I won&#x27;t be trying this again!!</li>
            <li> If you have a nail-biting problem, do not hesitate to get this product!! I have been biting my nails since I was a young girl and the first day I applied this, I forgot and brought my fingers to my mouth. Lets just say I regretted that for the next hour! The taste is HORRIBLE, but that is why it is awesome! I haven&#x27;t bitten my nails in a little over a week and that is the longest I have gone without touching them. I am so excited I bought this, especially since I was considering not buying it due to the high price. Honestly, the thirteen dollars is so worth it to stop such a bad habit. I also bought some nail polish to paint my nails to help me even more. It definitely worked and I highly recommend buying this product if you have the habit as well. Good luck!!</li>
            <li> This product is very harmful ! As a parent I am very ashamed that I resulted in using this product for my child.  It made her very sick.  Please read the label before purchasing, it should be banned from shelves.</li>
            <li> My nice starting eating her nails, so I found this product. For $11.00 is really good  it took just 2 days ship.</li>
            <li> It takes like the worst thing you could ever imagine. Cured my daughter from biting her nails in less than a week.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not very common that you find a product where you can call it good for being awful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m a habitual nail-biter, which is an awful habit I picked up back in high school. I haven&#x27;t kicked the habit, but I&#x27;ve used Malava Stop a few times to try and tone it back. Each time it&#x27;s worked, but since it&#x27;s so awful I&#x27;m always hesitant to use it again to try and knock the habit for good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d previously trued the brand &amp;#34;Thum&amp;#34; and really couldn&#x27;t tell there was anything on my nails, then I purchased Malava Stop and it was night and day. I literally must say that this stuff is absolutely horrid to get on your tongue, so you will try so very hard to not do it. I find that when I wear it I do stop biting my nails, my hand might make it halfway to my mouth before I subconciously think &amp;#34;oh... right... never mind.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, the downside (at least, for me) for this product (and any like it) to solve this kind of problem is that it also kind of ruins any finger foods you might be trying to eat for the ~1-2 weeks you have an application on your fingers. No potato chips, hot wings, pizza, cookies, cinnamon buns, popcorn, etc. Of course you can try to be very careful but you&#x27;re bound to get that one bite where your fingers hit your tongue or lip and it&#x27;s just gross.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyways, just prepare yourself and good luck!</li>
            <li> We have tried everything to get our child to stop sucking their thumb and this stuff really works! You have to put it on all fingers and definitely don&#x27;t skip a day though.</li>
            <li> I would pay $500 for his if needed. My son was almost 3 and nothing worked. Put this on twice and magic. This is a gift from god.</li>
            <li> bought to get three year old to stop sucking thumb. didnt work well, she was stubborn. when she turned four i ordered some more and it worked after one application. no more thumb sucking.</li>
            <li> My son was a thumb sucker since infancy, and this finally got him to stop his habit. It only took a week of using this product for him to quit. And it has stuck for the last few months, so I even have product left in case my youngest picks up the habit, too.</li>
            <li> PLUS,bitter taste lasts for days and is so bad that it does discourage nail biting. CON, finger foods must be eaten with utensils to avoid putting your fingers in your mouth, as this wll interfere with the flavor of food.</li>
            <li> My daughter has been biting her nails for ages.  (She is 20).  I bought this for her and for the first time in her life, she has fingernails and skin around her fingers.  Works like a charm.  Stopped the habit in two days.  Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I used it to help my daughter to sucking her fingers. It has a very bitter, long lasting  taste, that discourages you from putting your fingers in your mouth. It needs to be reapplied every 2-3 days for best results.</li>
            <li> So far this is working for my daughter.  She has been biting her nails and surrounding skin for years.  I have to apply it daily rather than every other day as is directed.</li>
            <li> The first bottle helped me more than the second one...I do have to wear this about all the time or I chew my nails.  I am in my 30&#x27;s, so that is depressing, but  it&#x27;s just like I have clear polish on.  It does prevent me from nail biting.</li>
            <li> REALLY WORKS....NASTY TASTING.....Wonderful! I had a death in my family and that is why I have not posted sooner. Thank you. GOD is good. Martha</li>
            <li> This stuff tastes so bad that when you have it on your nails it is impossible to bite them. I used it for 1 week and now my nails are long. I would definitely recommend.</li>
            <li> My 2 year old had a bad habit of sucking her thumb especially when she was tired. I used this product and she hasnt sucked her thumb since. She does not complain about the taste, she just stopped the thumb sucking.</li>
            <li> This mixture does not even deter my son. He will stick his fingers in his mouth with no hesitation. Probably need to make it more bitter than it already is..</li>
            <li> So I would give this five stars because it has helped my husband. But my son bites right through it. I could probably dip his hands in acid and he would still bite through.</li>
            <li> In only three days my one and a half year-old stop sucking her thumb</li>
            <li> My daughter had a serious thumb sucking habit. I started using this when she turned 3. I used it for less than a month and applied it every two days.  It stopped her from sucking her thumb. This was a miracle worker for me!</li>
            <li> I used this on my son for a little bit because he was sucking his thumb. he did stop, I don&#x27;t know if it was because he grew out of it or if the stuff really worked.</li>
            <li> If you put it on fresh every day (and reapply whenever you wash your hands or they get wet), this nail biting solution really does work. The trick is to USE IT every day.</li>
            <li> One bottle worked but I spilt it so I had to order another... Second and third bottle did not work at all..</li>
            <li> This product is amazing! I have tried for years to make my little daughter to stop sucking her thumbs and NOTHING worked before.I took my little one to the dentist and the dentist recommend this product. I applied it on her finger nails and it did work immediately,  like magic! She actually does not suck her thumbs anymore!!!! I am the most happy person now.</li>
            <li> My 3 yr old daughter sucked her thumb a lot...to the point she was getting blisters. We only had to apply Mavala once as she stopped. I tried everything before this. I have to reapply ever now and then but this product is amazing.</li>
            <li> I have tried other products to stop thumb sucking and they didn&#x27;t work (my kids sucked through them) but this one was amazing!</li>
            <li> My seven year old nailbiter will not bite his nails for at least 3 days after this has been applied. So, it works. It&#x27;s also not too shiny, which I appreciate since he&#x27;s a boy. However, I didn&#x27;t consider when purchasing this product that 7 year olds have loose teeth that they like/need to wiggle. So we have to take breaks from the product when he has loose teeth. Therefore, my crusade against nailbiting has not been as successful as I had hoped.</li>
            <li> I think it&#x27;s best to make sure your child is over the age of 3-4. With that being said, &amp;#34;THIS WAS THE BEST MONEY I&#x27;VE EVER SPENT&amp;#34;! When my daughter was brought to me after delivery she shunned her binky and put her thumb in her mouth, that was the beginning of my nightmare.  For 3 years her father and I searched for ways to get her to stop sucking her thumb! She sucked her thumb to the point of her skin starting to peel; thats when I realized that something had to be done! Her Dentist recommended we try this and in less than a week, SHE STOPPED! I mean..seriously I couldn&#x27;t believe it. And I stated the age factor because she was able to associate the bad taste with thumb sucking, curbing the habit! I&#x27;m so grateful because I not only saved thousands from braces, but her teeth will be able to grow the way they are supposed to now! Sigh!!..(BTW..I&#x27;ve NEVER written a review before..but this definitely deserved it!:-)</li>
            <li> This is great product. I stop bite my nail finally.</li>
            <li> I got this product to help my 3 year old stop sucking her thumb. It was like I never put it on. I tried it for several nights, one time I blew it dry, the second I let it air dry. One night I even let it dry and put on another coat, nothing.</li>
            <li> Finally my five year old is done sucking her thumb. We tried many different tactics, and I swore I wouldn&#x27;t use something like this, but after everything else failed, I decided to give it a try. After 2 days she had quit. Weeks later she has still not restarted, as she did with other methods we tried.</li>
            <li> Works better than most.</li>
            <li> This product does exactly what it claims it will do.  After 3 or 4 applications, the fingers stopped going in the mouth.  We have attempted everything we could think of in the past 18 months and none worked.  I even put some on my nails and tested it.  It tastes horrible!  Once was enough for me to never want to chew my nails.</li>
            <li> I tried this on my 2 year old and it works great!  First day she said, \\&quot;my fingers are spicy!\\&quot;  Amazing results!</li>
            <li> The first few days were tough to get through, as my son cried during the night as he attempted to put his thumb in his mouth while sleeping, and discovered how bad it tasted, but after about two weeks of consistent use, he was done sucking his thumb!</li>
            <li> in the past I tried using Thum Thumb Sucking Nail Biting Treatment but after awhile my kid kept sucking her thumb but after I used this stuff, she really didnt like this taste compared to Thum and stopped sucking her thumb, when she thinks about sucking her thumb I tell her I am going put the Mavala on her thumb and she starts to cry no no.</li>
            <li> I have been trying for a year to help my granddaughter stop sucking her thumb... things that went over her thumb, earning rewards, and another yucky tasting product. This worked after one day! She even quit sucking during the night. And, it came off easily with nail polish remover.</li>
            <li> Works like a champ.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First time we tried it though... my daughter sucked the stuff right off the tip of her finger.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After talking to an Orthodontist... he said - liberally apply it on every finger - from tip to where it the finger attaches to the palm...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Coat the entire finger - and every finger - both hands. Liberally - every night. Takes about 15 fifteen minutes each night.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Use a hair dryer on cool high setting to dry the hands afterwards.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She stopped sucking the 1st night we coated every finger... but we went ahead and used 7 bottles over several weeks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The 7 bottles cost less than the (down the road) dental work needed to fix the issue without Mavala.</li>
            <li> My daughter sucks right through</li>
            <li> This stuff works great! My son was still sucking his fingers at age 7 yr (he is now 8). I applied Mavala Stop while he was sleeping. He woke up early because he was unable to sleep without sucking his fingers. That was the last day he sucked his fingers. I applied the Mavala Stop every night for 2 weeks. Mainly on his fingers not his nails.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Even after a couple months I noticed the he had his fingers in his mouth while sleeping. Again, I applied the Mavala Stop and no more sucking for him.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It was very hard for him, even though it tasted gross. At night I would lay with him, because it was VERY difficult. I had to do this for about two weeks.  However, it should be expected.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you Mavala Stop!! It works great!!</li>
            <li> A lifelong nail biter, I had this on my nails for two days and haven&#x27;t put my fingers in my mouth since (that was 2 weeks ago). It is much different than the bitter polish my mom would buy me when I was a kid, which would wash right off when you wash your hands. This stuff sticks. Even after I took it off with polish remover, it took another day before the bitterness went away. The flavor it leaves in your mouth is strong and long-lasting. Mints barely kill the taste. In other words, it works. I thought I would have to wear it for weeks, but the taste was so unpleasant and stubborn, that in 2 days, I was done biting.</li>
            <li> This was amazing, we used on our 4-year old daughter and she cried a little the first night but did not suck her thumb again.&lt;br /&gt;We tried a glove over her fingers, rewards, nothing worked.  We were desperate and very skeptical this would work as she sucked her fingers constantly . Buy this, it will work.</li>
            <li> Works like a dream! My 4 year old is now on her 10th day of no thumb sucking.  Just use a small tiny quantity and reapply every night et voila!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also bought the pink j glove to help her through the first few days! So that probably reduced the resistance to applying mavala since her friend thought the thumb-guard was cool!</li>
            <li> Trying to get my son to stop sucking his thumb....this product works.  He does not like the taste at all.</li>
            <li> did not stop my son from biting his nails at all</li>
            <li> My 6 year old daughter hated this so much she quit biting her nails.  Score!</li>
            <li> despite of the bitter taste my 3 year old got used to of it...continued with sucking thumb...this product didn&#x27;t work for me :(</li>
            <li> My 5 year old son LOVES his thumb! We have tried multiple products similar to ths one, and this one surpasses all of the others, by far! Some brands don&#x27;t deter him at all because the taste is not bad enough, others wore off after a few hours, and one even burned his eyes very badly when he rubbed them at night! However, this product keeps him from putting his thumb in his mouth at all, it only needs to be applied to his thumbnail once every day or two, and it is only bitter, not spicy, so it doesn&#x27;t cause irritation when he rubs his tired eyes. If you can add in the application of this product into your childs daily routine for a short amount of time, it will break their thumbsucking habit. One bottle will do the trick if you are consistent.</li>
            <li> Wow this stuff really worked. It made for some dramatic mid-night crying as my son stuck his thumb in his mouth. He described his thumb as &amp;#34;sour&amp;#34; and thought that when you turn 4, your thumbs automatically turn sour. After only three applications, he has completely stopped thumb sucking!</li>
            <li> I was hoping this would work for my 5 year old to stop biting his nails.  However, he would only comment on how it didn&#x27;t taste great, but he continued to bite his nails.  Disappointed.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s an ok product but didn&#x27;t really work. At first my son didn&#x27;t bite his nails because he knew the stuff was on there and was told that it would taste really bad but eventually he bit them anyway and said the taste wasn&#x27;t that bad.</li>
            <li> I personally love this product. My daughter developed this nail biting habit and I have no idea why . This definitely has put a bad taste in her mouth and has forced her to stop. She still occasionally goes to put her fingers in her mouth and I give one warning about Mavala and she stops. She is almost 4 . I had to re-apply every day for about 2 weeks for it to REALLY work. When I thought I could apply it once a week it did not work. trial and error i suppose every child is different but thats what worked for us.</li>
            <li> I almost never write reviews but I felt impelled to do so with this product for the simple fact that it actually helped my oldest daughter change an unpleasant and unsanitary behavior that had become habitual.  She chewed on her nails in the AM, cringed and complained about the awful taste as she got on her school-bus, and was still complaining about the taste 8 hours later when she got off the bus.  The point here is while she suffered for the entire day with the taste, she did so with her fingers OUTSIDE of her mouth.  Cruel yes, but effective!</li>
            <li> My 3.5yr old is a chronic thumb sucker.  Orthodontist recommended based on results from other patients.  My son said it tasted yucky and wouldn&#x27;t suck his thumb for an hour or so but then he just didn&#x27;t seem to care after that. But he&#x27;s stubborn.  Seems to work for a lot of other people and I&#x27;m thinking about trying with my older son to stop nail biting.</li>
            <li> I never thought my daughter would stop sucking her thumb, but this worked in a few days. She has not done it again since.</li>
            <li> We bought this for our 17-month-old who can&#x27;t stop sucking her fingers-especially at night. We put it on her two favorite fingers at night and she went to bed and ended up vomiting (several times) when she put her fingers in her mouth. I would recommend waiting until they are older (like the directions state...I know, but we are desperate her teeth are starting to grow crooked) and if possible, not with a full stomach.</li>
            <li> It definitely has a bad taste, and for moderate thumb suckers it probably works great. My six year old son complained about the taste but still sucked his thumb.</li>
            <li> the only thing that works for people who bite their nails. its absolutely disgusting</li>
            <li> works for my gf&#x27;s mom.</li>
            <li> I think my son likes the flavor...</li>
            <li> If anything will help stop thumb sucking or nail bitiing, this will. I put some on to try out and it haunted me any time I touch my hand to my mouth (which includes when eating finger foods). It helped my little ones stop thumb sucking, though they do need to be on board with the idea, otherwise they will chew it off.</li>
            <li> Helped me stop biting! Something I needed to do for several years! Tastes terrible, but that&#x27;s a good thing, I now have long healthy nails!</li>
            <li> Love this!  Helped my child to&lt;br /&gt;Stop biting his nails</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m going to try again when my daughter turns 3 years old and see if the taste bothers her more then. I&#x27;ve heard children don&#x27;t have developed taste buds until about 3. It stays on just a little bit better than other stuff I bought, but it&#x27;s pretty much the same. I have to reapply it a couple times a day. I tried it for 3 days straight, with it constantly on her, and it either came off enough that she didn&#x27;t care about it, or she got used to the taste or stopped caring that it tasted bad.</li>
            <li> Purchased this for my 10 year old son who has been a nail biter for as long as I can remember and it has been working amazingly! My son wasn&#x27;t to happy about having to wear it on his nails because it does dry clear however its shinny just like any other clear polish. But I can say the nasty taste has kept him from biting his nails! For best results I would suggest to reapply the polish at least every 4 days</li>
            <li> I bought this to help my daughter who just turned seven to stop sucking her thumb.  We have been trying to break her of this for years. I put this on on a week ago and she hasn&#x27;t sucked her thumb since.  I highly recommend it.  So happy she has finally stopped!</li>
            <li> Works beautifully. We applied it twice and made of show of how nasty my two-year-old&#x27;s son thumb was, and that was it. We had tried everything prior to this. Someone suggested we give this a try, and I&#x27;m so glad they did. There is nothing in this product that is going to hurt a child in a few tries. This is not intended for long-term usage.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not working with my 3 years old son.</li>
            <li> This stuff is awesome!! No one in their right minds would put their fingers in their mouths when they&#x27;re painted with the Mavala. But if your fingers get wet, it comes off on whatever they&#x27;re touching, which can get pretty nasty if, for example, you&#x27;re eating a messy sandwich.  It&#x27;s only really strong for the first day or two, so I make sure not to apply it if I know I&#x27;ll be cooking that night (or even the next).  You can reduce the effect by washing your hands- I like to apply it before showering to help keep it from leaking off into my food.  But it definitely serves its purpose very well!</li>
            <li> My Daughter stopped sucking her thumb in less than a week. I have plenty left and we are using every once and a while when she feels an urge to suck the thumb again.</li>
            <li> great kid has stopped already sucking the finger</li>
            <li> My 4 year old was sucking his thumb since infancy. My friend recommended this and it works like magic. We only had to use it a couple of times, my son stoped sucking his thumb within a few days. Great product!!!</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t work. My daughter didn&#x27;t seem to notice it.  I ended up buying something called bitter nail and she stopped sucking her thumb within a few days....</li>
            <li> Orders this to use to stop thumb sucking.. First night, worked, following night son was &amp;#34;use to it.&amp;#34; He has now adapted to the taste and it no longer works :(</li>
            <li> This is a great product. It worked on the first time on my son when he was 2, my daughter it is a little tougher to break the habit of sucking her fingers/thumb. When I use the product she stops and will stop for a few weeks after, but she keeps reverting back. I just bought some more and will try to be more diligent about putting it on her every day (she is 6).</li>
            <li> Was recommended by a Doctor to stop our daughter from sucking her thumb. Her teeth were growing in all crooked because of the thumb sucking. We used it on her, but she just kept sucking her thumb. I tasted it and it is SO BITTER, I don&#x27;t know how she could keep doing it. I think it wears off once it dries.</li>
            <li> Nothing short of a miracle! Five year old stopped sucking thumb after one day of application. Since he knew &amp;#34;medicine&amp;#34; was on his thumb he didnt even try to put thumb in mouth. After Mavala wore off his thumb he had lost desire. Awesome product!</li>
            <li> I have a 5 year old who has been sucking on her fingers and biting her nails for forever...now she&#x27;s starting to back off and it&#x27;s not a fight all day long. Mom win!</li>
            <li> This stuff is heavy duty it will last for 1-2 days you only need to reapply it every other day, where as the cheap stuff needs to be reapplied twice a day, I used it to stop my child from sucking his fingers and it works like a charm</li>
            <li> Awesome! We have nails now!</li>
            <li> I have been putting this on my 4 year old&#x27;s thumb for about two weeks.  My boy doesn&#x27;t like it and throws a fit because he wants to be able to suck his thumb.  (He is not motivated to break this habit). A little bribery is allowing me to put Mavala Stop on his thumb a  little more easily.  I think it lasts about a day before it wears off, and then he goes back to sucking his thumb.  It hasn&#x27;t broken his habit yet, but I hope it will in time.  I just have to be very consistent about putting it on.  I put it on his entire thumb nail and the tip of his thumb.</li>
            <li> This stuff tastes awful.my daughter is learning to stop sucking her thumb because of it. Hopefully my older ones will stop buying their nails as well.</li>
            <li> I used this on my 3 year old and she had quit sucking her thumb within a few days of use. She gagged and began spitting and whipping off her tongue the first time she tried to suck her thumb after applying it and she never tried it again!</li>
            <li> Its very nasty, and the taste doesn&#x27;t go away!</li>
            <li> It worked to help me stop biting my hangnails.  However, I wear contacts, and every time I put them in while wearing this product I tasted it in the back of my mouth and throat for an hour or so afterward.  It drove me nuts, so I had to stop using it.  I didn&#x27;t see where anyone else mentioned this problem, but I tried it for over a week and it happened every morning within 10-15 minutes of putting my contacts in.</li>
            <li> I used this on my 3 year old and she didn&#x27;t even seem to mind that it was on her fingers.  In the products defense, I got it on my fingers once and hated it!</li>
            <li> Worked great for my 10-year old.</li>
            <li> this works wonders for kids who suck their finger or bite their nails. great product to help stop the habit!</li>
            <li> Our four year old was starting to suck her thumb and we tried for weeks to get her to stop. When I found this stuff, I was put off at first by the mixed reviews. When we got it, I let it sit in the cupboard for another week or two before I got the courage to use it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My 4yo and I sat down for a special session of nail painting. I put a 6mm dab on each of our thumbnails--mine and hers--near the cuticle. I had decided that I&#x27;d find out first-hand how much it affected daily living even for a non-thumbsucker.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product worked as advertised. It was bitter and unpleasant.  It lasted for over a week before wearing off completely. I managed to taste it accidentally several times over the week, so it shouldn&#x27;t be used on anyone sensitive enough to throw up if they get it in their mouth. My daughter only tried sucking her thumbs a couple more times. She gave it up and hasn&#x27;t been back at it since.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product isn&#x27;t for everyone, but it worked well for us and I would recommend it for any adults or kids who need additional help keeping fingers out of mouths.</li>
            <li> Truly disgusting. Defiantly will help even with the worst habits</li>
            <li> It worked for us and I would highly recommend it if you are serious about having your child stop sucking their thumb. I have to reapply every few days and I do it during his sleep. The taste seems to go away with a drink of water.</li>
            <li> I apply it daily to my 4 year old child&#x27;s finger nails.  He has been using it for about 2 weeks.  I think it has slowed down his nail biting but I do not think it has stopped it.  So far I am not really sure whether it is really working or not. I bought this product thinking it would be in instant fix.  I thought that has long as he had the nail polish on it would taste so bad he would not bite, but he still does.  I am going to keep using it on him and if he does not stop in a week or two I am going to switch to another brand.</li>
            <li> My nine year old did not stop sucking her thumb after using this for a period of time , she said it did not taste that bad any more</li>
            <li> This stuff works great&lt;br /&gt;My son now all the day doesnt suck his thumb sometimes when he forget i tell him if you suck the thumb I use that stuff and he stop sucking.  just night time he suck the thumb and i feel bad to use and let him with his thumb</li>
            <li> My 4 year old daughter was very attached to her thumb.  I also have a 2.5 year old that sucks his thumb. My four year old has not sucked thumb since first try after Mavala was put on nail! I am still shocked it worked so well! However, my 2.5 year old vomited from the bitter taste. I think he put thumb in his mouth before it was dry because he he has never vomited prior to this.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m going to wait and try it again when he is three years.</li>
            <li> As long as you remember to put it on every week it works good. No complaints, can&#x27;t find this stuff in the store.</li>
            <li> My friend used it and she said it work great!. I was told that this would help my 4 year old son to stop sucking his thumb butt sadly it did not work. It may not be the products fault that this didn&#x27;t work cuz my son is known to suck that thumb no matter what we throw at him!</li>
            <li> Excellent product. I highly recommend it. Take a video of your toddler sucking thumb before you use this product coz after using it you will never see your toddler go back to thumb sucking again. I feel nice to have tried it first.</li>
