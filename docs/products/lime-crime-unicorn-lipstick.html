            <li>Very true to the color it shows in the photo.</li>
            <li>:) I recommend this to anyone who loves bright colors and loves to play with new looks.</li>
            <li>the more I looked at it in the car and in the store and then at home, it got deeper and more neon reddish, which is exactly what I wanted!</li>
            <li>;) LOVE LOVE LOVE</li>
            <li>Love the colour, love the feel of it on my lips, and the pretty deep-pink stain it leaves on my lips when I wash it off.</li>
            <li>This lipstick doesn&#x27;t go on opaque and looks like a cheap crayon.</li>
            <li>but it was perfect ,stayed on all day and left a nice pinkish stain to my lips when I finally removed it.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s actually a rather attractive color (i.e.; no clown lips).</li>
            <li>: Smooth formula, beautiful colour, lasts long, and smells like vanilla</li>
            <li>i love the bright color and it lasts all day long!    </li>
            <li>Amazing vivid color, lasts forever!</li>
            <li>I am usually told that my lips are my best feature.</li>
            <li>Chapstick significantly helps if you have that problem.&lt;br /&gt;You</li>
            <li>It goes on great and stays on fairly long.</li>
            <li>Retrofuturist is my new favoRED, and Lime Crime is my new fave brand!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s super comfortable to wear</li>
            <li>Smelled good too which is genius because most lipsticks do not really have a smell to me..</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s all that matters - right!  </li>
            <li>The bright red lipsticks were the style then, also in the movie colony.  </li>
            <li>I should add that it&#x27;s not as bright and intensely red as it appears on Amazon.  </li>
            <li>But I really like the way the lipstick smells and the packaging is cute.</li>
            <li>I am fair skined and this looked pinkish red on me.</li>
            <li>It gets more intense, the longer its on.</li>
            <li>And if I don&#x27;t scrub it off my face before bed, I will still find myself doing a good bit of work to get it off the next morning.</li>
            <li>This red is bright and looks luscious and when I put it on it makes my lips look so full and pretty!</li>
            <li>i bought this lipstick  due to all the great reviews...</li>
            <li>The color is even more vibrant than it shows.  </li>
            <li>This lipstick leaves lesser beings in fear and awe of your ability to maintain bright and colorful lips.  </li>
            <li>It goes on smooth, moisturizing, defined, and very, very opaque, and it will just stay for hours and</li>
            <li>Very fast shipping too!</li>
            <li>, however the color is very sexy and very red.</li>
            <li>It is simply amazing, and the color is a true red that is both flattering, retro, femme fatale, and bold.</li>
            <li>true red everyone will be loving your lips.</li>
            <li>She is thrilled with the lasting quality.  </li>
            <li>Laugh as them tremble in fear.</li>
            <li>If you can only own one red lipstick in your life ever, this is the one you want to own.</li>
            <li>Worth the money</li>
            <li>This is a nice red but it doesn&#x27;t go on as moisterizing as the photo.</li>
            <li>Such a beautiful, true red!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s more opaque than I&#x27;m used to since my signature red lip is ruby woo from mac, but it&#x27;s cruelty free and vegan</li>
            <li>I was very pleased with this color; it is a nice opaque red that blended well with my dark skin.  </li>
            <li>Shipping was super fast like 5 days.  </li>
            <li>At first, upon putting it on in the car, (straight from my mailbox) I thought, nice red...</li>
            <li>Love how this product goes on and feels when applied, prefect red color for any lady to wear will be ordering again soon!</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s long lasting and smells great.</li>
            <li>;)</li>
            <li>Love this retro red lipstick.</li>
            <li>when I do a speaking engagement and show a clip about the film I wear vintage 1940&#x27;s clothes, a 1940&#x27;s updo, red platform shoes, and this&amp;#34; bright, look at me&amp;#34;, red lipstick.  </li>
            <li>The lipstick is soft, velvety, and TRUE to color..</li>
            <li>I have a bunch of different colors from Lime Crime and they all have way more staying power than pretty much any other lipstick I own (and I have A LOT of makeup), but this one so far tops the list.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m black american, and this color looks great on me.</li>
            <li>Is a little more pink than red but a great color all in all</li>
            <li>For me, I felt it a bit much.  </li>
            <li>I love make and this is my second purchase of lime crime really pretty red!</li>
            <li>But as far lasting and easy to apply.....</li>
            <li>so it&#x27;s not a long lasting lipstick, but i still absolutely love the color and the quality.</li>
            <li>I will continue the search for a true red that matches my skintone.</li>
            <li>and it was super red</li>
            <li>And it even kind of leaves a pink stain the next day, too.  </li>
            <li>I like the color on my skin tone, I&#x27;m pale and I bought this because I&#x27;ve been looking for a good red lipstick.</li>
            <li>Very retro, like old hollywood film stars of the 40&#x27;s!</li>
            <li>/&gt;this is my go to red right now.</li>
            <li>BUT Emma from Lime Crime was a sweetie, and offered to replace it so that my new fave would remain debri-free</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s always hard for me to find a good red that doesn&#x27;t look too purpley or have magenta tones in it.</li>
            <li>So pretty, I&#x27;m about to order a second one for my mom!!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a 77 yr old first time filmmaker producing a short film about WWII.  </li>
            <li>I am really happy to say out of the few Lime Crime products i&#x27;ve bought I have never been disappointed, their lipsticks are very vibrant rich colors!</li>
            <li>I really like this red lipstick!</li>
            <li>on.&lt;br /&gt;it doesnt dry my lips at all which is very very</li>
            <li>Tell them your secret is simply willing your lipstick to remain fabulous and not applying, powdering, and then reapplying LimeCrime.</li>
            <li>Try 8 hours with one reapplication, and a pretty pink stain when I woke up</li>
            <li>Really stands out against your complexion especially this red.....</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t smear all over your face and make you look like a hot mess.</li>
            <li>My only complaint is I was looking for a true red.</li>
            <li>I absolutely loved it and have nothing bad to say about it.</li>

            <li> so it&#x27;s not a long lasting lipstick, but i still absolutely love the color and the quality.</li>
            <li> I will continue the search for a true red that matches my skintone.</li>
            <li> and it was super red</li>
            <li> And it even kind of leaves a pink stain the next day, too.  </li>
            <li> I like the color on my skin tone, I&#x27;m pale and I bought this because I&#x27;ve been looking for a good red lipstick.</li>
            <li> Very retro, like old hollywood film stars of the 40&#x27;s!</li>
            <li> /&gt;this is my go to red right now.</li>
            <li> BUT Emma from Lime Crime was a sweetie, and offered to replace it so that my new fave would remain debri-free</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s always hard for me to find a good red that doesn&#x27;t look too purpley or have magenta tones in it.</li>
            <li> So pretty, I&#x27;m about to order a second one for my mom!!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a 77 yr old first time filmmaker producing a short film about WWII.  </li>
            <li> I am really happy to say out of the few Lime Crime products i&#x27;ve bought I have never been disappointed, their lipsticks are very vibrant rich colors!</li>
            <li> I really like this red lipstick!</li>
            <li> on.&lt;br /&gt;it doesnt dry my lips at all which is very very</li>
            <li> Tell them your secret is simply willing your lipstick to remain fabulous and not applying, powdering, and then reapplying LimeCrime.</li>
            <li> Try 8 hours with one reapplication, and a pretty pink stain when I woke up</li>
            <li> Really stands out against your complexion especially this red.....</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t smear all over your face and make you look like a hot mess.</li>
            <li> My only complaint is I was looking for a true red.</li>
            <li> I absolutely loved it and have nothing bad to say about it.</li>
            <li> The only problem I have is that I have dry lips.</li>
            <li> also, it did not stay on long at all.</li>
            <li> but i learned that theres no need to reapply since it lasts so long!    </li>
            <li> Made this Lime Crime purchase and several other colors at my wife&#x27;s request.  </li>
            <li> I will put this on in the morning and go to bed with it looking not much different, while other brands have worn off halfway through the day.  </li>
            <li> dry and caky look that some long-wear lipsticks do.</li>
            <li> , my lips are really dry.</li>
            <li> , my lips aren&#x27;t naturally dry.</li>
            <li> The lipstick does stay on for hours even after drinking but again, your lips will be dry.</li>
            <li> Make the mistake of kissing someone and your face will be reddish pink for the rest of the night just from minor running around the lips.</li>
            <li> I mean, I wore it last night, woke up with still red lips, scrubbed my lips with a toothbrush, and there&#x27;s still some color left.</li>
            <li> paying $16.00 was crazy for me, but i SO wanted a true red shade...</li>
            <li> /&gt;i am on a VERY LIMITED income.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a bit drying, but it&#x27;s a matte, so that&#x27;s expected.</li>
            <li> You can slap it on, dance all night, eat, drink, and with minimal worry about touch-ups.</li>
            <li> &quot; i am a pale, caucasian female.</li>
            <li> It is not overwhelming and is totally wearable but it makes a statement as well.</li>
            <li> You have to be very careful not to stain your teeth or clothing.</li>
            <li> At least, on me the red looks \\&quot;fushia.\\</li>
            <li> id say very long wear!!!!   </li>
            <li> So if you buy makeup from Lime Crime, you should buy it through Amazon and not directly from the web-site, at least until the company has secured its website from cyber crime.</li>
            <li> If you need a red lipstick that really stands out please buy this one you won&#x27;t be disappointed</li>
            <li> it does stain your lips a little if you keep reapplying</li>
            <li> : The unicorn on the lipstick tube can be a little off-putting for anyone over the age of 21.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros</li>
            <li> fun packageing and no worrie about bad ingrediance.</li>
            <li> Waste of $20</li>
            <li> When I wear this lipstick over lip balm it decreases the pigmentation which makes it hard to wear.</li>
            <li> Be warned: This colour is not for the faint of heart.</li>
            <li> oh, not to mention- I dropped it, and my lid broke :(</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve never had to worry about it feathering (I hate lipliner).</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

            <li> awesome lip stick new favorite brand. true red everyone will be loving your lips. fun packageing and no worrie about bad ingrediance.</li>
            <li> Shipping was super fast like 5 days.  I tried it on as soon as I opened it and it was super red the best shade red ive seen ever, it didnt get on my teeth, then i went to wipe it off and it wouldnt come off it didnt even come off when I washed my face, so id say very long wear!!!!   Im in love   I WILL be ordering more Lime Crime!</li>
            <li> love it!  it stays on and on, even after lunch</li>
            <li> i love the bright color and it lasts all day long!    it does stain your lips a little if you keep reapplying but i learned that theres no need to reapply since it lasts so long!    i love the unicorn on the tube as well.    :)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a 77 yr old first time filmmaker producing a short film about WWII.  The bright red lipsticks were the style then, also in the movie colony.  when I do a speaking engagement and show a clip about the film I wear vintage 1940&#x27;s clothes, a 1940&#x27;s updo, red platform shoes, and this&amp;#34; bright, look at me&amp;#34;, red lipstick.  Great product, and works for my 1940&#x27;s look.</li>
            <li> I like the color on my skin tone, I&#x27;m pale and I bought this because I&#x27;ve been looking for a good red lipstick. It&#x27;s a bit drying, but it&#x27;s a matte, so that&#x27;s expected. When I wear this lipstick over lip balm it decreases the pigmentation which makes it hard to wear. But I really like the way the lipstick smells and the packaging is cute. It also doubles as a lip stain.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m glad I bought this through Amazon and not on the Lime Crime web-site, because the company&#x27;s payment system was hacked and a number of customer&#x27;s had their bank accounts and credit cards (and paypal) hacked. So if you buy makeup from Lime Crime, you should buy it through Amazon and not directly from the web-site, at least until the company has secured its website from cyber crime.</li>
            <li> Made this Lime Crime purchase and several other colors at my wife&#x27;s request.  She is thrilled with the lasting quality.  Colors have great impact.</li>
            <li> Beautiful. Bright colored. Works well with any skin complexion. However, as a warning- it runs. Make the mistake of kissing someone and your face will be reddish pink for the rest of the night just from minor running around the lips.</li>
            <li> The color is even more vibrant than it shows.  For me, I felt it a bit much.  But as far lasting and easy to apply.....It&#x27;s good.</li>
            <li> This lipstick leaves lesser beings in fear and awe of your ability to maintain bright and colorful lips.  Buy it in candy apple red &amp;#34;retrofuturist&amp;#34; which could also described as attention-grabbing, full-out glamazon, or the lil&#x27; red corvette of red lipsticks.  Tell them your secret is simply willing your lipstick to remain fabulous and not applying, powdering, and then reapplying LimeCrime. Laugh as them tremble in fear.</li>
            <li> If you can only own one red lipstick in your life ever, this is the one you want to own. It goes on smooth, moisturizing, defined, and very, very opaque, and it will just stay for hours and hours.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is the perfect going-out lipstick. You can slap it on, dance all night, eat, drink, and with minimal worry about touch-ups. It stays moisturizing and doesn&#x27;t do that dry and caky look that some long-wear lipsticks do. It doesn&#x27;t smear all over your face and make you look like a hot mess. I&#x27;ve been amazed at how well it&#x27;s stood up after hours and hours of wear. It is simply amazing, and the color is a true red that is both flattering, retro, femme fatale, and bold.</li>
            <li> Excellent staying power.</li>
            <li> ITEM WAS AS DESCRIBED. I LOVE IT &amp; IT ALSO MAKES A GREAT GIFT. THANK YOU FOR GREAT SERVICE !!!!</li>
            <li> I love this lipstick! Became one of my favorite lipsticks ever. The color pay off is amazing and smooth to apply on the lips. I will definitely be purchasing this again. Worth the money</li>
            <li> I love the quality of lime crime lip products. This lipstick stayed on through eating breakfast and lunch. My only complaint is I was looking for a true red. I am fair skined and this looked pinkish red on me. I will continue the search for a true red that matches my skintone.</li>
            <li> This lipstick is one of a kind! Its a staple in any makeup kit! At first, upon putting it on in the car, (straight from my mailbox) I thought, nice red...the more I looked at it in the car and in the store and then at home, it got deeper and more neon reddish, which is exactly what I wanted! It gets more intense, the longer its on. If you like to be a show stopper, this is for you! Very fast shipping too!</li>
            <li> i love this lipstick and everyone else as well.&lt;br /&gt;i got so many complements once i put it on.&lt;br /&gt;it doesnt dry my lips at all which is very very important.&lt;br /&gt;Love It!!!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not even kidding. Not only does it smell like cupcakes, but the color lasts-- I mean, I wore it last night, woke up with still red lips, scrubbed my lips with a toothbrush, and there&#x27;s still some color left. You just can&#x27;t beat it. And the color is amazing. I wore it to a rockabilly movie premiere and got so many compliments on it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been diying to get a Lime Crime lipstick and I finally ordered Retrofuturinst . I absolutely loved it and have nothing bad to say about it. Smells just like MAC lipsticks, the packaging is adorable, and the color is super tinted ! Love it &amp;&amp; it arrived in 3 days (:</li>
            <li> If you want a red lipstick that doesn&#x27;t come off literally ALL DAY, then look no further. I will put this on in the morning and go to bed with it looking not much different, while other brands have worn off halfway through the day.  It stands up to eating, drinking, talking, all of it. And if I don&#x27;t scrub it off my face before bed, I will still find myself doing a good bit of work to get it off the next morning. And it even kind of leaves a pink stain the next day, too.  I have a bunch of different colors from Lime Crime and they all have way more staying power than pretty much any other lipstick I own (and I have A LOT of makeup), but this one so far tops the list.</li>
            <li> This is a nice red but it doesn&#x27;t go on as moisterizing as the photo. I&#x27;m Hispanic &amp; have a honey color skin tone. I like this lipstick during the 1st hour &amp; after that, my lips are really dry. At that point, I use a chap stick and my lips are moisturized again as if I just applied the lipstick.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No, my lips aren&#x27;t naturally dry. I am usually told that my lips are my best feature. The lipstick does stay on for hours even after drinking but again, your lips will be dry.</li>
            <li> Such a beautiful, true red! Very retro, like old hollywood film stars of the 40&#x27;s! So pretty, I&#x27;m about to order a second one for my mom!!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Definitely reccommend this lipstick!</li>
            <li> Amazing vivid color, lasts forever!</li>
            <li> Lime Crime isn&#x27;t nearly as awesome as it&#x27;s made out to be. This lipstick doesn&#x27;t go on opaque and looks like a cheap crayon. Waste of $20</li>
            <li> love it! it&#x27;s long lasting and smells great. I love when lipsticks are so pigmented that your lips stay bright even when you wipe it off.&lt;br /&gt;this is my go to red right now. i want more colors!</li>
            <li> Love the colour, love the feel of it on my lips, and the pretty deep-pink stain it leaves on my lips when I wash it off. Be warned: This colour is not for the faint of heart. Wear it with confidence!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons: The unicorn on the lipstick tube can be a little off-putting for anyone over the age of 21.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros: Smooth formula, beautiful colour, lasts long, and smells like vanilla cupcakes!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are looking for a retro red, get this!</li>
            <li> I am really happy to say out of the few Lime Crime products i&#x27;ve bought I have never been disappointed, their lipsticks are very vibrant rich colors! Really stands out against your complexion especially this red.....it is magnificent! If you need a red lipstick that really stands out please buy this one you won&#x27;t be disappointed</li>
            <li> Retrofuturist is my new favoRED, and Lime Crime is my new fave brand! The lipstick is soft, velvety, and TRUE to color.. Since its opaque I only need one coat... Staying power??? WHAT?! Try 8 hours with one reapplication, and a pretty pink stain when I woke up ;) oh, not to mention- I dropped it, and my lid broke :( BUT Emma from Lime Crime was a sweetie, and offered to replace it so that my new fave would remain debri-free ;) LOVE LOVE LOVE</li>
            <li> This is an amazing lipstick and the colour is great. I would suggest wearing Guerlain Lipstick Primer underneath because it can feather without it.</li>
            <li> I was very pleased with this color; it is a nice opaque red that blended well with my dark skin.  It is not overwhelming and is totally wearable but it makes a statement as well. Elegant!</li>
            <li> In love with this color! It&#x27;s more opaque than I&#x27;m used to since my signature red lip is ruby woo from mac, but it&#x27;s cruelty free and vegan so I had to try it. I recommend this to anyone who loves blue based red lipstick.</li>
            <li> This is the most amazing lipstick I have ever tried! Honestly. It&#x27;s a beautiful true rich red, it&#x27;s moisturizing, and it smells delicious! It is perfectly opaque as it says, and I love that it&#x27;s not too glossy, but not matte. It has the perfect sheen. It&#x27;s super comfortable to wear and I&#x27;ve never had to worry about it feathering (I hate lipliner). The only problem I have is that I have dry lips. So if I forget to swipe on a layer of cherry chapstick underneath the lipstick, the colour flakes on my lips. Chapstick significantly helps if you have that problem.&lt;br /&gt;You must try this lipstick! You won&#x27;t regret it.</li>
            <li> I really like this red lipstick! It&#x27;s always hard for me to find a good red that doesn&#x27;t look too purpley or have magenta tones in it. This red is bright and looks luscious and when I put it on it makes my lips look so full and pretty! It goes on great and stays on fairly long. It does come off if you&#x27;re drinking something though so it&#x27;s not a long lasting lipstick, but i still absolutely love the color and the quality. Also, Lime Crime products smell good! They smell like vanilla cupcakes. :) I recommend this to anyone who loves bright colors and loves to play with new looks. Any red lipstick enthusiast my want this one for their collection because it looks great!</li>
            <li> The title is self explanatory - I had my item within a week and it was lovely. No damaging in it&#x27;s lovely purple packaging.</li>
            <li> Very true to the color it shows in the photo. May need to line your lips, however the color is very sexy and very red. I&#x27;m black american, and this color looks great on me.</li>
            <li> Love the color!  Great color and application; makes lips feel smooth and moisturized. Stays on!</li>
            <li> This lipstick fit me perfect Im a balance between warm and cool tones and fair skin I was worried about it being too orange but it was perfect ,stayed on all day and left a nice pinkish stain to my lips when I finally removed it. Smelled good too which is genius because most lipsticks do not really have a smell to me..</li>
            <li> What I like best is that when you are reAdy to wipe it off it comes off so nicely. Does t stain your lips. Is a little more pink than red but a great color all in all</li>
            <li> I love make and this is my second purchase of lime crime really pretty red! This came in like 2 days :)</li>
            <li> I was looking for a real red lipstick. This is really red. I love it. You have to be very careful not to stain your teeth or clothing.</li>
            <li> Love this retro red lipstick.</li>
            <li> At least, on me the red looks \\&quot;fushia.\\&quot; i am a pale, caucasian female. also, it did not stay on long at all. i bought this lipstick  due to all the great reviews...and i&#x27;m happy it works for them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i am on a VERY LIMITED income. paying $16.00 was crazy for me, but i SO wanted a true red shade...</li>
            <li> Bought it at my wife&#x27;s request and she&#x27;s quite happy with it.  That&#x27;s all that matters - right!  I should add that it&#x27;s not as bright and intensely red as it appears on Amazon.  It&#x27;s actually a rather attractive color (i.e.; no clown lips).</li>
