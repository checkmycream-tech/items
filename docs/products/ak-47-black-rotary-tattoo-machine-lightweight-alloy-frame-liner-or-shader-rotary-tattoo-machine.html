            <li> I have to say buy this machine. I&#x27;m doing color packing at 4.5 volts. This thing does old school saturation with ease. I ran it on continuous for almost an hour didn&#x27;t even get worm. 60 bucks how is it possible.  I would of thought a machine so cheep would suck. Read on this machine rocks.</li>
            <li> Great results.  I can&#x27;t speak for the durability yet, but it does the job.</li>
            <li> Machine has been working well. Quiet, lightweight, consistant and no heat issues yet. I use this machine almost every session for many reasons. HOWEVER, the set screw for the swing arm came stripped and I didn&#x27;t notice till later but the second swing arm is the exact same as the one installed. So I have not been able to swap that out and have mostly used this as a liner. Because I didn&#x27;t notice these problems till weeks after delivery, I did not contact seller for replacement simply because I didn&#x27;t want them to question the time frame and think anything shady. So I can&#x27;t confirm sellers replacement, return or communication reputation. If they send me anything after this review I&#x27;ll update everyone and would makethis purchase a 5 star fo sho.</li>
            <li> Great product that does exactly what is suggested. Reliable and worth the money if you&#x27;re interested in a mid-range rotary!</li>

            <li> I have been tattooing for over 15 years and have tried several top brand rotary machines such as bishop and stigma. I can honestly say that this is by far the best knock off that I have tried. Runs very smooth and it weighs slightly more than others but it feels very comfortable on your hand.</li>
            <li> I broke on me after the 5th time I used it&lt;br /&gt;the gold bearing sanded itself down to nothing and the piece that holds it together broke off&lt;br /&gt;do not buy this!</li>
            <li> Best rotary I&#x27;ve come across so far, a lot of guys complained about the cord. But mine is working just fine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Although, whoever answered that direction about throw wheels is wrong. It just comes with the one, it&#x27;s set up as a liner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t blame the seller just whoever answered that question.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I actually plan on getting a few more and putting the different throw wheels on them</li>
            <li> Im new to rotarys but thing runs good for black and gray and color. I haven&#x27;t used it for lining yet but its a good buy if your just trying rotarys out</li>
            <li> This is a nice gun. Finished a few tattoos with it and it runs nice. Fast delivery. This was a great buy! This will be in my first line of guns</li>
            <li> a smooth lightweight low sound machine.great bright red cord &amp; came with a spare &amp; a Allen wrenches.just used it but gotta wait for uses till I see its true potential.</li>
            <li> The gun is great, the cheap a** RCA is trash and burned out</li>
            <li> I have used many types of machines throughout the years. from cheap, almost throw away one time use. To very expensive ones. All comes down to design and materials used. If they will hold up or not. This AK-47 works smoother than any other Rotary I own, and built well. And is a very simply design.</li>
            <li> They worked great at first so I ordered another one. After a couple months both of the motors wore out. Beware of these.</li>
            <li> Worked fine - for a short while, then started fluctuating power &amp; just turning off, not it will not work at all.</li>
            <li> Best inexpensive machine for the money. Don&#x27;t waste money on cheap machines. This baby purrs and runs smoothly at very low voltage. Lightweight and comfortable.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried several tattoo machines and they&#x27;ve all been hit and miss. It didn&#x27;t matter if it was a $30 machine or a $150 machine, they wouldn&#x27;t stay tuned for a 60 minute session and I&#x27;d have to reseat and adjust everything in the middle of a paint job. I found this one by accident on eBay while looking for AK47 parts, go figure, and decided to give it a shot since it was much smaller than what I normally use. I was a bit apprehensive when I received it but set it up and did a 90 minute job (lining AND fill) without any issues. Needle and tip changes are a breeze and it stayed dead on the whole time. I&#x27;m beyond impressed and would highly recommend this to any artist looking for a kickass rotary machine.</li>
            <li> Worked for about 10 procedures / pieces, then fell apart.</li>
            <li> Good tattoo gun for what I paid for it</li>
            <li> I bought this and was sceptical but I must say I absolutely love this machine been tattooing for years and only used coil machines pleasantly surprised will buy another</li>
            <li> The cord that came with it were not of great quality but I frabicated some of my own and now it works perfect! Wouldn&#x27;t be such a low review but the other reviews are very high and I want this one to be noticed so buyers know that you need to either make or buy a new cord to go with this machine.</li>
            <li> Buenas maquinas 100% recomendadas, ideal para trabajar rapido y durar largas sesiones intensas, valen la pena cumplen con el trabajo como es debido!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Google traductor:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good machines 100% recommended, ideal for working fast and last long intense sessions, worth meet the job properly!</li>
            <li> Great product, This is a nice gun. Fast delivery. This was a great buy!</li>
