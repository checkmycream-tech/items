            <li>Beautiful.</li>
            <li>Great product for the price.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a very elegant and beautiful wig for its price.</li>
            <li>If I didn&#x27;t have a flower wreath I was wearing (Renaissance Fair)</li>
            <li>so I think it looks gorgeous with the length it is.</li>
            <li>The bangs did look good though</li>
            <li>so I appreciate that something was good about this wig.  </li>
            <li>I love the color and the curls!</li>
            <li>you want an especially light blonde wig, this is perfect.</li>
            <li>Great for cosplay, Truly in love and satisfied, would buy again</li>
            <li>So wonderful and soft.</li>
            <li>Quality is pretty good and hair looks nice.</li>
            <li>The quality was significantly better than I thought.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love it.</li>
            <li>Okay so, I was cosplaying Misa from Death Note.</li>
            <li>Most notably, in the front with the bangs.</li>
            <li>The wig cap is snug fitting and stretches.</li>
            <li>Overall very impressed.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d recommend this for a one time Halloween use, but I need something that&#x27;s going to be more durable for my cosplay.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s definitely better than some wigs though it&#x27;s not shiny</li>
            <li>and it was shine free!</li>
            <li>It was the color pictures and it felt really smooth and natural, and the curls were beautiful.</li>
            <li>Luckily I was able to hide most of it before I went onto the cosplay stage for J-Pop Summit.</li>
            <li>It sheds just a tiny bit but is still good quality for me!</li>
            <li>love very well put together and looks amazing  </li>
            <li>I really liked this wig and it worked really well for my costume as lady rainicorn.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s cute and would be fun for play.</li>
            <li>so she couldn&#x27;t wait to see how it fit her.</li>
            <li>Couldn&#x27;t even fit.</li>
            <li>The wig is quite long and with beautiful (albeit tangle-prone) curls.</li>
            <li>Got my wig super quick!</li>
            <li>wig pictures tend to make the wig look lighter and more washed-out than they are in real life.</li>
            <li>I used this wig as Sweet Pea.</li>
            <li>Not bad for the price.</li>
            <li>You hold this wig up to the light and you can see right through it.</li>
            <li>I needed a straight wig of this color, so I straightened this wig quite easily, first with a straightener and then with the hot water method (the second one worked best).</li>
            <li>I had decent hopes for this wig but when it got here those were shattered, The color was a more bleach blond color</li>
            <li>I ordered it at night and got it in the mail the next day:)!</li>
            <li>I love it and now our acting can be even more realistic!</li>
            <li>I had intended to use this for a Misa Amane cosplay and go for a light blonde look (rather than the more strong yellow she was originally drawn with), but this wig is quite light.</li>
            <li>But overall a nice wig for the price and its heat resistant (I used my straightner on 180°)</li>
            <li>Overall, nice feel and look.</li>
            <li>Its worth the money tho.</li>
            <li>Pretty true to picture.</li>
            <li>Good wig, super thin at the top though.</li>
            <li>Fast delivery!</li>
            <li>So long story short, great wig for the price IF you are wearing a cap or head covering.</li>
            <li>It touches my sisters lower back (top of her butt).</li>
            <li>so you need to be aware when your wig cap is showing.</li>
            <li>I just got this wig yesterday and my sister was SOOOO EXCITED to try it on because we use it for our own personal acting.</li>
            <li>I ordered the light golden and it&#x27;s almost a platinum blonde.  </li>
            <li>The bang is long but its sexy.</li>
            <li>The hair was a nice natural blonde and was very soft.</li>
            <li>It does look very synthetic and she says drops hair, but for the price, it&#x27;s certainly what it was intended to be...</li>
            <li>Loads more hair than I expected for the price.  </li>
            <li>It was also very tangled you couldn&#x27;t run your fingers through it</li>
            <li>If you want a natural looking blonde, it&#x27;ll probably be too light!</li>
            <li>When I initially took this wig out of the packaging, I was SO excited.</li>
            <li>Hair kept going in my face and hard to pin back but beautiful</li>
            <li>so you must be careful when positioning the hair as you put it on because your wig cap will show easily.</li>
            <li>Decent quality for price.  </li>
            <li>The wig overall is very thin and light which is good in some cases but will not work for what I&#x27;m looking for.</li>
            <li>My wife has Filipina straight black hair to her butt which I love very much, but suddenly got the notion she wanted to color it blonde.  </li>
            <li>Her character had long light blonde hair</li>
            <li>I ordered the blonde wig for a costume and it is much more of a dirty ash blond than a bright yellow blonde as pictured, the colors aren&#x27;t even really comparable.</li>
            <li>The hair does get messy while trying to style it so always brush it lightly with a wig brush and leave the curls alone because you don&#x27;t want to loosen them with the brush.</li>
            <li>The hair is kind of thin on the wig</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d actually wear this out on a normal day!</li>
            <li>Its really pretty and very soft but its lighter then expected.</li>
            <li>Was a little thin in some areas but besides that it&#x27;s great</li>
            <li>I personally prefer and LOVE long hair (especially long blonde hair)</li>
            <li>I was pleasantly surprised at the qual,very soft and long.</li>
            <li>Go somewhere else if you need a bare head.</li>
            <li>, I could hardly get the front on my forehead) and on top of that, the wefting is VERY thin in many places.</li>
            <li>and you could easily see the netting through the hair it was so thin.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> It might be hard to find the style of the wig when you first put it on your head so the hair might tangle and mess up a bit.</li>
            <li> Only let down was the thickness on the cap,I can see through it in some spots.</li>
            <li> and it doesn&#x27;t look super fake.</li>
            <li> If you have a larger head it might be a bit to tight.  </li>
            <li> Right out of the package I was shocked as to how soft this wig was</li>
            <li> This wig is not true to her character, but I figured I could use this for my Kaleesi cosplay and other things later down the line.</li>
            <li> The hairs do not fizzle under heat like other wigs of this</li>
            <li> Its a really pretty wig, the styling is a bit difficult due to parting.</li>
            <li> only complaint I have is that the color is a bit lighter than as shown in the picture.</li>
            <li> The only negative thought I had about the wig was how deep the bangs are, however the photo does show a thick side part.</li>
            <li> I would hate for her to do that, especially since it would take years for it to look natural again, so I suggested we buy this wig so she can see how she would look.  </li>
            <li> Just two college girls trying to have a little bit of newfound freedom!</li>
            <li> I have bought 3 other wigs from all different brands on amazon, and this was by far the worst one.</li>
            <li> However, upon trying in on, I realized that the cap is very small</li>
            <li> The hair is thin at the scalp</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just too thin.</li>
            <li> I was a bit disappointed when this came in after reading the other reviews.</li>
            <li> My hair is crazy thick.</li>
            <li> it would have been useless.</li>
            <li> Not too fake looking.</li>
            <li> you have thick hair, you will hate it.</li>
            <li> Terrible.</li>

            <li> Got my wig super quick! I ordered it at night and got it in the mail the next day:)! I was pleasantly surprised at the qual,very soft and long. Only let down was the thickness on the cap,I can see through it in some spots. But overall a nice wig for the price and its heat resistant (I used my straightner on 180°)</li>
            <li> Great product for the price. Fast delivery!</li>
            <li> Bought this for a halloween costume. The quality was significantly better than I thought. I&#x27;d actually wear this out on a normal day! The hair was a nice natural blonde and was very soft. Does NOT come with wig cap.</li>
            <li> I really liked this wig and it worked really well for my costume as lady rainicorn. I bought a separate wig cap to keep my hair in place. Quality is pretty good and hair looks nice.</li>
            <li> Not bad for the price.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love it. Although the color is a lot lighter than I wanted. It looks wonderful. But this wig is also a bit on the white/blonde side. But I&#x27;d still buy again</li>
            <li> Wig style and length looked as-is in the picture.&lt;br /&gt;Most wig pictures tend to make the wig look lighter and more washed-out than they are in real life. This wig was the opposite. When it arrived, it was a platinum, almost white-blonde.&lt;br /&gt;If you want an especially light blonde wig, this is perfect. If you want a natural looking blonde, it&#x27;ll probably be too light!</li>
            <li> Okay so, I was cosplaying Misa from Death Note. This wig is not true to her character, but I figured I could use this for my Kaleesi cosplay and other things later down the line. So I bought it!&lt;br /&gt;If you have thick hair, you will hate it. My hair is crazy thick. And there were bald spots in the wig. Luckily I was able to hide most of it before I went onto the cosplay stage for J-Pop Summit. But again. Would not recommend this brand. I have bought 3 other wigs from all different brands on amazon, and this was by far the worst one.</li>
            <li> Good wig, super thin at the top though.</li>
            <li> Perfect transaction quality item.</li>
            <li> My wife has Filipina straight black hair to her butt which I love very much, but suddenly got the notion she wanted to color it blonde.  I would hate for her to do that, especially since it would take years for it to look natural again, so I suggested we buy this wig so she can see how she would look.  I think I won that skirmish, but it&#x27;s no reflection on the wig itself.  It does look very synthetic and she says drops hair, but for the price, it&#x27;s certainly what it was intended to be... a cosplay wig.  It&#x27;s cute and would be fun for play.</li>
            <li> I ordered the blonde wig for a costume and it is much more of a dirty ash blond than a bright yellow blonde as pictured, the colors aren&#x27;t even really comparable. I attempted to return it but this company does not allow returns so buyer beware.</li>
            <li> When I initially took this wig out of the packaging, I was SO excited. It was the color pictures and it felt really smooth and natural, and the curls were beautiful. However, upon trying in on, I realized that the cap is very small (I don&#x27;t have the smallest head in the world but it&#x27;s not that big, I could hardly get the front on my forehead) and on top of that, the wefting is VERY thin in many places. Most notably, in the front with the bangs. You hold this wig up to the light and you can see right through it. If I didn&#x27;t have a flower wreath I was wearing (Renaissance Fair) it would have been useless. So long story short, great wig for the price IF you are wearing a cap or head covering. Go somewhere else if you need a bare head.</li>
            <li> The wig is quite long and with beautiful (albeit tangle-prone) curls. I needed a straight wig of this color, so I straightened this wig quite easily, first with a straightener and then with the hot water method (the second one worked best). The hairs do not fizzle under heat like other wigs of this price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only complaint I have is that the color is a bit lighter than as shown in the picture. I had intended to use this for a Misa Amane cosplay and go for a light blonde look (rather than the more strong yellow she was originally drawn with), but this wig is quite light. Somewhere in the middle of the color pictured here and white.</li>
            <li> Great for cosplay, Truly in love and satisfied, would buy again</li>
            <li> Its a really pretty wig, the styling is a bit difficult due to parting. And the bangs are strange. Overall, nice feel and look. Not too fake looking.</li>
            <li> I just got this wig yesterday and my sister was SOOOO EXCITED to try it on because we use it for our own personal acting. Her character had long light blonde hair so she couldn&#x27;t wait to see how it fit her. She loved it! She literally threw on sunglasses and sat in the mirror doing poses for about 30 minutes. It&#x27;s a very elegant and beautiful wig for its price. Since its heat resistant you can style it with low heat ! you can&#x27;t beat that for the price! I love the color and the curls! 33 inches is very long. It touches my sisters lower back (top of her butt). I personally prefer and LOVE long hair (especially long blonde hair) so I think it looks gorgeous with the length it is. You can trim to desired length though but the curl pattern might be off once you do. The hair does get messy while trying to style it so always brush it lightly with a wig brush and leave the curls alone because you don&#x27;t want to loosen them with the brush. It might be hard to find the style of the wig when you first put it on your head so the hair might tangle and mess up a bit. The bang is long but its sexy. The hair is kind of thin on the wig so you must be careful when positioning the hair as you put it on because your wig cap will show easily. Its under $15 so what can I expect? The hair is thin at the scalp so you need to be aware when your wig cap is showing. Always get second opinions before leaving the house in it. It&#x27;s beautiful for its price though! I love it and now our acting can be even more realistic! Just two college girls trying to have a little bit of newfound freedom! &amp;#60;3</li>
            <li> love very well put together and looks amazing  thank you</li>
            <li> Its really pretty and very soft but its lighter then expected. Its worth the money tho.</li>
            <li> I got this to do a Galandriel cosplay. The color is perfect. Pretty true to picture. Beautiful. Loads more hair than I expected for the price.  With a bit of styling it will work perfectly. The tracks around the hairline can be seen if not styled well. The wig cap is snug fitting and stretches. It had adjustable straps inside. If you have a larger head it might be a bit to tight.  Overall very impressed.</li>
            <li> I had decent hopes for this wig but when it got here those were shattered, The color was a more bleach blond color and you could easily see the netting through the hair it was so thin. It was also very tangled you couldn&#x27;t run your fingers through it let alone a brush it also shed every where. The bangs did look good though so I appreciate that something was good about this wig.  I will be sending it back.</li>
            <li> So wonderful and soft. You can&#x27;t see the inside at all which is always something I worry about with Amazon.</li>
            <li> Was a little thin in some areas but besides that it&#x27;s great</li>
            <li> Very good wig! It sheds just a tiny bit but is still good quality for me!</li>
            <li> I was a bit disappointed when this came in after reading the other reviews. I ordered the light golden and it&#x27;s almost a platinum blonde.  The wig cap/mesh is very obvious. If you try to part it in any way it will show. The wig overall is very thin and light which is good in some cases but will not work for what I&#x27;m looking for. I&#x27;d recommend this for a one time Halloween use, but I need something that&#x27;s going to be more durable for my cosplay.  It&#x27;s definitely better than some wigs though it&#x27;s not shiny and it doesn&#x27;t look super fake. It&#x27;s just too thin.</li>
            <li> Used for my gold finger party. Decent quality for price.  Hair kept going in my face and hard to pin back but beautiful</li>
            <li> I used this wig as Sweet Pea. Right out of the package I was shocked as to how soft this wig was and it was shine free! The only negative thought I had about the wig was how deep the bangs are, however the photo does show a thick side part.</li>
            <li> Terrible. Couldn&#x27;t even fit.</li>
