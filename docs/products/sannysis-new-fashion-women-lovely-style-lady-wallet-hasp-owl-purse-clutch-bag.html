            <li>Grand daughter collects owls.</li>
            <li>Graphic design is great &amp; coloring good all throughout piece.</li>
            <li>While the pattern is adorable, it is one continuous piece of fabric, so the owls are upside-down on one side.</li>
            <li>We love owls and this didn&#x27;t disappoint us.</li>
            <li>Cute design of owls and looked just as pictured.  </li>
            <li>The colors are very vivid and it has a good latch on it.</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t sure what the quality would be like when I originally placed this order because the price was so low, but I am very pleased with the two that I bought!</li>
            <li>Super cute</li>
            <li>Super cute.</li>
            <li>Super cute bag...larger than I thought</li>
            <li>, daughters love it as much as I do!!</li>
            <li>Cheaply made.</li>
            <li>Love it, and just the right size for me.</li>
            <li>Super cute for a young girl.</li>
            <li>Cute my 8 year old daughter loves it</li>
            <li>This is an adorable little purse, perfect for coins as well as small items.</li>
            <li>it is exactly what I ordered</li>
            <li>It is large enough to carry coins, bills and most used credit cards.  </li>
            <li>Very cute little coin purse for the money.  </li>
            <li>Used as a large change purse.  </li>
            <li>and I received it much faster</li>
            <li>Very sturdy.  </li>
            <li>So much so I did not even donate them to a thrift store, just threw them away.</li>
            <li>Nice to have a small purse to take along.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s cute, but it&#x27;s an odd fabric.</li>
            <li>Love this little bag, just as described.</li>
            <li>Pretty much what you would expect from a low prices item from china.</li>
            <li>Not so big that I&#x27;ve been able to slip it into jacket pockets securely but big enough not to loose.  </li>
            <li>This is super cute, but I can&#x27;t even get it open, it is so hard to try and pull it apart that I just put it up and stopped trying</li>
            <li>Has a secure closure, opens wide enough to easily remove money yet not so wide that it falls out.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a bit bigger than what I thought it would be but other than that I love it.</li>
            <li>This is fine for a little girl for dress up, or perhaps for a themed event.</li>
            <li>such a cute little purse.</li>
            <li>I love it, I&#x27;m a purse &amp; owl fanatic.</li>
            <li>So far I haven&#x27;t heard any complaints.</li>
            <li>Cute little change purse, holds a lot of change along with bills, keys and any small objects you don&#x27;t want lost in your purse.</li>

            <li> This was a gift. Looked good to me so hope she liked it.</li>
            <li> I love this owl purse.  It is large enough to carry coins, bills and most used credit cards.  But not too big for your purse.</li>
            <li> Very happy with this purchase.  Size works well for me as I use it for my garage sale shopping days.  Has a secure closure, opens wide enough to easily remove money yet not so wide that it falls out.  Not so big that I&#x27;ve been able to slip it into jacket pockets securely but big enough not to loose.  It took awhile to receive but I knew that when ordering.  I&#x27;ve received many compliments on how cute it is.</li>
            <li> MATCHES THEORY PURSE THAT I HAVE ALREADY.</li>

            <li> Very difficult to open and close.  Waste of $$</li>
            <li> Item came on time and packaged nicely.  I got this to put my chapsticks, lipsticks and other make up items that always get lost in my purse.  It&#x27;s cute.  The material seems sturdy and the clasp works nicely.  This will help me keep my stuff some what more organized in my purse.  It will make it easier to find my make-up items!!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s cute, but it&#x27;s an odd fabric. The owls are upside down on the back side. Seems fairly durable, and for what I paid, it&#x27;s just fine. Wouldn&#x27;t buy it again tho.</li>

            <li> Good size for purse!  Big enough for cosmetics but can slip into purse.  Cute design of owls and looked just as pictured.  Took about a month to arrive but for that price who cares.  Did not have an odor like some products ordered from afar.  I&#x27;m very pleased with this and may order some more for gifts.</li>
