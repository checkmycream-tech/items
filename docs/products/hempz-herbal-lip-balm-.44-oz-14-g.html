            <li>I enjoy the lotion from Hempz</li>
            <li>Love it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have tried several of their products and have loved them all.</li>

            <li>I love this lip balm so much!  </li>
            <li>I would be more inclined to give a higher rating if the product I ordered was the product I received.</li>
            <li>My lips are no longer dry &amp; the smell is great .</li>
            <li>Was in a area where it was dry and it worked great.</li>
            <li>This is by far my favorite!</li>
            <li>but this shiz is cool</li>
            <li>Wish I would have ordered several more!</li>
            <li>I would recommend this lip gloss to anyone who wants smooth lips.</li>
            <li>This not only smells amazing</li>
            <li>Worth the price.</li>
            <li>should of ordered more best lip balm ever never buying some other lip balm no more</li>
            <li>Makes irritated dry lips feel great almost instantly and lasts for a good long time.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not the first time I&#x27;ve ordered.</li>
            <li>It keeps my lips soft and chap free.</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>The European Union has banned many petroleum jelly products, and experts are concerned they could be linked to cancer.</li>
            <li>It was the only thing I uses that helped the most.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t believe the first ingredient is petroleum.</li>
            <li>I have tried many different brands of lip balm and none compare to the Hempz.</li>
            <li>I bought it for someone who is somewhat of a &#x27;hippy&#x27; and a vegetarian, and was pleased that these HEMP products were not only well-received by her, but did not contain any &#x27;offensive&#x27; ingredients.</li>
            <li>I tried it once anyways just to see if it was effective as other reviews claim, it was exactly like putting Vaseline on your lips.</li>
            <li>I will maybe try to make my own version in due time.</li>
            <li>Long lasting with pleasant feel.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It is a bit pricey, but one tube lasts a long time.&lt;br /&gt;Sometimes you can find it on sale, which is even better.</li>
            <li>Price on Amazon is much lower than retail.  </li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t like the intense packaging...</li>
            <li>Shipment was fast and on time.</li>
            <li>This has really helped my chapped lips.</li>
            <li>but I don&#x27;t really buy into that s</li>
            <li>I really like the Hempz lotion</li>
            <li>This lip balm is very moisturizing</li>
            <li>a pleasant but subtle scent/</li>
            <li>The lipgloss has a nice subtle flavor and is different than most glosses.</li>
            <li>, I&#x27;ll be using it until I&#x27;m sure my lips are back to normal, and then probably only use it at night.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>highly recommend this product to anyone especially&lt;br</li>
            <li>Though its a bit on the pricey side its worth the extra money.</li>
            <li>This is a good lip balm but not a great one.</li>
            <li>My lips were so dry and this product softened them right up.</li>
            <li>It makes me lips so soft and moisturized.</li>
            <li>It makes my lips feel soft and hydrated.</li>
            <li>it made my lips so soft</li>
            <li>She loves how soft this balm leaves her lips.</li>
            <li>the kind I&#x27;ve never experienced before that spread all around my lips, and NOTHING helped.</li>
            <li>This product is far better than any other typical lip care products.</li>
            <li>but it really does make your lips much smoother while providing a little bit of shine.</li>
            <li>I would rather spend a little more and get Caudelie or Jack Black.</li>
            <li>Instant soft subtle smooth lips</li>
            <li>I really like this product compared to any other lip balms I have tried.  </li>
            <li>I had really high expectations for this product due to the high marks given not just here but on other online review sites.</li>

            <li> I had really high expectations for this product due to the high marks given not just here but on other online review sites.</li>
            <li> It is thin enough to not be goopy on my lips but still provides adequate hydration.</li>
            <li> The product stays a long time and actually heals chapped lips.  </li>
            <li> Only thing is I would not recommend this product for healing dry lips</li>
            <li> Used when ill, and it helped with such a gentle, natural ointment.  </li>
            <li> It is staying on the lips for a long time, protecting its from the sun.</li>
            <li> I Will use it for as long as the Hempz Company makes it.</li>
            <li> It does moisturize when you put it on but the effects don&#x27;t last like they do with some other lip balms.</li>
            <li> Keep in mind this tube lasts a very long time, I had one for almost one year.</li>
            <li> Recommend to anyone with dry lips.</li>
            <li> I heals my dry lips.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had a dry lips problem for a while.  </li>
            <li> My dry lip issue is no longer.</li>
            <li> Hempz Herbal Lip Balm , I had very dry skin on my lips and within 2 days</li>

    <ol>
            <li> I order the HEMPZ lotion constantly...this is a good item but kind of greasy.</li>
            <li> This product is far better than any other typical lip care products. Not greasy or shines when applied. Makes irritated dry lips feel great almost instantly and lasts for a good long time. Highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Great product for aging lips.  Been using it for many years.  Price on Amazon is much lower than retail.  Recommend to anyone with dry lips.</li>
            <li> I love this product.  I heals my dry lips.  I have tried other products, but this product works the best.</li>
            <li> You know I really love this stuff. It&#x27;s not the first time I&#x27;ve ordered. BUT I ordered this one because it said &amp;#34;SPF 15&amp;#34;. Well when it arrived guess what?, no &amp;#34;SPF 15&amp;#34; anywhere on the package. Still love the stuff and will still use it but if you aren&#x27;t going to have what is shown as advertised then change your advertising.</li>
            <li> This is the best lip product and even feels like silk when placing it on the lips.  The product stays a long time and actually heals chapped lips.  Love it!</li>
            <li> This is a staple in my vanity! I use it every night at bedtime and more often if I get chapped lips or a sunburn. Great stuff!</li>
            <li> This is the BEST lip balm I have ever used, hands down! It makes me lips so soft and moisturized. I haven&#x27;t used any other lip balm since!</li>
            <li> never leave home without it</li>
            <li> Great item and great price, would purchase from this seller again</li>
            <li> The product is excellent and the&lt;br /&gt;dealer was very prompt in sending this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this product to anyone especially&lt;br /&gt;if lips are chapped.</li>
            <li> The lipgloss has a nice subtle flavor and is different than most glosses. Love it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have tried several of their products and have loved them all. I gave a lotion to a friend as a gift and when she ran out she tried another hemp product. She said it wasn&#x27;t the same at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Buy Hempz only!</li>
            <li> I love this lip balm so much!  It makes my lips feel soft and hydrated.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t like the intense packaging...way overload...hard to get product out.&lt;br /&gt;otherwise I love the lip balm...,always have.&lt;br /&gt;unnecessary stickers to remove</li>
            <li> Used when ill, and it helped with such a gentle, natural ointment.  No pain or burning.  My lips are happy!</li>
            <li> My lips were so dry and this product softened them right up.</li>
            <li> Good product, lasted me for over a year. Shipment was fast and on time. Only thing is I would not recommend this product for healing dry lips, it&#x27;s more of just a moisturizer. Overall very satisfied!</li>
            <li> Nice and smooth. Goes on easily. Not waxy like some sticks.&lt;br /&gt;Has a pleasant but subtle scent/flavor.&lt;br /&gt;It is a bit pricey, but one tube lasts a long time.&lt;br /&gt;Sometimes you can find it on sale, which is even better.</li>
            <li> I like it, a little expensive but that is alright. My lips aren&#x27;t chapped as often, I also like the way you are supposed to put it on kinda like carmex.</li>
            <li> I like the product but the way it was shipped was horable!!! there was some odd sticky substance all over the tube and no safety seal for sanitation. Ended up throwing product out due to no safety seal.</li>
            <li> Great product, worth the price. Keep in mind this tube lasts a very long time, I had one for almost one year. I will be buying again!</li>
            <li> Love this product. I have ordered several tubes and never tire of using it. It keeps my lips soft and chap free. Great Product.</li>
            <li> Best stuff. I ordered six of them. For me and as gifts for my friends. It also contains sunblock so that&#x27;s a plus as well.</li>
            <li> Im so sad. I love hempz products. I love the gloss itself it made my lips so soft however the smell alone made me give it away to my friends daughter. I could not stand the smell. I put it on and i swear it smelt cat urine (i have no cats). I wish there was a bettr smelling ine because the formula spot on.  Instant soft subtle smooth lips but i can not get over the smell.</li>
            <li> Best lip balm around! This is by far my favorite! It&#x27;s a compact tube and easy to bring out or throw in your bag...it isn&#x27;t sugary and it lasts a while!</li>
            <li> I love how smooth this lip gloss makes my lips feel.  I started using it about a year ago and now is my favorite choice for lip gloss.  I also like that the smell is light and not overpowering.  I would recommend this lip gloss to anyone who wants smooth lips.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Hempz for many years. Though its a bit on the pricey side its worth the extra money. This not only smells amazing but it really does make your lips much smoother while providing a little bit of shine. I find if I use this just once a day my lips stay smooth and hydrated even throughout the winter months.</li>
            <li> Love it! goes smoothly on the lips, love love love! will definitely buy more, this is a really great brand, all their products are designed with love and care.</li>
            <li> As expected, no complaints.</li>
            <li> Good stuff, Fast ship</li>
            <li> Honestly this Balm changed my life. I&#x27;ve been suffering from extremely chapped lips for the past couple of days, the kind I&#x27;ve never experienced before that spread all around my lips, and NOTHING helped. I exfoliated, I put on oils on my lips and eos balm on top and I was about to give up and just go to a dermatologist, when I decided to try this. It&#x27;s been three hours since I first applied it, and my lips are softer Than they&#x27;ve ever been!! This is so great, I&#x27;ll be using it until I&#x27;m sure my lips are back to normal, and then probably only use it at night. I&#x27;m so in love with this but I&#x27;m so sad it has so many toxic chemicals :/ I will maybe try to make my own version in due time.</li>
            <li> I love the way this product leaves my lips feeling.  It is easy to put on and has a pleasant taste.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m addicted to this lip balm. It feels luxurious on my lips. Doesn&#x27;t feel waxy or greasy. I order a dozen tubes at a time do I can keep it everywhere</li>
            <li> This is now on the top of my list for lip balm.  The lip balm goes on smooth, is light-weight, and smells good.  This has really helped my chapped lips.</li>
            <li> Hempz Herbal Lip Balm , I had very dry skin on my lips and within 2 days I  could tell&lt;br /&gt;a difference by using the lip balm. My lips are no longer dry &amp; the smell is great .</li>
            <li> I really like this product compared to any other lip balms I have tried.  It&#x27;s the only one I use now.</li>
            <li> I had to pick this up as a gift. I got one for myself to try out too. It is a large tube and has a mild, pleasant taste. I will probably be ordering it again. It may end up being my winter lip balm all year.</li>
            <li> I had really high expectations for this product due to the high marks given not just here but on other online review sites. This is a good lip balm but not a great one. It does moisturize when you put it on but the effects don&#x27;t last like they do with some other lip balms. I would not repurchase, especially at this price. I would rather spend a little more and get Caudelie or Jack Black. The scent and consistency is very nice, however.</li>
            <li> Quick arrival!  Amazing lip balm that my daughter also loves!  Long lasting with pleasant feel.  Wish I would have ordered several more! Thanks!</li>
            <li> If you think you are getting a healthier product this isn&#x27;t it! This has petrolatum, parabens, and Aspartame! Any health benefits you may be getting from the \\&quot;Hemp\\&quot; are nullified by these additives. If you want to put petrolatum (see below) on your lips buy something cheaper I am trying to return this garbage!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From \\&quot;The Top Three Dangers In Your Beauty Products\\&quot;- Dr Oz Show&lt;br /&gt;(look it up on his site)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3. Lip Gloss the shine in lip-gloss comes from petroleum jelly. Petroleum jelly is a byproduct of oil drilling, and when you spread it on your lips, you end up eating it, which is essentially the same as drinking gasoline. Add up the amount of lip-gloss the average woman uses (and consumes) over a decade, and it equals 7 pounds. The European Union has banned many petroleum jelly products, and experts are concerned they could be linked to cancer. Women with breast cancer have twice the levels of hydrocarbons (substances found in petroleum jelly) in their breasts than women who haven&#x27;t had breast cancer.</li>
            <li> I just Love the Hempz brand, and now that ive tried it, i love this lip balm. Goes on light, smells great, keeps lips soft.</li>
            <li> Had this with a busted lip from my teeth in my sleep. It was ridiculously painful and friend let me use it. It was the only thing I uses that helped the most. Yes petroleum is in it but I don&#x27;t really buy into that s***... my only problem was it only was healing the actual days I used it... not like into the next couple if I didn&#x27;t have it and use it.</li>
            <li> This is a great product.  Although the pricing and shipping were equivalent; it seems best to wait and see if you can buy it at your local beauty supply.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe the first ingredient is petroleum. It also has several parabens and aspartame in it. I tried it once anyways just to see if it was effective as other reviews claim, it was exactly like putting Vaseline on your lips. In the garbage it goes, what a waste! It&#x27;s my fault for not looking up the ingredients before purchasing.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had a dry lips problem for a while.  Tried several inexpensive products I had at home to no avail.  I really like the Hempz lotion so I thought I would try the lip gloss.  I love it.  It doesn&#x27;t taste funky.  It works and continues to work.  I end up apply it a couple of times a day.  My dry lip issue is no longer.</li>
            <li> Since I love the Hempz lotion, I decided to order a lip balm and see how that compared to others I have purchased.  I have tried many different brands of lip balm and none compare to the Hempz. This is the best lip moisturizer I have ever used. It really works -- and it is not waxy or heavy.  I will definitely buy this again in the future.</li>
            <li> As soon as you put it on your lips you will feel explosion of taste, wonderful smell and gentle touch. It is staying on the lips for a long time, protecting its from the sun.</li>
            <li> I would be more inclined to give a higher rating if the product I ordered was the product I received. The picture and description says SPF 15 But the one I received does not have SPF.</li>
            <li> This lip balm is very moisturizing and I love the way it smells.  I wish it came in a tube form also.</li>
            <li> I Will use it for as long as the Hempz Company makes it. I like all of Hempz products.&lt;br /&gt;It is good for my lips.</li>
            <li> Nothing wrong with the delivery...just with the product itself.  I didn&#x27;t notice the ingredient list--aspartame?!?!?  Such a toxic ingredient!  I avoid any gums or candy or any other product containing this junk...hard to believe they would add this to lip balm!  Super disappointing!  Throwing it in the trash immediately!  Beware health nuts...this is not the product for you!</li>
            <li> Love love this stuff. It is thin enough to not be goopy on my lips but still provides adequate hydration. Love the taste and texture. Worth the price.</li>
            <li> I enjoy the lotion from Hempz and I wanted to try the lip balm.  I always keep a lip balm in my pocket at all times.  I keep the Hempz lip balm at work in my desk and when I use it, it is like a spa for my lips.  Great product.</li>
            <li> Was in a area where it was dry and it worked great. Even my granddaughter liked it. Will buy again.</li>
            <li> but this shiz is cool should of ordered more best lip balm ever never buying some other lip balm no more</li>
            <li> I love this lip stuff and can never find it in the stores. I used to get it at the tanning and now they don&#x27;t keep it in stock.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t smell or taste great, but it works.</li>
            <li> I bought this product, along with HEMP Hydrating Shampoo 13.5 oz. and HEMP Hydrating Conditioner 13.5 oz. as a gift for a loved one. She loves how soft this balm leaves her lips. I have not used any of these items personally. I bought it for someone who is somewhat of a &#x27;hippy&#x27; and a vegetarian, and was pleased that these HEMP products were not only well-received by her, but did not contain any &#x27;offensive&#x27; ingredients.</li>
