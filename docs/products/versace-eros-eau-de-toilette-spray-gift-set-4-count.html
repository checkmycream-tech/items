            <li>I love it and my girl does too</li>
            <li>Authentic cologne.</li>
            <li>I smelled this at a department store and fell in love with it.</li>
            <li>The wallet went right into the donation bin, but everything else is good</li>
            <li>Everything is nice, came quickly, with no issues.</li>
            <li>After getting this home and putting it on my body, I noticed a combination of scents that  project a strong musky scent.</li>
            <li>I have a pretty nice collection of cologne</li>
            <li>Its really worth to buy this product!</li>
            <li>Smells amazing, Versace knocked it out the park with this one, masculine but not too musky, sweet and fruity without being feminine.</li>
            <li>He loves the scent and the set was cheaper than we could get locally, however, the wallet that came with the set is too large and looks very cheap!  </li>
            <li>The perfume is high quality and also the creams but the wallet doesn&#x27;t worth anything if I would&#x27;ve known</li>
            <li>I received the item very fast but opened up and used for only one ,had a nice scent but later found out that the content has disappeared ,I don&#x27;t know the cause ,whether the bottle was leaking or what ?</li>
            <li>The lady who worked there said she didn&#x27;t like it much, I disagreed, but that should have been my forewarning.</li>
            <li>Masculine , euphoria aroma</li>
            <li>Purchased for my 18 year old grandson.  </li>

            <li> When I put this on, it makes me fall in love with myself -- and I&#x27;m a difficult person!</li>
            <li> Remember a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I love the vanilla, but I think some of the heavier base notes are over done.</li>

            <li> Very sexy and elegant cologne. Versace&#x27;s versatile and finest.</li>

            <li> Everything was great, except for the wallet. U would never think it&#x27;s versace. It looks like Kmart brand</li>
            <li> Everything is nice, came quickly, with no issues. The wallet is too feminine for me though.</li>

            <li> Authentic cologne. My son loves it!</li>
            <li> The perfume is high quality and also the creams but the wallet doesn&#x27;t worth anything if I would&#x27;ve known I wouldn&#x27;t have bought this offer and I just would&#x27;ve bought the perfume and the creams.</li>
            <li> I smelled this at a department store and fell in love with it. The lady who worked there said she didn&#x27;t like it much, I disagreed, but that should have been my forewarning.

You may feel differently.</li>
