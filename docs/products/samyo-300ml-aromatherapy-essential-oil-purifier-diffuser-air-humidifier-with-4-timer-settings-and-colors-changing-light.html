            <li>Really love this diffuser!  </li>
            <li>I love this thing!</li>
            <li>You can use it with or without the light, puts out a great stream of air.</li>
            <li>I REALLY liked this diffuser.  </li>
            <li>It is good that cover fits securely, I just worry that one of these times when it still has water in it, I will drop it.  </li>
            <li>I use the timer a lot, really a great diffuser, worth the price.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a great diffuser when it works, but doesn&#x27;t have much for longevity.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>Better than a candle.</li>
            <li>I love this.  </li>
            <li>and I need one that can run throughout most of the night.</li>
            <li>I LOVE the colors this diffuser has.</li>
            <li>My kids all love it as well.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s our favorite part of the diffuser.</li>
            <li>I have the 100 ml diffuser and wanted one that lasted more than 3-4 hours, so I bought this 300 ml diffuser.  </li>
            <li>The 100ml diffuser puts out more scent.  </li>
            <li>I have never had a diffuser before, and after reading many reviews decided to order this one and the 500 ml unit.</li>
            <li>Loved it so much I bought another for a coworker.</li>
            <li>Puts out a strong stream of mist.</li>
            <li>Works beautifully and shuts itself off when low.</li>
            <li>fine.</li>
            <li>It really kicks out the oils and water mist and it spreads through the whole room very nicely.</li>
            <li>The first night I diffused doTERRA lavender and even with 8-9 drops (which in most diffusers is overkill)</li>
            <li>I find if I only fill it about 3/4 of the way to the top line, it works much better than if you fill it as full as the top line.</li>
            <li>I regularly clean the diffuser and even run vinegar through it to keep it clean.  </li>
            <li>It has a cool glow effect as well which is a plus.</li>
            <li>Fortunately this isn&#x27;t my first diffuser</li>
            <li>I feel like this works better than the &#x27;young living&#x27; diffuser you get</li>
            <li>Works really well!</li>
            <li>I bought the 100ml one for a friend and almost got the same one but saw this one for one dollar more.  </li>
            <li>This botheredme at first</li>
            <li>If I put it next to my bed, I have to make sure that it is higher than my head in order for me to reap the benefits of it.  </li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t smell it after the first 10 minutes.</li>
            <li>My first Diffuser.</li>
            <li>Adding pure essential oils like tangerine is so refreshing.</li>
            <li>After seeing the two units, I really preferred the 500 ml capacity, so the supplier was willing to send me another 500 ml unit in exchange for the 300 ml.</li>
            <li>you have to remove the whole cover to add water and there is no &amp;#34;grip&amp;#34; to unlock the lid so you have to pick up the unit with both hands to remove the cover.  </li>
            <li>I have to be more careful as to where I place this one.  </li>
            <li>I plan of getting a couple more for the other rooms in the house.</li>
            <li>The 500ml has buttons that stick out so are easy to use, but the lid doesn&#x27;t lock (which is probably ok as long as it&#x27;s not accessible by kids or pets).</li>
            <li>So much so that I might return the 300ml ones (just received them, brand new).</li>
            <li>Love it, and is exactly the same as a more expensive one I purchased.</li>
            <li>My grandkids live the colored lights.</li>
            <li>Love that I can set it to stay on for various amounts of time, or until it shuts itself off when its empty.</li>
            <li>The new one arrived in about a week (just like the first one), then I mailed the 300 ml unit back to China.</li>
            <li>When I first received the diffuser, it came with a Chinese instruction manual.</li>
            <li>so I didn&#x27;t feel completely clueless.</li>
            <li>I have had a few smaller diffusers that only last a few hours, but this one lasts longer and is simply great!</li>
            <li>Would highly recommend this is your looking for a longer lasting diffuser.</li>
            <li>My family is new to essential oils, but these work wonders for distributing the EO&#x27;s throughout our spaces.  </li>
            <li>My one complaint is that the mist blows out at a diagonal and quickly falls to the floor, unlike my other diffuser that shoots it straight up and into the air.  </li>

            <li> However after a few weeks it has a musty smell.</li>
            <li> The bad thing about this 300 ml is that I can smell the scent of the oils very strongly at first, but then it is just blowing mist - no scent.  </li>
            <li> so I usually set it on a darker color at night.  </li>
            <li> One thing, the electronics are like old video game buttons.&lt;br /&gt;You can have a difficult time setting time and color.&lt;br /&gt;Just</li>
            <li> Really disappointing and I least empty the water so this should not be happening-</li>
            <li> and it is so much less expensive!</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I REALLY liked this diffuser.  I purchased it January 22, 2015.  I diffuse an immunity oil nightly in this diffuser, and unfortunately, last night, it stopped working for no reason.  I regularly clean the diffuser and even run vinegar through it to keep it clean.  It&#x27;s a great diffuser when it works, but doesn&#x27;t have much for longevity.</li>
            <li> Works really well! Scent fills my kitchen, dining room, living room, and hallway to bed rooms.&lt;br /&gt;LOVE IT!!!</li>
            <li> I use this in the bedroom at night and it is wonderful.  My grandkids live the colored lights.</li>
            <li> Love it. Perfect for my desk. Adding pure essential oils like tangerine is so refreshing. Better than a candle. Wonderful timer feature and color options. Loved it so much I bought another for a coworker.</li>
            <li> would buy again for the price &amp; shipping cost</li>
            <li> I love this.  You can set it as only one color or have it rotate.  It is very bright so I usually set it on a darker color at night.  Works beautifully and shuts itself off when low.</li>
            <li> Really love this diffuser!  I bought the 100ml one for a friend and almost got the same one but saw this one for one dollar more.  It lasts for a long time, evenly distributes the fragrance, my only problem with it was that it has a hum and gurggling noise.  This botheredme at first but I&#x27;ve gotten used to it and findit slightly soothing.  Puts out a strong stream of mist.</li>
            <li> This item works well. However after a few weeks it has a musty smell. Really disappointing and I least empty the water so this should not be happening-</li>
            <li> Arrived on time.  I ordered one for each family member for their rooms. My family is new to essential oils, but these work wonders for distributing the EO&#x27;s throughout our spaces.  2 things I do not like are: 1.) the buttons are on the back of the device, 2.) you have to remove the whole cover to add water and there is no &amp;#34;grip&amp;#34; to unlock the lid so you have to pick up the unit with both hands to remove the cover.  It is good that cover fits securely, I just worry that one of these times when it still has water in it, I will drop it.  On that note, it is sturdy, it did get knocked off a shelf (empty) and still works like a charm!  Great price! Love that I can set it to stay on for various amounts of time, or until it shuts itself off when its empty.</li>
            <li> My kids like that they can choose a color.  I like that it holds 300 mL - was a good price.  My one complaint is that the mist blows out at a diagonal and quickly falls to the floor, unlike my other diffuser that shoots it straight up and into the air.  I have to be more careful as to where I place this one.  If I put it next to my bed, I have to make sure that it is higher than my head in order for me to reap the benefits of it.  Otherwise, the mist seems to just fall to the floor.</li>
            <li> I purchased this diffuser because I read that it can last for 8-10 hours and I need one that can run throughout most of the night. When I first received the diffuser, it came with a Chinese instruction manual. I couldn&#x27;t even read how to work the diffuser. Fortunately this isn&#x27;t my first diffuser so I didn&#x27;t feel completely clueless. When I went to run it for the first time it was difficult to get the mist to turn on.  You must hold the &amp;#34;mist&amp;#34; button down until it beeps (3-5 seconds). Some diffusers you just click the button and it will respond immediately. Then you click which cycle you would like your diffuser to run. Then there is a button to click to turn on the colors. I LOVE the colors this diffuser has. My kids all love it as well. It&#x27;s our favorite part of the diffuser. It has a cool glow effect as well which is a plus. However my biggest disappointment is that it took SEVERAL drops of E.O&#x27;s to really be able to smell them and in the end it still smelled pretty faint. The first night I diffused doTERRA lavender and even with 8-9 drops (which in most diffusers is overkill) I couldn&#x27;t smell it after the first 10 minutes. It did last around 8 1/2 hours so that was a plus. However I am returning this diffuser for one that won&#x27;t burn through my oils.</li>
            <li> I have the 100 ml diffuser and wanted one that lasted more than 3-4 hours, so I bought this 300 ml diffuser.  The good thing about this diffuser is that when we are sick, I can put it on a stool by the bed and run it all night.  I turn it on at 9pm and it is still going at 7am.  The bad thing about this 300 ml is that I can smell the scent of the oils very strongly at first, but then it is just blowing mist - no scent.  The 100ml diffuser puts out more scent.  I&#x27;m overall not pleased with this diffuser.  What&#x27;s the use of having something that can run for a long time if it is not doing it&#x27;s job?</li>
            <li> I love this thing! You can use it with or without the light, puts out a great stream of air. I use the timer a lot, really a great diffuser, worth the price.</li>
            <li> I have the 100, 300, and 500ml diffusers. I find the buttons on the two smaller models very hard to use. So much so that I might return the 300ml ones (just received them, brand new). The 500ml has buttons that stick out so are easy to use, but the lid doesn&#x27;t lock (which is probably ok as long as it&#x27;s not accessible by kids or pets).</li>
            <li> I have had a few smaller diffusers that only last a few hours, but this one lasts longer and is simply great! I find if I only fill it about 3/4 of the way to the top line, it works much better than if you fill it as full as the top line. I like the color options, I like the timing options (several). It diffuses the oils well and I get compliments any time people stop over on how great the house smells. It really kicks out the oils and water mist and it spreads through the whole room very nicely. I plan of getting a couple more for the other rooms in the house. I feel like this works better than the &#x27;young living&#x27; diffuser you get and it is so much less expensive!</li>
            <li> Love it, and is exactly the same as a more expensive one I purchased. Would highly recommend this is your looking for a longer lasting diffuser.</li>
            <li> I have never had a diffuser before, and after reading many reviews decided to order this one and the 500 ml unit. The 500 ml worked well from the outset, and this one only worked on one of the timed settings and the lights did not come on at all. I contacted the seller and received an immediate reply. After seeing the two units, I really preferred the 500 ml capacity, so the supplier was willing to send me another 500 ml unit in exchange for the 300 ml. The new one arrived in about a week (just like the first one), then I mailed the 300 ml unit back to China. I was reimbursed for the return shipping charges.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was very impressed with the customer service and how quickly the problem was resolved, considering the supplier is in China. I would not hesitate to purchase from this supplier again.</li>
            <li> My first Diffuser. Picked it for Price and what it offered.&lt;br /&gt;Works fine. One thing, the electronics are like old video game buttons.&lt;br /&gt;You can have a difficult time setting time and color.&lt;br /&gt;Just has issues with connecting. Be patient.</li>
            <li> Very good product.  It has very nice lighting.</li>
            <li> Works great! It&#x27;s really quiet.</li>
