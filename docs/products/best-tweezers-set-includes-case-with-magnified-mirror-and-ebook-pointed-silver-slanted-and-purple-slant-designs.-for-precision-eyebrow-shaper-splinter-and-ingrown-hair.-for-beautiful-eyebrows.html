            <li>I especially like the cute purple pouch to keep them in.</li>
            <li>I recently found myself in need of replacing my drug store brand tweezers, so when I stumbled across these during a promotional period, I was super excited and had to get them right away.</li>
            <li>It comes complete with a handy little pouch that they all fit inside with a velcro closure.  </li>
            <li>It comes in a nice little Velcro pouch that holds each tweezer in place.</li>
            <li>They come in a great little purple case with Velcro closure and have 3 different tweezers.</li>
            <li>These tweezers are really well made, are sturdy and durable.  </li>
            <li>seller is very communicative.</li>
            <li>she absolutely loves this set.</li>
            <li>The pouch is nice because I find myself actually putting them back after each use.</li>
            <li>The tweezers are sharp, cute and work well.  </li>
            <li>The stainless steel manufacturing of the tools makes them durable and high end products.  </li>
            <li>It makes plucking your eyebrows, so easy and your fingers can grip the tweezers without slipping.</li>
            <li>I’m getting older and refuse to admit that I need glasses</li>
            <li>highly recommend this set.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This is a cute little set makes eyebrow precision and shaping a breeze.</li>
            <li>I love that there is three tweezers to choose from and it comes with a matching little pouch.</li>
            <li>I love the little case that they come in...</li>
            <li>The tweezers are easy to handle and the edges are sharp - just what I need for those pesky chin hairs.</li>
            <li>You can never have enough tweezers, right?</li>
            <li>They are sharp and precise and get the hair or splinter every time.</li>
            <li>so you don&#x27;t lose your tweezers because they had no place to live and they fell on the floor.</li>
            <li>this set arrived during a hectic apartment move when my tweezers were in the bottom of one of a gazillion boxes and i needed to remove an unknown something i got stuck with during the rush to clean the old place.</li>
            <li>Moments after this package arrived my 3 year old got a splinter, I used the tweezers with the finest point and got it out in one try.</li>
            <li>The case is purple, which is just a bonus as far as I am concerned.</li>
            <li>Bought this as a gift as my mom always used old tweezers</li>
            <li>However I was surprised how well all three worked.</li>
            <li>Ther are by far the nicest tweezers I have ever use.</li>
            <li>They are made of stainless steel and will last for years to come.</li>
            <li>I cannot tell you how many times I have gone to my bathroom to grab my tweezers only to find them missing.  </li>
            <li>They seem super sturdy and like they&#x27;ll last a long time.</li>
            <li>Super sharp!</li>
            <li>No other tweezers needed!</li>
            <li>They are sharp and tweeze really well.  </li>
            <li>The weight of each tweezer tells me that they are high quality beauty tools and that they will last me a long time.</li>
            <li>Tweezers usually tend to get lost in my house so this alone was worth taking advantage of the promotion.</li>
            <li>I am notorious for losing my tweezers or having my tweezers go dull really quickly because they are unprotected and floating around my make up case.</li>
            <li>They were all three very sharp and gripped very well.</li>

            <li> I love the little case that they come in...</li>
            <li> The tweezers are easy to handle and the edges are sharp - just what I need for those pesky chin hairs.</li>
            <li> You can never have enough tweezers, right?</li>
            <li> They are sharp and precise and get the hair or splinter every time.</li>
            <li> so you don&#x27;t lose your tweezers because they had no place to live and they fell on the floor.</li>
            <li> this set arrived during a hectic apartment move when my tweezers were in the bottom of one of a gazillion boxes and i needed to remove an unknown something i got stuck with during the rush to clean the old place.</li>
            <li> Moments after this package arrived my 3 year old got a splinter, I used the tweezers with the finest point and got it out in one try.</li>

            <li> They are made of stainless steel and will last for years to come.</li>
            <li> I cannot tell you how many times I have gone to my bathroom to grab my tweezers only to find them missing.  </li>
            <li> They seem super sturdy and like they&#x27;ll last a long time.</li>
            <li> Super sharp!</li>
            <li> No other tweezers needed!</li>
            <li> They are sharp and tweeze really well.  </li>
            <li> The weight of each tweezer tells me that they are high quality beauty tools and that they will last me a long time.</li>
            <li> Tweezers usually tend to get lost in my house so this alone was worth taking advantage of the promotion.</li>
            <li> I am notorious for losing my tweezers or having my tweezers go dull really quickly because they are unprotected and floating around my make up case.</li>
            <li> They were all three very sharp and gripped very well.</li>
            <li> and I pulled out a small strand of built up dirt that was in the whole of my piercing.</li>
            <li> Even though it&#x27;s been over a year, it&#x27;s not completely close.</li>
            <li> I have used these to tweeze my eyebrows a few times now and thankfully have only pulled hairs.  </li>
            <li> It may seem like a not brainer, but I have had cheap ones that do not meet across the entire edge, making it difficult and frustrating to grasp a single hair.</li>
            <li> I like that they can be used for ingrown hairs, splinters or other foreign objects and eyebrows.</li>
            <li> with no hot water nor time to prep the skin</li>
            <li> The size of carrying case they are stored in is approximately the same size as a standard pocket pack of tissues as shown in picture.</li>
            <li> Half the time they will not grab the hair...</li>
            <li> and I noticed that a little black scab-like skin was sticking out of the hole.</li>
            <li> This set appears to be well crafted and each pair closes tightly.</li>
            <li> These are a little thicker than the ones I&#x27;m used to using.</li>
            <li> Took a little bit to get used to that.</li>
            <li> This is a neat little tweezer set.</li>
            <li> I have had some tweezers I&#x27;ve purchased in the past, that have had a small enough gap to make it almost impossible to get a hold of any thing I was attempting to pluck, or remove from my skin.</li>
            <li> I am a tweezer fanatic.</li>
            <li> not only did it remove the stabbing thing it did it without hurting, yay!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Because of that, it vulnerable in collecting dirt, just like the pores on our face.</li>
            <li> that is just useless to me</li>

            <li> Industrial tweezers! Great precision and grips single eyebrow hair really well. Contours to my fingers perfectly. I love the pointed tweezers. Here&#x27;s why, and this may gross readers out a bit. I had belly button piercing that I let close up. Even though it&#x27;s been over a year, it&#x27;s not completely close. Because of that, it vulnerable in collecting dirt, just like the pores on our face. Dirt built up and I noticed that a little black scab-like skin was sticking out of the hole. I tried to scratch it off and pull it out with just my fingers but it didn&#x27;t work. I used the pointed tweezers and it grabbed it right away and I pulled out a small strand of built up dirt that was in the whole of my piercing. It was narly. If I would not have had this tool, it would probably still be there. Because of that, it&#x27;s a definite 5-star with me. I love the purple carry case it comes in, useful for travel and it&#x27;s my favorite color. I purchased this item on promo and love it!</li>
            <li> What a great tweezer set!  I love this set!  The tweezers are sharp, cute and work well.  I especially love that the one purple set is sparkly.  Very cute :-)  I like the case they come in- very convenient and fits great right in my purse or makeup bag very easily.  They didn&#x27;t pull on my skin and removed the hair very easily.</li>
            <li> This a great little set of effective tweezers. It comes in a nice little Velcro pouch that holds each tweezer in place. This is a cute little set makes eyebrow precision and shaping a breeze. You have three different tweezers to choose from. They are sharp and they have perfectly angled tips that grab individual hairs easily. I was able to grab very fine hair that you could hardly see too. I think these tweezers are great for any kind of facial hair. They have great gripping power. They are also great at getting splinters or little pieces of glass out of your skin. I love the real pointy tweezers for grabbing splinters and ingrown hairs. I love that there is three tweezers to choose from and it comes with a matching little pouch. It looks quite nice, is convenient, and easy to keep them all together. I received a discount on this product. This review is a reflection of my own personal experience with this product from a customer&#x27;s standpoint.</li>
            <li> These are hands down the best tweezers I have ever used! They come in a great little purple case with Velcro closure and have 3 different tweezers. The pouch is great because I am always misplacing my tweezers.  Moments after this package arrived my 3 year old got a splinter, I used the tweezers with the finest point and got it out in one try. I love that it is so easy to be precise with these. It makes plucking your eyebrows, so easy and your fingers can grip the tweezers without slipping. I received these as part of a promotion and would buy them again without hesitation. These are definitely profession grade tweezers, I am so happy with this set!</li>
            <li> Love the tweezers! They work great &amp; the packaging is really nice so I can carry them along with me &amp; not worry about them getting lost or damaged.</li>
            <li> No other tweezers needed! This set has 3 tweezers for every type of need. They are sharp and precise and get the hair or splinter every time. I love the convenient carry case. Great to throw in a purse and to travel with. I will never leave home without them!  I got these as a promotion and so happy to review this very good, high quality set of tweezers.</li>
            <li> These tweezers are really well made, are sturdy and durable.  They are sharp and tweeze really well.  I like the convenient carrying case as well.  It keeps them protected and in place.</li>
            <li> This set to tweezers have become my favorite tweezers that I own! I can not sand a set of tweezers that bend when you apply pressure to them, which many many sets that I own do!! that is just useless to me I need some strong durable can take just about anything thrown at them tweezers!! And thankfully i was asked to try these out because I think I have finally found what i was looking for!!!!!</li>
            <li> I am a tweezer fanatic. I am always on the hunt for THE PERFECT TWEEZER. This set is so wonderful! I am so glad that I was offered a coupon for this product! There are three very different pairs of tweezers in this set and they are all sharp and work so great! The carrying case is really nice, as well. If you are a plucking fiend (like I am) these tweezers will make you sooooo happy!!</li>
            <li> These are a little thicker than the ones I&#x27;m used to using. Took a little bit to get used to that. There&#x27;s one for fine and or ingrown hairs that really comes in handy. They do get the job done and are nice. They seem super sturdy and like they&#x27;ll last a long time. They come with a super cute and handy pouch to store them in. I was able to score them using a coupon code so it really made the purchase even better!</li>
            <li> I was happy to get to try this set of 3 Tweezers with the Super Cute Purple Case! I have been needing a new pair of tweezers and when I look, I never seem to find the kind I like, until now! I have 3 to choose from depending on what I need them for. I like that they can be stored in this super cute case for protection of the alignment and also the case makes them easy to find instead of them being loose in a drawer.  I like this because I can sanitize them and place them back in their individual places in the case, after each use. The alignment is just fine and they seem to be of good quality.  I like that they can be used for ingrown hairs, splinters or other foreign objects and eyebrows. I recommend this fashionable set.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re great!  Especially love the way they are packaged in the little pouch.  It will keep the tweezers from getting damaged.</li>
            <li> Great asset to my make-up supply and the carrying case acts as a perfect hiding place.  Yes, I said hiding place. I cannot tell you how many times I have gone to my bathroom to grab my tweezers only to find them missing.  It’s 5 against 1 at my house and the 5 are named: not me, wasn’t me, I don’t know, what tweezers?, and they were there the last time I looked.  So, yes, the pretty purple case makes for a great hiding place!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The tweezers themselves are excellent!  The length is perfect and I like the way the edges meet so that they grab the hairs easily.  It may seem like a not brainer, but I have had cheap ones that do not meet across the entire edge, making it difficult and frustrating to grasp a single hair. I’m getting older and refuse to admit that I need glasses so, yes, I sometimes grab skin with eyebrow hairs. I have used these to tweeze my eyebrows a few times now and thankfully have only pulled hairs.  I really am glad I jumped in on the promotional deal when I was given the opportunity.</li>
            <li> i painstakingly had a review written when the internet ate it. anyway... this set arrived during a hectic apartment move when my tweezers were in the bottom of one of a gazillion boxes and i needed to remove an unknown something i got stuck with during the rush to clean the old place. with no hot water nor time to prep the skin i just grabbed the purple one of the set and used it around 3 am in low light and it worked! not only did it remove the stabbing thing it did it without hurting, yay!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;about the set itself, it&#x27;s well made, is very precise, has no gaps, it tweezes painlessly and it comes in a purple case that closes with velcro so you don&#x27;t lose your tweezers because they had no place to live and they fell on the floor. highly recommend this set. seller is very communicative. edited to fix typos.</li>
            <li> I received my tweezer set today, and am very happy with the product. The size of carrying case they are stored in is approximately the same size as a standard pocket pack of tissues as shown in picture. In my opinion these work well, and are closely together when pinching them to grab at a piece of hair, or sliver. There are no gaps in between when pinching each tweezer type included, which is a huge plus. I have had some tweezers I&#x27;ve purchased in the past, that have had a small enough gap to make it almost impossible to get a hold of any thing I was attempting to pluck, or remove from my skin. In my experience with these, they are very easy to use, and lightweight. I like the color, purple being one of my favorite colors. These are stainless steel as I did test with a magnet and there was a strong connection between the two.&lt;br /&gt;***I purchased this product at a promotional rate, for testing and review purposes. This review is based on my honest/unbiased opinion of said product***</li>
            <li> [[VIDEOID:c3bdd2c718e3cb65de6f668a7792dacd]] This 3 pack of tweezers is an awesome purchase! It comes with 3 different types of tweezers that are great for all kinds of hair pulling or splinter plucking.  They fit easy in my hand and are comfortable to grip.  The weight of each tweezer tells me that they are high quality beauty tools and that they will last me a long time. The stainless steel manufacturing of the tools makes them durable and high end products.  I love that they have the sparkling purple coating, this helps with keeping a good firm grip while they are in use.  It comes complete with a handy little pouch that they all fit inside with a velcro closure.  This is something I&#x27;ll definitely be keeping in my purse away from my husband and kids! I purchased this product at a discount in exchange for my honest review.</li>
            <li> You can never have enough tweezers, right? I was glad to take advantage of the opportunity to review these as part of a promotion.  I love the little case that they come in... it&#x27;s pretty and well made.  The tweezers themselves offer a nice variety of shapes and uses.  I&#x27;m keeping these in my bathroom drawer so that they can stay all together and I can have the variety at my disposal whenever needed.</li>
            <li> Gotta say tweezerman is exceptionally better than these 3 . Half the time they will not grab the hair... what&#x27;s up with that?? Spend 20$ on one good one that will work instead of these.</li>
            <li> This is a neat little tweezer set. I really love the variety of tweezers. You get two slanted tipped tweezers, which I use often, so it&#x27;s nice to have more than one pair. You also get a pointed tipped tweezer, which is perfect for removing hard to grab things, like splinters. I am notorious for losing my tweezers or having my tweezers go dull really quickly because they are unprotected and floating around my make up case. That is why the little pouch they come in is so great. It has one slot for each pair of tweezers, and a velcro closure to ensure they don&#x27;t slip out The case is purple, which is just a bonus as far as I am concerned. I recently found myself in need of replacing my drug store brand tweezers, so when I stumbled across these during a promotional period, I was super excited and had to get them right away. Incidentally, even at regular price, you will pay less with this brand, than the best pair you can get at one of the drug store chains. This is really a great set, and I am very satisfied with my purchase.</li>
            <li> wife was so impressed with the quality</li>
            <li> Although they look like they do they don&#x27;t grab tightly enough to pluck hair. They may be okay for splinters but not hair</li>
            <li> This set appears to be well crafted and each pair closes tightly. We&#x27;re happy with the variety in this pack and expect them to serve us for years to come. Thanks for the attention to quality!</li>
            <li> Love tweezerman! Bought this as a gift as my mom always used old tweezers she absolutely loves this set. The pointy tweezers are amazing and best of the 3.</li>
            <li> There is a tweezer here for anything you may need.  I love the verstility of each of these.  Sometimes you need a really fine point and sometimes you just don&#x27;t.  I love they came in such a  great case that I can just keep in my makeup train case.  I purchsed this with a coupon and it came very fast.</li>
            <li> Very nice set of tweezers. I especially like the cute purple pouch to keep them in. Tweezers usually tend to get lost in my house so this alone was worth taking advantage of the promotion. However I was surprised how well all three worked. They were all three very sharp and gripped very well. It was easy to use them for brows with great accuracy.</li>
            <li> Ther are by far the nicest tweezers I have ever use. Not only are they pretty, but they are effective, enabling me to tweeze the tiniest eyebrow hair. They are made of stainless steel and will last for years to come. And they come in a convenient storage pouch which tucks easily into your purse. Highly recommend.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Disclaimer: I was offered this product at a promotional price to share my honest opinion.</li>
            <li> I finally found tweezers that get the job done! The tweezers are easy to handle and the edges are sharp - just what I need for those pesky chin hairs. They come in a purple leather pouch which makes it easy to carry with you - Just drop in your bag and go! I had the opportunity to purchase these with a discount and in my honest opinion I now have no reason to spend $24 on just one tweezer. Halleluiah!</li>
            <li> This is the last set of tweezers you will ever need.  I have used all three for different reasons and found each one to be of well quality and well made.  The protective sleeve they come in is super convenient to keep them all together and easy to find.  I am super pleased with my purchase and would recommend them to anyone looking for a new set!</li>
            <li> These are incredible! I find the extra pointy tweezers really handy for pulling out splinters. The wider tweezers have a good angle and edges are even for catching the hair. The pouch is cute and very sparkly. The pouch is nice because I find myself actually putting them back after each use. The</li>
            <li> I bought these for my daughter for a gift but ended up keeping them for myself! Super sharp! great quality. salon quality! They come in a cute little purple decorative storage bag that looks great in my bathroom vanity!</li>
