            <li>It is now shiny and healthy looking.  </li>
            <li>This shampoo and conditioner gave my hair the volume, shine and healthy look it needed.</li>
            <li>Makes it easy to brush after a shower.</li>
            <li>This is my new favorite!</li>
            <li>This product is DEFINITELY worth the cost!</li>
            <li>The extra volume isn&#x27;t good for my hair, it&#x27;s too drying for this time of year.</li>
            <li>However my conditioner had leaked out and didn&#x27;t get a full bottle.  </li>
            <li>I use this in my daughters SUPER curly hair as well</li>

            <li>This shampoo and conditioner combo really do what they claim to do.  </li>
            <li>The Extra Valume shampoo and conditioner made my hair look pretty wild; I just thought there was a chance it would work, but what I really needed was a different kind that my hair stylist later recommended.  </li>
            <li>No matter how many tangles or knots just a little bit of conditioner goes a very long way and gets the hair feeling silky smooth in seconds.</li>
            <li>i highly recommend this brand for the hair.  </li>

            <li>It makes my hair so soft</li>
            <li>My hair feels soft and silky and it is shiny.</li>
            <li>The shampoo is not smooth, but the conditioner is just ok; it is not what i expected it to be.</li>
            <li>and I can tell you how much her frizziness and dry ends have improved!</li>

            <li> The scent reminds me of Flex, a shampoo I grew up with. The extra volume isn&#x27;t good for my hair, it&#x27;s too drying for this time of year. Maybe it will be better in summer. I do like that it leaves y hair shiny.</li>

            <li> these products work great on my fine, thinning hair - and the fragrance is just right for hair products.  Sometimes the shampoo is over &#x27;fragranced&#x27; and them I can hardly stand to be around myself.</li>

            <li> The shampoo is not smooth, but the conditioner is just ok; it is not what i expected it to be.</li>
            <li> The Extra Valume shampoo and conditioner made my hair look pretty wild; I just thought there was a chance it would work, but what I really needed was a different kind that my hair stylist later recommended.  But the seller was really good in accepting the return!  So you should order from here.</li>

            <li> Great product for my dry fine limp hair. Makes it easy to brush after a shower. Hair is smooth and has lots of extra volume. Just a smidge cheaper than at my local hair salon. Will be rebuying</li>
            <li> This product actually does what it says. My hair feels soft and silky and it is shiny. I will never use another brand.</li>
