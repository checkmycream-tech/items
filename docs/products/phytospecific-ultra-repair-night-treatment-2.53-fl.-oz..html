            <li>I am very pleased.</li>

            <li>I just love it.</li>
            <li>I love the smell and it&#x27;s not greasy</li>
            <li>I am Phyto loyalist and I love the products.</li>
            <li>It was recommended to me and I tried it and love it.  </li>
            <li>Just as described - even better.</li>
            <li>but this product is for more ethnic hair</li>
            <li>My hair is fuller and easily managed.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t feel strongly about it, but would purchase again.</li>
            <li>It goes on light but</li>
            <li>I have fine hair and it is just the right amount of moisture.  </li>
            <li>Since I love Big Hair, this was precisely what I was looking for.</li>
            <li>It was worth the price.</li>
            <li>I wanted to love this product, but it sends my hair into protein overload, my hair must be protein sensitive to this process.</li>
            <li>Fast improvement, my hair feels incredible and I can actually tell the difference after using it for only a week</li>
            <li>Nice hair cream, but not exceptional or necessarily better than others.  </li>

            <li>I really like it a lot</li>
            <li>I love this cream and frankly I&#x27;m rather a beauty product slut who tries everything new.</li>
            <li>First time user and I am surprised that I can feel results in my hair.</li>
            <li>Overall when it comes packaged right</li>
            <li>I had hoped it would protect my fine locks, don&#x27;t waste money on this one.</li>
            <li>I am a 4a/b natural hair type</li>
            <li>Its easier to put protein back in then to overload this much for me.</li>
            <li>i used a very small amount and focus more on the ends of my hair.</li>
            <li>The next morning my hair felt soft.</li>
            <li>Be mindful not to use too much because it may weight down the hair.</li>

            <li> the next morning I noticed my hair was dry and crispy.</li>
            <li> Last time came the cap was loose.</li>
            <li> I have been looking for something like this for a long time</li>
            <li> My hair is soft and silky with just a small  amount added each night before I wrap my hair.</li>
            <li> It adds just enough moisture without weighing my hair down.  </li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I like some of the other products in the Phytospecific line</li>
            <li> No at all greasy, heavy or thick and a natural fragrance.</li>
            <li> I use this product 3-4 nights a week and noticed that my hair is allot stronger and have less breakage.</li>
            <li> my hairstylist recommended this because I am transitioning and I lead a very active lifestyle.</li>
            <li> I use it after blowing my hair dry and it does NOT make my thick, wavy hair greasy at all.</li>
            <li> I got this for almost all other orders, but this one :/</li>
            <li> It dried my hair out.</li>
            <li> container is just really small.</li>
            <li> This stuff leaves hair hard and crunchy, I thew it away.</li>
            <li> , the only bad thing is that is too small a jar.  </li>
            <li> They are not tightening the package and that is not good.</li>
            <li> But I got annoyed  when the info about it wasn&#x27;t all correct, where the seller wrote that it is 6 oz</li>

            <li> Product not for everyone. Ask your hairdresser. It dried my hair out.</li>
            <li> I am a 4a/b natural hair type and i found this product to be good. I used it as directed although i mist my hair with water first before applying the product. after applying the product i wrap my hair up in a satin scarf.I have used it for two weeks now and i feel it has helped combat with breakage especially since its winter. i used a very small amount and focus more on the ends of my hair.</li>
            <li> I have 4a/b hair. I like some of the other products in the Phytospecific line so I decided to give this one a try. It goes on light but the next morning I noticed my hair was dry and crispy. Almost like it had protein overload. I will not buy again.</li>
            <li> This product is the added moisture that I needed for my hair.  It adds just enough moisture without weighing my hair down.  I have fine hair and it is just the right amount of moisture.  I have been looking for something like this for a long time and I finally found it.  I just love it.</li>
            <li> I really can tell a difference. My hair is fuller and easily managed. I love the smell and it&#x27;s not greasy</li>
            <li> I love this cream and frankly I&#x27;m rather a beauty product slut who tries everything new. Surprisingly I found that this gave my hair body as if it were a thickener. Since I love Big Hair, this was precisely what I was looking for. I use it after blowing my hair dry and it does NOT make my thick, wavy hair greasy at all. Now I don&#x27;t use regular conditioner any longer. Have already stocked up on this product in case they stop making it. Great Product!</li>
            <li> This stuff leaves hair hard and crunchy, I thew it away. I had hoped it would protect my fine locks, don&#x27;t waste money on this one. No moisturizing effect at all.</li>
            <li> First time user and I am surprised that I can feel results in my hair. I think one can get maximum results if after rubbing it in at night, one covers or wraps the hair with a satin scarf or so. In the morning there is perfectly moisturised and manageable hair. Be mindful not to use too much because it may weight down the hair.</li>
            <li> But I got annoyed  when the info about it wasn&#x27;t all correct, where the seller wrote that it is 6 oz while when I got the package I found out that it is 2.3 oz. I like to buy from Amazon because it offers me options other sites don&#x27;t offer, for example, find this product in bigger sizes. I got this for almost all other orders, but this one :/</li>
            <li> I have relaxed hair and I often have allot of breakage at night. I use this product 3-4 nights a week and noticed that my hair is allot stronger and have less breakage. A little goes a long way. I received it before the scheduled date. I am very happy with the product and the seller.</li>
            <li> The product is a God send!. I work out 6 times a week. My stylist uses the entire line and recommended the product. I was concern with the cost but I was experiencing some breakage with the exercising. I apply the product to my scalp and my ends. The next morning my hair felt soft. You dont need much. It was worth the price. I am Phyto loyalist and I love the products. I am very pleased. I would buy again.</li>
            <li> It has helped my hair a lot!!  It was recommended to me and I tried it and love it.  I would buy it again.</li>
            <li> I really like it a lot, the only bad thing is that is too small a jar.  Not enough so you have to keep on buying like every two weeks if you have lots of hair like me</li>
            <li> my hairstylist recommended this because I am transitioning and I lead a very active lifestyle. It&#x27;s hydrating without being heavy.&lt;br /&gt;The container is just really small.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff!!!!! My hair is soft and silky with just a small  amount added each night before I wrap my hair. I&#x27;ll purchase this stuff for life!!!!!</li>
            <li> The perfect product for me. Just as described - even better. No at all greasy, heavy or thick and a natural fragrance. Didn&#x27;t even style my hair the next day - ran my hands through and didn&#x27;t feel as if I should have washed it out.</li>
            <li> Fast improvement, my hair feels incredible and I can actually tell the difference after using it for only a week</li>
            <li> Last time came the cap was loose. I would say that has happened 2xs recently. They are not tightening the package and that is not good. Overall when it comes packaged right it&#x27;s a great product.</li>
            <li> I liked this product but not for my hair type but it works but this product is for more ethnic hair</li>
            <li> I wanted to love this product, but it sends my hair into protein overload, my hair must be protein sensitive to this process. Its easier to put protein back in then to overload this much for me.</li>
            <li> Nice hair cream, but not exceptional or necessarily better than others.  I don&#x27;t feel strongly about it, but would purchase again.</li>
            <li> This is a good product make ur heathy</li>
