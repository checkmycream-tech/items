            <li>If alternate use of a good moisturizer it helps combat some of the dryness.</li>
            <li>Wondering how true that statement is.</li>
            <li>I would recommend this to anyone that wants a brighter, more even, tighter (collagen inhibited), and smoother (wrinkle reduction) skin.  </li>
            <li>I love Obagi and will reorder another item very soon.</li>
            <li>So, I am forced to find the best price online.  </li>
            <li>This is a good mild facial cleanser.</li>
            <li>The original obagi cleanser was pink and had a mild pleasant smell to it, made you want to put it on your face.</li>
            <li>Have used these products for over 8 years and love the condition of my skin given the nearly 70 years of use.  </li>
            <li>I do prefer the foaming cleaner (pink), but this one is also good.  </li>
            <li>The two products combined are very gentle on your skin.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend the full line.</li>
            <li>The product is exactly what I wanted and it was delivered in a timely manner.</li>
            <li>What happened to this product?&lt;br /&gt;The toner is exactly what I was expecting.</li>
            <li>- I had this in my hot hands within 1 day of ordering - thank</li>
            <li>This was my first time to try them</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried so many others, but this cleanser actually makes my skin feel and look smoother, softer without drying it out.</li>
            <li>Wished Obagi Clear was available without prescription...</li>
            <li>I have used tthem for several years, and still love them.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>This is the best skin care products I ever tried, however is expensive.</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>Such a good value-  lasts a solid 6 months.  </li>
            <li>Not cheap but worth the money if yuu want nice skin.</li>
            <li>so simple, reasonably priced, good daily habit.</li>
            <li>I have been using Obagi Gentle Cleanser and Toner because years ago I was in a motor vehicle accident and my face was cut up.</li>
            <li>Switched to Amazon and its vendors because of its reliability, fast shipment and very resonable price.  </li>
            <li>The toner is just as gentle.</li>
            <li>and my skin feels very greasy after using it.</li>
            <li>Just wondering if this was the real thing.</li>
            <li>There is Obagi Gentle Cleanser.</li>
            <li>Shipped fast.</li>
            <li>Thanks Amazon</li>
            <li>Real obagi cleanser is a pinkish orange.</li>
            <li>Ordering these products through Amazon is so much easier than driving across town and paying a fortune.  </li>
            <li>I really like the toner it makes my face feel cleaner.</li>
            <li>I paid almost twice as much.</li>
            <li>Obagi has been around for a long time and while I have strayed and tried other skin care lines I keep coming back to Obagi as it never disappoints in doing  the best job of keeping my skin clear of acne (even at 56 years old) yet fresh and clean not dried out.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know if one is better than the other.</li>
            <li>The gentle cleanser is great for dry skin, but I did find the toner to be a little too drying along with the rest of the system which can also be drying.</li>
            <li>No serious side effects, fast results.</li>
            <li>The toner was okay, but the cleanser was a clear color and smelled like some strange chemical.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll go back to my spa and pay full.</li>
            <li>As I have gotten older and my skin has changed there has been a product in their line that has met my changing needs.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend this seller.</li>
            <li>Leaves skin clean without feeling dried out, Toner balances out the skin leaving it fresh.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s yellow; while the real one is a light orange color and the toner smells completely different!</li>
            <li>This was my first order but it won&#x27;t be my last.</li>
            <li>I also love the price a amazon which without that would be hard for me to get.  </li>
            <li>I still get occasional break-outs (PMS and stress!), but I do believe that this cleaner and toner keep my skin clean, don&#x27;t irritate it and doesn&#x27;t dry it out.  </li>
            <li>It is clear with a scent.&lt;br /&gt;And</li>
            <li>am 40 years old</li>
            <li>My skin,age 70, looks like a 50 year old women.</li>
            <li>I recommend this product and the Obagi treatment, but would suggest you consult a professional to ensure it will work for you.</li>
            <li>It makes my skin so soft</li>
            <li>I wash with this, wipe off with a tissue, and then complete the cleaning with a water wetted face cloth.  </li>
            <li>A bit on the old side.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very gentle on my skin, it doesn&#x27;t dry it out or make it oily.</li>
            <li>I requested the gentle cleanser for dry to normal skin and received just the opposite.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin and it does not dry it out.</li>
            <li>They are both very gentle and you just have to use a dimes woth of the cleanser and also of the toner, so they last a very long time.</li>
            <li>it is the only one that works for my sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>My dermatologist claims that Obagi only sells through doctors and anything else may be old and expired product.</li>
            <li>Now I am apparently required to keep typing words.</li>
            <li>my skin is much clearer and pores are minimal.</li>
            <li>This is a widely recommended product and your price is very competitive. .  </li>
            <li>After following the instructions of the treatment correctly, I saw a steady decline in pigmentation on my face and slowed aging down considerably.</li>
            <li>She unfortunately is no longer in the area and the product is not available over the counter.</li>

            <li> I really like the toner it makes my face feel cleaner.</li>
            <li> I paid almost twice as much.</li>
            <li> Obagi has been around for a long time and while I have strayed and tried other skin care lines I keep coming back to Obagi as it never disappoints in doing  the best job of keeping my skin clear of acne (even at 56 years old) yet fresh and clean not dried out.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if one is better than the other.</li>
            <li> The gentle cleanser is great for dry skin, but I did find the toner to be a little too drying along with the rest of the system which can also be drying.</li>
            <li> No serious side effects, fast results.</li>
            <li> The toner was okay, but the cleanser was a clear color and smelled like some strange chemical.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll go back to my spa and pay full.</li>
            <li> As I have gotten older and my skin has changed there has been a product in their line that has met my changing needs.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend this seller.</li>
            <li> Leaves skin clean without feeling dried out, Toner balances out the skin leaving it fresh.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s yellow; while the real one is a light orange color and the toner smells completely different!</li>
            <li> This was my first order but it won&#x27;t be my last.</li>
            <li> I also love the price a amazon which without that would be hard for me to get.  </li>
            <li> I still get occasional break-outs (PMS and stress!), but I do believe that this cleaner and toner keep my skin clean, don&#x27;t irritate it and doesn&#x27;t dry it out.  </li>
            <li> It is clear with a scent.&lt;br /&gt;And</li>
            <li> am 40 years old</li>
            <li> My skin,age 70, looks like a 50 year old women.</li>
            <li> I recommend this product and the Obagi treatment, but would suggest you consult a professional to ensure it will work for you.</li>
            <li> It makes my skin so soft</li>
            <li> I wash with this, wipe off with a tissue, and then complete the cleaning with a water wetted face cloth.  </li>
            <li> A bit on the old side.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very gentle on my skin, it doesn&#x27;t dry it out or make it oily.</li>
            <li> I requested the gentle cleanser for dry to normal skin and received just the opposite.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and it does not dry it out.</li>
            <li> They are both very gentle and you just have to use a dimes woth of the cleanser and also of the toner, so they last a very long time.</li>
            <li> it is the only one that works for my sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li> My dermatologist claims that Obagi only sells through doctors and anything else may be old and expired product.</li>
            <li> Now I am apparently required to keep typing words.</li>
            <li> my skin is much clearer and pores are minimal.</li>
            <li> This is a widely recommended product and your price is very competitive. .  </li>
            <li> After following the instructions of the treatment correctly, I saw a steady decline in pigmentation on my face and slowed aging down considerably.</li>
            <li> She unfortunately is no longer in the area and the product is not available over the counter.</li>
            <li> I have dry skin &amp; its much too harsh.</li>
            <li> I have used less expensive products for my face and they do not clean as good as Obagi.  </li>
            <li> I started this product probably 10 years ago at least, and I really like it.</li>
            <li> I have been a long time user of Obagi products and they have transformed my skin.  </li>
            <li> Prices so high hard to afford.</li>
            <li> My face doesn&#x27;t feel dry after using them morning and night.</li>
            <li> I recommend for anyone who has dry or oily skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in my mid thirties and have some minor pigmentation and uneven skin.  </li>
            <li> Expensive but worth it</li>
            <li> I have had skin trouble my entire life, and tried everything out there for acne-prone skin.  </li>
            <li> Product came in on time and was what was expected.</li>
            <li> As an avid Obagi user (goodbye blasted Irish freckles!!)</li>
            <li> I have ordered Obagi Cleanser through you and other sources for five years and have never received an Obagi cleanser that feels and smells like hand soap.</li>
            <li> My doctor told me about this product and now I will not use any other cleanser or toner.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin and have never experienced any irritation from these products.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for the past 5 years and had run out and had taken too long to re-order</li>
            <li> It takes awhile to see the results so if you are just starting out, give it at least 2 months for results, and don&#x27;t get disheartened.</li>
            <li> product!i know this line very well,and what a revived is not a reall Obagi ,is totally fake</li>
            <li> Not fresh</li>
            <li> Just use a little cleanser</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for a few days now</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money by trying to save some.</li>
            <li> I have delicate skin (thin and prone to reactions to perfumes and harsh cleansers).  </li>
            <li> So disappointed I made such a costly error because I assumed the search was limiting resu</li>
            <li> This was a fake  </li>
            <li> As some others have reviewed, this product appears to be fake.</li>
            <li> You can never go wrong with Obagi!  </li>
            <li> Fake product!</li>
            <li> Horrible!</li>
            <li> It is totally fake!!!!!</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Honestly, nothing very special about this cleaner. Save your money.</li>
            <li> Expensive but worth it</li>
            <li> The product is exactly what I wanted and it was delivered in a timely manner.</li>
            <li> Your skin feels clean when your finished without over drying. Skin feels hydrated after toner. Love Obagi!!! You will see the difference!</li>
            <li> I have ordered Obagi Cleanser through you and other sources for five years and have never received an Obagi cleanser that feels and smells like hand soap. I don&#x27;t think Obagi changed the Cleanser. What happened to this product?&lt;br /&gt;The toner is exactly what I was expecting. I like it.</li>
            <li> Great price and genuine product. Mlive it!</li>
            <li> amazing product and even more amazing delivery - I had this in my hot hands within 1 day of ordering - thank you thank you</li>
            <li> Ugh...I didn&#x27;t pay attention to what I purchased since I searched only for foaming cleanser which is milder than this product! This cleanser&amp;toner set is for oily or acne prone skin. I have dry skin &amp; its much too harsh. I&#x27;ve used foaming cleanser for years &amp; love it. So disappointed I made such a costly error because I assumed the search was limiting resu</li>
            <li> Excellent service.  Items delivered as promised.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for the past 5 years and had run out and had taken too long to re-order so I had a week with out it and boy did I notice a difference when i finally got my order.  My skin had gone &amp;#34;downhill&amp;#34; in the days without it and had improved within 2 days of getting back on my routine!  this is a wonderful line that I will be careful to not lapse my order again!</li>
            <li> I love the obagi skin care it really work for me and Amazon price for all product are great.&lt;br /&gt;I would like to recommend anyone to use it.&lt;br /&gt;I am 40 years old but I am looking youngers for my ages ,I been useing over 2 years now and I love it :)</li>
            <li> I like these two products. This was my first time to try them and I&#x27;ll order again. My face doesn&#x27;t feel dry after using them morning and night. I follow with Obagi retinal cream. My face feels terrific.</li>
            <li> Favorite products. Leaves skin clean without feeling dried out, Toner balances out the skin leaving it fresh. Great price on two products together in package deal. Wish they would do for others. Prices so high hard to afford. Have to buy one product at a time and wait to buy next when I can afford it.</li>
            <li> Got this two days after I ordered! I&#x27;ve used Obagi before and it does wonders for my acne prone skin. I also have dark spots and after using Obagi for a month I noticed great results! Will continue to use.</li>
            <li> excellent products have been using them for years. I have very sensitive skin and have never experienced any irritation from these products. You don&#x27;t have to use much to get great results.</li>
            <li> Best cleanser and toner I have ever used.</li>
            <li> I use the whole line of Nu Derm products and have received many compliments on my skin. It takes awhile to see the results so if you are just starting out, give it at least 2 months for results, and don&#x27;t get disheartened.</li>
            <li> I have been buying this fro 10 years and I love it.</li>
            <li> Love these products and this was a great price</li>
            <li> I have been using Obagi Gentle Cleanser and Toner because years ago I was in a motor vehicle accident and my face was cut up. After my face healed. My doctor told me about this product and now I will not use any other cleanser or toner. They are both very gentle and you just have to use a dimes woth of the cleanser and also of the toner, so they last a very long time. I buy my obagi from Amazon.com.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried so many others, but this cleanser actually makes my skin feel and look smoother, softer without drying it out. Love it and it smells good too.</li>
            <li> Switched to Amazon and its vendors because of its reliability, fast shipment and very resonable price.  More selections and variety of vendors to choose.</li>
            <li> The gentle cleanser is great for dry skin, but I did find the toner to be a little too drying along with the rest of the system which can also be drying. If alternate use of a good moisturizer it helps combat some of the dryness.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for a few days now and I can&#x27;t believe it. It&#x27;s very gentle on my skin, it doesn&#x27;t dry it out or make it oily. It simply cleanses my skin. You use just a drop of it and it&#x27;s enough for your entire face. The toner is just as gentle. I recommend for anyone who has dry or oily skin.</li>
            <li> Love how these two products work together, leaving my face clean.  I have sensitive skin and it does not dry it out.</li>
            <li> Obagi has been around for a long time and while I have strayed and tried other skin care lines I keep coming back to Obagi as it never disappoints in doing  the best job of keeping my skin clear of acne (even at 56 years old) yet fresh and clean not dried out. If you use their other products they do a great job of getting rid of hyper pigmentation and reducing fine lines. I have used their products for 15 years! I get compliments on my skin all time. As I have gotten older and my skin has changed there has been a product in their line that has met my changing needs. Their cleansers and toner will always be a part of my regimen. Love love their products.</li>
            <li> It made me break out and my skin feels very greasy after using it. I don&#x27;t like that feeling on my skin</li>
            <li> I started this product probably 10 years ago at least, and I really like it. It is a great product</li>
            <li> Great Product and it is the only one that works for my sensitive skin.  Will continue to buy this product and use it.</li>
            <li> love these products and have used them for years</li>
            <li> Great Product and a good price - Happy with the purchase</li>
            <li> Started using this after cosmetic surgery and I love it. Wished Obagi Clear was available without prescription... that&#x27;s the step 3 in this product line, but the doctor&#x27;s office marks it up by 30% ($99 per dinky bottle!). Anyway, these two are a great start.</li>
            <li> Does what it says it does. Been using Obagi for years. My skin,age 70, looks like a 50 year old women.</li>
            <li> This is amazing skin care and well worth the price.</li>
            <li> To strong for my face</li>
            <li> I have been a long time user of Obagi products and they have transformed my skin.  I highly recommend the full line.</li>
            <li> As an avid Obagi user (goodbye blasted Irish freckles!!), I love the cleanser and toner-- they clean without stripping, and the toner shrinks my pores.</li>
            <li> You can never go wrong with Obagi!  Your face feels so clean and youthful!</li>
            <li> Have used these products for over 8 years and love the condition of my skin given the nearly 70 years of use.  i recommend to friends and family. so simple, reasonably priced, good daily habit.</li>
            <li> Horrible! I have used Obagi for years. Fake product! This was NOT Obagi and they would not refund my money.</li>
            <li> meant to order foaming gel- this cleanser doesn&#x27;t work as well</li>
            <li> Do not but this product from this company! It is totally fake!!!!! I have used Obagi products for about 5 years and have always re-purchased through my dermatologist until this last purchase. The cleanser made me break out and it&#x27;s yellow; while the real one is a light orange color and the toner smells completely different! Do not buy it!!</li>
            <li> Caused rash and redness on my face.  Since then I&#x27;ve heard from several people that the same thing happened to them</li>
            <li> I received everything as promised; I am very pleased with this purchase. Highly recommend this seller.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t see a difference from purchase I made at my dermatologist office and I got more for my money . My dermatologist claims that Obagi only sells through doctors and anything else may be old and expired product. Wondering how true that statement is.</li>
            <li> I tried this cleaner and toner (and the entire Obagi treatment) after getting a recommendation from a dermatologist. After following the instructions of the treatment correctly, I saw a steady decline in pigmentation on my face and slowed aging down considerably. I recommend this product and the Obagi treatment, but would suggest you consult a professional to ensure it will work for you.</li>
            <li> I have used tthem for several years, and still love them.&lt;br /&gt;I was really happy to purchase these cleanser and toner that I use everyday at the same tiem at great price.</li>
            <li> i love this product. amazing i even told my friends about it.</li>
            <li> I requested the gentle cleanser for dry to normal skin and received just the opposite. The toner is great, just want to get the correct cleanser.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in my mid thirties and have some minor pigmentation and uneven skin.  I&#x27;ve started the obagi nu derm system and couldn&#x27;t be more satisfied with this product.  I would recommend this to anyone that wants a brighter, more even, tighter (collagen inhibited), and smoother (wrinkle reduction) skin.  Buy it, Buy it!!!!</li>
            <li> I love this duo.  I realized that there are two different kinds of facial cleaners after this set arrived..... I do prefer the foaming cleaner (pink), but this one is also good.  Such a good value-  lasts a solid 6 months.  I have had skin trouble my entire life, and tried everything out there for acne-prone skin.  I still get occasional break-outs (PMS and stress!), but I do believe that this cleaner and toner keep my skin clean, don&#x27;t irritate it and doesn&#x27;t dry it out.  A great product.</li>
            <li> Broke my face out and didn&#x27;t smell like the Obagi I had bought at the dermatologist.  Just wondering if this was the real thing.</li>
            <li> Great product, service and price.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;VE BEEN USING OBAGI PRODUCTS FOR OVER 7 YEARS!! THIS WAS RECOMMENDED BY MY PLASTIC SUREGON FOR ME TO USE AFTER FULL FACE LASER!!! IT WORKS!</li>
            <li> There is Obagi Gentle Cleanser. It is clear with a scent.&lt;br /&gt;And then there is Obagi Foaming Gel. The Foaming Gel is pink.&lt;br /&gt;I prefer the Foaming Gel, but that&#x27;s only personal preference. I don&#x27;t know if one is better than the other.</li>
            <li> This was a fake  product!i know this line very well,and what a revived is not a reall Obagi ,is totally fake</li>
            <li> I love obagi.&lt;br /&gt;Best product for oily skin.</li>
            <li> I have been using my Obagi for around 2 years. I wouldn&#x27;t use anything else on my face. Make sure you use all of the steps to get the result you want.</li>
            <li> Shipped fast. Items as described.</li>
            <li> These are high-end skin products recommended by most cosmetic doctors.  Not cheap but worth the money if yuu want nice skin.</li>
            <li> My wife uses this product and it works great for her skin.  Product always arrives on time and the best price around.  Thanks Amazon</li>
            <li> I know this product before, I just return to use it because it&#x27;s the best I love it and I recommend to use any one</li>
            <li> As some others have reviewed, this product appears to be fake. The cleanser came as a yellow color, toner smells different. Real obagi cleanser is a pinkish orange. Don&#x27;t waste your money by trying to save some. My advice...Just go see your dermatologist and make sure it&#x27;s authentic.</li>
            <li> Best Product ever... No serious side effects, fast results. A definite purchase if experiencing acne and hyper pigmentation. The toner is amazing and the cleanser gives you a natural glow. I also use number 3 and 5</li>
            <li> Good deal and works well. Just use a little cleanser, that is all that is needed. I like the way the toner feels.</li>
            <li> For a 40 something female, this product is great.  My dermatologist introduced me.  It is cheaper to by it online though.</li>
            <li> Good price and arrived promptly.  Like getting this product as a duo. Obagi Nu Derm Cleanser/Toner, 6.7 oz 200 ml 2 bottles</li>
            <li> Just like I wanted.  You nailed it, Admiral.&lt;br /&gt;Just like I wanted.  You nailed it, Admiral.&lt;br /&gt;Just like I wanted.  You nailed it, Admiral.</li>
            <li> Best cleanser and toner on the market. Best product line to do what it says.</li>
            <li> Love this product, face felt so clean</li>
            <li> I use this cleanser and toner before I go to bed and in the morning.  I love the way it makes my skin feel.  Ordering these products through Amazon is so much easier than driving across town and paying a fortune.  I have used less expensive products for my face and they do not clean as good as Obagi.  It arrived on time.</li>
            <li> I really like the toner it makes my face feel cleaner. The two products combined are very gentle on your skin.</li>
            <li> I get many compliments from strangers about my skin. I have been using it for over a year.</li>
            <li> I have been using this for some time a Great find for the price. Thank you  It makes my skin so soft</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used the Obagi product line for several years and have had excellent results.</li>
            <li> This is the best skin care products I ever tried, however is expensive. I was able to save some money buying from here instead buying 1 to 6 from dermatologist.</li>
            <li> Product came in on time and was what was expected. Thanks! Now I am apparently required to keep typing words.</li>
            <li> I  am totally happy with my products. I saved a lot of money as well. This was my first order but it won&#x27;t be my last.</li>
            <li> This is a good mild facial cleanser. I have delicate skin (thin and prone to reactions to perfumes and harsh cleansers).  I wash with this, wipe off with a tissue, and then complete the cleaning with a water wetted face cloth.  These 3 steps ensure a completely clean skin.</li>
            <li> I love Obagi and will reorder another item very soon.</li>
            <li> The toner was okay, but the cleanser was a clear color and smelled like some strange chemical. The original obagi cleanser was pink and had a mild pleasant smell to it, made you want to put it on your face. I Will Not be buying that again. I&#x27;ll go back to my spa and pay full. Price to keep from smelling that garbage.</li>
            <li> Product as described. Thank You!</li>
            <li> these work so well together. I just love them</li>
            <li> This product has worked for me and love the result.  I also love the price a amazon which without that would be hard for me to get.  It is a product that needs dermatologist follow up at the beginning but if once you know the product works for you best to buy it at amazon for the best price.</li>
            <li> Several years ago, I was diagnosed with melasma (pigment change in face).  My dermatologist at the time recommended the Obagi Nu Derm line.  She unfortunately is no longer in the area and the product is not available over the counter. So, I am forced to find the best price online.  Amazon&#x27;s prices are great - I am able to obtain all the products except one.</li>
            <li> A bit on the old side.  Not fresh</li>
            <li> I did not purchase this from this seller but I can tell you this is an excellent price. I paid almost twice as much. Since I have been using both of these products for 3 months my skin is much clearer and pores are minimal. Would purchase again.</li>
            <li> GREAT PRICE.  LOVE PRODUCT. BEEN USING OVER 10 YEARS.</li>
            <li> This is a widely recommended product and your price is very competitive. .  I have always used this product and it is truly one of the best.</li>
