            <li>I&#x27;m reordering this product as I&#x27;m happy with the results so far.</li>
            <li>Feels very nice on my skin but too early to rate</li>
            <li>This serum goes on smoothe and absorbs easily.</li>
            <li>its a work if art really works very pleased with my results.</li>

            <li>I have noticed fine lines disappeared and the wrinkles are not that noticeable.  </li>
            <li>Noticed improvement in fine lines and the brightness of my skin.</li>
            <li>It works fine twice a day.</li>
            <li>I do notice the fine lines are disappearing.  </li>
            <li>and I already notice a difference on fine lines.  </li>
            <li>My skin is smoother and my fine lines around my eyes are going away.</li>
            <li>This has a super silky consistency and makes your face look fantastic!  </li>
            <li>but as I am pleased with the results so far I am re-ordering in the hope my age spots will fade even more!</li>
            <li>oh and the seller included a wonderful little bonus lip balm as well</li>
            <li>My skin feels tighter and smooth.</li>
            <li>but the way it goes on is so smooth I can tell my skin loves it.</li>
            <li>It makes your skin so smooth.  </li>

            <li>So far so good.</li>
            <li>Thanks for such a great product!!!</li>
            <li>I love the dropper as it helps easily control how much you get out of the bottle and is easy to use.</li>
            <li>This one goes on smoothly, easily and absorbs quickly leaving the skin feeling hydrated, supple, smooth and refreshed.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Loved it the first few days, soaked in and made my skin feel great.</li>
            <li>I LOVE THIS STUFF, ORDERED 3 BOTTLES FIRST TIME AND SHARED ONE WITH A FRIEND.</li>
            <li>I love this stuff - does exactly what it says.</li>
            <li>So far - I am very pleased.</li>
            <li>Great product, gentle on my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I put it on after my face is clean and damp.</li>
            <li>I have tried several and so far this one is the best.</li>
            <li>Skin was much smoother and fine lines disappearing!</li>
            <li>For this first time in quite a while.......I hold my head UP and have a SMILE on my face!!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m pretty sure she&#x27;s ordered her first!</li>
            <li>I wanted it to like it and had such a good review.</li>
            <li>I did experience break outs, but this is true of any change in face product.</li>
            <li>and hopefully my full blown results will be what I expect that they will be.</li>
            <li>My skin is much smoother and healthy feeling.</li>
            <li>Not even sure if the product is real.  </li>
            <li>, I can&#x27;t wait for the full 6 weeks to see what happens.</li>
            <li>So far I am loving this.  </li>
            <li>only been using this one week and the difference in my skin is amazing, I just love it and my skin is glowing - it can only get better!</li>
            <li>Excellent for dry skin issues, clear with no odor.</li>
            <li>arrived quickly</li>
            <li>This is a good product, but I like the one in the green bottle better.</li>
            <li>Fantastic product, you can really feel it tightening your skin!</li>
            <li>I am delighted by this and plan on using this product for a very long time.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this as part of your beauty routine!!!</li>
            <li>I noticed a difference within the first two days of using it!</li>
            <li>and I really feel it is making a difference to both fine lines and deeper wrinkles.  </li>
            <li>You do have to follow the directions and use a moisturizer on after using this serum because your skin does feel tighter afterward, but it is well worth the effort.</li>
            <li>I was using a different brand I really liked.</li>
            <li>I have been using Yeouth for 3 weeks now and can honestly say it has made a difference to my skin, it looks brighter, clearer and younger and</li>
            <li>Let skin air-dry, so the hyaluronic acid can be absorbed.</li>
            <li>I have noticed reduction in the laugh lines after just 2 weeks.</li>
            <li>u  got something  at  worth the  </li>
            <li>I should have researched this before buying, there&#x27;s no evidence that topical application will be effective in any way.</li>
            <li>Really pleased so far. will probably reorder.</li>
            <li>So far I love it.</li>
            <li>I have not used this for very long, but so far it seems pretty good!</li>
            <li>as good as the other one.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sold , been using this product , it does what it says right to the point</li>
            <li>Saw &amp; felt the difference right away.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve had positive comments from people since using it!</li>
            <li>This is an amazing product,after using it for two weeks now,I have noticed my lines starting to decrease and skin feels tighter and brighter,however I have to be honest that it did dry my skin out a bit and broke out the first couple days</li>
            <li>Such a great product - every cell seems to benefit &amp; will thank you for adding this to your facial regime.</li>
            <li>thank you very much, i will keep you updated on my result</li>
            <li>I have been using various brands of Hyaluronic Acid serums for many years (and I am over 60 yrs</li>
            <li>Within the first week of using this product I can see a difference.</li>
            <li>But going to see how much it really works on the wrinkles!</li>
            <li>I have only been using this product for three days but love it.  </li>
            <li>Was an avid sun worshipper&lt;br /&gt;in</li>
            <li>I have only been using for about a week but am pleased with the product.</li>
            <li>#34;Your skin has more tone, your skin does not look papery and thin.&amp;#34; People who I haven&#x27;t seen for a while say I am looking younger.</li>
            <li>I love how it makes my skin feel and what it is starting to look like.  </li>
            <li>The first time I used it I could feel a difference in my skin.</li>
            <li>Seems to work pretty well.</li>
            <li>The only problem is can&#x27;t get any more at this price.</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>Absolutely brilliant serum, have used lots of different creams and serums in the past but none feel as nice as this on my skin and lasts all day long</li>
            <li>Really reduces the fine wrinkles so far.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t review it the first time I bought this product because I wanted to wait until I had used a whole bottle before commenting.</li>
            <li>Thanks so much!</li>
            <li>I have used other hyaluronic acid products before, this one works much better, worth buying.</li>
            <li>The reviews I read, prior to purchasing hyaluronic acid by Yeouth, are accurate.</li>
            <li>Hyaluronic acid serums are all the rage now and it is because they really work.  </li>
            <li>I really don&#x27;t know what&#x27;s in this stuff</li>
            <li>Much brighter and youthful looking as well.</li>
            <li>Plus the shipping is fast.</li>
            <li>At my age people say &amp;#34;you look well&amp;#34; but the word they would use I think, if it didn&#x27;t sound irrational, is younger.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not what I expected I wanted more results ony face</li>
            <li>and I didn&#x27;t see much</li>
            <li>A very noticeable difference in the texture.  </li>
            <li>It doesnt take much</li>
            <li>I would recommend it to anyone who wants to get rid of their wrinkles.</li>
            <li>This is really making a change in my complexion.</li>
            <li>This product is very drying.</li>
            <li>I received my order in a timely manner and the glass bottles were not broken.</li>
            <li>Having grown up in the southwest, my skin shows my age and the years of intense sunning.  </li>
            <li>Much more about improved than I expected.</li>
            <li>Good enough for the price in comparison to other products.</li>
            <li>This simple little bottle produces amazing results!</li>
            <li>This product seems to be better than the other two I have tried.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had so much skin damage from too much beach time as a kid - then living at high altitude and the sun bounce from the snow.</li>
            <li>Delivered within a couple of days after using for over 1 week I can see the difference in my face.lines under eyes much finer, highly recommended</li>
            <li>Over the years I have used very expensive products with marginal results;  and may happy to say I see RESULTS with YEOUTH!</li>
            <li>excellent product, Ive seen a marked reduction in my age spots and my skin feels soft and my wrinkles are definitely less noticeable!!!!!</li>
            <li>I lost about a 100 pounds quickly and  have deep wrinkles in my cheek.</li>
            <li>and although I live in high humidity, it really helps keep the skin hydrated.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m hoping to see a little bit more result.</li>
            <li>Works well, shrinks my pores to present a smoother appearance,  a little sticky but overall does great.</li>
            <li>It requires application on a clean damp face--so remember not to dry your face after cleansing or you&#x27;ll have to splash it with water, again.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t expect much since I&#x27;m 80 years old</li>
            <li>In just a few days it looked more plumped up and after a few weeks as though I&#x27;d had the most relaxing of holidays.</li>
            <li>This product is topical, as cannot be absorbed by your body/skin, so will not be beneficial.</li>
            <li>I have only been using it for a short time; however I am satisfied with the product so far.</li>
            <li>It is light weight, non greasy, and keeps my skin hydrated, even in the very dry climate where I live.</li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t fade any of the dark spots I have and didn&#x27;t hide any fine  lines .</li>
            <li>only got this a few days ago but have used this and feels nice on the face no irritation  with it  </li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li>im giving it four stars instead of five is because of the dryness and the fact that I  had a couple breakouts only the first two times I applied it,but nothing after that.</li>
            <li>Def see less fine lines.</li>
            <li>The tone is less red and more even.</li>
            <li>Makes my skin feel much smoother, have noticed a slight improvement and will keep using the product as it seems to work better than lots of other products I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using Yeouth hyaluronic acid plus for nearly three weeks now</li>
            <li>old)...</li>
            <li>I am 68 years old and did a lot of sun bathing and tanning bed use.  </li>
            <li>Haven&#x27;t seen drastic improvement yet, but I do have sensitive skin and no irritation occurred so I&#x27;m going to stick with it.</li>
            <li>Have&#x27;nt used it long enough to see much difference, but I really like it a lot !</li>
            <li>people say wow you are so hydrated</li>
            <li>It is still early in the process to review the results of use</li>
            <li>and I have sensitive skin, so  </li>
            <li>and so far I like it...</li>
            <li>early days but can feel it working.</li>
            <li>but, my face feels soft, my neck and chest also.</li>
            <li>It keeps my skin clear and soft.</li>
            <li>I do need face cream afterwards, feels like the skin gets pretty dry.</li>
            <li>I put it on every evening, my skin is softer and more &amp;#34;full&amp;#34; - not as dry and tight.</li>
            <li>Much thicker, need less, pure hyaluronic acid....</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ll be back to normal.</li>
            <li>In a matter of a few days i saw a big differance in the appearnce of fine lines and my skin appeared smoother.</li>
            <li>This product, along with the facial and the moisturizer, have given my complexion new life.</li>
            <li>In dry climates, it would be an absolute necessity!&lt;br /&gt;If</li>
            <li>if  your  not  careful.  </li>
            <li>As a 65year old my expectations were low</li>
            <li>I just received this product and I&#x27;m not happy with it, it is more like a gel then a serum</li>
            <li>the Hyaluronic Acid Serum is exactly what my skin need&#x27;s because it is so dry, and 1 drop goes a long way.....</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t really had a chance to see if it does what it claims, however, it doesn&#x27;t leave clumps when I apply my foundation like other brands have.</li>
            <li>don&#x27;t have it long enough to know what it does, but so far I like it.</li>
            <li>Not sure if I look  years younger but do think it is well worth the money.</li>
            <li>and I didn&#x27;t see a difference in the sun spots I have,but still is a great product compared to a lot of other very expensive products I have used in the past.the only reason</li>
    </ol>

            <li> Feels very nice on my skin but too early to rate</li>

            <li> I have noticed fine lines disappeared and the wrinkles are not that noticeable.  </li>
            <li> Noticed improvement in fine lines and the brightness of my skin.</li>
            <li> It works fine twice a day.</li>
            <li> I do notice the fine lines are disappearing.  </li>
            <li> and I already notice a difference on fine lines.  </li>
            <li> My skin is smoother and my fine lines around my eyes are going away.</li>
            <li> This has a super silky consistency and makes your face look fantastic!  </li>
            <li> but as I am pleased with the results so far I am re-ordering in the hope my age spots will fade even more!</li>
            <li> oh and the seller included a wonderful little bonus lip balm as well</li>
            <li> My skin feels tighter and smooth.</li>
            <li> but the way it goes on is so smooth I can tell my skin loves it.</li>
            <li> It makes your skin so smooth.  </li>
            <li> Makes your face feel smooth while on otherwise no difference at all.</li>
            <li> Goes on smoothly.  </li>
            <li> Fantastic, felt a difference immediately!&lt;br</li>
            <li> Makes my skin really smooth.</li>

            <li> I put it on after my face is clean and damp.</li>
            <li> I have tried several and so far this one is the best.</li>
            <li> Skin was much smoother and fine lines disappearing!</li>
            <li> For this first time in quite a while.......I hold my head UP and have a SMILE on my face!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pretty sure she&#x27;s ordered her first!</li>
            <li> I wanted it to like it and had such a good review.</li>
            <li> I did experience break outs, but this is true of any change in face product.</li>
            <li> and hopefully my full blown results will be what I expect that they will be.</li>
            <li> My skin is much smoother and healthy feeling.</li>
            <li> Not even sure if the product is real.  </li>
            <li> , I can&#x27;t wait for the full 6 weeks to see what happens.</li>
            <li> So far I am loving this.  </li>
            <li> only been using this one week and the difference in my skin is amazing, I just love it and my skin is glowing - it can only get better!</li>
            <li> Excellent for dry skin issues, clear with no odor.</li>
            <li> arrived quickly</li>
            <li> This is a good product, but I like the one in the green bottle better.</li>
            <li> Fantastic product, you can really feel it tightening your skin!</li>
            <li> I am delighted by this and plan on using this product for a very long time.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this as part of your beauty routine!!!</li>
            <li> I noticed a difference within the first two days of using it!</li>
            <li> and I really feel it is making a difference to both fine lines and deeper wrinkles.  </li>
            <li> You do have to follow the directions and use a moisturizer on after using this serum because your skin does feel tighter afterward, but it is well worth the effort.</li>
            <li> I was using a different brand I really liked.</li>
            <li> I have been using Yeouth for 3 weeks now and can honestly say it has made a difference to my skin, it looks brighter, clearer and younger and</li>
            <li> Let skin air-dry, so the hyaluronic acid can be absorbed.</li>
            <li> I have noticed reduction in the laugh lines after just 2 weeks.</li>
            <li> u  got something  at  worth the  </li>
            <li> I should have researched this before buying, there&#x27;s no evidence that topical application will be effective in any way.</li>
            <li> Really pleased so far. will probably reorder.</li>
            <li> So far I love it.</li>
            <li> I have not used this for very long, but so far it seems pretty good!</li>
            <li> as good as the other one.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sold , been using this product , it does what it says right to the point</li>
            <li> Saw &amp; felt the difference right away.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve had positive comments from people since using it!</li>
            <li> This is an amazing product,after using it for two weeks now,I have noticed my lines starting to decrease and skin feels tighter and brighter,however I have to be honest that it did dry my skin out a bit and broke out the first couple days</li>
            <li> Such a great product - every cell seems to benefit &amp; will thank you for adding this to your facial regime.</li>
            <li> thank you very much, i will keep you updated on my result</li>
            <li> I have been using various brands of Hyaluronic Acid serums for many years (and I am over 60 yrs</li>
            <li> Within the first week of using this product I can see a difference.</li>
            <li> But going to see how much it really works on the wrinkles!</li>
            <li> I have only been using this product for three days but love it.  </li>
            <li> Was an avid sun worshipper&lt;br /&gt;in</li>
            <li> I have only been using for about a week but am pleased with the product.</li>
            <li> #34;Your skin has more tone, your skin does not look papery and thin.&amp;#34; People who I haven&#x27;t seen for a while say I am looking younger.</li>
            <li> I love how it makes my skin feel and what it is starting to look like.  </li>
            <li> The first time I used it I could feel a difference in my skin.</li>
            <li> Seems to work pretty well.</li>
            <li> The only problem is can&#x27;t get any more at this price.</li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> Absolutely brilliant serum, have used lots of different creams and serums in the past but none feel as nice as this on my skin and lasts all day long</li>
            <li> Really reduces the fine wrinkles so far.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t review it the first time I bought this product because I wanted to wait until I had used a whole bottle before commenting.</li>
            <li> Thanks so much!</li>
            <li> I have used other hyaluronic acid products before, this one works much better, worth buying.</li>
            <li> The reviews I read, prior to purchasing hyaluronic acid by Yeouth, are accurate.</li>
            <li> Hyaluronic acid serums are all the rage now and it is because they really work.  </li>
            <li> I really don&#x27;t know what&#x27;s in this stuff</li>
            <li> Much brighter and youthful looking as well.</li>
            <li> Plus the shipping is fast.</li>
            <li> At my age people say &amp;#34;you look well&amp;#34; but the word they would use I think, if it didn&#x27;t sound irrational, is younger.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not what I expected I wanted more results ony face</li>
            <li> and I didn&#x27;t see much</li>
            <li> A very noticeable difference in the texture.  </li>
            <li> It doesnt take much</li>
            <li> I would recommend it to anyone who wants to get rid of their wrinkles.</li>
            <li> This is really making a change in my complexion.</li>
            <li> This product is very drying.</li>
            <li> I received my order in a timely manner and the glass bottles were not broken.</li>
            <li> Having grown up in the southwest, my skin shows my age and the years of intense sunning.  </li>
            <li> Much more about improved than I expected.</li>
            <li> Good enough for the price in comparison to other products.</li>
            <li> This simple little bottle produces amazing results!</li>
            <li> This product seems to be better than the other two I have tried.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had so much skin damage from too much beach time as a kid - then living at high altitude and the sun bounce from the snow.</li>
            <li> Delivered within a couple of days after using for over 1 week I can see the difference in my face.lines under eyes much finer, highly recommended</li>
            <li> Over the years I have used very expensive products with marginal results;  and may happy to say I see RESULTS with YEOUTH!</li>
            <li> excellent product, Ive seen a marked reduction in my age spots and my skin feels soft and my wrinkles are definitely less noticeable!!!!!</li>
            <li> I lost about a 100 pounds quickly and  have deep wrinkles in my cheek.</li>
            <li> and although I live in high humidity, it really helps keep the skin hydrated.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m hoping to see a little bit more result.</li>
            <li> Works well, shrinks my pores to present a smoother appearance,  a little sticky but overall does great.</li>
            <li> It requires application on a clean damp face--so remember not to dry your face after cleansing or you&#x27;ll have to splash it with water, again.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t expect much since I&#x27;m 80 years old</li>
            <li> In just a few days it looked more plumped up and after a few weeks as though I&#x27;d had the most relaxing of holidays.</li>
            <li> This product is topical, as cannot be absorbed by your body/skin, so will not be beneficial.</li>
            <li> I have only been using it for a short time; however I am satisfied with the product so far.</li>
            <li> It is light weight, non greasy, and keeps my skin hydrated, even in the very dry climate where I live.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t fade any of the dark spots I have and didn&#x27;t hide any fine  lines .</li>
            <li> only got this a few days ago but have used this and feels nice on the face no irritation  with it  </li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li> im giving it four stars instead of five is because of the dryness and the fact that I  had a couple breakouts only the first two times I applied it,but nothing after that.</li>
            <li> Def see less fine lines.</li>
            <li> The tone is less red and more even.</li>
            <li> Makes my skin feel much smoother, have noticed a slight improvement and will keep using the product as it seems to work better than lots of other products I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Yeouth hyaluronic acid plus for nearly three weeks now</li>
            <li> old)...</li>
            <li> I am 68 years old and did a lot of sun bathing and tanning bed use.  </li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t seen drastic improvement yet, but I do have sensitive skin and no irritation occurred so I&#x27;m going to stick with it.</li>
            <li> Have&#x27;nt used it long enough to see much difference, but I really like it a lot !</li>
            <li> people say wow you are so hydrated</li>
            <li> It is still early in the process to review the results of use</li>
            <li> and I have sensitive skin, so  </li>
            <li> and so far I like it...</li>
            <li> early days but can feel it working.</li>
            <li> but, my face feels soft, my neck and chest also.</li>
            <li> It keeps my skin clear and soft.</li>
            <li> I do need face cream afterwards, feels like the skin gets pretty dry.</li>
            <li> I put it on every evening, my skin is softer and more &amp;#34;full&amp;#34; - not as dry and tight.</li>
            <li> Much thicker, need less, pure hyaluronic acid....</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ll be back to normal.</li>
            <li> In a matter of a few days i saw a big differance in the appearnce of fine lines and my skin appeared smoother.</li>
            <li> This product, along with the facial and the moisturizer, have given my complexion new life.</li>
            <li> In dry climates, it would be an absolute necessity!&lt;br /&gt;If</li>
            <li> if  your  not  careful.  </li>
            <li> As a 65year old my expectations were low</li>
            <li> I just received this product and I&#x27;m not happy with it, it is more like a gel then a serum</li>
            <li> the Hyaluronic Acid Serum is exactly what my skin need&#x27;s because it is so dry, and 1 drop goes a long way.....</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t really had a chance to see if it does what it claims, however, it doesn&#x27;t leave clumps when I apply my foundation like other brands have.</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t have it long enough to know what it does, but so far I like it.</li>
            <li> Not sure if I look  years younger but do think it is well worth the money.</li>
            <li> and I didn&#x27;t see a difference in the sun spots I have,but still is a great product compared to a lot of other very expensive products I have used in the past.the only reason</li>
            <li> I live in a very dry climate and my skin is naturally dry - with this product</li>
            <li> The small bottle came very well packaged</li>
            <li> Have not used long enough to see results</li>
            <li> I am 39 and have normal to somewhat dry skin, never had any skin issues like zits or major skin issues in the past.</li>
            <li> I applied this product once a day following with moisturizer for 2 weeks and found my face really dry.</li>
            <li> It looks as if I wiped my face with toilet tissue.</li>
            <li> but so far I am liking what I am seeing on my face after religiously using the regimen for the past 4 days.</li>
            <li> I took a long time looking at options and reading the reviews before I made this purchase.</li>
            <li> I have wanted to add a serum to my skin regiment for a long time.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s thick,so it goes a  long way.</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t had this product long</li>
            <li> lIt lasts a really long time.</li>
            <li> Seriously I have NEVER had the POSITIVE results from a skin product that I got from YOUTH.</li>
            <li> i have deep wrinkles on face due to stress and sun damage and seeing results there as well.</li>
            <li> Looking forward to the long term results!</li>
            <li> It also takes a lot longer to dry</li>
            <li> It also doesn&#x27;t leave my skin too dry like others.</li>
            <li> I I suffer from really dry skin</li>
            <li> No matter how long you wait for this to dry as soon as you try to apply primer or foundation over it, it just pills up and leaves rubbery liitle blobs all over your face, no thanks.</li>
            <li> and I like it because it absorbs immediately leaving my skin soft and without any heavy greasiness that I&#x27;ve had from other serums .</li>
            <li> My make up wears longer and doesn&#x27;t dry into my wrinkles!</li>
            <li> I will use the medical grade serum that I have previously used at work.</li>
            <li> Definitely less redness and open pores seem reduced.</li>
            <li> It looks brighter, firmer , my pores appear smaller and my lines less noticeable.</li>
            <li> I get bored of things quickly if I don&#x27;t see results.</li>
            <li> I have only used it for  a little over 2 weeks.</li>
            <li> ; perhaps a few drops, is enough to cover the face.</li>
            <li> few months later</li>
            <li> Only had it a few days</li>
            <li> I have only been using it for a few days</li>
            <li> I have only used it for a few days, but I feel the softness and moisture.</li>
            <li> Have only been using YEOUTH serum for a few days but already noticed a difference on the dark spot on my face, has faded some</li>
            <li> I guess that&#x27;s to be expected at 44 with an active outdoor lifestyle.</li>
            <li> a little gos a long way works well</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried other brands and they have made my face break out.  </li>
            <li> Works as expected!</li>
            <li> and I can already see an improvement in my skin tone and dark age spots are beginning to fade.</li>
            <li> NOT  WORTH  </li>
            <li> so I think it will last for at least a month.</li>
            <li> It is thick and has only hyaluronic acid in it.</li>
            <li> The serum smooths out imperfections and gives a slight luminosity to, otherwise, dark tones under the eyes.</li>
            <li> Then, seemed to have less of an effect and not soak in as well.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used a little over half the bottle &amp; see no difference in my skin at all.</li>
            <li> It  takes a little to spread on the face.</li>
            <li> Have used for a couple weeks and a little glow has appeared.</li>
            <li> No more orders and a refund is due; this item is not what it was suppose to do....</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t wear it during the day because it&#x27;s to heavy.</li>
            <li> Goes on smoothly, no sticky feeling.</li>
            <li> it was a waste  of money</li>
            <li> Just a few drops at a time did the trick.</li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s at least doing what it says it does in other words.</li>
            <li> I use a heavy moisturizer anyway, so it goes on as usual after the serum absorbs.</li>
            <li> Works as well as expensive creams that I suspect only contain a small amount of this.</li>
            <li> A small amount</li>
            <li> As I usually break out from products.</li>
            <li> Not sure I like it.&lt;br /&gt;Not</li>
            <li> My poor face has been thru it all this year-Bells Palsy on one side &amp; shingles on the other side.  </li>
            <li> Let me say I hardly ever write reviews, but I will for this product.</li>
            <li> HARD  </li>
            <li> and  at  least  u  felt  </li>
            <li> Holds moisture so my face doesn&#x27;t feel dry all day even in this extremely cold weather.</li>
            <li> Like I said it&#x27;s very thick and is hard to get out of the dropper.</li>
            <li> This serum is very thick.  </li>
            <li> That caused it to be very thick...</li>
            <li> she let me in on her secret and  </li>
            <li> In some cancers, hyaluronan (hyaluronic acid) levels correlate well with malignancy and poor prognosis.</li>
            <li> Sadly the seller has raised the price by several dollars!!! :(</li>
            <li> I have to use a dry wash cloth to whip the crap of my face before applying my make up and</li>
            <li> But in just 4 days my wrinkles are less noticeable!!!!!</li>
            <li> Use a very, very thin layer.  </li>
            <li> This brand has a fishy odor that is terrible.</li>
            <li> So needless to say I need to start ordering YOUTH by the barrel!!!!!</li>
            <li> Very disappointed !!!</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I love this product! Will purchase again.</li>
            <li> After I washed my face,.I used this serum and it goes on very smooth and absorbs nicely. My skin feels tighter and smooth. Would recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Hyaluronic acid serums are all the rage now and it is because they really work.  This one goes on smoothly, easily and absorbs quickly leaving the skin feeling hydrated, supple, smooth and refreshed.&lt;br /&gt;It works well under mineral powder or alone.  I love it, recommend it  and although I live in high humidity, it really helps keep the skin hydrated.  In dry climates, it would be an absolute necessity!&lt;br /&gt;If the way your skin looks and feels is important, this is an excellent product.</li>
            <li> I wear this serum every day underneath my sunscreen. It is light weight, non greasy, and keeps my skin hydrated, even in the very dry climate where I live. My skin even feels a bit firmer when I wear it.  I use the Yeouth Hyaluronuc Acid, Peptide &amp; Vitamin E serum at night and have been very happy with the results of both products. Both Yeouth products will be a permanent part of my skin care regime from now on.</li>
            <li> Received this morning-having ordered only yesterday. I used it and immediately noticed a firming/smoothness . Absolutely brilliant and will save me spending at beauty salons!</li>
            <li> Great product, gentle on my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had so much skin damage from too much beach time as a kid - then living at high altitude and the sun bounce from the snow. Yikes, what was I thinking!? And smoking cigarettes too. Skin killers for sure. YEOUTH is working wonders. I really don&#x27;t know what&#x27;s in this stuff but the way it goes on is so smooth I can tell my skin loves it. Wish they sold it in 55 gal drums so I could soak the entire body in it. Working wonders.</li>
            <li> Makes my face feel better firmer and more smoother. haven&#x27;t noticed reduction of wrinkles yet. I lost about a 100 pounds quickly and  have deep wrinkles in my cheek. I am 50.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Yeouth hyaluronic acid plus for nearly three weeks now and I can already see an improvement in my skin tone and dark age spots are beginning to fade.</li>
            <li> Let me say I hardly ever write reviews, but I will for this product. I took a long time looking at options and reading the reviews before I made this purchase. I didn&#x27;t review it the first time I bought this product because I wanted to wait until I had used a whole bottle before commenting. What I can say is that I bought a second and third bottle. I have noticed an improvement in my skin&#x27;s brightness more than anything. The tone is less red and more even. Much brighter and youthful looking as well. I have seen the lines around my eyes diminish but not disappear. I guess that&#x27;s to be expected at 44 with an active outdoor lifestyle. I have had friends ask me what I am doing because my skin looks so much better. I have also recommended this product to them. You do have to follow the directions and use a moisturizer on after using this serum because your skin does feel tighter afterward, but it is well worth the effort. I use a heavy moisturizer anyway, so it goes on as usual after the serum absorbs. I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> This serum is very thick.  I was using a different brand I really liked. This one was on sale so I thought why not. It  takes a little to spread on the face. Like I said it&#x27;s very thick and is hard to get out of the dropper. It also takes a lot longer to dry and I don&#x27;t get the plumping of skin and It also feels sticky on the skin .I don&#x27;t wear it during the day because it&#x27;s to heavy. I won&#x27;t be repurchase this serum.</li>
            <li> Good product....I&#x27;ve been using for 3 weeks....my skin is smoother and feels more plump?....I&#x27;m mid 40&#x27;s so this added to my beauty regimen has been a plus....you can&#x27;t beat for the price!</li>
            <li> Made my skin beautiful</li>
            <li> This is a 5 star product!  Although my review page had NO stars to pick! My eyes don&#x27;t water &amp; it doesn&#x27;t sting or stink!  My poor face has been thru it all this year-Bells Palsy on one side &amp; shingles on the other side.  My face looks kind of lop-sided to me-others don&#x27;t notice it.  This serum has helped with the lop-sided look. I hope it keeps working and I&#x27;ll be back to normal. Thanks for a great product!</li>
            <li> I love this product.  No complaints at all</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used a little over half the bottle &amp; see no difference in my skin at all. Lines &amp; wrinkles have not changed.</li>
            <li> Have used for a couple weeks and a little glow has appeared. Hopefully the next couple of weeks. Will show more results.</li>
            <li> This serum goes on smoothe and absorbs easily. I have been using various brands of Hyaluronic Acid serums for many years (and I am over 60 yrs old)...If you want to truly help your aging skin, use this product along with your daily skin care regime.</li>
            <li> love this its a great product!!!!</li>
            <li> Great product.  Matches advertising.&lt;br /&gt;Very good price.</li>
            <li> This is an amazing product,after using it for two weeks now,I have noticed my lines starting to decrease and skin feels tighter and brighter,however I have to be honest that it did dry my skin out a bit and broke out the first couple days and I didn&#x27;t see a difference in the sun spots I have,but still is a great product compared to a lot of other very expensive products I have used in the past.the only reason im giving it four stars instead of five is because of the dryness and the fact that I  had a couple breakouts only the first two times I applied it,but nothing after that. Good product.</li>
            <li> Great stuff really does work</li>
            <li> This serum has made my skin glow!!! I highly recommend this as part of your beauty routine!!!</li>
            <li> Second product I have tried from this manufacturer.&lt;br /&gt;Just as good as the other one. I am hooked.</li>
            <li> Feels good putting on!</li>
            <li> Great consistency, works quickly. My red spots are fading</li>
            <li> Delivered within a couple of days after using for over 1 week I can see the difference in my face.lines under eyes much finer, highly recommended</li>
            <li> I have wanted to add a serum to my skin regiment for a long time.  This was a great choice.  It makes your skin so smooth.  I also like to use it at night on the back of my hands.  Wonderful product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m reordering this product as I&#x27;m happy with the results so far.</li>
            <li> Great ! Will continue using</li>
            <li> I was very impressed by this product</li>
            <li> I have used this for a couple of months and I like it. Tried another Hyaluronic but this is my favorite. Easy to apply, feels smooth. I do need face cream afterwards, feels like the skin gets pretty dry. I do believe that some of my fine lines has gotten more invisible. I&#x27;m hoping to see a little bit more result.</li>
            <li> This is the best hyaluronic acid I have ever used! I&#x27;ve tried other brands and they have made my face break out.  This has a super silky consistency and makes your face look fantastic!  Also, their customer service is amazing!  Definitely recommend!</li>
            <li> Good product. It helps in keeping the aging face aging lines to appear softer.</li>
            <li> Great product. Goes on smoothly, no sticky feeling.</li>
            <li> a little gos a long way works well</li>
            <li> Excellent quality...couldn&#x27;t be happier!!!&lt;br /&gt;Fast delivery as well.  Thank you!</li>
            <li> Did not see any difference. Been using it for a couple of months.</li>
            <li> Brilliant I noticed results straight away I get bored of things quickly if I don&#x27;t see results. I ran out a week ago and have noticed the difference in my skin so am on with my next order</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t have it long enough to know what it does, but so far I like it. I like the way my skin feels</li>
            <li> I have been using Yeouth for 3 weeks now and can honestly say it has made a difference to my skin, it looks brighter, clearer and younger and I am definitely going to be purchasing it again.</li>
            <li> I have not used this for very long, but so far it seems pretty good! I do use another moisturiser on top and I when I wash in the morning my face is still creamy with both products!</li>
            <li> Within the first week of using this product I can see a difference. It arrived in a timely manner and I will be ordering it again as needed</li>
            <li> This product is awesome, everyone wants to know what I am using. Love it!!!!!</li>
            <li> I have used medical grade hyaluronic acid serums for several years. This brand has a fishy odor that is terrible. I will not buy this brand again. I will use the medical grade serum that I have previously used at work.</li>
            <li> Works as well as expensive creams that I suspect only contain a small amount of this. Excellent for dry skin issues, clear with no odor.</li>
            <li> Fantastic product, you can really feel it tightening your skin!</li>
            <li> This product has done more for the texture of my skin than any product I have used.  I am 68 years old and did a lot of sun bathing and tanning bed use.  This product has been amazing.</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing! Plus the shipping is fast.</li>
            <li> Immediately my skins felt firmer. In just a few days it looked more plumped up and after a few weeks as though I&#x27;d had the most relaxing of holidays. At my age people say &amp;#34;you look well&amp;#34; but the word they would use I think, if it didn&#x27;t sound irrational, is younger. Val</li>
            <li> This product is topical, as cannot be absorbed by your body/skin, so will not be beneficial.</li>
            <li> Very happy with this product I purchased this item because a coworker uses it and has amazing skin she let me in on her secret and  im more than happy I made the choice to try it ....its a work if art really works very pleased with my results.</li>
            <li> The reviews I read, prior to purchasing hyaluronic acid by Yeouth, are accurate. A small amount; perhaps a few drops, is enough to cover the face. The serum smooths out imperfections and gives a slight luminosity to, otherwise, dark tones under the eyes. It requires application on a clean damp face--so remember not to dry your face after cleansing or you&#x27;ll have to splash it with water, again. Let skin air-dry, so the hyaluronic acid can be absorbed. The small bottle came very well packaged so even if it broke in transit (it IS glass) the fluid would not leak from the box.</li>
            <li> Use a very, very thin layer.  Otherwise the moisturizer will sit on top, move, and peel off.  Haven&#x27;t seen drastic improvement yet, but I do have sensitive skin and no irritation occurred so I&#x27;m going to stick with it.</li>
            <li> I like it. But going to see how much it really works on the wrinkles!</li>
            <li> I love this product!! Compliments on my skin all the time</li>
            <li> Great Product !!! Pricing Fair</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not what I expected I wanted more results ony face and I didn&#x27;t see much</li>
            <li> Love this stuff. I noticed a difference in 2 weeks!</li>
            <li> This Hyaluronic Acid face serum is amazing! I put it on after my face is clean and damp. I have noticed reduction in the laugh lines after just 2 weeks. I put it on every evening, my skin is softer and more &amp;#34;full&amp;#34; - not as dry and tight. Thanks so much! oh and the seller included a wonderful little bonus lip balm as well that is very nice.</li>
            <li> I had an abrasion on my forehead and applied this twice a day. Amazing results!!!</li>
            <li> Makes my skin feel much smoother, have noticed a slight improvement and will keep using the product as it seems to work better than lots of other products I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> Makes your face feel smooth while on otherwise no difference at all.</li>
            <li> Excellent Product! My skin looks great after using for a month.</li>
            <li> I have only been using this product for three days but love it.  Goes on smoothly.  Soaks into skin within seconds.  Not greasy or oily. To soon for final approval but will check back soon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A few months later and I love the product.  I have noticed fine lines disappeared and the wrinkles are not that noticeable.  I would  recommend this product.</li>
            <li> No matter how long you wait for this to dry as soon as you try to apply primer or foundation over it, it just pills up and leaves rubbery liitle blobs all over your face, no thanks. I&#x27;ll stick to my coconut oil with orange essential drops in it.</li>
            <li> Took a while, perhaps two weeks, for me to notice a difference in my skin. Definitely less redness and open pores seem reduced. Will definitely buy again</li>
            <li> Have&#x27;nt used it long enough to see much difference, but I really like it a lot !</li>
            <li> Great product, noticed the difference in a week, will Deffo get more &#x27;</li>
            <li> I ordered  this product as an experiment. I&#x27;m 52 and getting a bit fed up with my loss of skin tone and increasing wrinkles. I have been using this product for 2 weeks now and can tell a definite difference in my skin. It looks brighter, firmer , my pores appear smaller and my lines less noticeable. It has boosted my confidence. Astrid.</li>
            <li> Fantastic, felt a difference immediately!&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve had positive comments from people since using it!</li>
            <li> It made me break out in a rash all over my face and neck. Im suspect that this is 100% hyaluronic acid.</li>
            <li> Only had it a few days</li>
            <li> Works as expected! Thank you for having a product that does what it says it will do!</li>
            <li> Love this product.  Makes my skin feel so good.</li>
            <li> NOT  WORTH  THE  MONEY.  THIS IS  A  MONEY  GRABBER  THAT S  ALL.  if  you  are  going to  buy  it  ,  it  should  have  atleast  four  ounces  for  paying  customers  money ,  well  this  was  only  1 oz  and  at  least  u  felt  like  u  got something  at  worth the  in  the  bathroom  mirror  ,  however ,  this  YEOUTH  SERUM  its  called  is  practically  gel  water  and lasting  effects  is  for  one  day  ,  and  its  will  be  waxing  on  your  face  if  your  not  careful.  so  i  have  to  say  NO  ,  THIS  IS  NOT  THE  ONE .  SAVE  YOUR  HARD  EARNED  MONEY.</li>
            <li> This stuff is awesome.  Makes my skin really smooth.</li>
            <li> Love this Product.  I have recommended to others and they say they love it too.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t see a difference.</li>
            <li> Saw no difference in my husbands arms.  I would have to say it does not work.</li>
            <li> Leaves skin feeling soft,smooth and definitely minimises pores</li>
            <li> I applied this product once a day following with moisturizer for 2 weeks and found my face really dry. I had to apply moisturizer several times a day to prevent flaking. Please educate me on this,  either my face is so dehydrated that this serum is helping to suck up more of my moisturizer or.... In addition, I broke out 3 pimples which I have not seen for years. I am 39 and have normal to somewhat dry skin, never had any skin issues like zits or major skin issues in the past. I am from Hawaii so I have been under the sun a lot when I was younger. Anyways I can not return it. It will cost a lot to return since I am in APO address. I wanted it to like it and had such a good review.</li>
            <li> This serum is amazing. My skin is tighter and smoother. I have used other hyaluronic acid products before, this one works much better, worth buying.</li>
            <li> Although i had the one with plus vitamin c which was fantastic so must this one be</li>
            <li> Great product,will defiantly buy again</li>
            <li> I have tried many anti-aging products but can honestly say that this is the best ever. I have only been using mine for about 3 weeks but can see a difference already. I am 71 but receive many compliments on how I look and these have increased since using this product. I hope that I&#x27;m never without it. It&#x27;s a must for me.</li>
            <li> This is probably the best thing that I have ever used on my face!  I could not beleive that one product could make just a difference.  It asorbs well and instantly could see a difference!</li>
            <li> I LOVE THIS STUFF, ORDERED 3 BOTTLES FIRST TIME AND SHARED ONE WITH A FRIEND. SHE LOVES IT ALSO. SO THIS TIME I BOUGHT 8 AND WE SPLIT ORDER. WOULD RECOMMEND TO ANYONE, THEN ORDERED 8 MORE AND SHARED AGAIN</li>
            <li> This product is the only product I have ever used that lives up to its hype. It really does work and my skin looks and feels great. I am so impressed and I believe this product has knocked years off me.</li>
            <li> This is great stuff! I&#x27;ve even ordered some more since I&#x27;ve noticed a distinct&lt;br /&gt;change in my skin... others have commented on how good my skin looks!&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m soon to be 64 so I need all the help I can get. Was an avid sun worshipper&lt;br /&gt;in my youth...)-:  Thank you for letting my have the chance to use this  -</li>
            <li> Have been using the product for a month. Noticed improvement in fine lines and the brightness of my skin. Will continue to use.</li>
            <li> only been using this one week and the difference in my skin is amazing, I just love it and my skin is glowing - it can only get better!</li>
            <li> Makes my skin so smooth.  A very noticeable difference in the texture.  A great product.&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Just got this , I love it , I&#x27;m sold , been using this product , it does what it says right to the point</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t expect much since I&#x27;m 80 years old but I did notice a smoothest texture to my skin after about two weeks . It didn&#x27;t fade any of the dark spots I have and didn&#x27;t hide any fine  lines .</li>
            <li> I have had this product for a couple weeks ,very satisfied, skin looks better and age spots on forearms are reduced. i have deep wrinkles on face due to stress and sun damage and seeing results there as well.</li>
            <li> It works fine twice a day. Good enough for the price in comparison to other products.</li>
            <li> I love this serum...after cleansing, i use a Vitamin C serum followed by this product, then my daytime moisturizer.  My makeup glides on and has a &#x27;dewey&#x27; look.  I get compliments on my skin often...I use it am and pm...</li>
            <li> I have been using this for about six weeks now and I like it because it absorbs immediately leaving my skin soft and without any heavy greasiness that I&#x27;ve had from other serums .</li>
            <li> I love it!  I use it with my MyPen.</li>
            <li> something that helps with acne</li>
            <li> Magical product.  By the second application, I could see and feel a difference in overall tone and appearance.  I have been applying 2x a day for 4 days and am in love with this product!</li>
            <li> Delivery was prompt and product was well packaged.  This simple little bottle produces amazing results! I use it daily and wouldn&#x27;t be without it.</li>
            <li> As a 65year old my expectations were low but as I am pleased with the results so far I am re-ordering in the hope my age spots will fade even more!</li>
            <li> The Product is as described.  I read the reviews and use my Aveda Spray Toner and then apply.  I have not noticed any change in the appearance of my sun damage or skin.  I did experience break outs, but this is true of any change in face product.</li>
            <li> So far I am happy with the results and the price is good.  I will keep ordering the product in the future.  Thank you Gina</li>
            <li> Although I&#x27;ve just started using this product, I&#x27; m hoping for and expecting wonderful results and plan to reorder very soon.</li>
            <li> Very light on my face!! Love</li>
            <li> Nice packaging and a great price.  I have only been using for about a week but am pleased with the product.</li>
            <li> Great stuffðŸ˜€comments from my family include, &amp;#34;Your skin has more tone, your skin does not look papery and thin.&amp;#34; People who I haven&#x27;t seen for a while say I am looking younger. I do feel the difference it has made to my skin.</li>
            <li> This product seems to be better than the other two I have tried.  Much thicker, need less, pure hyaluronic acid....nothing more.  Saw &amp; felt the difference right away.  Will order again &amp; would recommend.</li>
            <li> I saw immediate results! Skin was much smoother and fine lines disappearing!</li>
            <li> great product and it get results</li>
            <li> Just received it, can&#x27;t wait to try it!</li>
            <li> I have tried several and so far this one is the best.</li>
            <li> Have not used long enough to see results</li>
            <li> I saw no improvement in my skin at all.</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t seen any changes yet may purchase again but not now</li>
            <li> Great product. My skin looks great</li>
            <li> Absolutely brilliant serum, have used lots of different creams and serums in the past but none feel as nice as this on my skin and lasts all day long</li>
            <li> Have been using it for 6 weeks and the liver spot on my face has definately faded and is not so noticeable.</li>
            <li> does not seem to work on wrinkles</li>
            <li> I love how it makes my skin feel and what it is starting to look like.  Really reduces the fine wrinkles so far. I have only used it for  a little over 2 weeks.</li>
            <li> I have only been using it for a few days but I already see a difference. It doesnt take much so I think it will last for at least a month. I am going to wait another week and if I continue to see results I will be ordering more. I love the dropper as it helps easily control how much you get out of the bottle and is easy to use.</li>
            <li> Just love this product. I live in a very dry climate and my skin is naturally dry - with this product my skin is instantly supple and hydrated! My make up wears longer and doesn&#x27;t dry into my wrinkles!</li>
            <li> My skin feels wonderfully smooth! Very happy with this product!!</li>
            <li> I like the price point, but when it was delivered, we had frezzing temperatures . That caused it to be very thick...and it still is . Can that ruin its potency?</li>
            <li> I love this stuff!!! The first time I used it I could feel a difference in my skin. I would buy this again</li>
            <li> Great product and delivery!!</li>
            <li> Very nice serum.  Have been receiving compliments on my skin since I started using it.</li>
            <li> Love the way it feels when applied and I can see a difference in the firmness of my neck already.</li>
            <li> Would recommend and buy again.</li>
            <li> Truthfully, I cannot say enough good things about this product, which is why I am purchasing it again. I even recommended that my dermatologist start selling it to his clients.&lt;br /&gt;Since I&#x27;ve been using it my skin looks fuller and I definitely have been looking younger! I promise...this is a genuine customer review.</li>
            <li> Works well, shrinks my pores to present a smoother appearance,  a little sticky but overall does great.</li>
            <li> Was very happy when it was delivered when i was told it would be. I am pleased with how it makes my skin feel</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t  do anything  for wrinkles  it was a waste  of money</li>
            <li> Seems to work pretty well. It&#x27;s thick,so it goes a  long way. I would recommend it to anyone who wants to get rid of their wrinkles.</li>
            <li> clean beautiful skin, and people say wow you are so hydrated you skin is so plump!</li>
            <li> Just received the  Yeouth serum and have applied it twice. Feels very nice on my skin but too early to rate it&#x27;s efficacy. Will be happy to provide an update in a couple of weeks.</li>
            <li> I rarely leave reviews,but I love this product!!!!! I&#x27;m 64 and have lovely skin,(yes) with some deep wrinkles around my eyes. But in just 4 days my wrinkles are less noticeable!!!!! I have very fair skin,but this product does not give me any problems!  So a gave it 5 stars!! Sadly the seller has raised the price by several dollars!!! :(</li>
            <li> Very nice, exactly as posted.</li>
            <li> the Hyaluronic Acid Serum is exactly what my skin need&#x27;s because it is so dry, and 1 drop goes a long way.....</li>
            <li> So far so good. Have only been using it a week but have one comment that I looked well rested. Will update after 30 days.</li>
            <li> I was amazed that delivery was made in two days from date of purchase. Based on reviews of this product I could not wait to get started using it. It is still early in the process to review the results of use but so far I am liking what I am seeing on my face after religiously using the regimen for the past 4 days. I do combine hyaluronic acid with vitamin C oil for best results as suggested. Keep in touch and hopefully my full blown results will be what I expect that they will be.</li>
            <li> Great. I love the way it makes my face feel. Holds moisture so my face doesn&#x27;t feel dry all day even in this extremely cold weather.</li>
            <li> Great,my skin looks firmer and smoother.</li>
            <li> This stuff is great.  I use this under my makeup.  I do notice the fine lines are disappearing.  I will be purchasing this in the future</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t seen any results yet.</li>
            <li> I have only used the vitamin c today will let you know later.</li>
            <li> Very nice product. Did not break me out!!! Will definitely continue to use this product!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for over a week now...I love the way my skin feels..</li>
            <li> only got this a few days ago but have used this and feels nice on the face no irritation  with it  and I have sensitive skin, so  going  to keep on using it and see if it does  what it says .</li>
            <li> I should have researched this before buying, there&#x27;s no evidence that topical application will be effective in any way. It&#x27;s used by dermatologists by injecting it or in cataract surgery.  In some cancers, hyaluronan (hyaluronic acid) levels correlate well with malignancy and poor prognosis. Hyaluronan is, thus, often used as a tumor marker for prostate and breast cancer. It may also be used to monitor the progression of the disease.</li>
            <li> Absolutely an amazing product! I noticed a difference within the first two days of using it! My skin is much smoother and healthy feeling. I have definitely incorporated this into my daily routine.</li>
            <li> Wonderful product! Love it! Great quality!</li>
            <li> Hands down, this is among the best cosmetic items I&#x27;ve ever used. Although the enclosed brochure informed me that I would need to wait eight weeks for results, I now assume that this caution referred to diminishing wrinkles and shrinking pores. To my surprise, after just three days of using this serum morning and night, I found that the age spots (I&#x27;m 68) had all but disappeared from my hands, and the skin on my face, neck and decolletage was noticeably smoother. Just a few drops at a time did the trick. I especially appreciate that I can use the serum in conjunction with my regular cleansing and moisturizing routine. My only quibble is that the dropper applicator takes some balancing to use on the backs of my hands. I look forward to Kev/Go/Yeouth formulating a hyaluronic acid moisturizing hand cream.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t noticed any improvements since beginning this product.</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t seen any results yet?</li>
            <li> Use this daily. Def see less fine lines.</li>
            <li> thank you very much, i will keep you updated on my result</li>
            <li> This is really making a change in my complexion. Love this product and will reorder ASAP.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff - does exactly what it says.</li>
            <li> excellent product, Ive seen a marked reduction in my age spots and my skin feels soft and my wrinkles are definitely less noticeable!!!!!</li>
            <li> I have only been using it for a short time; however I am satisfied with the product so far. Looking forward to the long term results!</li>
            <li> I love this product it works well on my skin. The only problem is can&#x27;t get any more at this price. I give it a 5 star rating</li>
            <li> no reason to pay more as this product has given me perfect skin</li>
            <li> LOVE THIS PRODUCT!!!!!! My skin never looked better! I have tried many , many serums and creams but this is truly amazing.In a matter of a few days i saw a big differance in the appearnce of fine lines and my skin appeared smoother. Its a must try product!!!!!</li>
            <li> Great product, feels great on my skin, a must have product!!!</li>
            <li> Super Great Product Love It!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had the product for about a week now and so far I like it...I can feel a tightness (not a drying tightness though) around the area I put it so it&#x27;s at least doing what it says it does in other words. I will have to see the effects later on as I continue to use it</li>
            <li> The wife had me order and she is very happy with product.........and that makes me happy.</li>
            <li> So far - I am very pleased. My product arrived in 2days. Amazing. I have only used it twice but I swear my face feels softer.  Worried about sensitivity. As I usually break out from products. Hoping for the best. Thank you.</li>
            <li> This product is very drying. Not sure I like it.&lt;br /&gt;Not sure anything drying could be could for your skin</li>
            <li> If you have oily skin proceed causiouly because this serum clogged my pores and caused pimples.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t really had a chance to see if it does what it claims, however, it doesn&#x27;t leave clumps when I apply my foundation like other brands have. It also doesn&#x27;t leave my skin too dry like others. I received my order in a timely manner and the glass bottles were not broken. So far so good.</li>
            <li> Having been using this for a week or so I love it!  Very easy to apply and I really feel it is making a difference to both fine lines and deeper wrinkles.  Already ordering another bottle to ensure I don&#x27;t run out!</li>
            <li> Just purchased it because I saw amazing before after results on my cousin who&#x27;s been battling some wrinkles that appeared on her forehead. Started fading after 2.5 weeks!!! And she rubs it on all day!</li>
            <li> I will continue to USE and ENDORSE thus product!! I can&#x27;t even begin to tell you what this product has done for my skin. For this first time in quite a while.......I hold my head UP and have a SMILE on my face!! My skin&lt;br /&gt; GLOWS!! Everyone thinks I had a chemical peel!! NO...YOUTH **remember that name!! Now go get you some. Seriously I have NEVER had the POSITIVE results from a skin product that I got from YOUTH. NOT ONLY ON FACE......I mixed it hand lotion &amp; got the same effect of my arms &amp; legs!! So needless to say I need to start ordering YOUTH by the barrel!!!!! THANK YOU for changing the way I carry myself...face FORWARD shoulders squared &amp; PROUD of my BEAUTIFUL SKIN!!</li>
            <li> I just received this product and I&#x27;m not happy with it, it is more like a gel then a serum and then it dries on my face in clumps.  It looks as if I wiped my face with toilet tissue. I have to use a dry wash cloth to whip the crap of my face before applying my make up and even then I still have to continue to wipe it off.  Not even sure if the product is real.  Don&#x27;t buy!</li>
            <li> Love this product.  It is a non greasy moisturizer which absorbs almost immediately.  It has only been 2 days and I already notice a difference on fine lines.  Will definately buy again when I run out.</li>
            <li> Felt nice on my skin but I did not see any appreciable difference in my skin after using for 2 months.</li>
            <li> Love!!! Thanks for such a great product!!!</li>
            <li> I have only used it for a few days, but I feel the softness and moisture. Time will tell.</li>
            <li> Have only been using YEOUTH serum for a few days but already noticed a difference on the dark spot on my face, has faded some, I can&#x27;t wait for the full 6 weeks to see what happens. I use the serum morning and night and then apply moisture cream.Really pleased so far. will probably reorder.</li>
            <li> This product, along with the facial and the moisturizer, have given my complexion new life. My face is smoother and softer, and looks younger than it has in years.</li>
            <li> Can feel the difference in my skin, its softer</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t know yet. See no improvement.</li>
            <li> Love it I will buy again.</li>
            <li> Excellent with fast delivery!  Thanks!</li>
            <li> I have only just started using my product I I suffer from really dry skin and I drink loads of water since starting using the secrum my skin has a glow and feels so much better</li>
            <li> Loved the feel of this on my face. Not sure if I look  years younger but do think it is well worth the money. I have very sensitive skin and it feels like velvet when I put this on.</li>
            <li> early days but can feel it working. arrived quickly</li>
            <li> Very disappointed !!! Not at all what it was suppose to do....No more orders and a refund is due; this item is not what it was suppose to do....</li>
            <li> This product works so good and love it</li>
            <li> Just started using it.  Hope it works as well as you say @</li>
            <li> No one&#x27;s saying &#x27;you look younger&#x27;.</li>
            <li> Very good will keep using it.</li>
            <li> Cannot believe how my skin looks and feels since using this product, makin brighter and softer.</li>
            <li> So far I am loving this.  It has made my skin nice and and smooth.  Lines already look better around the eyes</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing!  After one day I can see it working. My skin is smoother and my fine lines around my eyes are going away. It&#x27;s only been a couple of days but I can see  results already. I can&#x27;t wait to see how great I look after 6 weeks.</li>
            <li> I love looking good being wrinkle free wish it came in a body lotion I do use the serium on my body than cocoa butter but b nice if it were and all in one lotion I also mix hydrologic serium with vitium c serum</li>
            <li> Lovely fresh feel to skin after using.&lt;br /&gt;Will buy again</li>
            <li> My mother in law was in my bathroom and came out with this bottle.  She asked &amp;#34;is this why you don&#x27;t have any crows feet?&amp;#34;  I&#x27;d like to think it&#x27;s good genes and good skin care, but I think this has something to to with it. I like it and am on my second bottle.  I&#x27;m pretty sure she&#x27;s ordered her first!</li>
            <li> This is a superb product. When I need more I will buy it. It is thick and has only hyaluronic acid in it. I use it every day</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t had this product long but, my face feels soft, my neck and chest also. I do feel I see smoother skin. So far I love it.</li>
            <li> Such a great product - every cell seems to benefit &amp; will thank you for adding this to your facial regime.</li>
            <li> This is a good product, but I like the one in the green bottle better. lIt lasts a really long time.</li>
            <li> I am still using this product and it definitely makes my skin softer and smoother</li>
            <li> I think it  made a difference in the texture and tightness of my skin. I would buy it&lt;br /&gt;And use it regularly. How do I purchase it?</li>
            <li> Having grown up in the southwest, my skin shows my age and the years of intense sunning.  Over the years I have used very expensive products with marginal results;  and may happy to say I see RESULTS with YEOUTH! I am delighted by this and plan on using this product for a very long time.</li>
            <li> So far so good! My skin been flawless thanks for great customer service.</li>
            <li> Still deciding. Loved it the first few days, soaked in and made my skin feel great. Then, seemed to have less of an effect and not soak in as well. Will continue to use and see what happens. Seems to work better when I think it with water.</li>
            <li> This is my 3rd purchase of this product. It does what it said it will do. It keeps my skin clear and soft. I love it. It arrived on time as well. I will continue to be a customer of this product!</li>
            <li> I can see an improvement. Much more about improved than I expected.</li>
            <li> Best I have tried. Love it. Will keep buying</li>
            <li> Loved it!  Works great on my hands too</li>
