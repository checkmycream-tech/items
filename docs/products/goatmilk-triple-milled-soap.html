            <li> This is the only product I use to remove my make-up with and have been using it for 20+ years!  I have a mix of dry to oily skin, and I find that this soap does well for me!</li>
            <li> If you have issues with bar soap, you may want to try this.  I got my first bar as a set for Christmas several years ago and have never looked back.</li>

            <li> It lathers up good and makes shaving so much easier. It makes your skin feel soft and silky. There is only one place in Denver to get it and I live in the country. Being able to order it from Amazon and having it delivered was great.</li>

            <li> My mother is in love with the Crabtree &amp; Evelyn goatmilk products - this was a great find!  The store site doesn&#x27;t carry a lot of the goatsmilk products any longer.</li>
            <li> I have used this soap for years and years. It is so soft and very gentle for the skin. It smells so clean and fresh. I wouldn&#x27;t be without it. It is reasonably priced, is long lasting, and always arrives very fast when I order it.</li>

            <li> This is my favorite soap and haven&#x27;t used anything else in the shower for 20 years. Doesn&#x27;t smell obnoxious; very little fragrance. Lasts forever because it&#x27;s triple-milled (dense). Doesn&#x27;t dry your skin. I settled on the Goat Milk because it has the least fragrance of all Crabtree and Evelyn&#x27;s tripple-milled soap. Makes a beautiful and thoughtful gift too.</li>

            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this soap for years, having been introduced to it as a gift.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love it, and rarely use anything but this soap.  I even take it overseas with me when I travel, as to do without seems unacceptable.</li>

            <li> Love the smell and the feel of this soap!</li>
            <li> Very drying soap, so if you have oily skin it might be okay to use, or maybe in the summer when there is more humidity.&lt;br /&gt;It would be horrible for me to use in the winter time. Smell is nice. I would not order again though. Sorry Crabtree.</li>
