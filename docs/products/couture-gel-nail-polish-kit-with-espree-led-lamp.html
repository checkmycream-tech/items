            <li>I&#x27;ve saved about $200 now since I do my own nails.  </li>

            <li>It&#x27;s so worth buying this kit!!!</li>

            <li>This kit included everything I needed for this do-it-yourself project and the price was right!!!  </li>
            <li>This is an awesome complete Gel Nail system.</li>
            <li>The three colors that came with my kit were: &#x27;front row seat&#x27; ( lovely neutral brown), &#x27;street chic&#x27; (a gorgeous plum red color) and &#x27;night on the town&#x27; (my fav and an awesome silver color).  </li>
            <li>It is EASY to use &amp; my manicure lasted just over 3 weeks!</li>
            <li>They were always breaking and I was lucky if polish looked good for a couple of hours.  </li>
            <li>This stuff is fantastic!</li>
            <li>And I am SO glad I did.</li>
            <li>Not only is the product outstanding, but their customer service has been the best as well.</li>
            <li>Ever since I have started using this product my nails are now grown to a lovely length that I never thought I would get.  </li>
            <li>Love the product, love the customer service you recieve.  </li>
            <li>and I absolutely love it.</li>
            <li>I have used it many times since November and it has more than paid for itself in saved money from salon visits.  </li>
            <li>Just love this product.  </li>
            <li>You&#x27;ll love it.  </li>
            <li>I have had it for six months and am able to do it when ever I want.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love it :)</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s everything you need and more and you can&#x27;t beat this price for the quality you are getting.</li>
            <li>27 days later my nails were perfect</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m going to be purchasing more colors soon</li>
            <li>and i&#x27;ve already done my toes, my mom&#x27;s nails, mynbestfriends nails and my sister in law :).</li>
            <li>This product looks and feels better at a fraction of the cost</li>
            <li>I was wishing that I more to hands to do.</li>
            <li>\\&quot;I could, for sure, do this myself\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li>The customer service is top notch</li>
            <li>I secretly love it when someone comments on how they have no clue how i find time to go get my nails done.  </li>
            <li>I absolutely love this</li>
            <li>I love that I don&#x27;t have to worry about my toes getting ruined when I go to bed a bit too soon after doing them.  </li>
            <li>Couture offers beautiful colors and expands their selection each season.  </li>
            <li>Did I mention how easy it was to apply? :)  </li>
            <li>I love this product and how it dries so quickly!</li>
            <li>Aside from it&#x27;s incredible durability, the immediate dry time is one of my favorite parts of this product.&lt;br</li>
            <li>but I had to change the color because I was so excited to pick another color  :-)</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to use and lasts for weeks.</li>
            <li>It was really easy</li>
            <li>The kit came with everything you need and the directions were easy to follow.</li>
            <li>This product will pay for itself very quickly.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m quick to note that I did them myself and how much I love the product.  </li>
            <li>Great local Marin business to support!</li>
            <li>Last for a nice long time and stays looking great!</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;d love to be able to purchase one new color at a time.&lt;br /&gt;Other</li>
            <li>Well worth the cost!</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t wait to try more, especially a beautiful blue or a passionate purple.</li>
            <li>I have used every Gel nail color system on the planet and this is by far my favorite!</li>
            <li>Good product right here definately want more colors, the gel polish lasts longer and doesn&#x27;t peel off easily like other nail polish brands</li>
            <li>(It&#x27;s so great that the lamp is large enough to fit feet as well as hands.)  </li>
            <li>It works exactly as it states and with fantastic results.  </li>
            <li>The polish lasts for weeks (until too much new growth shows) on fingers AND toes :)  If you are a mani-pedi type of gal, this kit will pay for itself in no time.  </li>
            <li>but they were super quick to reply and get things taken care of right away</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t even bother painting them with regular polish as I can&#x27;t get more than 24 hours without a chip!  </li>
            <li>Its easy to use and lasts for me, around 3 weeks :) You will never use regular nail color again!</li>
            <li>You really can&#x27;t beat it with all the positive reviews from so many ladies.  </li>
            <li>would highly recommend this product to anybody that wants beautiful nails that won&#x27;t chip or peal for several weeks.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Manicures and pedicures last weeks and the customer service is amazing.</li>
            <li>After hunting around, I found Couture Gel Nail Polish on line and decided it was worth a try.</li>
            <li>Have fun ladies.</li>
            <li>Worth every penny</li>
            <li>, you&#x27;ll get your moneys worth in saved time alone, plus you use so much regular polish just trying to get them to look nice and stay that way.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s well worth the money.  </li>
            <li>It is well worth the money.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It lasts virtually forever on my toes (seriously, it stays perfect until my toes grow out so much</li>
            <li>and I was able to do a complete gel manicure in less than an hour and had gorgeous nails for a dinner date that night.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve since given myself a gel pedicure - very easy, changed colors for my second manicure and did my daughters nails a couple of times.  </li>
            <li>I also work full time (spending 90% of my time in front of a computer equaling a LOT of typing) AND we live on a farm full our poultry, goats and horses.  </li>
            <li>Just follow the steps exactly</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have to drive to the salon, pay $30 dollars or more for the same product.</li>
            <li>I have saved so much money going to the nail salon having this kit!</li>
            <li>I did have an initial problem with shine on the top coat</li>
            <li>;)  </li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve woken the next morning many times with smudges even though they were painted hours before bed.  </li>
            <li>only problem I have is they offer SO many colors</li>
            <li>and I thought my always beautifully painted nails were a thing of the past until I found Couture !!  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve gotten my nails done at salons for decades and decided it was past time to do it myself if I could find a good at home solution.</li>
            <li>It is easy to use and the initial kit comes with everything you need.</li>
            <li>The process is simple and easy to do yourself.  </li>
            <li>Easy and convenient at home gel nail manicure lasting for up to 2 weeks, what else needs to be said.  </li>
            <li>I love the idea but this product does not live up to its name.  </li>
            <li>My job&#x27;s pretty hard on my nails and so far it&#x27;s wearing great.</li>
            <li>This kit has everything thing that you need besides rubbing alcohol, pure acetone and lint-free wipes.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not very good at polishing my own nails and tend to polish what seems like the entire end of my finger, but I&#x27;m hopeful that I&#x27;ll get better with practice.  </li>
            <li>, I get a professional looking manicure right from home.  </li>
            <li>It went on as a rich, vibrant color and seemed to last forever!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve actually painted my nails less than a 1/2 hour before I went to bed and still woke up to gorgeous nails.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Being so busy it seems that often the only time I have free to even paint my nails is after I&#x27;ve put all the kids to bed.  </li>
            <li>, also I am a licensed nail tech, way better than regular polish you have to wait for to dry, and smudge your work.</li>
            <li>Last time I did them I gave my daughter a bath right afterwards without any worries.  </li>
            <li>Uptown Girl has to be my ultimate fav right now.  </li>
            <li>I am a very, very busy mom of 4 kids (ages 9 to 4 months).  </li>
            <li>This clearly has paid for itself in a matter of about one</li>
            <li>I purchased this kit as an early Christmas gift for myself.  </li>
            <li>My nails are so shiny and have a professional look to them.  </li>
            <li>PLEASE do not waste your money.  </li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t had quite as much luck on my hands, but the polish still lasts quite a while if applied properly.  </li>
            <li>A lot of products these days claim to long lasting and worth the money.  </li>
            <li>It is really easy to do (although the process is fairly slow with all the coats, it generally takes me an hour or more, at least when I&#x27;m doing French).  </li>
            <li>I think the only time over all the years I had my nails professionally done that I did not have a smudge was my wedding day</li>
            <li>and they promised to replace it, but then took what they said back due to a misunderstanding that I was willing to correct.</li>
            <li>Regular nail polish doesn&#x27;t last nearly as long and the colors are so vibrant.</li>
            <li>I went to a salon to get a \\&quot;gel manicure\\&quot; for the first time a few months ago.  </li>

            <li> The kit came with everything you need and the directions were easy to follow.</li>
            <li> This product will pay for itself very quickly.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m quick to note that I did them myself and how much I love the product.  </li>
            <li> Great local Marin business to support!</li>
            <li> Last for a nice long time and stays looking great!</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;d love to be able to purchase one new color at a time.&lt;br /&gt;Other</li>
            <li> Well worth the cost!</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t wait to try more, especially a beautiful blue or a passionate purple.</li>
            <li> I have used every Gel nail color system on the planet and this is by far my favorite!</li>
            <li> Good product right here definately want more colors, the gel polish lasts longer and doesn&#x27;t peel off easily like other nail polish brands</li>
            <li> (It&#x27;s so great that the lamp is large enough to fit feet as well as hands.)  </li>
            <li> It works exactly as it states and with fantastic results.  </li>
            <li> The polish lasts for weeks (until too much new growth shows) on fingers AND toes :)  If you are a mani-pedi type of gal, this kit will pay for itself in no time.  </li>
            <li> but they were super quick to reply and get things taken care of right away</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t even bother painting them with regular polish as I can&#x27;t get more than 24 hours without a chip!  </li>
            <li> Its easy to use and lasts for me, around 3 weeks :) You will never use regular nail color again!</li>
            <li> You really can&#x27;t beat it with all the positive reviews from so many ladies.  </li>
            <li> would highly recommend this product to anybody that wants beautiful nails that won&#x27;t chip or peal for several weeks.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Manicures and pedicures last weeks and the customer service is amazing.</li>
            <li> After hunting around, I found Couture Gel Nail Polish on line and decided it was worth a try.</li>
            <li> Have fun ladies.</li>
            <li> Worth every penny</li>
            <li> , you&#x27;ll get your moneys worth in saved time alone, plus you use so much regular polish just trying to get them to look nice and stay that way.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s well worth the money.  </li>
            <li> It is well worth the money.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It lasts virtually forever on my toes (seriously, it stays perfect until my toes grow out so much</li>
            <li> and I was able to do a complete gel manicure in less than an hour and had gorgeous nails for a dinner date that night.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve since given myself a gel pedicure - very easy, changed colors for my second manicure and did my daughters nails a couple of times.  </li>
            <li> I also work full time (spending 90% of my time in front of a computer equaling a LOT of typing) AND we live on a farm full our poultry, goats and horses.  </li>
            <li> Just follow the steps exactly</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have to drive to the salon, pay $30 dollars or more for the same product.</li>
            <li> I have saved so much money going to the nail salon having this kit!</li>
            <li> I did have an initial problem with shine on the top coat</li>
            <li> ;)  </li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve woken the next morning many times with smudges even though they were painted hours before bed.  </li>
            <li> only problem I have is they offer SO many colors</li>
            <li> and I thought my always beautifully painted nails were a thing of the past until I found Couture !!  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve gotten my nails done at salons for decades and decided it was past time to do it myself if I could find a good at home solution.</li>
            <li> It is easy to use and the initial kit comes with everything you need.</li>
            <li> The process is simple and easy to do yourself.  </li>
            <li> Easy and convenient at home gel nail manicure lasting for up to 2 weeks, what else needs to be said.  </li>
            <li> I love the idea but this product does not live up to its name.  </li>
            <li> My job&#x27;s pretty hard on my nails and so far it&#x27;s wearing great.</li>
            <li> This kit has everything thing that you need besides rubbing alcohol, pure acetone and lint-free wipes.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not very good at polishing my own nails and tend to polish what seems like the entire end of my finger, but I&#x27;m hopeful that I&#x27;ll get better with practice.  </li>
            <li> , I get a professional looking manicure right from home.  </li>
            <li> It went on as a rich, vibrant color and seemed to last forever!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve actually painted my nails less than a 1/2 hour before I went to bed and still woke up to gorgeous nails.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Being so busy it seems that often the only time I have free to even paint my nails is after I&#x27;ve put all the kids to bed.  </li>
            <li> , also I am a licensed nail tech, way better than regular polish you have to wait for to dry, and smudge your work.</li>
            <li> Last time I did them I gave my daughter a bath right afterwards without any worries.  </li>
            <li> Uptown Girl has to be my ultimate fav right now.  </li>
            <li> I am a very, very busy mom of 4 kids (ages 9 to 4 months).  </li>
            <li> This clearly has paid for itself in a matter of about one</li>
            <li> I purchased this kit as an early Christmas gift for myself.  </li>
            <li> My nails are so shiny and have a professional look to them.  </li>
            <li> PLEASE do not waste your money.  </li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t had quite as much luck on my hands, but the polish still lasts quite a while if applied properly.  </li>
            <li> A lot of products these days claim to long lasting and worth the money.  </li>
            <li> It is really easy to do (although the process is fairly slow with all the coats, it generally takes me an hour or more, at least when I&#x27;m doing French).  </li>
            <li> I think the only time over all the years I had my nails professionally done that I did not have a smudge was my wedding day</li>
            <li> and they promised to replace it, but then took what they said back due to a misunderstanding that I was willing to correct.</li>
            <li> Regular nail polish doesn&#x27;t last nearly as long and the colors are so vibrant.</li>
            <li> I went to a salon to get a \\&quot;gel manicure\\&quot; for the first time a few months ago.  </li>
            <li> I have had acrylic nails in the past and tried to do this myself, but it took way too much time and energy.  </li>
            <li> In fact I was just thinking I need to cut them back because they are getting too long.  </li>
            <li> How long does the polish last for...little over a week before you see chipping!!</li>
            <li> The curing lamp is a professional grade, the bottles of polish are full-sized (not those little tiny ones that Gelish gives you) and they even put in a storage bag and tools to get you started.</li>
            <li> I had the chance to try out another type of salon gel polish last summer and was hooked on the zero dry time and durability.  </li>
            <li> My only wish is that you could by single colors.  </li>
            <li> A complete waste of money.  </li>
            <li> This stuff goes a long way!</li>
            <li> The nail polish stayed on so long after scrubbing cleaning and packing up a house!</li>
            <li> My friends cannot believe how long the nail polish stayed on!</li>
            <li> UGH, I don&#x27;t have time to sit and wait for polish to dry.  </li>
            <li> My time to get to the salon to get my nails done is limited and saying I am rough on my nails is an understatement!  </li>
            <li> It is $$ well spent.</li>
            <li> I went to the salon just before I got my package and spent 35 on a gel manicure.  </li>
            <li> I got tired of paying high prices at the nail saloon, so I took a chance on Couture.  </li>
            <li> I have tried some other brands out there</li>
            <li> I have very soft thin nails</li>
            <li> I bought this kit a few months ago and was skeptical at first.  </li>
            <li> Plus they dry immediately so no more smudges and imperfections from not sitting still for hours.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this set for a little over a week</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t know about other reviews being shady, but I tell all my friends</li>
            <li> Poor customer service has resulted in a very unhappy customer - which is unfortuate because I had intended on ordering more colors.</li>
            <li> but I have sent two e-mail&#x27;s in the past three weeks with no response.  </li>
            <li> thing I have always HATED about polish, whether on my natural nails or over acrylics was the dry time!  </li>
            <li> Beware, when it says to use THIN coats, take heed.  </li>
            <li> I really like the gel polish kit, unfortunately the customer service is BAD!!!  </li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t go wrong.  </li>
            <li> The customer service is terrible and the founder does not back her product.  </li>
            <li> Buy this now you won&#x27;t be sorry!</li>
            <li> I find it difficult to decide and want them all!</li>
            <li> Try it - you won&#x27;t be disappointed!</li>
            <li> The colors are awful</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I had a baby 1.5 years ago and I thought my always beautifully painted nails were a thing of the past until I found Couture !!  great product, love it !!</li>
            <li> I love this brand and UV polish is the best! Regular nail polish doesn&#x27;t last nearly as long and the colors are so vibrant. I almost never wore nail polish as it would always chip within a day - now I can wear it all the time!</li>
            <li> This stuff is fantastic! It went on as a rich, vibrant color and seemed to last forever! I can&#x27;t wait to try more, especially a beautiful blue or a passionate purple. They&#x27;ve got plenty to choose from!</li>
            <li> I just LOVE this product! It is easy to use and the initial kit comes with everything you need. It is addicting. I just want ALL the colours. I&#x27;ve gotten my nails done at salons for decades and decided it was past time to do it myself if I could find a good at home solution. After hunting around, I found Couture Gel Nail Polish on line and decided it was worth a try. And I am SO glad I did. Not only is the product outstanding, but their customer service has been the best as well. They are quick to respond to questions and happy to help. I follow them on Facebook and always keep an eye out for their posts. Their colour selection is well varied. I am looking forward to trying the french manicure this weekend!</li>
            <li> I love Couture Gel! My husband bought it for me for Christmas &amp; after watching the DVD &amp; reading the instructions I painted my nails. It is EASY to use &amp; my manicure lasted just over 3 weeks! My nails are longer &amp; stronger than ever, too! I just love all the colors that are offered, too! Buy it! You won&#x27;t regret it at all. It is $$ well spent. Afterall, going to the salon for shellac or gels is a $40 trip &amp; usually only lasts 2 weeks!</li>
            <li> I purchased this kit in an effort to save myself from spending $35 every two weeks for a gel manicure.  It is great!  The colors are beautiful and it lasted for over two weeks.  I&#x27;m not very good at polishing my own nails and tend to polish what seems like the entire end of my finger, but I&#x27;m hopeful that I&#x27;ll get better with practice.  My only wish is that you could by single colors.  They sell polish in sets of 3 and I&#x27;d love to be able to purchase one new color at a time.&lt;br /&gt;Other than that, it&#x27;s a great product - a great kit - and I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> I discovered Couture by seaching the internet.  I got tired of paying high prices at the nail saloon, so I took a chance on Couture.  You really can&#x27;t beat it with all the positive reviews from so many ladies.  My daughter has tried several different gel products but both she and I agree that Couture is the very best.  You can&#x27;t go wrong.  Have fun ladies.</li>
            <li> LOVE this product!  I have the weakest nails on the planet.  They were always breaking and I was lucky if polish looked good for a couple of hours.  Ever since I have started using this product my nails are now grown to a lovely length that I never thought I would get.  In fact I was just thinking I need to cut them back because they are getting too long.  And the polish stays on for about 2 weeks for me, which is perfect because by then I&#x27;m ready for a polish change anyway.  Plus they dry immediately so no more smudges and imperfections from not sitting still for hours.  Last time I did them I gave my daughter a bath right afterwards without any worries.  Love the product, love the customer service you recieve.  Worth every penny, you&#x27;ll get your moneys worth in saved time alone, plus you use so much regular polish just trying to get them to look nice and stay that way.  I recommend this kit to everyone!</li>
            <li> This gel nail kit is awesome! I&#x27;ve had it for 7 months and I absolutely love it. Manicures and pedicures last weeks and the customer service is amazing. Well worth the cost! And makes a great gift. Great local Marin business to support!</li>
            <li> I have used every Gel nail color system on the planet and this is by far my favorite! Totally love Couture! Its easy to use and lasts for me, around 3 weeks :) You will never use regular nail color again!</li>
            <li> I purchased this kit as an early Christmas gift for myself.  I have used it many times since November and it has more than paid for itself in saved money from salon visits.  The process is simple and easy to do yourself.  Couture offers beautiful colors and expands their selection each season.  Beware, when it says to use THIN coats, take heed.  This stuff goes a long way!</li>
            <li> Good product right here definately want more colors, the gel polish lasts longer and doesn&#x27;t peel off easily like other nail polish brands</li>
            <li> Love, love, love this gel polish!!  No appointment to the nail salon necessary, I get a professional looking manicure right from home.  Extremely pleased with how it lasts and lasts without a smudge or smear!  I recommend this product to all my friends who wear polish.  Excellent!</li>
            <li> I bought this kit a few months ago and was skeptical at first.  A lot of products these days claim to long lasting and worth the money.  Then I decided to try it.  It is the best product that I have bought for myself in years.  I was initially having an issue with my manicures chipping in a day or two.  A complete waste of money.  This kit has everything thing that you need besides rubbing alcohol, pure acetone and lint-free wipes.  The color choices are brilliant and beautiful.  Uptown Girl has to be my ultimate fav right now.  Just love this product.  It&#x27;s well worth the money.  I&#x27;ve saved about $200 now since I do my own nails.  You&#x27;ll love it.  Just follow the steps exactly and you&#x27;ll achieve the perfect outcome.  The customer service is awesome as well.  Great product!!</li>
            <li> I love this product! I have had it for six months and am able to do it when ever I want. I don&#x27;t have to drive to the salon, pay $30 dollars or more for the same product. It is well worth the money.</li>
            <li> I just received my shipment yesterday and decided to do my nails today.  It works exactly as it states and with fantastic results.  My nails are so shiny and have a professional look to them.  I will be a customer for life!!!</li>
            <li> My mom.bought me this for Christmas and I haven&#x27;t gone a day without my nails done&lt;br /&gt;  I absolutely love it :)</li>
            <li> I have tried some other brands out there but nothing is as great as Couture! It&#x27;s easy to use and lasts for weeks.</li>
            <li> This is an awesome complete Gel Nail system. It&#x27;s everything you need and more and you can&#x27;t beat this price for the quality you are getting. I have very soft thin nails and this polish does the trick to strengthen them without having to be bulky.</li>
            <li> The best ..smooth going on and you can&#x27;t beat the shine! All I can say is amazing and I&#x27;m loving it! Try it you will love it too!</li>
            <li> I ordered my kit a couple months ago and LOVE everything about it!! The nail polish stayed on so long after scrubbing cleaning and packing up a house! My friends cannot believe how long the nail polish stayed on! 27 days later my nails were perfect but I had to change the color because I was so excited to pick another color  :-) I have saved so much money going to the nail salon having this kit! Think about it when you go to the salon you spend between $25 to $40? How long does the polish last for...little over a week before you see chipping!! Not couture nail products!! It&#x27;s so worth buying this kit!!!</li>
            <li> I was given this kit for Mother&#x27;s Day.  I&#x27;ve since done my nails, my daughter&#x27;s nails and will be giving my Mom a manicure this Sunday!  It was really easy and I&#x27;ve got short nails!  My job&#x27;s pretty hard on my nails and so far it&#x27;s wearing great. Did I mention how easy it was to apply? :)  The kit came with everything you need and the directions were easy to follow. The quality of this kit is what has really impressed me!  The curing lamp is a professional grade, the bottles of polish are full-sized (not those little tiny ones that Gelish gives you) and they even put in a storage bag and tools to get you started. I&#x27;m going to be purchasing more colors soon and I really love this kit!  Try it - you won&#x27;t be disappointed! Also, its made in the US!</li>
            <li> This is the best thing to hit the market since nail polish was invented! Buy this now you won&#x27;t be sorry!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this set for a little over a week and i&#x27;ve already done my toes, my mom&#x27;s nails, mynbestfriends nails and my sister in law :). I went to the salon just before I got my package and spent 35 on a gel manicure.  This product looks and feels better at a fraction of the cost plus you can do it in your own home, in your pjs, watching a movie :) love it!!!!</li>
            <li> I did my nails a week ago and they still look great! I love this product and how it dries so quickly!</li>
            <li> Great inexpensive way to do you nails at home, also I am a licensed nail tech, way better than regular polish you have to wait for to dry, and smudge your work.</li>
            <li> Recieved my kit yesterday and did my nails with french manicure last night and toes today and they both came out great. I was wishing that I more to hands to do. Going to have to have a girls night and do them for my girlfriends. Regular polish does not stay on my nails. I had then done at a salon with gel for 35 dollars and they stayed almost three week. This product will pay for itself very quickly.</li>
            <li> I went to a salon to get a \\&quot;gel manicure\\&quot; for the first time a few months ago.  I have had acrylic nails in the past and tried to do this myself, but it took way too much time and energy.  But when I got the salon gel manicure, I thought, \\&quot;I could, for sure, do this myself\\&quot;.  I did some google searching and found Couture Gel Nail Polish Kit.  This kit included everything I needed for this do-it-yourself project and the price was right!!!  The kit was waiting for me when I got home from work on a Friday and I was able to do a complete gel manicure in less than an hour and had gorgeous nails for a dinner date that night.  I&#x27;ve since given myself a gel pedicure - very easy, changed colors for my second manicure and did my daughters nails a couple of times.  This clearly has paid for itself in a matter of about one month.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would highly recommend this product to anybody that wants beautiful nails that won&#x27;t chip or peal for several weeks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you, Couture Gel Nails, for your AWESOME product!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:B006R4DGKE Couture Gel Nail Polish Kit with UV Lamp (Fashionista)]]</li>
            <li> I bought this kit a couple months ago and I absolutely love it!  The polish lasts for weeks (until too much new growth shows) on fingers AND toes :)  If you are a mani-pedi type of gal, this kit will pay for itself in no time.  The customer service is top notch and I haven&#x27;t found a color yet that I don&#x27;t like.  I researched MANY before I chose this one, and I have been nothing but HAPPY with my purchase.  If you are considering DIY gel manicures, this is the kit for you.</li>
            <li> My daughter introduced me to this nail polish, it is great. Last for a nice long time and stays looking great!</li>
            <li> I am a very, very busy mom of 4 kids (ages 9 to 4 months).  I also work full time (spending 90% of my time in front of a computer equaling a LOT of typing) AND we live on a farm full our poultry, goats and horses.  My time to get to the salon to get my nails done is limited and saying I am rough on my nails is an understatement!  I don&#x27;t even bother painting them with regular polish as I can&#x27;t get more than 24 hours without a chip!  For years I went the route of acrylics until I could no longer commit the time to keep them up.  I had the chance to try out another type of salon gel polish last summer and was hooked on the zero dry time and durability.  When I saw Couture was coming out with an at home kit I knew I HAD to have it!&lt;br /&gt;My mother in law bought me my kit of Couture gel nail polish for Christmas last year.  I could not BE more in love with this product!  I did have an initial problem with shine on the top coat but they were super quick to reply and get things taken care of right away, I was really impressed with their customer service.  The three colors that came with my kit were: &#x27;front row seat&#x27; ( lovely neutral brown), &#x27;street chic&#x27; (a gorgeous plum red color) and &#x27;night on the town&#x27; (my fav and an awesome silver color).  Each of the colors applies easily, the shine is incredible and the wear is more than I could have asked for!  I secretly love it when someone comments on how they have no clue how i find time to go get my nails done.  I&#x27;m quick to note that I did them myself and how much I love the product.  :D&lt;br /&gt;One thing I have always HATED about polish, whether on my natural nails or over acrylics was the dry time!  UGH, I don&#x27;t have time to sit and wait for polish to dry.  I think the only time over all the years I had my nails professionally done that I did not have a smudge was my wedding day and that was only because they practically glued me to the seat for an hour afterwards! ;)  Aside from it&#x27;s incredible durability, the immediate dry time is one of my favorite parts of this product.&lt;br /&gt;Being so busy it seems that often the only time I have free to even paint my nails is after I&#x27;ve put all the kids to bed.  This is always a risky time to paint nails and I&#x27;ve woken the next morning many times with smudges even though they were painted hours before bed.  With Couture gel polish I&#x27;ve actually painted my nails less than a 1/2 hour before I went to bed and still woke up to gorgeous nails.  Even my kids notice and compliment me.&lt;br /&gt;The only problem I have is they offer SO many colors I find it difficult to decide and want them all!</li>
            <li> Easy and convenient at home gel nail manicure lasting for up to 2 weeks, what else needs to be said.  I rest my case!</li>
            <li> I love the idea but this product does not live up to its name.  PLEASE do not waste your money.  The colors are awful nothing like pictured on the site and even the darker colors i ordered are NOT opaque.  Also, I have received MULTIPLE gel manicures in salon and they ALWAYS have lasted.  My couture polish only last 3 days max.  *** I have waited an entire year to write this review, I have tried EVERY suggestion offered to me to make the kit work, it just doesnt! ***</li>
            <li> I really like the gel polish kit, unfortunately the customer service is BAD!!!  Couture does not respond to e-mail&#x27;s.  Their web site indicates they will respond to inquiries within 48 hours but I have sent two e-mail&#x27;s in the past three weeks with no response.  The  polish colors on the web site are not the same as the actual colors.  All I wanted to do was exchange a color I ordered for a lighter shade but Couture will not respond to my e-mail&#x27;s.  Poor customer service has resulted in a very unhappy customer - which is unfortuate because I had intended on ordering more colors.</li>
            <li> If I could give this company and kit zero stars, I would.  The customer service is terrible and the founder does not back her product.  My kit broke and they promised to replace it, but then took what they said back due to a misunderstanding that I was willing to correct.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve purchased a kit for myself, had my mom purchase a kit for my brother&#x27;s fiancé, and just purchased a kit for my mom.  I absolutely love this product!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It lasts virtually forever on my toes (seriously, it stays perfect until my toes grow out so much it needs to be removed... I&#x27;ve left it on for over a month before).  I love that I don&#x27;t have to worry about my toes getting ruined when I go to bed a bit too soon after doing them.  (It&#x27;s so great that the lamp is large enough to fit feet as well as hands.)  I haven&#x27;t had quite as much luck on my hands, but the polish still lasts quite a while if applied properly.  It is really easy to do (although the process is fairly slow with all the coats, it generally takes me an hour or more, at least when I&#x27;m doing French).  I&#x27;ve also found the owner to provide excellent customer service.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t know about other reviews being shady, but I tell all my friends how great this product is!</li>
