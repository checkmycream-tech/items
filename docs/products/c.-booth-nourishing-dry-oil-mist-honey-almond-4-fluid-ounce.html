            <li>Smells good.</li>
            <li>When I purchased it in the store there was a variety to choose from but like anything else, good, it goes away.</li>
            <li>and I once had to wait for a reorder to come in as it seems to be popular as I imagine it would be as this is a great price for an oil of this quality.</li>
            <li>and the price is good since I cannot find this product in my stores.</li>

            <li>so I liked that</li>
            <li>I simply love when I emerge from the shower I put this oil on my skin immediately while still moist and it absorbs right in, I think it&#x27;s perfect</li>
            <li>Awesome dry oil spray smells great</li>
            <li>/&gt;The smell is light and sweet, very pleasant.</li>
            <li>because the spray bottle is supposed to be making application convenient, but the product is so good and so easy to spray everywhere else, and so easy to spread, and so effective...</li>
            <li>love the scent and the oil is light and dry…use it on my face, body and on my hair after hair spray….a good buy</li>
            <li>I was somewhat worried about it, but it is very light and almost tropical.  </li>
            <li>Very, very light.</li>
            <li>Love the smell and the feel.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I got it.</li>
            <li>I love love love this product.  </li>
            <li>I also love the smell.  </li>

            <li>I love C. Booth products and this oil mist doesn&#x27;t disappoint.</li>

            <li>Umm, this will become a favorite.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>Love this oil..  </li>
            <li>Love the application and smell of this product.</li>
            <li>I received the 2 oz size in a Glossybox and immediately feel in love with it.</li>
            <li>Love how it gives a non greasy glow to your skin.</li>
            <li>I love the smell ...</li>
            <li>I love to moisturize after my evening shower</li>
            <li>it smells nice and is so light...</li>
            <li>Lovely feel, wish it had worked for me.</li>
            <li>Love this.  </li>
            <li>Love the almond~</li>
            <li>I have bought this so many times and never regret it.</li>
            <li>I just make sure that I stand on a towel when I spray.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m SO glad</li>
            <li>Very light and easy to apply.</li>
            <li>This dry oil spray is awesome.</li>
            <li>the size is perfect for those with limited space.</li>
            <li>It is a fine mist and leaves my skin feeling moisturized and looking healthy.</li>
            <li>I live in a very warm climate where every indoor establishment is air conditioned, including my work space and my home.  </li>
            <li>and it is a lovely light fragrance.</li>
            <li>The honey/almond smells great and doesn&#x27;t stay long which is nice.</li>
            <li>It sounded good, but the scent really misses the mark.</li>
            <li>The mist-er makes it so easy to apply.  </li>
            <li>I then ordered the full size product and still love it.</li>
            <li>Very nice and elegant, oily when sprayed but is absorbed easily leaving skin soft.</li>
            <li>I received a sample in a subscription box and loved it so much I purchased the full size</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a fine mist .</li>
            <li>It absorbs in so quickly and seems to end up where I need it most.  </li>
            <li>Whatever the name, this kind of body oil is indeed &amp;#34;dry&amp;#34; in that it is not greasy and does not have the heaviness of a pure oil spray, which I also like to use.</li>
            <li>Light weight.</li>
            <li>The fragrance is a light vanilla.</li>
            <li>Oh, and the SMELL is amazing &#x3D; very soothing.</li>
            <li>simply a fine dry oil that has a wonderful aroma and places one in a nice mood - this is my third purchase</li>
            <li>The scent is clean and light.</li>
            <li>Had to refer three people to this over the holidays because they were so excited about my alien-soft skin.</li>
            <li>Very light, smells sweet exactly like the ingredients, goes on oily</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a great dry oil</li>
            <li>The dry oil feels great on your skin, lasts all day</li>
            <li>It smells great but does not linger or cloy; it is a natural smell without a very assertive or lingering tone.</li>
            <li>This is not a heavily moisturizing product, so it&#x27;s not going to quench your hands/elbows/etc, but it works soooo nicely for the face and neck, and gives a fabulous glow to the d&amp;eacute;colletage area as well.</li>
            <li>Awesome product for normal, combo or dry skin.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re looking for a nice light moisturizer and like heavy scents, you&#x27;ll love this!</li>
            <li>Sprays well and absorbs quickly.</li>
            <li>Super helpful to spray &amp; help reach those had to get places like your back,… a couple sprays all over,..</li>
            <li>but I also like to get stuff done quick.</li>
            <li>Is not oily and absorbs quickly into the skin.</li>
            <li>Soft fresh nice just love the soft glow</li>
            <li>Will definitely purchase more when it runs out!</li>
            <li>Highly recommended!!!</li>
            <li>Stellar product!</li>
            <li>I love this soft scent; it is a mild almond scent.</li>
            <li>This oil has a nice light scent and it sinks quickly into my skin.  </li>
            <li>I have ultra dry skin, and this stuff (originally got it in a GlossyBox or ipsy subscription bag) is amazing for it.</li>
            <li>very practical and light</li>
            <li>This product is even safe enough to use as a nice light facial moisturizer.  </li>
            <li>So does my 4 year old Grand Baby.</li>
            <li>It keeps my face look fresh</li>
            <li>If I&#x27;m not in the mood to apply regular lotion, I can spritz this all over and throw my PJs on and feel all nice and moisturized and fragrant.</li>
            <li>Love this mist, keeps my skin soft.  </li>
            <li>I like that you can get dressed right away without fear of getting oily stains on your clothes.</li>
            <li>Great choice for me because I have dry, mature skin . .</li>
            <li>Nice dry moisture.</li>
            <li>Just a delightful way to moisturize, after-shower, without resorting to heavy lotions and such.  </li>
            <li>Shipping was very fast</li>
            <li>This was the first product I tried that got my attention to the C.Booth line</li>
            <li>Remember that you only need a light spray!</li>
            <li>It was exactly as described.  </li>
            <li>so it&#x27;s not a mess to clean</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t make me break out, which is surprising for an &#x27;oil&#x27; as my back and chest are sensitive to lotion and oils in general.</li>
            <li>Boston has had a tough winter this year and thankfully my skin has been great.</li>
            <li>I really like this product.</li>
            <li>It drys fast leaves no oily residue and works wonders.</li>
            <li>I use it on my whole body.</li>
            <li>I Like the scent, its not too much.</li>
            <li>I really like this .</li>
            <li>The only issue is you have to buy 5 at a time for free shipping.</li>
            <li>It absorbs fast and doesn&#x27;t leave skin greasy at all.</li>
            <li>Kept my skin silkly smooth all winter long.</li>
            <li>Left my skin feeling soft and lightly scented.  </li>
            <li>I would highly recommend.</li>
            <li>I wish it moisturized a little better.</li>
            <li>And normally I would be somewhat peeved by that</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll stick with plain coconut oil as it&#x27;s cheaper and better at moisturizing.</li>
            <li>It is quick to apply and lasts a long time.</li>
            <li>Like some other reviewers I had originally gotten this product in Glossybox.</li>
            <li>Delicate mist that absorbs quickly and leaves the skin feeling soft and cool.</li>
            <li>My skin actually remains very even, dewy but not greasy.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a little sweet smelling, but not overpowering.</li>
            <li>Decent dry oil.</li>
            <li>You only need a mist or two per extremity and after you rub it in there is no residue and your skin feels soft and silky.</li>
            <li>Do be careful though if spray gets onto tile flooring as it can get very slippery.</li>
            <li>REALLY WORKS FOR DRY SKIN!!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sensitive to smells and while this smell isn&#x27;t necessarily overpowering due to strength, the smell itself was a big turn off for me (way to sweet and heavy, and lingered forEVER).  </li>

            <li> I have ultra dry skin, and this stuff (originally got it in a GlossyBox or ipsy subscription bag) is amazing for it.</li>
            <li> very practical and light</li>
            <li> This product is even safe enough to use as a nice light facial moisturizer.  </li>
            <li> So does my 4 year old Grand Baby.</li>
            <li> It keeps my face look fresh</li>
            <li> If I&#x27;m not in the mood to apply regular lotion, I can spritz this all over and throw my PJs on and feel all nice and moisturized and fragrant.</li>
            <li> Love this mist, keeps my skin soft.  </li>
            <li> I like that you can get dressed right away without fear of getting oily stains on your clothes.</li>
            <li> Great choice for me because I have dry, mature skin . .</li>
            <li> Nice dry moisture.</li>
            <li> Just a delightful way to moisturize, after-shower, without resorting to heavy lotions and such.  </li>
            <li> Shipping was very fast</li>
            <li> This was the first product I tried that got my attention to the C.Booth line</li>
            <li> Remember that you only need a light spray!</li>
            <li> It was exactly as described.  </li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s not a mess to clean</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t make me break out, which is surprising for an &#x27;oil&#x27; as my back and chest are sensitive to lotion and oils in general.</li>
            <li> Boston has had a tough winter this year and thankfully my skin has been great.</li>
            <li> I really like this product.</li>
            <li> It drys fast leaves no oily residue and works wonders.</li>
            <li> I use it on my whole body.</li>
            <li> I Like the scent, its not too much.</li>
            <li> I really like this .</li>
            <li> The only issue is you have to buy 5 at a time for free shipping.</li>
            <li> It absorbs fast and doesn&#x27;t leave skin greasy at all.</li>
            <li> Kept my skin silkly smooth all winter long.</li>
            <li> Left my skin feeling soft and lightly scented.  </li>
            <li> I would highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I wish it moisturized a little better.</li>
            <li> And normally I would be somewhat peeved by that</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll stick with plain coconut oil as it&#x27;s cheaper and better at moisturizing.</li>
            <li> It is quick to apply and lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> Like some other reviewers I had originally gotten this product in Glossybox.</li>
            <li> Delicate mist that absorbs quickly and leaves the skin feeling soft and cool.</li>
            <li> My skin actually remains very even, dewy but not greasy.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little sweet smelling, but not overpowering.</li>
            <li> Decent dry oil.</li>
            <li> You only need a mist or two per extremity and after you rub it in there is no residue and your skin feels soft and silky.</li>
            <li> Do be careful though if spray gets onto tile flooring as it can get very slippery.</li>
            <li> REALLY WORKS FOR DRY SKIN!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sensitive to smells and while this smell isn&#x27;t necessarily overpowering due to strength, the smell itself was a big turn off for me (way to sweet and heavy, and lingered forEVER).  </li>
            <li> My skin is sometimes so dry that I get bumps on my hips and the back of my arms.  </li>
            <li> I personally didn&#x27;t like the smell other people did.</li>
            <li> C. Booth Nourishing Dry Oil Mist in Honey Almond...  </li>
            <li> have combination skin on my face and dry skin everywhere else.  </li>
            <li> I even have sprayed my husbands dry knees</li>
            <li> My skin was as dry as ever.</li>
            <li> I cannot figure out how this works, when spraying it it feels oily, but dries, dry and softens.</li>
            <li> Dry oil?</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried at least a dozen dry oil sprays and this is the only one in this price range that actually &amp;#34;mists&amp;#34; rather than quirts</li>
            <li> The bottle lasts forever because you only need a little.</li>
            <li> And, of course, it makes my dry skin less dry.</li>
            <li> Not what I expected.</li>
            <li> We got some as a sample in a Glossybox (a beauty supply subscription package) and had trouble finding it in stores locally.</li>
            <li> The fragrance is as expected from the other reviews . . .</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that the bottle is small so they don&#x27;t last long if you use it every day like I do.</li>
            <li> But despite it&#x27;s small size, one bottle has lasted me about two months already, and I use it several times a week for all-over moisturizing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I still have a few other oils I want to try.</li>
            <li> I like how it gives my skin a subtle shine and instantly softens.</li>
            <li> Like a previous revewer stated...</li>
            <li> Apply after shower when skin is slightly damp.</li>
            <li> Admittedly, it is a little difficult to get the back of the legs and such because if you turn the bottle upside down, you can&#x27;t spray the product.  </li>
            <li> i use on my little boys</li>
            <li> Messy and loss of some product.</li>
            <li> However this time around all four caps were missing and I am wandering how that happened, hence the four stars</li>
            <li> Very delicate and small enough to be portable.  </li>
            <li> I have frustrating combination skin on my face - often uncomfortably dry, but prone to shine and grease.</li>
            <li> I became addicted to the fragrance of the honey almond when I was given a gift set containing small containers of the body wash, body butter and this dry oil mist.</li>
            <li> Going between heat and cold, dry indoor air and muggy outdoor air, really does a number on my skin.  </li>
            <li> spritzes manages to relieve the uncomfortable dry feeling, without being heavy - and without making my face shiny!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been unable to achieve this balance before.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t be mad.  </li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I just don&#x27;t like the smell of this. It sounded good, but the scent really misses the mark.</li>
            <li> I love this soft scent; it is a mild almond scent.</li>
            <li> Love the smell and the feel.</li>
            <li> very practical and light</li>
            <li> This smells wonderful.  I&#x27;m glad I got it.</li>
            <li> love the scent and the oil is light and dry…use it on my face, body and on my hair after hair spray….a good buy</li>
            <li> Awesome dry oil spray smells great</li>
            <li> C. Booth Nourishing Dry Oil Mist in Honey Almond...  I love love love this product.  I can&#x27;t say enough.  I tried this on a whim and it has been one of the best purchases I have made.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have combination skin on my face and dry skin everywhere else.  My skin is sometimes so dry that I get bumps on my hips and the back of my arms.  I live in a very warm climate where every indoor establishment is air conditioned, including my work space and my home.  Going between heat and cold, dry indoor air and muggy outdoor air, really does a number on my skin.  This product is great because it truly is a &amp;#34;dry&amp;#34; oil.  It absorbs in so quickly and seems to end up where I need it most.  The mist-er makes it so easy to apply.  Admittedly, it is a little difficult to get the back of the legs and such because if you turn the bottle upside down, you can&#x27;t spray the product.  And normally I would be somewhat peeved by that because the spray bottle is supposed to be making application convenient, but the product is so good and so easy to spray everywhere else, and so easy to spread, and so effective... I can&#x27;t be mad.  I also love the smell.  I was somewhat worried about it, but it is very light and almost tropical.  I really can&#x27;t even smell it unless I press my nose to my skin with the few hours after application.  This product is even safe enough to use as a nice light facial moisturizer.  Very delicate and small enough to be portable.  But despite it&#x27;s small size, one bottle has lasted me about two months already, and I use it several times a week for all-over moisturizing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this product to almost anyone.</li>
            <li> I really like this product. However, when delivered it had leaked the oil all over inside the plastic bag. Messy and loss of some product.</li>
            <li> Like some other reviewers I had originally gotten this product in Glossybox. I love spraying this on after I get out of the shower. It&#x27;s a great dry oil but the smell is the best part. I then ordered the full size product and still love it.</li>
            <li> I personally didn&#x27;t like the smell other people did. It had a vanilla smell to me which I didn&#x27;t like.</li>
            <li> I love C. Booth products and this oil mist doesn&#x27;t disappoint. It is a fine mist and leaves my skin feeling moisturized and looking healthy. I will definitely be ordering again.</li>
            <li> Wonderful product....  I even use on my scalp.  I don&#x27;t allow myself to run out of spray.  I keep a constant supply on hand.  Absolutely love it!  So does my 4 year old Grand Baby.</li>
            <li> This oil has a nice light scent and it sinks quickly into my skin.  I like that you can get dressed right away without fear of getting oily stains on your clothes.</li>
            <li> I like it . It keeps my face look fresh</li>
            <li> I love this stuff. I received a sample in a subscription box and loved it so much I purchased the full size and I still love it. It drys fast leaves no oily residue and works wonders. I use it on my whole body. I even have sprayed my husbands dry knees and it worked wonders. It also has a wonderful smell!!! The bottle lasts forever because you only need a little.</li>
            <li> This was the first product I tried that got my attention to the C.Booth line</li>
            <li> Smells great and hydrates skin!</li>
            <li> Delicate mist that absorbs quickly and leaves the skin feeling soft and cool. The fragrance is as expected from the other reviews . . . a vanilla overtone that I find pleasant. Umm, this will become a favorite. Great choice for me because I have dry, mature skin . . . the size is perfect for those with limited space. Remember that you only need a light spray!</li>
            <li> Very good product.  I love it.</li>
            <li> Decent dry oil. Sprays well and absorbs quickly. I Like the scent, its not too much. I still have a few other oils I want to try. But I would buythis again.</li>
            <li> My skin was as dry as ever. I&#x27;ll stick with plain coconut oil as it&#x27;s cheaper and better at moisturizing.</li>
            <li> Love this oil..  Great mild scent-feels good on my skin.</li>
            <li> LOVE THIS PRODUCT! Want to get a stockpile of this. I love the smell!</li>
            <li> I simply love when I emerge from the shower I put this oil on my skin immediately while still moist and it absorbs right in, I think it&#x27;s perfect</li>
            <li> This stuff is awesome. The scent is clean and light. The dry oil feels great on your skin, lasts all day</li>
            <li> Love it! Super helpful to spray &amp; help reach those had to get places like your back,… a couple sprays all over,.. rub in &amp; good to go. Purchased the Honey Almond and it is a lovely light fragrance. Will definitely purchase more when it runs out! Great price! So glad to have found this product!!! Highly recommended!!!</li>
            <li> Feels great, smells great and not greasy but gives your legs just the right amount of shine.</li>
            <li> Love the application and smell of this product. You only need a mist or two per extremity and after you rub it in there is no residue and your skin feels soft and silky.</li>
            <li> I received the 2 oz size in a Glossybox and immediately feel in love with it. I cannot figure out how this works, when spraying it it feels oily, but dries, dry and softens. Love how it gives a non greasy glow to your skin. Awesome product for normal, combo or dry skin.</li>
            <li> I really like this . It&#x27;s a fine mist . It doesn&#x27;t go all over the place so it&#x27;s not a mess to clean I love the smell ...good stuff</li>
            <li> This stuff is the best. Discovered by accident and couldn&#x27;t find locally so I did a search and found here. I have asthma and am unable to tolerate most any smell or perfume. This doesn&#x27;t give me even one cough !! It makes your skin feel heavenly. The only issue is you have to buy 5 at a time for free shipping. Lov this stuff</li>
            <li> I love to moisturize after my evening shower but I also like to get stuff done quick. If I&#x27;m not in the mood to apply regular lotion, I can spritz this all over and throw my PJs on and feel all nice and moisturized and fragrant. Doesn&#x27;t make me break out, which is surprising for an &#x27;oil&#x27; as my back and chest are sensitive to lotion and oils in general.</li>
            <li> Given as gift. Reported to be excellent product.</li>
            <li> Dry oil? Sounds like an oxymoron. Whatever the name, this kind of body oil is indeed &amp;#34;dry&amp;#34; in that it is not greasy and does not have the heaviness of a pure oil spray, which I also like to use. I use it at work where I shower after working out. It smells great but does not linger or cloy; it is a natural smell without a very assertive or lingering tone.</li>
            <li> Very light and easy to apply. I&#x27;ve tried at least a dozen dry oil sprays and this is the only one in this price range that actually &amp;#34;mists&amp;#34; rather than quirts and it smells nice, too. My only complaint is that the bottle is small so they don&#x27;t last long if you use it every day like I do.</li>
            <li> REALLY WORKS FOR DRY SKIN!!</li>
            <li> This is an excellent product. Is not oily and absorbs quickly into the skin.</li>
            <li> I wish it moisturized a little better. Smells good.</li>
            <li> Excellent product, although I wished you had more of a selection. When I purchased it in the store there was a variety to choose from but like anything else, good, it goes away.</li>
            <li> Smells exquisite. Very, very light. Doesn&#x27;t moisturize, though, or hold moisture into the skin, like a heavier oil would. This is sometimes to the product&#x27;s advantage.</li>
            <li> simply a fine dry oil that has a wonderful aroma and places one in a nice mood - this is my third purchase and I once had to wait for a reorder to come in as it seems to be popular as I imagine it would be as this is a great price for an oil of this quality.</li>
            <li> love..love..love..it smells nice and is so light...spritz and rub</li>
            <li> Lovely feel, wish it had worked for me. I&#x27;m sensitive to smells and while this smell isn&#x27;t necessarily overpowering due to strength, the smell itself was a big turn off for me (way to sweet and heavy, and lingered forEVER).  If you&#x27;re looking for a nice light moisturizer and like heavy scents, you&#x27;ll love this!</li>
            <li> Shipping was very fast so I liked that and the price is good since I cannot find this product in my stores. The honey/almond smells great and doesn&#x27;t stay long which is nice. No greasy feel after applying. I would recommend this product!</li>
            <li> Light weight. Nice dry moisture. Smells pleasant.</li>
            <li> Love this.  It was exactly as described.  Left my skin feeling soft and lightly scented.  Not greasy at all!</li>
            <li> This dry oil spray is awesome. It is quick to apply and lasts a long time. It absorbs fast and doesn&#x27;t leave skin greasy at all. I like how it gives my skin a subtle shine and instantly softens. The fragrance is a light vanilla. It&#x27;s a little sweet smelling, but not overpowering. I found this spray to be excellent. I would purchase it again.</li>
            <li> Soft fresh nice just love the soft glow</li>
            <li> Not what I expected. Does not absorb well into skin</li>
            <li> This stuff is awesome! We got some as a sample in a Glossybox (a beauty supply subscription package) and had trouble finding it in stores locally. Amazon has the best price I&#x27;ve seen on it. It keeps you so well moisturized and it smells heavenly. Even my husband uses this product.</li>
            <li> I like this product a lot</li>
            <li> Very nice and elegant, oily when sprayed but is absorbed easily leaving skin soft. i use on my little boys</li>
            <li> Leaves skin silky...w/o greasy feel.</li>
            <li> I have ultra dry skin, and this stuff (originally got it in a GlossyBox or ipsy subscription bag) is amazing for it. It gives me a glow without grease. And, of course, it makes my dry skin less dry. Win-win. Oh, and the SMELL is amazing &#x3D; very soothing.</li>
            <li> Got mine today. Love the almond~honey scent and the oil is divine.  Like a previous revewer stated...it IS oil, but does not stay oily on one&#x27;s skin.  Just a delightful way to moisturize, after-shower, without resorting to heavy lotions and such.  Gives a sheeny glow to the skin.  LOVE IT!</li>
            <li> Love this mist, keeps my skin soft.  Not oily and smells wonderful.</li>
            <li> Great stuff! Very light, smells sweet exactly like the ingredients, goes on oily but once you rub in all over it disappears &amp; does the job.</li>
            <li> I have bought this so many times and never regret it. However this time around all four caps were missing and I am wandering how that happened, hence the four stars</li>
            <li> I became addicted to the fragrance of the honey almond when I was given a gift set containing small containers of the body wash, body butter and this dry oil mist. It is my favourite and I always spray use after showering at the gym. Kept my skin silkly smooth all winter long. Do be careful though if spray gets onto tile flooring as it can get very slippery. I just make sure that I stand on a towel when I spray.</li>
            <li> I have frustrating combination skin on my face - often uncomfortably dry, but prone to shine and grease. I was given this product by a friend and almost pushed it to the back of the cupboard, because the word &amp;#34;oil&amp;#34; rang warning bells. I&#x27;m SO glad I didn&#x27;t.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Two spritzes manages to relieve the uncomfortable dry feeling, without being heavy - and without making my face shiny!! This blew my mind. My skin actually remains very even, dewy but not greasy. I&#x27;ve been unable to achieve this balance before. It must have something to do with the skin being quenched but not suffocated, so it doesn&#x27;t overproduce or underproduce oil in response.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The smell is light and sweet, very pleasant. This is not a heavily moisturizing product, so it&#x27;s not going to quench your hands/elbows/etc, but it works soooo nicely for the face and neck, and gives a fabulous glow to the d&amp;eacute;colletage area as well. Stellar product!</li>
            <li> Non greasy. Smells awesome. Apply after shower when skin is slightly damp. Boston has had a tough winter this year and thankfully my skin has been great. I would highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Had to refer three people to this over the holidays because they were so excited about my alien-soft skin. Great for use after a shower. Feels like the moisture lasts longer than when I use standard lotion.</li>
