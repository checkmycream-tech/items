            <li> Amazing cleanser! I used to be in the makeup industry and I love the consistency, cleansing power and moisturizing effect. Very clean. You only need a tiny amount (I used half a pea size). Wet face first, foam cleanser in hands and work into skin. I noticed a visible difference after using this product. Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> worth the cash. great product!</li>

            <li> I really like this face soap!  It doesn&#x27;t make my face feel dried out after I use it like most do.  Although the one thing I can say is you should definitely avoid getting it in your mouth... I accidentally got a bit in my mouth and it tastes awful.  Its also unscented which can be nice.</li>

            <li> I have used this cleanser for quite awhile. It works.</li>

            <li> Love this product.  It leaves my face clean and soft.  I will reorder it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only been using this for about 3 weeks but I do notice improved moisturization and it cleans nicely.</li>
            <li> I have dry skin and this never ever has left my skin feeling tight or irritated, even after double cleansing and using tretinoin. No sulfates, right pH (all hada labo products have a pH between 5 &amp; 6.5). Does an excellent job of removing oils. Couldn&#x27;t ask for more from a cleanser.</li>
            <li> Best facial wash I have used in a long time! Buying there whole line of product! The Japanese women have all the beauty secrets and now now I do too!!</li>

Very thick and creamy and foams nicely. I have been using Philosophy Purity for ages and I like this better, and it&#x27;s cheaper.  This brand makes a wonderful moisturizer too!</li>
