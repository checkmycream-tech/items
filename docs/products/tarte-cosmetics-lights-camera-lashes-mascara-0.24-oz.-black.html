            <li>Be sure to mix it up though!</li>
            <li>but it goes on nicely.</li>
            <li>the brush isn&#x27;t the best, the product comes out very clumpy, and requires wiping on a tissue or rag so that you can apply it.</li>
            <li>OMG she was soo thrilled with it...!&lt;br</li>
            <li>clumping, easy off &amp; no itch to eyes-very happy with this one &amp; so glad I saw it on this</li>
            <li>however when i contacted the seller she was quick to respond and happy to refund me.</li>
            <li>Awesome natural product !  </li>
            <li>Take it from a savvy old lady--this is the best mascara ever made.  </li>
            <li>Its is by far the best ..</li>
            <li>I think the best thing to do in this instance is to buy directly from Tarte.</li>
            <li>I love love love this mascara!</li>
            <li>creates great, long and beautiful eyelashes</li>
            <li>This Tarte mascara provides a nice, substantial layer on your lashes that lasts all day and also removes easily at night without drying/clumping on.</li>
            <li>must have that I will gladly keep in my cosmetic bag.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Love this stuff.  </li>
            <li>I love this mascara.  </li>
            <li>And it separates and volumnizes better than Lancome Hypnose Drama.  </li>
            <li>I really love the mascara.</li>
            <li>Love this mascara.</li>
            <li>This is one of my favorite mascaras to add length and volume without clumping or smearing.</li>
            <li>I love Tarte products</li>
            <li>One of my favorite mascaras, I&#x27;ve been using it for years.</li>
            <li>I have short lashes and this does awesome!</li>
            <li>It has come in most of my Tarte make-up sets, making the price much more reasonable.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It is way better than the drug store ones I have used, but it didn&#x27;t add tons of length.</li>
            <li>and the case is so cute.  </li>
            <li>I love this mascara.</li>
            <li>This is an OK mascara.  </li>
            <li>but I love love love this mascara</li>
            <li>Really love the way it thickens up lashes without a lot of clumping.</li>
            <li>I love this mascara</li>
            <li>This mascara is just okay.  </li>
            <li>I have to reapply many times throughout the day because it flakes off and who has time for that?</li>
            <li>I also bought Physician&#x27;s Formula Organic mascara for a fraction of the price and it works many many times better.</li>
            <li>and I love it more than anything</li>
            <li>If you are looking for a smooth, non clumping, lengthening mascara that will make even the lowliest of eyelashes pop, you found it!</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>This is a great mascara if you have allergies because it&#x27;s all natural and made with bees wax:-)</li>
            <li>I like how it looks, full coverage lashes!</li>
            <li>Washes off easily without ripping out your lashes.</li>
            <li>so I was able to remember it to order a full size as a Chrismas stocking stuffer.....</li>
            <li>Applies smooth and adds length to lashes, but doesn&#x27;t add a ton of volume.</li>
            <li>it &amp; i bet you will enjoy~</li>
            <li>It clumps, it doesn&#x27;t go on smoothly.</li>
            <li>Otherwise my eyelashes look fantastic.</li>
            <li>This makes them seem fuller, longer and works well for people who have light or short/straight lashes as well.</li>
            <li>I also don&#x27;t like that this mascara isn&#x27;t available in a lighter shade.  </li>
            <li>Not only is this product already amazing because it lengthens and volumized the lashes with out clumping with the most unique packaging!</li>
            <li>But overall it goes on nicely and comes off very easily (a benefit over the waterproof one).</li>
            <li>It has good coverage and is easy enough to wash off.</li>
            <li>Great for long lashes, but does flake at the end of an 8 hour work day</li>
            <li>Product came in original sealed unopened packaging.</li>
            <li>I love this so much!</li>
            <li>Keeps my eyelashes looking great all day long.</li>
            <li>This is the first mascara I have used which leaves my lashes the way I love them.</li>
            <li>Goes on clean and no clumps.</li>
            <li>I love this mascara shipped pretty quickly</li>
            <li>Ordered it because of the reviews and they were right!</li>
            <li>Full, defined lashes that are clump-free.</li>
            <li>This is my new favorite mascara.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s great to know that I can get it here for less</li>
            <li>It is the only one that gives my eyelashes a nice full look without being clumpy.</li>
            <li>The price is a little high, but worth it for the effect, I&#x27;ve tried SO many and this one stands out as the best mascara so far.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t leave me with raccoon eyes at the end of the day (which is a different kind of drama).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Definitely worth the price.  </li>
            <li>This is a nice mascara that I have used for the last couple of years.</li>
            <li>It has to come in a set to be worth it for me.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s worth every penny.</li>
            <li>(though I&#x27;d be thrilled if I could find one that was entirely clump-free).  </li>
            <li>have longer lashes, that are pretty full.</li>
            <li>Well worth the money.</li>
            <li>I have a smaller version of this that I got as a sample and LOVE it, so I decided to order the full sized one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>It is my absolute favorite by far.  </li>
            <li>Dries very fast</li>
            <li>I love this mascara, it curls and lengthens at the same time.</li>
            <li>so when I wake up in the morning I still have pretty eye lashes.  </li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t seem to lengthen like my first one.</li>
            <li>Couldn&#x27;t be happier and will be looking to buy more Tarte cosmetics in the future!</li>
            <li>It looks harsh with my fair complexion during the day.  </li>
            <li>This is a better solution and was able to remove it completely with black soap, no need for makeup remover.</li>
            <li>Overall a good mascara, but I won&#x27;t buy it individually.</li>
            <li>There are some things I really like about this mascara, and there are some things I don&#x27;t like very much at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>the positive side: this mascara provides visible lash lengthening.  </li>
            <li>Not at all what i expected, easily clumps and dries out quickly</li>
            <li>Not only does it give my lashes length and volume without being clump or flaky but it comes off so easily once I wash my face.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It is a nice black that really coats the lashes.</li>
            <li>Then again, it&#x27;s natural, which I liked, and nothing to date has done much for my long but very sparse lashes.</li>
            <li>I found that adding a little warm water to the tube extends it for weeks.</li>
            <li>It also thickens my lashes, makes them look longer, and really adds drama to my eyes.  </li>
            <li>This makes my eyelashes much longer and thicker without clumping.</li>
            <li>I know I sound like a commercial</li>
            <li>For daytime wear I really need a brown, so this has to be an evening mascara</li>
            <li>I try a lot of different mascaras on my medium-length, nicely curled, too blonde lashes.  </li>
            <li>Makes me feel a little better about waking up and not having to run to put make up on right away.  </li>
            <li>Wasn&#x27;t the same as my original.</li>
            <li>This NON-Waterproof version wears better on me than any other I&#x27;ve ever tried.</li>
            <li>it costs more than 3x what other leading brands cost.</li>
            <li>But my sample size (which was only 1/3 the size of the original) has lasted me way longer than this one.</li>
            <li>You absolutely cannot go wrong with this mascara if you&#x27;re looking for beautiful eyes.</li>
            <li>main obstacle to me buying this again is really the color limitation.  </li>
            <li>I also love that it doesn&#x27;t have the harsh chemicals in it that most other mascaras do.</li>
            <li>I am blesses with great skin but unfortunately not great natural eye lashes</li>
            <li>/&gt;I would recommend this to someone with sensitive eyes, that has nice firm lashes and doesn&#x27;t have issues with spider lashes.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>I love the fact that it is natural vs. the other products</li>
            <li>I normally by mine from Sephora</li>
            <li>I love this mascara and probably won&#x27;t be regularly using any others for a long time.</li>
            <li>/&gt;After using mascara, I normally have some eye irritation.</li>
            <li>My lashes are so long and full.</li>
            <li>I want my lashes long and thick, and most importantly for my eye shape, one that does not smear or smudge on my lids or under eye area.</li>
            <li>Just put it on, and WOW, after just one coat I actually have pretty lashes that look much</li>
            <li>I feel like this mascara was not Abrams new product.  </li>
            <li>and it appears to look like a very old mascara (appearance of formula and wand)</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never spent this much on mascara.</li>
            <li>I finally found a product that really enhances my eyelashes.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you!</li>
            <li>Terrific mascara- makes my eyes really look awake!</li>
            <li>Hint - Be careful with the brush on the full size.</li>
            <li>My eyes were a little red after removing it-however I will say it did come off much more easily that nearly all the other mascara brands I have</li>
            <li>Turns out, it is super dry and it takes an extra coat to really show.</li>
            <li>Brown mascaras are much more versatile for me, and I won&#x27;t repurchase one that&#x27;s black only.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not sure this really provides any benefit, but it does make this mascara unique and</li>
            <li>I have sensitive eyes</li>
            <li>if ever any eye problems-this is the one for complete comfort.</li>
            <li>don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s the brand, or the seller that messed up, but this mascara is old.</li>
            <li>I cannot use drugstore brands eyes are to sensitive.  </li>
            <li>4-in-1 Natural Mascara 0.24 oz.]]</li>
            <li>I received a sample of the Tarte mascara and fell in love with it, which is the only reason I spent $20 on the actual size.</li>
            <li>No crumbling, no mess,</li>
            <li>I really wanted to love this mascara because of its natural ingredients and alleged non-clumping formula, and I tried it several times, but it&#x27;s just not a good product, especially for the VERY high price -</li>
            <li>this mascara was a little dissapointing, it gives clumps and is pretty expensive to use, has some good ingredients in it , but will not buy it again</li>
            <li>Like most women, I&#x27;ve search long and hard for a mascara that does everything I want it to do.</li>
            <li>However, I have blonde hair and my lashes are nearly invisible.</li>
            <li>the product was old, dry and seemed to have been used?</li>
            <li>I have reasonably long lashes, so I never really pay attention to lengthening, but this provided extra length I could see, even though I wasn&#x27;t really looking for it.  </li>
            <li>if you have allergies, sensitive eyes, dry eyes, this mascara is for you!</li>
            <li>It is environmentally friendly (or there are less bad things in it than most mascara</li>

            <li> Washes off easily without ripping out your lashes.</li>
            <li> so I was able to remember it to order a full size as a Chrismas stocking stuffer.....</li>
            <li> Applies smooth and adds length to lashes, but doesn&#x27;t add a ton of volume.</li>
            <li> it &amp; i bet you will enjoy~</li>
            <li> It clumps, it doesn&#x27;t go on smoothly.</li>
            <li> Otherwise my eyelashes look fantastic.</li>
            <li> This makes them seem fuller, longer and works well for people who have light or short/straight lashes as well.</li>
            <li> I also don&#x27;t like that this mascara isn&#x27;t available in a lighter shade.  </li>
            <li> Not only is this product already amazing because it lengthens and volumized the lashes with out clumping with the most unique packaging!</li>
            <li> But overall it goes on nicely and comes off very easily (a benefit over the waterproof one).</li>
            <li> It has good coverage and is easy enough to wash off.</li>
            <li> Great for long lashes, but does flake at the end of an 8 hour work day</li>
            <li> Product came in original sealed unopened packaging.</li>
            <li> I love this so much!</li>
            <li> Keeps my eyelashes looking great all day long.</li>
            <li> This is the first mascara I have used which leaves my lashes the way I love them.</li>
            <li> Goes on clean and no clumps.</li>
            <li> I love this mascara shipped pretty quickly</li>
            <li> Ordered it because of the reviews and they were right!</li>
            <li> Full, defined lashes that are clump-free.</li>
            <li> This is my new favorite mascara.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s great to know that I can get it here for less</li>
            <li> It is the only one that gives my eyelashes a nice full look without being clumpy.</li>
            <li> The price is a little high, but worth it for the effect, I&#x27;ve tried SO many and this one stands out as the best mascara so far.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t leave me with raccoon eyes at the end of the day (which is a different kind of drama).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Definitely worth the price.  </li>
            <li> This is a nice mascara that I have used for the last couple of years.</li>
            <li> It has to come in a set to be worth it for me.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s worth every penny.</li>
            <li> (though I&#x27;d be thrilled if I could find one that was entirely clump-free).  </li>
            <li> have longer lashes, that are pretty full.</li>
            <li> Well worth the money.</li>
            <li> I have a smaller version of this that I got as a sample and LOVE it, so I decided to order the full sized one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> It is my absolute favorite by far.  </li>
            <li> Dries very fast</li>
            <li> I love this mascara, it curls and lengthens at the same time.</li>
            <li> so when I wake up in the morning I still have pretty eye lashes.  </li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t seem to lengthen like my first one.</li>
            <li> Couldn&#x27;t be happier and will be looking to buy more Tarte cosmetics in the future!</li>
            <li> It looks harsh with my fair complexion during the day.  </li>
            <li> This is a better solution and was able to remove it completely with black soap, no need for makeup remover.</li>
            <li> Overall a good mascara, but I won&#x27;t buy it individually.</li>
            <li> There are some things I really like about this mascara, and there are some things I don&#x27;t like very much at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> the positive side: this mascara provides visible lash lengthening.  </li>
            <li> Not at all what i expected, easily clumps and dries out quickly</li>
            <li> Not only does it give my lashes length and volume without being clump or flaky but it comes off so easily once I wash my face.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It is a nice black that really coats the lashes.</li>
            <li> Then again, it&#x27;s natural, which I liked, and nothing to date has done much for my long but very sparse lashes.</li>
            <li> I found that adding a little warm water to the tube extends it for weeks.</li>
            <li> It also thickens my lashes, makes them look longer, and really adds drama to my eyes.  </li>
            <li> This makes my eyelashes much longer and thicker without clumping.</li>
            <li> I know I sound like a commercial</li>
            <li> For daytime wear I really need a brown, so this has to be an evening mascara</li>
            <li> I try a lot of different mascaras on my medium-length, nicely curled, too blonde lashes.  </li>
            <li> Makes me feel a little better about waking up and not having to run to put make up on right away.  </li>
            <li> Wasn&#x27;t the same as my original.</li>
            <li> This NON-Waterproof version wears better on me than any other I&#x27;ve ever tried.</li>
            <li> it costs more than 3x what other leading brands cost.</li>
            <li> But my sample size (which was only 1/3 the size of the original) has lasted me way longer than this one.</li>
            <li> You absolutely cannot go wrong with this mascara if you&#x27;re looking for beautiful eyes.</li>
            <li> main obstacle to me buying this again is really the color limitation.  </li>
            <li> I also love that it doesn&#x27;t have the harsh chemicals in it that most other mascaras do.</li>
            <li> I am blesses with great skin but unfortunately not great natural eye lashes</li>
            <li> /&gt;I would recommend this to someone with sensitive eyes, that has nice firm lashes and doesn&#x27;t have issues with spider lashes.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I love the fact that it is natural vs. the other products</li>
            <li> I normally by mine from Sephora</li>
            <li> I love this mascara and probably won&#x27;t be regularly using any others for a long time.</li>
            <li> /&gt;After using mascara, I normally have some eye irritation.</li>
            <li> My lashes are so long and full.</li>
            <li> I want my lashes long and thick, and most importantly for my eye shape, one that does not smear or smudge on my lids or under eye area.</li>
            <li> Just put it on, and WOW, after just one coat I actually have pretty lashes that look much</li>
            <li> I feel like this mascara was not Abrams new product.  </li>
            <li> and it appears to look like a very old mascara (appearance of formula and wand)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never spent this much on mascara.</li>
            <li> I finally found a product that really enhances my eyelashes.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you!</li>
            <li> Terrific mascara- makes my eyes really look awake!</li>
            <li> Hint - Be careful with the brush on the full size.</li>
            <li> My eyes were a little red after removing it-however I will say it did come off much more easily that nearly all the other mascara brands I have</li>
            <li> Turns out, it is super dry and it takes an extra coat to really show.</li>
            <li> Brown mascaras are much more versatile for me, and I won&#x27;t repurchase one that&#x27;s black only.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure this really provides any benefit, but it does make this mascara unique and</li>
            <li> I have sensitive eyes</li>
            <li> if ever any eye problems-this is the one for complete comfort.</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s the brand, or the seller that messed up, but this mascara is old.</li>
            <li> I cannot use drugstore brands eyes are to sensitive.  </li>
            <li> 4-in-1 Natural Mascara 0.24 oz.]]</li>
            <li> I received a sample of the Tarte mascara and fell in love with it, which is the only reason I spent $20 on the actual size.</li>
            <li> No crumbling, no mess,</li>
            <li> I really wanted to love this mascara because of its natural ingredients and alleged non-clumping formula, and I tried it several times, but it&#x27;s just not a good product, especially for the VERY high price -</li>
            <li> this mascara was a little dissapointing, it gives clumps and is pretty expensive to use, has some good ingredients in it , but will not buy it again</li>
            <li> Like most women, I&#x27;ve search long and hard for a mascara that does everything I want it to do.</li>
            <li> However, I have blonde hair and my lashes are nearly invisible.</li>
            <li> the product was old, dry and seemed to have been used?</li>
            <li> I have reasonably long lashes, so I never really pay attention to lengthening, but this provided extra length I could see, even though I wasn&#x27;t really looking for it.  </li>
            <li> if you have allergies, sensitive eyes, dry eyes, this mascara is for you!</li>
            <li> It is environmentally friendly (or there are less bad things in it than most mascara</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t provide anywhere near the volume other brands do.</li>
            <li> The mascara is encased in a pouch, which means it will not stand or sit on the counter, it will only lie flat.</li>
            <li> This mascara is great, the only problem is it is crazy hard to get off.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s my go to mascara if I&#x27;m going for a bold look but don&#x27;t want to take the time to apply false lashes.</li>
            <li> It lasts all day long no smudging or flaking off.</li>
            <li> I ordered this as I had gotten it on QVC a long time ago &amp; having eye problems</li>
            <li> I even got a few samples of a cream, so I was surprised with that gesture.</li>
            <li> However, as for making my lashes long or curled, I did not notice any difference than the products I can buy at the drugstore.  </li>
            <li> I prefer long, thinner lashes.  </li>
            <li> My lashes are already quite long, but I wish they were darker and fuller.</li>
            <li> In this case it was minimal but still present.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used mascaras in the past that claim to thicken, volumize, lengthen, none of which live up to their claims.</li>
            <li> I am not sure that this is new or unexpired.</li>
            <li> I seems old a used.  :/.</li>
            <li> Very dry consistency and also made my lashes brittle as well.&lt;br /&gt;I would not recommend this product.  </li>
            <li> My only complaint is that it seems to dry out earlier than others I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> When you pay $20.00 for a product, you would like it to last a little longer.</li>
            <li> And I have minimal lashes.  </li>
            <li> What a drag.</li>
            <li> You do not have to worry about it slipping out of your hands when using.</li>
            <li> It only comes in black, which is too dark for me.  </li>
            <li> I got a small one on ipsy &amp; that&#x27;s why I wanted a bigger one.</li>
            <li> I like some of the other Tart products I have tried.  </li>
            <li> After trying many store brands over the years and being disappointed with clumping, eye irritation and smudges</li>
            <li> I came across this item while looking up other Tarte products and had to leave a review.</li>
            <li> I sometimes just use this w/o any other eye makeup.</li>
            <li> I prefer this mascara over the last couple I have tried -- the Maybelline pink-and-green standard version you can buy in the drugstore (makes your lashes too clumpy and is difficult to wash off) and Buxom (does not last all day).</li>
            <li> Non irritating and natural !</li>
            <li> Wish it was less clumpy other than that</li>
            <li> , so the next evening I tried the Tarte primer sample I received and was even more disappointed with the results!</li>
            <li> I got black mascara all over my vanity.  </li>
            <li> I appreciate the longer wand as well as I feel like it takes half the time to compete both eyes.</li>
            <li> This is only the second \\&quot;natural\\&quot; mascara I have used, and I have to say I am not impressed.</li>
            <li> After hearing some negative things about mascara, I searched for an all natural mascara-or at least a couple brands with less harsh ingredients, and I have to say I will not be buying Tarte again!&lt;br</li>
            <li> My niece told me about how thick and long it makes your lashes appear.</li>
            <li> it makes my eyelashes look so long and thick</li>
            <li> There is a little bit sometimes, but I can usually work the clumping out so that is is not really noticable.</li>
            <li> I thought this product would be a little easier to smear on my lashes, like the waterproof version.</li>
            <li> It pulls a lot of product and can go on clumpy if you don&#x27;t remove a little before applying.</li>
            <li> It was completely dried out when i received it.</li>
            <li> Give this a try if you&#x27;re looking for a new mascara, you won&#x27;t be sorry!</li>
            <li> The item was difficult to open and ended up breaking.</li>
            <li> Not sure whether I did this or there was a product breakdown.  </li>
            <li> Therefore I was never able to even try it.</li>
            <li> I needed a mascara without glycol and there are very few out there.  </li>
            <li> It gave my lashes have that \\&quot;spider\\&quot; quality to them, which was a major disappointment since this product claims it helps with curling as well.</li>
            <li> really disappointed i even did not use it the mascara arrived open and used and dry !</li>
            <li> However, this mascara is made with a  powder base and does not last long at all.  </li>
            <li> so if make a mistake, it&#x27;s too late to comb through it.</li>
            <li> I hate that I paid this much for it</li>
            <li> packaging is a little weird.  </li>
            <li> Even though it is a little expensive, I will no longer buy anything else.</li>
            <li> In addition, the flakiness creates darkness under the eyes, which is never good.</li>
            <li> Holds curl and is not too thick!</li>
            <li> tried 3D mascara briefly, but hated the residue which would fall off after being applied.</li>
            <li> I always get accused of fake lashes and its not loaded with junk</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s expensive, so I had doubts about springing for the Tarte Cosmetics Lights mascara.</li>
            <li> This mascara clumped horribly, especially at the base of my lashes!</li>
            <li> Found this Mascara to be of very poor quality.</li>

            <li> I got a small one on ipsy &amp; that&#x27;s why I wanted a bigger one.</li>
            <li> I try a lot of different mascaras on my medium-length, nicely curled, too blonde lashes.  While they all deliver the color I expect, the claims of curling, volumizing, and drama have been lost on me until...Tarte Lights, Camera, Lashes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This mascara does add the color I expect.  It also thickens my lashes, makes them look longer, and really adds drama to my eyes.  This mascara is a must have that I will gladly keep in my cosmetic bag.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It doesn&#x27;t clump.  It doesn&#x27;t flake.  It doesn&#x27;t leave me with raccoon eyes at the end of the day (which is a different kind of drama).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wear contacts and Lights, Camera, Lashes doesn&#x27;t irritate my eyes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a must-have mascara for me.</li>
            <li> The only mascara I&#x27;ve ever sworn by. I received a trial size in my Ipsy bag in March and have been hooked since then. This makes my eyelashes much longer and thicker without clumping. The only con is that it does not hold a curl for me.</li>
            <li> This mascara is truly the best I&#x27;ve ever used.  I&#x27;ve used mascaras in the past that claim to thicken, volumize, lengthen, none of which live up to their claims. This one actually works. With  just one swipe too.  And I have minimal lashes.  Definitely worth the price.  No crumbling, no mess, no fuss.  Just easy beautiful lashes.  Finally.</li>
            <li> I thought this product would be a little easier to smear on my lashes, like the waterproof version. Turns out, it is super dry and it takes an extra coat to really show. But overall it goes on nicely and comes off very easily (a benefit over the waterproof one). The tint is good for brown eyes.</li>
            <li> Not at all what i expected, easily clumps and dries out quickly</li>
            <li> Got this of my wife she loves it</li>
            <li> I love this mascara, it curls and lengthens at the same time. I have been asked multiple times if I am wearing fake lashes, I love it. This mascara doesn&#x27;t smear or smudge, and lasts all day. The price is a little high, but worth it for the effect, I&#x27;ve tried SO many and this one stands out as the best mascara so far. The only thing I don&#x27;t like is the packaging, the faux snake skin material is fugly, I&#x27;d be happier with a regular tube.</li>
            <li> Great for long lashes, but does flake at the end of an 8 hour work day</li>
            <li> Love this stuff.  Ordered it because of the reviews and they were right!</li>
            <li> I was always on the hunt for a great mascara until I found this one.  It is my absolute favorite by far.  No smudges and washes off effortlessly when you want it to.  I am blesses with great skin but unfortunately not great natural eye lashes so when I go to bed at night I leave my mascara on so when I wake up in the morning I still have pretty eye lashes.  Makes me feel a little better about waking up and not having to run to put make up on right away.  I normally by mine from Sephora but it&#x27;s great to know that I can get it here for less which is what I will be doing from now on. Bottom line is this....... You absolutely cannot go wrong with this mascara if you&#x27;re looking for beautiful eyes.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using mascara for FIFTY years!  Take it from a savvy old lady--this is the best mascara ever made.  Ever.</li>
            <li> This is wonderful mascara! Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> best mascara I&#x27;ve had in years! creates great, long and beautiful eyelashes</li>
            <li> I do like the product I just wish it made them fuller and longer but it goes on nicely. I have been happy with it.</li>
            <li> Great mascara w not a bunch of toxic ingredients. Holds curl and is not too thick!</li>
            <li> I love this mascara.  It is environmentally friendly (or there are less bad things in it than most mascara anyway)--that&#x27;s why I bought it.  And it separates and volumnizes better than Lancome Hypnose Drama.  I&#x27;ve been very happy with it.</li>
            <li> Not only is this product already amazing because it lengthens and volumized the lashes with out clumping with the most unique packaging! But the seller was amazing! I ordered on a Monday night and received my package wednesday! Will be ordering from this seller again!</li>
            <li> I love the mascara but could have done without the weird leather case...I thought that was some sort of delivery or carrying device, but it stays on the mascara tube...</li>
            <li> I really love the mascara. It washes off when you want it to. It lasts all day long no smudging or flaking off. I have sensitive eyes and this mascara doesnt cause any irritation.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this mascara! It is the only one that gives my eyelashes a nice full look without being clumpy. Great mascara and great price on Amazon.</li>
            <li> Adds LOTS of length and volume. It&#x27;s my go to mascara if I&#x27;m going for a bold look but don&#x27;t want to take the time to apply false lashes. Hint - Be careful with the brush on the full size. It pulls a lot of product and can go on clumpy if you don&#x27;t remove a little before applying. For some reason I haven&#x27;t had this issue with the trial size.</li>
            <li> The item was difficult to open and ended up breaking. Not sure whether I did this or there was a product breakdown.  I got black mascara all over my vanity.  Therefore I was never able to even try it.</li>
            <li> Love this mascara. Goes on clean and no clumps. Washes off easily without ripping out your lashes. Curls just enough.</li>
            <li> Wasn&#x27;t the same as my original. Doesn&#x27;t seem to lengthen like my first one.</li>
            <li> the brush isn&#x27;t the best, the product comes out very clumpy, and requires wiping on a tissue or rag so that you can apply it. Dries very fast so if make a mistake, it&#x27;s too late to comb through it. I love the fact that it is natural vs. the other products so I will continue to use it, just wish it went on easier.</li>
            <li> This is one of my favorite mascaras to add length and volume without clumping or smearing.</li>
            <li> returned this item.  It was completely dried out when i received it.</li>
            <li> I feel like this mascara was not Abrams new product.  I seems old a used.  :/. I&#x27;ve never spent this much on mascara.</li>
            <li> Wish it was less clumpy other than that I like how it looks, full coverage lashes!</li>
            <li> It is a bit clumpy on the brush and you have scrape off the extra.  The brush also isn&#x27;t the best.  I love Tarte products but I won&#x27;t buy this one again once it&#x27;s gone.</li>
            <li> One of my favorite mascaras, I&#x27;ve been using it for years. It has good coverage and is easy enough to wash off. My only complaint is that it seems to dry out earlier than others I&#x27;ve used. I found that adding a little warm water to the tube extends it for weeks. Be sure to mix it up though! Give this a try if you&#x27;re looking for a new mascara, you won&#x27;t be sorry!</li>
            <li> I love love love this mascara!</li>
            <li> This is my new favorite mascara. Not clumpy at all. Applies smooth and adds length to lashes, but doesn&#x27;t add a ton of volume. This doesn&#x27;t smear on me through the day.</li>
            <li> if you have allergies, sensitive eyes, dry eyes, this mascara is for you!</li>
            <li> Best mascara ever, doesn&#x27;t run but easy to take off. Goes on beautifully!</li>
            <li> I ordered this as I had gotten it on QVC a long time ago &amp; having eye problems oit was the best for no reactions to it.&lt;br /&gt;Where I can order 1 &amp; Not 2 at a time-I chose Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;Less clumping, easy off &amp; no itch to eyes-very happy with this one &amp; so glad I saw it on this site.&lt;br /&gt;Try it &amp; i bet you will enjoy~ if ever any eye problems-this is the one for complete comfort.</li>
            <li> Found this Mascara to be of very poor quality. Very dry consistency and also made my lashes brittle as well.&lt;br /&gt;I would not recommend this product.  Perhaps this tube had passed it&#x27;s self life?</li>
            <li> My Gorgeous Girl Loves this product and it looks so good on her.&lt;br /&gt;She got a sample of this and raved about it, thank the gods that it has a catchy name so I was able to remember it to order a full size as a Chrismas stocking stuffer..... OMG she was soo thrilled with it...!&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m a hero today..!</li>
            <li> Awesome natural product !  Non irritating and natural ! Finally found THE mascara !</li>
            <li> Product came in original sealed unopened packaging. I even got a few samples of a cream, so I was surprised with that gesture. This is a great mascara if you have allergies because it&#x27;s all natural and made with bees wax:-)</li>
            <li> I have short lashes and this does awesome!</li>
            <li> I needed a mascara without glycol and there are very few out there.  I like some of the other Tart products I have tried.  However, this mascara is made with a  powder base and does not last long at all.  When you pay $20.00 for a product, you would like it to last a little longer.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t seem to find a mascara that does not clump on my lashes and this one (for me) was no exception.</li>
            <li> i’m really disappointed i even did not use it the mascara arrived open and used and dry !</li>
            <li> I love this mascara shipped pretty quickly</li>
            <li> No clumps and looks great!  I also love that it doesn&#x27;t have the harsh chemicals in it that most other mascaras do.</li>
            <li> I am not sure that this is new or unexpired. What a drag.</li>
            <li> the product was old, dry and seemed to have been used? however when i contacted the seller she was quick to respond and happy to refund me. i&#x27;ve used this mascara before and loved it, so i&#x27;ll buy it at ulta.</li>
            <li> I love this so much! Its is by far the best .. I always get accused of fake lashes and its not loaded with junk</li>
            <li> I have a smaller version of this that I got as a sample and LOVE it, so I decided to order the full sized one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s the brand, or the seller that messed up, but this mascara is old. It clumps, it doesn&#x27;t go on smoothly. It&#x27;s junk.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t buy from Amazon. I think the best thing to do in this instance is to buy directly from Tarte.</li>
            <li> This is a nice mascara that I have used for the last couple of years. It has come in most of my Tarte make-up sets, making the price much more reasonable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is a nice black that really coats the lashes. It is way better than the drug store ones I have used, but it didn&#x27;t add tons of length. Overall a good mascara, but I won&#x27;t buy it individually. It has to come in a set to be worth it for me.</li>
            <li> This mascara is great, the only problem is it is crazy hard to get off. Like days after wearing it still shows up under my eyes. But when it&#x27;s on, it does not run or smudge, only when you start messing with it to take it off. Otherwise my eyelashes look fantastic.</li>
            <li> I love this mascara and probably won&#x27;t be regularly using any others for a long time.Not only does it give my lashes length and volume without being clump or flaky but it comes off so easily once I wash my face. I appreciate the longer wand as well as I feel like it takes half the time to compete both eyes. Couldn&#x27;t be happier and will be looking to buy more Tarte cosmetics in the future!</li>
            <li> I read about this product so I thought I would try and I like it.  I cannot use drugstore brands eyes are to sensitive.  But I like this and the case is so cute.  You do not have to worry about it slipping out of your hands when using.</li>
            <li> Tarte is the only mascara that doesn&#x27;t make my eyes red and tear.  Not clumping,great lengthening.  The waterproof  one is good for rainy days, gym and hairdresser.</li>
            <li> I love this mascara. My niece told me about how thick and long it makes your lashes appear. After trying many store brands over the years and being disappointed with clumping, eye irritation and smudges I finally found a product that really enhances my eyelashes.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you!</li>
            <li> This is an OK mascara.  It does not clump or smudge under my eyes.  It does make lashes thicker.  However, as for making my lashes long or curled, I did not notice any difference than the products I can buy at the drugstore.  I ended uup with think, short lashes, which is not my preference.  I prefer long, thinner lashes.  If you want thickness and have problems with smudging, then this may be the mascara for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The packaging is a little weird.  The mascara is encased in a pouch, which means it will not stand or sit on the counter, it will only lie flat.</li>
            <li> I found this mascara about a year ago when I was googling the best mascaras for lengthening and curling eyelashes. Even though it is a little expensive, I will no longer buy anything else. This mascara is wonderful! Keeps my eyelashes looking great all day long. For years, I&#x27;ve been searching for the perfect mascara and I&#x27;ve finally found it.</li>
            <li> Like most women, I&#x27;ve search long and hard for a mascara that does everything I want it to do. I want my lashes long and thick, and most importantly for my eye shape, one that does not smear or smudge on my lids or under eye area. I&#x27;ve tried every drug store waterproof out there and by the end of the day, they all smudge on my eye lids. This NON-Waterproof version wears better on me than any other I&#x27;ve ever tried. Zero smudging. Full, defined lashes that are clump-free. I know I sound like a commercial but I love love love this mascara and it&#x27;s worth every penny.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for years. Really love the way it thickens up lashes without a lot of clumping. There is a little bit sometimes, but I can usually work the clumping out so that is is not really noticable.</li>
            <li> this mascara was a little dissapointing, it gives clumps and is pretty expensive to use, has some good ingredients in it , but will not buy it again</li>
            <li> Does not clump...have very fine lashes and this does a great job of making them look glam....</li>
            <li> I love this mascara it makes my eyelashes look so long and thick</li>
            <li> This mascara is just okay.  If you are looking for the perfect mascara, this one is not it.</li>
            <li> The best mascara I&#x27;ve ever had...and it stays on all day with no flaking.</li>
            <li> I really wanted to love this mascara because of its natural ingredients and alleged non-clumping formula, and I tried it several times, but it&#x27;s just not a good product, especially for the VERY high price - it costs more than 3x what other leading brands cost. The formula smears all over the wand and needs to be scraped off several times before applying. It also clumps on the lashes and flakes off rather than sticking. It doesn&#x27;t provide anywhere near the volume other brands do. I have to reapply many times throughout the day because it flakes off and who has time for that? In addition, the flakiness creates darkness under the eyes, which is never good. I hate that I paid this much for it and it appears to look like a very old mascara (appearance of formula and wand) and just doesn&#x27;t work well. I also bought Physician&#x27;s Formula Organic mascara for a fraction of the price and it works many many times better.</li>
            <li> I received this mascara as part of my Ipsy Glam Bag and was so happy to find it on Amazon. This is the first mascara I have used which leaves my lashes the way I love them. My lashes are already quite long, but I wish they were darker and fuller. This makes them seem fuller, longer and works well for people who have light or short/straight lashes as well. I would suggest that if you want your lashes to curl, to use a curler after the mascara has dried.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried 3D mascara briefly, but hated the residue which would fall off after being applied. This is a better solution and was able to remove it completely with black soap, no need for makeup remover.</li>
            <li> There are some things I really like about this mascara, and there are some things I don&#x27;t like very much at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the positive side: this mascara provides visible lash lengthening.  I have reasonably long lashes, so I never really pay attention to lengthening, but this provided extra length I could see, even though I wasn&#x27;t really looking for it.  This can be a bit of a hazard, as my lashes were actually hitting back against my eyelid, and leaving mascara marks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Negatives: I&#x27;ve had some problems with clumpiness with this mascara, and it&#x27;s left some spidery looking lashes.  I have this issue with lots of mascaras, so it&#x27;s not 100% a deal-breaker (though I&#x27;d be thrilled if I could find one that was entirely clump-free).  I also don&#x27;t like that this mascara isn&#x27;t available in a lighter shade.  It only comes in black, which is too dark for me.  It looks harsh with my fair complexion during the day.  For daytime wear I really need a brown, so this has to be an evening mascara only.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The main obstacle to me buying this again is really the color limitation.  Brown mascaras are much more versatile for me, and I won&#x27;t repurchase one that&#x27;s black only.</li>
            <li> I got this as a gift and I love it more than anything, my lashes look longer than they ever have before. I came across this item while looking up other Tarte products and had to leave a review. If you are looking for a smooth, non clumping, lengthening mascara that will make even the lowliest of eyelashes pop, you found it! So what are you waiting for?</li>
            <li> I also learned about this from the Food Babe blog.  Terrific mascara- makes my eyes really look awake! I sometimes just use this w/o any other eye makeup. Love it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s expensive, so I had doubts about springing for the Tarte Cosmetics Lights mascara. Then again, it&#x27;s natural, which I liked, and nothing to date has done much for my long but very sparse lashes. Just put it on, and WOW, after just one coat I actually have pretty lashes that look much thicker.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t pretend to be happy about the price -- YIKES! Then again, it&#x27;s the best I&#x27;ve yet tried, so I&#x27;ll be ordering again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:B00547HS36 Tarte Cosmetics Lights Camera Lashes 4-in-1 Natural Mascara 0.24 oz.]]</li>
            <li> Works great. My go-to mascara! I also keep a second tube in my purse for touch ups, if needed!</li>
            <li> This is only the second \\&quot;natural\\&quot; mascara I have used, and I have to say I am not impressed. After hearing some negative things about mascara, I searched for an all natural mascara-or at least a couple brands with less harsh ingredients, and I have to say I will not be buying Tarte again!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have longer lashes, that are pretty full. However, I have blonde hair and my lashes are nearly invisible. This mascara clumped horribly, especially at the base of my lashes! It gave my lashes have that \\&quot;spider\\&quot; quality to them, which was a major disappointment since this product claims it helps with curling as well. Initially I thought maybe it was because I didn&#x27;t use a primer, so the next evening I tried the Tarte primer sample I received and was even more disappointed with the results! The two did not work well together, the mascara and primer do not coat evenly together.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After using mascara, I normally have some eye irritation. In this case it was minimal but still present. My eyes were a little red after removing it-however I will say it did come off much more easily that nearly all the other mascara brands I have tried.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this to someone with sensitive eyes, that has nice firm lashes and doesn&#x27;t have issues with spider lashes.</li>
            <li> I prefer this mascara over the last couple I have tried -- the Maybelline pink-and-green standard version you can buy in the drugstore (makes your lashes too clumpy and is difficult to wash off) and Buxom (does not last all day). This Tarte mascara provides a nice, substantial layer on your lashes that lasts all day and also removes easily at night without drying/clumping on. The actual tube is in a shiny, cloth exterior. I&#x27;m not sure this really provides any benefit, but it does make this mascara unique and memorable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Would definitely recommend.</li>
            <li> Well worth the money. My lashes are so long and full.</li>
            <li> I received a sample of the Tarte mascara and fell in love with it, which is the only reason I spent $20 on the actual size. But my sample size (which was only 1/3 the size of the original) has lasted me way longer than this one. I won&#x27;t buy again because I feel ur being ripped off by how much it actually in the bottle.</li>
