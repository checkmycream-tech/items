            <li> Great sealed quality products ALWAYS go with INKS MADE IN USA! I haven&#x27;t put them to use yet as I am waiting for other equipment before proceeding. These inks exp in 2016 so that is gives me enough time to put them to use.</li>
            <li> This is more of a grey rather than being titled jet black..good quality ink but not jet black..it&#x27;s more of a darkish grey</li>
            <li> Starbright inks are the best but the onebi recieved is very watery.  Smaller than expected.&lt;br /&gt;Was hoping for more but cant change it now.</li>

I wouldn&#x27;t want anything but sterile ink, it just makes a lot of sense.</li>
            <li> Not very happy with this product. It is very watery. Needs to be thicker for better tattooing. Not very happy.</li>
