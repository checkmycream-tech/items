            <li> Although I hoped for better results..... it is a good neck cream &amp;&lt;br /&gt;It does provide some firming ..... I have only used one jar..... maybe I should try it a little. longer for continuing results.....</li>
            <li> This was reccommened by my dermatologist, I was going to have lazer treatment done on my neck ($700)  she said try nectifirm first, we&#x27;ll I have saved myself a lot of money, the lines are disappearing on my neck. I am very pleased.</li>
            <li> This is the 2nd jar of this cream that I bought - I love it.</li>
            <li> This neck cream is amazing - can definitely tell the difference in my skin and it smells really nice.</li>
            <li> Was a gift for my daughter. She loved it so much when she was younger....that now she wanted to share it with her teenagers.&lt;br /&gt;It was a hit!!</li>
            <li> It works well.  I will buy this again</li>
            <li> Well I have used this cream now for a good 2 and half months and have not seen any change whatsoever. And I even took pictures. Expensive and doesn&#x27;t give any kind of tightness or better looking skin than any other creams out there. Will never buy it again.</li>
            <li> I was hesitant to try another cream for firming the neck, but I see a big difference after 6-8 weeks of use.</li>
            <li> Been using this for several years on my neck and jowl area and it seems to be keeping up with the gravity of my mature skin.</li>
            <li> I have ordered twice and I will order more in the future,  now  that I found it on Amazon I will continue to use it.  Ordering from Amazon is so convenient makes a working woman happy</li>
            <li> This cream is the best and I do see results</li>
            <li> this product is amazing.  I had and have used  the incredibly expensive so often recommended face and neck cream but it doesn&#x27;t compare to this product...and I am only using it once a day!!!!!!  And by the way....I am not a 30 or 40 something...I am 66 and this product works!!!</li>
            <li> Great product. Meet expectations</li>
            <li> good stuff - I&#x27;ve been using it for about a year. I don&#x27;t see a difference but the product&#x27;s ingredients are good, so MAYBE it&#x27;s better than it would have been;)</li>
            <li> I love this cream but I am loving all of the Revision products for anti aging skin.  After just one month I can see a difference.  Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Great price...love, love, love this stuff!!</li>
            <li> With all the other reviews, I though I might see more positive results. it does seem to make my skin softer, but I thought it would be more firming.</li>
            <li> I began using Nectifirm in March of 2014 after a mini liquid face lift. Definitely a big difference in my neck..not as droopy or crepy. My daughters even noticed a big difference. I am not one to believe these so called miracle creams, but this one did the trick.</li>
            <li> Been using a few years now and neck is in great shape</li>
            <li> Seems to help my neck.  A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> This creme works on the neck,making it look years younger. It appears to tighten the skin which smooths it.</li>
            <li> Love this product. Saw a difference with first application. Was doubtful but I saw an immediate improvement in my skin. It firmed the jaw line instantly</li>
            <li> GREAT PRODUCT, USED TO BUY FROM MY PLASTIC SURGEON AND IT IS MUCH MORE AFFORDABLE HERE.  YES, IT DOES WORK ON THE NECK TO GET RID OF THE LINES!!!!</li>
            <li> Very prompt shipment. It&#x27;s a pretty good sized amount, compared to a lot of creams that come in jars.  And best of all, it definitely works.  Really helps get rid of the crepey neck look!</li>
            <li> First product I&#x27;ve tried that actually seemed to make an immediate difference in nearly 60 year old neck. Doesn&#x27;t seem to have an enduring effect (might not be using it  consistently enough), but am very happy with the product!</li>
            <li> It is the best cream I have ever used for neck and face.  I highly recommend this cream.  It works</li>
            <li> Does help tighten and makes the texture much better.&lt;br /&gt;I would purchase again, in face I did buy it.  Very good!</li>
            <li> The cream seems to help somewhat with firming my neck area.  Just remember that once you start using it, you have to keep it up or you eventually lose the benefit.</li>
            <li> I love the product..The shipping was fast.</li>
            <li> Loove it!! I will give it a 5 star!!</li>
            <li> Love this product - have been using it for 2 years.  I have clearly seen a difference.</li>
            <li> Has improved the appearance of my neck since I started using this. Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> Product was sent right away but as far as the results, I will be able to tell after using it for a while?</li>
            <li> I use this on my chest because I had wrinkles forming from cleavage going up towards neck... They are gone! I never thought topical did a whole lot- but this cream is awesome, better than I thought</li>
            <li> It seems to work; I use it after having had an in-office cosmetic treatment.</li>
            <li> Somewhat..have not used it long enough to really rate it.</li>
