            <li>it smell very sweet.</li>
            <li>The bottle is gorgeous and is pretty large for being a 1.7 OZ.</li>
            <li>It came sealed in the original packaging.</li>
            <li>Arrived quickly and spray working fine</li>

            <li>Like all of Vera&#x27;s other scents this one is by far the best one it smells natural and not an artificial smell like other perfumes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I purchased this perfume and will skeptical at first because the price was so cheap compared to the department store.</li>
            <li>Its a very subtle scent that I feel would be appropriate for a night out or a day at the office.</li>

            <li> Smell doesn&#x27;t last long though!</li>
            <li> When you do research on the notes it states that it has champagne notes, it may sound weird</li>
            <li> Lasts long and smells calming.</li>
            <li> Its so sweet and subtle, not strong at all.</li>
            <li> Personally, I do not like the fragrance as it smells a little sour to me.</li>
            <li> Ms. Wang, you have truly let me down.</li>
            <li> Purchased this because I felt, &amp;#34;How can I go wrong with Vera Wang?&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately, one can.</li>

            <li> my daughter took it before I even smelt it..she loves it very light she said</li>
            <li> The decoration on the bottle (jewels) is neat. You can take it off and it is elastic. I use it in my hair. Scent is light and wonderful, never overpowering. It smells like violets.</li>
            <li> Great product and good price with great service from Amazon</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this! Its a very subtle scent that I feel would be appropriate for a night out or a day at the office. The bottle is gorgeous and is pretty large for being a 1.7 OZ. When you do research on the notes it states that it has champagne notes, it may sound weird but when I wear this I feel bubbly! Like all of Vera&#x27;s other scents this one is by far the best one it smells natural and not an artificial smell like other perfumes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I purchased this from the seller named &#x27;Chambers Sales&#x27; I received it three days after purchasing, I bought this at the price of $22.00 and I think I got a steal of a deal!</li>

            <li> I love this perfume! Its so sweet and subtle, not strong at all.</li>
