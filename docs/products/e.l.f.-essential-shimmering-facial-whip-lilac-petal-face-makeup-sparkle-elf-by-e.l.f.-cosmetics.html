            <li>If that happens, try shaking it and it that still does not take care of the watery phase, just squeeze it out, dispose of it and just use the shiny cream that will eventually come out - it still looks great on your cheekbones!</li>

            <li> This is my favorite highlighter for the cheekbones - it gives your face the most flattering glow ever! Also, a little goes a really long way so it took me 2 years before I used up mine. The packaging came apart fairly early on which made for a messy product. So, I kept it in a sealed ziploc bag and that worked great. With time, it does separate and you may get a simple liquidy phase coming out when you squeeze. If that happens, try shaking it and it that still does not take care of the watery phase, just squeeze it out, dispose of it and just use the shiny cream that will eventually come out - it still looks great on your cheekbones! With all the messiness, I will keep repurchasing this because the effect is GREAT and this is only one dollar off the ELF website.</li>
            <li> I bought this because of the price....cheap.  It is something I use daily.  I like how it makes my eyes pop!</li>
            <li> Only have used one time. Didn&#x27;t do a lot for me. Nice product, but just didn&#x27;t like the way it looked on my skin tone.</li>
            <li> I love this product and used to buy it in the store however the only place I can now find it is online. I can&#x27;t finish my look without this highlighter it brings such a glow to my face.</li>
            <li> Enjoy useing a great product.&lt;br /&gt;Use lightly. Stays on all day.</li>
            <li> This Facial Whip provides a subtle sheen, which is perfect for highlighting &amp; contouring.  I have very fair skin, and this shade is perfect!</li>
            <li> One of my absolute favorite drugstore products. I got it in Target for a dollar(!!!) and immediately loved it. I&#x27;ve heard it called a dupe for Benefit High Beam, but I&#x27;ve never used high beam, so I wouldn&#x27;t know. I have used it as an eye shadow primer, a gorgeous, subtle highlighter, and an illuminator- mixed in a small amount with bb cream or foundation for a subtle glowing look or a bit more for a dewy looking finish. Beautiful color for every skin tone I&#x27;ve seen it on, from my cool toned VERY light to my best friend&#x27;s warm toned medium brown and a little goes a long way- I use about the size of the tip of a pencil lead on each cheekbone when using it as a highlighter. Plus it smells wonderful, but not at all strong.</li>
            <li> Love this for everyday use</li>
            <li> It goes on fairly thick, and looks a bit darker on your face than I believe it should. I mixed it with my foundation, and it was ok.</li>
            <li> I need to order more. This makes you look much younger. I can&#x27;t go without it.</li>
            <li> It is what you pay for.  I didn&#x27;t like it at all.  Very cheap product and looks even cheaper on.  I think I will stick with my normal makeup.&lt;br /&gt;Would be good gifts for little girls for birthday parties or christmas stockings.</li>
            <li> I got this so I could use as a highlight. It work pretty good and its only a dollar so why not get it</li>
            <li> The best secret for getting that healthy glow!  This may be my all time favorite facial product!</li>
            <li> This is a really good eyeshadow primer and I like the way it smells.  It&#x27;s a great product for the price.  Can&#x27;t beat a dollar (or two).  I like the color all on its own as well, as a highlighter under the brows it looks really cute.</li>
            <li> I love this product! So glad I purchased it. I am loving all of the e.l.f. products, especially this one. This gives me a great glow, brightens up my face, its as important on my face as my foundation, I never want to forget to put this on. It&#x27;s great for when you are highlighting and contouring. I recommend this to everyone! The price is great and the product is great!! I&#x27;m hooked</li>
            <li> I was looking for a cream highlighter and this one was cheap and easy to get. The color is a pinky peach and has a ton of shimmer. The texture is quite thick, so a little goes a long way and then it dries down to almost a powder. These are whipped texture, but do not blend as easily as I would like. The shimmer stays all day, but you have to really control where it&#x27;s applied or you can look a little sweaty. It&#x27;s worth a try!</li>
            <li> Love this for a highlighter. It smells awesome, you only need a very small amount and it gives just the right amount of shimmer. I do wish the bottle held up better, but for the price, you can&#x27;t beat it.</li>

I bought one in August, and that one is coming apart where I squeezed it, so I bought a new one, but there&#x27;s still plenty left!</li>
            <li> Use just a little. The tiniest amt goes a long way. The secret is to blend blend blend. It&#x27;s a fab color and you can&#x27;t beat the price and value. I use it on the apple of my cheeks and blend up to highlight under my eyes.</li>
            <li> really pretty shimmering. if u have yellow undertones like me get the gold looking high light frm elf instead of this one. its very pretty though. subtle glow</li>
            <li> I use elf facial whip as an eye shadow primer. Eye shadow stays on all day and looks great. Just as good as any expensive professional shadow primer. Smells great and only $1 too! Comes in a tiny tube but a little goes a long way. Totally worth it!</li>
