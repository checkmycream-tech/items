    <ol>
            <li>Best sleep</li>
            <li>Not the best mask I&#x27;ve ever had</li>
            <li>Very happy with the purchase.  </li>
            <li>Arrived as promised and working out very good.  </li>
            <li>Works great.</li>
            <li>Great price and works well</li>
            <li>Who needs sleep apnea when they own this mask!  </li>
            <li>My brother-in-law says the resmed ultra mirage II is easily the &#x27;best&#x27; one out there.</li>
            <li>Good mask.</li>
            <li>Good luck waking up throughout the night resetting the mask on the frame.  </li>
            <li>The forehead guards are great and the adjustment straps are easier then most.</li>
            <li>me a very satisfied user.</li>
            <li>I have been using ResMed CPAP products for 10 year and I absolutely love this mask!</li>
            <li>It is cost effective.  </li>
            <li>Comfortable and very effective.</li>
            <li>Nice fit, price is good, just wish it was slightly more durable !</li>
            <li>It has a good construction and adjustments but could not get it to fit my face without it leaving marks on my nose.  </li>
            <li>I liked this mask and liked the way it fit.</li>
            <li>This is the most comfortable ResMed mask that I have ever used!</li>
            <li>Also the clips the straps attach to are much better than the Mirage FX&#x27;s slide over design.  </li>
            <li>I love this mask.</li>
            <li>Their description was helpful to make sure we got the size we needed.</li>
            <li>This one is okay.</li>
            <li>Better than any</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also the most durable -</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had my current Ultra Mirage II for about six years, and it&#x27;s still in excellent condition.</li>
            <li>, this IS pretty good.</li>
            <li>i bought this to repalce the mask that i got with the machine and its soooo much better and a lot more comfortable.</li>
            <li>I gave it to my son and he said it worked fine for him.  </li>
            <li>Masks are an important part, and I&#x27;m picky.</li>
            <li>It is comfortable, affordable, and came to my home on time.</li>
            <li>does not leak and is comfortable</li>
            <li>The design of the area the hose attaches though is far superior than that of the mirage FX, but it just doesn&#x27;t seem as comfortable.</li>
            <li>Same mask as i have been using for 10 years, but this one seems to not seal to my face good and tends to leak air a lot which causes me to wake up more.</li>
            <li>Excellent product that arrived at my door in less than three days after ordering it!</li>
            <li>The quality is lower then the headgear which come with my original CPAP.</li>
            <li>The lower straps connections have quick release snaps which enables quick and easy removal of mask.</li>
            <li>I can say without hesitation that the Ultra Mirage II is by far the most comfortable mask I&#x27;ve ever had.</li>
            <li>I liked my previous mask better than this one.  </li>
            <li>Great mask, I had to get used to the small area of the face it covers.  </li>
            <li>However, the first night I wore it</li>
            <li>Going into my first night, I thought, &amp;#34;Hey</li>
            <li>Thanks ResMed!</li>
            <li>Why pay more at a medical supply house?  </li>
            <li>Works great but the plastic seems a little cheap grade - that said, it works and has not broken after several months.</li>
            <li>Very good item, works as it should - just wish it was a little larger.</li>
            <li>so far, works well, came quickly</li>
            <li>Typical CPAP face piece but rugged in design, forehead and nasal connection pivots to facilitate accurate fit.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve ever had thanks to this mask.</li>
            <li>The ResMed headgear is working very well.</li>
            <li>Comfortable as possible.  </li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t have the mask in the proper size so this oversized mask has needed some tweeking and doesn&#x27;t quite fit.</li>
            <li>For this price, I expected better.</li>
            <li>I then went back to my old respironics and it felt SO much better.</li>
            <li>After a long day of smoking, this mask comfortable fits to my face and allows me to breath through the night.</li>
            <li>Next night, I adjusted it so more pressure was on my upper lip and also tried to loosen the headgear as much as I could.</li>
            <li>My husband has sleep apnea, and his old mask would leak and make funny noises.</li>
            <li>Quite amazing and cheaper than getting it from the local respiratory therapy supply center hooked to the hospital pharmacy where I would have also been required to meet and be charged to see the respiratory therapist on duty .</li>
            <li>The cusions are made of soft silicone which are actually quite comfortable.</li>
            <li>I chose this one mainly because I did not need a doctors RX to buy it</li>
            <li>High quality ResMed product.</li>
            <li>Normal quality.</li>
            <li>I was between sleep doctors and needed a new CPAP mask.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a pretty comfortable mask with few leaks, but I definitely prefer the nasal pillow masks.</li>
            <li>Old reliable.</li>
            <li>Hose portion swivels so that hose does not impair natural head movement.</li>
            <li>Overall the functionality is superior, but the comfort is not great.</li>
            <li>Its light weight no gel nose peice to replace and its a lot smaller than my other mask</li>
            <li>and I experienced no leaks, but difficult to sleep with this heavy item.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> so far, works well, came quickly</li>
            <li> This is the most comfortable ResMed mask that I have ever used! I have been using ResMed CPAP products for 10 year and I absolutely love this mask!</li>
            <li> Old reliable. Best sleep I&#x27;ve ever had thanks to this mask. Will continue to purchase.</li>
            <li> High quality ResMed product. Fits well. Works great. Delivery was prompt and timely. This is for the mask only. It does not include the headgear straps.</li>
            <li> I liked my previous mask better than this one.  I thought the frame along the forehead would provide more comfort, but in reality, it is a little uncomfortable.  The design of the area the hose attaches though is far superior than that of the mirage FX, but it just doesn&#x27;t seem as comfortable. Also the clips the straps attach to are much better than the Mirage FX&#x27;s slide over design.  Overall the functionality is superior, but the comfort is not great.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a pretty comfortable mask with few leaks, but I definitely prefer the nasal pillow masks.</li>
            <li> Spent a lot of money on this product.  It is the heaviest, most uncomfortable mask I&#x27;ve tried.  It does seal well and I experienced no leaks, but difficult to sleep with this heavy item.</li>
            <li> Great mask, I had to get used to the small area of the face it covers.  Just covers the nose.  However, the first night I wore it, I had two bumps appear on each side of my nose the very  next day.  I&#x27;ve been wearing it for about 3 weeks, and the bumps haven&#x27;t gone away yet.  Never had a bum on my nose before.  It sucks!</li>
            <li> Typical CPAP face piece but rugged in design, forehead and nasal connection pivots to facilitate accurate fit. Hose portion swivels so that hose does not impair natural head movement. Drawback is that it does not come with head harness and must be purchased separtately. The lower straps connections have quick release snaps which enables quick and easy removal of mask. The cusions are made of soft silicone which are actually quite comfortable.</li>
            <li> I have had C-PAP&#x27;s for over 10 years. Masks are an important part, and I&#x27;m picky. I love this mask. It is comfortable, affordable, and came to my home on time. The forehead guards are great and the adjustment straps are easier then most. I will definitely buy this mask again.</li>
            <li> Not the best mask I&#x27;ve ever had but I&#x27;m getting used to it. Would recommend it and I like the ability to adjust it.</li>
            <li> Comfortable and very effective.</li>
            <li> it didnt work for me and no returns... They just say sorry</li>
            <li> The ResMed headgear is working very well. The quality is lower then the headgear which come with my original CPAP. HOpe technology improves soon.</li>
            <li> i bought this to repalce the mask that i got with the machine and its soooo much better and a lot more comfortable.Its light weight no gel nose peice to replace and its a lot smaller than my other mask</li>
            <li> Item arrived timely and as described.</li>
            <li> Very happy with the purchase.  Mask came with head straps at a lower price than when I purchased just the mask previously.</li>
            <li> The entire mask system was needed for the patient, not just the frame. So, we reordered the entire sleep mask system.</li>
            <li> Arrived as promised and working out very good.  Their description was helpful to make sure we got the size we needed.</li>
            <li> Great price and works well</li>
            <li> Out of the gel masks.  This one is okay.</li>
            <li> Comfortable as possible.  Air tight.  Better than any I have owned previously.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t have the mask in the proper size so this oversized mask has needed some tweeking and doesn&#x27;t quite fit.</li>
            <li> I had been using a respironics comfort gel, but my mask was discontinued. My brother-in-law says the resmed ultra mirage II is easily the &#x27;best&#x27; one out there. Going into my first night, I thought, &amp;#34;Hey, this IS pretty good. No leaks.&amp;#34; I woke up with a bruise on one side of my upper nose. Next night, I adjusted it so more pressure was on my upper lip and also tried to loosen the headgear as much as I could. I woke up with an actual blister on the other side of my upper nose. I had to go without a mask for 2 nights while it healed. I then went back to my old respironics and it felt SO much better. This is the 4th mask I&#x27;ve used and I never had that trouble before. All I can say is that every face is different.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using a CPAP since 1994. I&#x27;ve had three different CPAP machines and about half a dozen masks. I can say without hesitation that the Ultra Mirage II is by far the most comfortable mask I&#x27;ve ever had. It&#x27;s also the most durable - I&#x27;ve had my current Ultra Mirage II for about six years, and it&#x27;s still in excellent condition. I have another one for a backup, but I&#x27;ve never had to use it. If a headgear clip does break - and that&#x27;s the part that usually breaks with a mask - the mask system is modular, so you only need to replace the clip that breaks. But the mask is so well made that I&#x27;ve never had to replace the clips.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Call me a very satisfied user.</li>
            <li> Good mask. does not leak and is comfortable</li>
            <li> the replacement mask I just ordered , the pillow seal ripped in less than two months .I have been using this same type &amp; brand  mask for 15 years and never had an issue with quality and never had a pillow seal rip either ....Is this an isolated case ? or is there quality declining ? Time will tell as I just ordered a replacement pillow seal for it ....</li>
            <li> Normal quality. Alot cheaper than buying in the local store. Well made.</li>
            <li> Works great but the plastic seems a little cheap grade - that said, it works and has not broken after several months.</li>
            <li> It makes me fall down</li>
            <li> My husband has sleep apnea, and his old mask would leak and make funny noises. This one seals well, and at the price, you can&#x27;t beat it. Much better than the expensive ones from the doctor.</li>
            <li> I liked this mask and liked the way it fit. I think I need a bigger size though</li>
            <li> Excellent product that arrived at my door in less than three days after ordering it! Quite amazing and cheaper than getting it from the local respiratory therapy supply center hooked to the hospital pharmacy where I would have also been required to meet and be charged to see the respiratory therapist on duty .</li>
            <li> Good luck waking up throughout the night resetting the mask on the frame.  I got to the point where it was a nightly event.  Who needs sleep apnea when they own this mask!  Note the one star was so I could review this plastic nightmare.</li>
            <li> After a long day of smoking, this mask comfortable fits to my face and allows me to breath through the night. No wheezing, snoring, or drooling. When Sunday morning arrives I am refreshed, and ready to teach a sermon, and have a little wine. Thanks ResMed!</li>
            <li> Mask was not working properly, tried to return it and come to find out, seller won&#x27;t exchange for working mask. Very disappointed. For this price, I expected better.</li>
            <li> Had issues keeping rubber gasket attached to nose piece? Nice fit, price is good, just wish it was slightly more durable !</li>
            <li> Very good item, works as it should - just wish it was a little larger.</li>
            <li> Why pay more at a medical supply house?  It works.  It is cost effective.  Amazon two-day shipping.  Enough said.</li>
            <li> Same mask as i have been using for 10 years, but this one seems to not seal to my face good and tends to leak air a lot which causes me to wake up more.</li>
            <li> I was between sleep doctors and needed a new CPAP mask.  It was so hard trying to figure out what type to get.  I chose this one mainly because I did not need a doctors RX to buy it (a lot of sites won&#x27;t sell you one without a doctors RX for it). I had used other ResMed masks in the past so I thought I would try this model.  I used it for several night and had to stop as it marking (rubbing badly) on the bridge of my nose. It has a good construction and adjustments but could not get it to fit my face without it leaving marks on my nose.  I gave it to my son and he said it worked fine for him.  So all I can say is it did not fit my face.</li>
            <li> I have used this mask for years it is the only one I will use</li>
