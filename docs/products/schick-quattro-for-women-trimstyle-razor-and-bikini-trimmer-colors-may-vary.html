            <li>The trim style end however is not as great as advertised.</li>
            <li>The razor is great quality too, Schick did not skimp there.   </li>
            <li>The handle was great for shaving, too.  </li>
            <li>Also, the trimmer is not that great.</li>
            <li>The razor works great but the trimmer doesn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li>lol..</li>
            <li>I agree with the great review</li>
            <li>/&gt;First, the razor itself works great.  </li>
            <li>And it worked great - for a couple of months.  </li>

            <li>I was so happy I didn&#x27;t have to buy a razor and a bikini trimmer.</li>
            <li>This is a great trimmer.</li>
            <li>Great tool for trimming the bikini area.</li>
            <li>but it works great</li>

            <li>This is a great product.</li>
            <li>It does everything that the description said it would and was a great gift for myself.</li>
            <li>This is a great trimmer for the bikini area.</li>
            <li>I just know it is absolutely great for trimming the hairs in the bikini area.</li>
            <li>This works best at the lowest setting since it has an easier time catching hairs at the lowest setting.</li>
            <li>Really great product.</li>
            <li>and I think that it was a great purchase.</li>
            <li>Works great for keeping &#x27;order&#x27; so to speak.</li>
            <li>It does a great job of getting rid of excess hair when used at 0 setting (with the cap taken off),and</li>
            <li>I am sure I can find another $10 to replace the thing!!</li>
            <li>LOVE THIS PRODUCT!!</li>
            <li>The razor part is very nice.</li>
            <li>Works well, very handy.</li>
            <li>This trimmer is amazing!</li>
            <li>and this makes me feel amazing without the pain!  </li>
            <li>the price was excellent the shipping was even better</li>
            <li>I am sure for others it would be best if all you want is a good trim or groom.</li>
            <li>Sleek design make this gem so easy to handle, and the colors are beautiful!</li>
            <li>Works awesome in the shower, you can get a super close shave, no nicks or cuts!</li>
            <li>but I LOVED the trimmer.</li>
            <li>It would, however, be quite good for trimming a beard or sideburns.      </li>
            <li>The trimmer works so good in the shower and it&#x27;s a close shave for my legs too.</li>
            <li>So, the bottom line is: LOVED the trimmer; no pulling, no irritation.</li>
            <li>The battery life is good as well.</li>
            <li>Initially I loved it.</li>
            <li>Does the job and good value.</li>
            <li>Good razor in and out of the shower</li>
            <li>they were good</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re looking for a good 2 in 1 razor/trimmer combo, I&#x27;d skip this one.</li>
            <li>I absolutely loved this razor...while it worked.  </li>
            <li>but it does do a good job of trimming bikini area.</li>
            <li>I suppose for the price, it&#x27;s a good deal</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s a really good razor where you don&#x27;t have to use shaving cream.</li>
            <li>Great in the shower, no razor burn, trimmed and cleaned nicely.</li>
            <li>The razor is really good</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s really good</li>
            <li>I got it in good time and it is everything it said it was</li>
            <li>I recieved The Schick Hydro Silk trimstyle razor from BzzAgent to try out for free and I love it!!!!!!</li>
            <li>This trimmer does a good job in trimming unruly and unsightly bikini and \\&quot;hooha\\&quot; hair.</li>
            <li>Just on your junk, remember to use some good shave cream.</li>
            <li>its good for the $.</li>
            <li>I am a medium-mantinance person in the sense that I like to look nice, smell nice, and be feminine and beautiful, however sometimes that just means putting on pearls with my jeans and a T-shirt.  </li>
            <li>The razor and trimmer functions are very easy to use and work great.</li>
            <li>Great smooth shave with the razor, and the trimmer works great, too.</li>
            <li>As a razor this is great, it didn&#x27;t feel like a razor, it was very smooth.</li>
            <li>The added vibration made for nice, clean trims.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am very happy with this product but prefer that it just be a trimmer.</li>
            <li>Maybe it would be a great thing for someone with more hair issues than I have.</li>
            <li>I have perfect success with the Gillette Venus even with the puny 3 blades and NO nicks/cuts</li>
            <li>I absolutely love the look or it!</li>
            <li>Love this razor!</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this razor!</li>

            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>No nicks or cuts, just a satisfied customer!  </li>
            <li>LOVE it!</li>
            <li>One more good thing about this razor is that its waterproof, I love that I can use it in the shower or out of the shower!</li>
            <li>Its an amazing trimmer</li>
            <li>This razor is amazing when it works.</li>
            <li>The razors are amazing.</li>
            <li>great deal when there is a coupon available too.</li>
            <li>The closeness of the shave is amazing.</li>
            <li>This is amazing.</li>
            <li>I do my own Brazilians at home</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t thrilled with the razor portion for shaving legs.  </li>
            <li>I liked it...until I tried using it again.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been meaning to try it again and give it another shot, but honestly, I can&#x27;t bring myself to do it.  </li>
            <li>to my dismay, I had to give up on loving this product.  </li>
            <li>So to my dismay, I had to give up on loving this product.  </li>
            <li>Since it&#x27;s a woman&#x27;s razor, my wife tried it and liked it.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried waxing and shaving, and this is a nice, painless alternative.</li>
            <li>I like to wax my arms, legs and underarms and am quite adept with the procedure.</li>
            <li>The razor does wonders, and that i really liked, but the trimmer, i honestly could do without.</li>
            <li>I bought this because I really like multipurpose devices, and this seemed great!  </li>
            <li>The blades feel nice and don&#x27;t cause burn or bleeding.</li>
            <li>but to each their own.</li>
            <li>and it came with its own batteries .</li>
            <li>This was a gift my daughter in law liked it.</li>
            <li>Nice trimmer and does well in the shower.  </li>
            <li>but all opinions are 100% my own.</li>
            <li>so I could get a nice grip on it when shaving.</li>
            <li>This is a nice combo product, with razor and trimmer all in one unit.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s nice to have a place to stash the razor without worry.</li>
            <li>The bikini trimmer was also really nice.</li>
            <li>It trims nicely and evenly too.</li>
            <li>Its just like having a barber shop in the comfort of your own home.</li>
            <li>I liked it so much I purchased one for my sister and my best friend.</li>
            <li>While I did not purchase this on Amazon I own it.</li>
            <li>but I find that a rechargeable AAA battery works just as well as the throwaway kind, though it does die sooner.</li>
            <li>Since I like to have absolutely no hair (lol), I use the razor to remove everything, and it&#x27;s great!</li>
            <li>This razor is very easy to use.</li>
            <li>The moisturizing bar on the razor side made for a very easy shave.</li>
            <li>It has 3 adjustable levels for trimming and is very easy to hold and maneuver.</li>
            <li>I have never once cut or nicked myself and it is very easy to use.</li>
            <li>Very easy</li>
            <li>The trimmer is perfect and the other end is great.</li>
            <li>This is the perfect razor to seriously get the perfect shave!</li>
            <li>I actually liked it better for my underarm area.  </li>
            <li>Whether shaving her legs or underarms, or trimming those sensitive areas, it works flawlessly.  </li>
            <li>but so far am impressed.</li>
            <li>I like to be able to shave and trim with this handy two-in-one tool.</li>
            <li>I have also used the trimmer (after cleaning of course) on my husbands neck and around his ears and face and honestly they are WAY better than all of the trimmers he has ever owned.</li>
            <li>My legs feel nice and smooth afterwards!</li>
            <li>(I&#x27;m not a terribly hairy person) which affords me a taste of the ever amazing college hygienic</li>
            <li>I loved the fact that it was waterproof and the razor was nice, but there is no way that I would recommend something like this that rusts as quickly as it did.</li>
            <li>It turns out that the Quattro has the nice 4 blades which is better than the Gillette Venus, but then it also has these 2 guard wires that run on top of and perpendicular to the razor blades.  </li>
            <li>Very fast shipping and a great price.</li>
            <li>It worked great at first, and if youre someplace where you need a trimmer</li>
            <li>I have tried many, many razors and this is the best by far.  </li>
            <li>The trimmer worked great the first time, but that&#x27;s about it.  </li>
            <li>Pretty great.</li>
            <li>Love this easy to travel with does the job!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to hold and gives an amazing shave with its 5 blades.</li>
            <li>The blade on the top however works like a charm, pretty great deal, just make sure you buy a box of Schick blades to replace them as needed.</li>
            <li>I received this for free as part of a promotion from the brand, and I love it!</li>
            <li>The trimmer is nice, and the moisturizing strips make it work just fine for me.</li>
            <li>I am giving it four stars because it could be very useful on trips and vacation, but I do hope they upgrade the trimmer to something better!</li>
            <li>and I love them.  </li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t be a skeptic, it is better then venus if you&#x27;re wondering.</li>
            <li>The results are lovely.</li>
            <li>As a bikini trimmer this is lacking in so many levels.</li>
            <li>I like my Venus razor better.</li>
            <li>My wife reviewed this product and found the trimmer more gimick than function.  </li>
            <li>or I&#x27;m better off getting a bikini wax.</li>
            <li>I say partly because I&#x27;m still using the product in search of a better one.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love that I can use it in the shower.</li>
            <li>I love this razor.</li>
            <li>now, and having cleaned many a trimmer, I am completely confident that I cleaned the trimmer thoroughly, still it would not work.</li>
            <li>This time I was getting a bit fed up with it and went out thinking I&#x27;d look at men&#x27;s trimmers, since I&#x27;ve started to suspect that the quality is better than in products made for women.</li>
            <li>For the more practical buyer considering the \\&quot;long-run\\&quot; price, you might want to shop around for something nicer.</li>
            <li>I used the trimmer BEFORE I got in the shower, and was extremely satisfied with it.  </li>
            <li>I bought it more for the trimmer than the razor, but decided to give it a try as well.  </li>
            <li>Schick Quattro is one of my favorite razors.  </li>
            <li>I love the 4 blades &amp; it does a close shave on your legs.  </li>
            <li>i love it.</li>
            <li>the trimmer is also ok however when using the razor I keep pushing the trimmer button and would freak out that I might cut myself.  </li>
            <li>What&#x27;s not to love???     </li>
            <li>For a razor blade that I got simply for the bikini trimmer, this is an awesome razor to have.</li>
            <li>I love it</li>
            <li>Considering it has many blades, it didn&#x27;t cause me any irritation.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve used this thing SO many times.</li>
            <li>The look of it is not that appealing.</li>
            <li>With the economy the way it is, it should be priced more affordably.</li>
            <li>The razor and trimmer combo concept is fantastic though!</li>
            <li>And it does shave smoothly and trim nicely.</li>
            <li>They need to do something about that because I am sure that the Trimstyle would sell well if they made a better razor.</li>
            <li>:)\\&quot;</li>
            <li>This does the job better.</li>
            <li>I love that you can trim and do close shaving.</li>
            <li>a woman.....&#x3D;)</li>
            <li>I found that wetting the blade makes ut work better.</li>
            <li>looking forward to more years with my trimming razor :)</li>
            <li>although the razor cap slides on from the end instead of over the top (this might be better.</li>
            <li>It seems more secure).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This made the more precision shaving which was to come a lot easier.</li>
            <li>It sounds like an electric razor and if you feel the need to hide what you&#x27;re doing, make sure to have the shower on or to be home alone.</li>
            <li>that well--it was okay, but</li>
            <li>I LOVE this razor trimmer combination product.  </li>
            <li>: I&#x27;ve bought the women&#x27;s version of this many times</li>
            <li>I have used Schick razors for many years</li>
            <li>I love that it adjusts so you can choose the length/closeness of the shave.</li>
            <li>Will update after 6 months which seems to be the self destruct date of most</li>
            <li>I love how they made the razor with a stand</li>
            <li>I love the trimmer, except the guard is a MUST.</li>
            <li>Glad I purchased this item.  </li>
            <li>:)</li>
            <li>and I love it.</li>
            <li>Favorite razor.</li>
            <li>I love it.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t cut myself or get as many bumps.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>love it, it makes everything about grooming easier.</li>
            <li>and you have to move your wrist and make sure you don&#x27;t cut yourself.</li>
            <li>will admit I do get more ingrown hairs with this razor though.</li>
            <li>Yes, it is wider than most, but I find I like the wider handle.</li>
            <li>I love this razor set.</li>
            <li>Love this.  </li>
            <li>Love that it came with a AAA battery and a shower holder as well.</li>
            <li>Does what it needs to, but I wish it had more power...</li>
            <li>I read many of the&lt;br /&gt;reviews</li>
            <li>Love the ease of just flipping over to do both jobs.</li>
            <li>And I love the attachment to stick it to the shower wall...</li>
            <li>A four pack is more than what I paid for the razor.</li>
            <li>The trimmer is ok.</li>
            <li>I love</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m glad I found it on Amazon cus</li>
            <li>I thought the trimmer would be a bit better.</li>
            <li>I love the idea, but at this price, you aren&#x27;t going to get a quality trimmer.</li>
            <li>I love the convenience of having it in the shower and trimming whenever I notice the need.</li>
            <li>I love this razor.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this bikini trimmer.</li>
            <li>Love the razor too.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a nice, smooth, razor bump free shave!</li>
            <li>I love what it does, so I&#x27;ll probably keep</li>
            <li>:)</li>
            <li>I LOVE the holder for the shower.</li>
            <li>I used this razor for years and was very happy with it until it finally gave out</li>
            <li>Love this .</li>
            <li>:)</li>
            <li>The cap for the trimmer is cute and I love the holder for gadget.</li>
            <li>My mother wants one now also and will proudly be ordering one for her.</li>
            <li>many others who bought this razor, my trimmer has died.</li>
            <li>Okay--</li>
            <li>love that it&#x27;s waterproof.  </li>
            <li>I love that it is waterproof and can be used in the shower.</li>
            <li>I love this razor.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s okay.</li>
            <li>It does the job, but it isn&#x27;t her favorite.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s okay for a razor.  </li>
            <li>I get a nice clean shave every time.</li>
            <li>The shape of it makes it very easy to manage the razor and trimming turns to be smooth.</li>
            <li>The razor doesn&#x27;t move nicely, it glides right over, no fear in shaving around the knees now!</li>
            <li>a normal razor can&#x27;t go and does a great job.  </li>
            <li>this product was good the first time.</li>
            <li>It uses 1 single AAA battery and is waterproof which ladies lets face it, WIN!</li>
            <li>On a positive note, the unit is water proof and the battery lasts for a good while.</li>
            <li>This a great razor and trimmer but keep the trimmer out of water because if you do it wears out pretty quick.</li>
            <li>Perfect little device, I use the trimmer part about 1X per week or so and the razor to shave every-other-day and replace the blade about every 3 weeks, maybe more often in the summer when I shave my legs more.  </li>
            <li>It allows for a more accurate shave.</li>
            <li>I personally end up in the jacuzzi/pool about once or twice a week, so this trimmer is ideal for me</li>
            <li>ok, I think this is SCHICK cheap trick to force people to buy Razor end refills, will not buy again from them.</li>
            <li>My legs have never felt more smooth and moisturized after shaving.</li>
            <li>Otherwise good, no pinching, and the batteries have lasted very well.</li>
            <li>When I say this with a Bikini Trimmer on the other end thought it was awesome.  </li>
            <li>Other than that it is perfect!</li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t even consider any other type or brand, this works perfectly for legs, underarms and bikini area.</li>
            <li>Perfect set: shaver on one side, trimmer on the other.</li>
            <li>The trimmer on the other hand is great!</li>
            <li>I was much more impressed with it the first time, but the second one doesn&#x27;t catch my hairs as well.</li>
            <li>It won&#x27;t do an easy great job, but it does a good job with a little effort.</li>
            <li>She also found it easy on the legs and the underarms.  </li>
            <li>Clogged EASILY.</li>
            <li>And besides it is easily replacable.</li>
            <li>It is easy to use.</li>
            <li>electric face razor- Easy instructions and easy to use</li>
            <li>Trimmer has 3 settings, glides easy without nicking as the slider acts as a guard.</li>
            <li>it looked easy to use</li>
            <li>Easy to store as well since it comes with a holder that has suction cups, allowing you to keep it within reach in the shower.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s slim design fits well in my hand and is easy to use.</li>
            <li>It was easy to hold and use.</li>
            <li>and I lose things like that easily, lol.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The problem is relatively easy to solve however.</li>
            <li>Do not waste your money, the company had some good marketing and cute ads with funky music-wow.</li>
            <li>This makes it easy to trim hair down to almost non noticeable levels and if i don&#x27;t want to shave the rest them awesome!</li>
            <li>Do note that Schick now has a much more attractive version of the same trimmer available for Men:</li>
            <li>The men&#x27;s Quattro is a much better, more robust razor, and for a bikini trimmer, both the Bikini Baby and the Bikini Touch trimmers are infinitely more maneuverable and so much easier to use.</li>
            <li>I am used to using the higher end razors with the nice soap bar attached to the razor</li>
            <li>(I&#x27;m sure it was a board room full of execs who said, \\&quot;Hey</li>
            <li>For that purpose, it does fine.  </li>
            <li>I dont change the battery often and it works just fine.</li>
            <li>Still, a fine product.</li>
            <li>and it still functions fine.</li>
            <li>It took no time to use it without any knicks and gave a very smooth and fresh result.  </li>
            <li>This is an awesome little razor and trimmer combined.</li>
            <li>(I got this free as a promotion from the company)</li>
            <li>Honestly, I didnt really like it.</li>
            <li>It makes your legs silky smooth after using the razor as well.</li>
            <li>If you are looking for a great razor, then pick this up but the regular razor, not with the trimmer.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know if the power button is cheaply constructed or what.  </li>
            <li>Just don&#x27;t expect a baby smooth shave in the bikini area.  </li>
            <li>--I&#x27;m not seeking a baby smooth shave, I just don&#x27;t want to don a bathing suit looking like Yeti.  </li>
            <li>this this is really nice, Shaves well and the trimmer really works.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Otherwise, I&#x27;m happy with the price and product overall.  </li>
            <li>I was still plenty smooth after using it.  </li>
            <li>A GREAT BUY ESPECIALLY WITH THIS PRICE</li>
            <li>You can tell by the sound of the razor if it&#x27;s time to change the battery.  </li>
            <li>I was fortunate to receive this from Amazon Vine in return for a review.  </li>
            <li>I was suprised how simple the razor was to use and that I experienced no rash or bumps.</li>
            <li>I bought this for the trimmer and it does a fantastic job.</li>
            <li>Also, the razor doesn&#x27;t work as well as the cheap, disposable ones.</li>
            <li>push the suctions cups to secure once a week.</li>
            <li>I even tried using tweezers to pull hair out to free up the blade.</li>
            <li>Electric shaver end is cheap and docent cut hair</li>
            <li>The razor is a VERY close shave and leaves your legs feeling like silk and the trimmer is AMAZING.</li>
            <li>My legs do not feel smooth like they do when I use a mens Gilette Fusion.</li>
            <li>I was not as happy with the razor part and have switched back to the Hydro so the dual function is lost on me.</li>
            <li>I got it free through bzzagent</li>
            <li>I got a smooth, close shave</li>
            <li>I got invited to try it for free</li>
            <li>I imagine that this would be fantastic for a guy too since the guard is good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I got it as a free sample</li>
            <li>This razor/trimmer combo provides smooth, close results.</li>
            <li>Comfortable close cut.</li>
            <li>The size adjustments are of a good length if you still want a natural look that&#x27;s groomed.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a comfort-first, jeans &amp; t-shirt most days, too busy chasing my 1-yr-old to fuss a lot with a beauty routine kind of girl.  </li>
            <li>So far so good.</li>
            <li>One of the better women&#x27;s razors I have used, gives a nice close, soft, clean shave.</li>
            <li>Like many other women, I thought this would be a great, time-saving product.  </li>
            <li>I am able to keep the trimmer happy by cleaning it every other time, but it is a pain to have to do this so often.  </li>
            <li>My wife says that the trimmer is very useful.</li>
            <li>When you turn on the trimmer, it buzzes very powerfully and trims well.  </li>
            <li>and I have to say that this one is much cheaper and does just as good of a job with the added bonus of having a great razor on the other end!</li>
            <li>The AAA battery is super easy to replace.</li>
            <li>Quick and easy</li>
            <li>I love how it&#x27;s a 2-in-one making it a very convenient purchase!</li>
            <li>For ten dollars, I couldn&#x27;t be more pleased. :-)</li>
            <li>Was excited to get and was excited to use.</li>
            <li>Also, the trimmer wasn&#x27;t user friendly, didn&#x27;t seem to work well at all.</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t sure what to expect the first time I tried this, now its a must have in my shower and bathroom.  </li>
            <li>It works fine for a quick clean up</li>
            <li>Cut just the right amount of with trimmer for a clean look for this upcoming summer!</li>
            <li>The large button for ejecting the razor head is nice when you want to change heads, but if you steady your razor by placing your index finger along the top of the razor while you shave, the head pops off.  </li>
            <li>I have always loved the regular Schick Quattro Razor and was excited to try this version of it as a free sample.</li>
            <li>just felt like after a couple years A new one would be nice...</li>
            <li>It didnt get as clean of a shave as venus.</li>
            <li>I contacted Schick and they sent me a list of ways to clean the trimmer.</li>
            <li>crossing my fingers hoping this means they&#x27;ve actually updated the model and made it better, but I kind of doubt it.    </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not as clean or as close as I&#x27;d like..</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had many trimmers and electric razors, and this is by far my favorite.</li>
            <li>honestly if that&#x27;s the only flaw I find, no harm no foul :).</li>
            <li>It works great for trimming, I knocked off one star because it stopped working unexpectedly when I really needed it.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a good option if you don&#x27;t like filling your bathroom with \\&quot;girly\\&quot; pink and sometimes the price is more affordable than the version for women.</li>
            <li>experience with Shick&#x27;s new Quattro For Women Trimstyle was pretty good.</li>
            <li>I was impressed how comfortable it is to hold in my very small hands and the comfort of the product.</li>
            <li>And yes, there is nothing special about the razor.  </li>
            <li>It is very handy for shaving underarms dry if you don&#x27;t need a close shave.</li>
            <li>I was more then surprised and excited about how my legs felt, and looked after shaving!</li>
            <li>I use this mainly for my arm pits and lady bits because I was very prone to razor burn, and the trimmer gets surprisingly close.</li>
            <li>The razor is very good, but seems to run into some trouble if you don&#x27;t trim beforehand.</li>
            <li>I liked this product so much that after the first one broke on me (would no longer turn on), I went and bought another.</li>
            <li>The only good thing about this is the quattro razor.  </li>
            <li>I love it so much it works</li>
            <li>I really wanted to love this product.  </li>
            <li>The trimmer is not great to use on its own without the razor since it doesnt trim very neatly, but its perfect for my purposes since I just use it to shorten the hairs before shaving.</li>
            <li>Love how they made grooming so much easier and convenient.</li>
            <li>I tried swirling it around in a basin full of water.</li>
            <li>I love this product so much</li>
            <li>I love the bikini trimmer, it works very well.</li>
            <li>love the straight razor, use it every day under the arms.</li>
            <li>Truely hassle</li>
            <li>trimmer is good because it has 3 settings, depending on how short of a trim you want.</li>
            <li>, I recommend it because it&#x27;s cheap, mostly effective, and comfortable enough to use.</li>
            <li>While the plastic piece for the trimmer doesn&#x27;t really do much (it works better with it off)</li>
            <li>The trimmer is painless, perfect, and makes everything down below look very cleaned up.</li>
            <li>With this trimmer I was able to trim up the &amp;#34;bush&amp;#34; (lol) in the shower and get right to waxing when I got out of the shower and dried off.</li>
            <li>I love the soft grip handle, which makes it easy to hold and manuevor.</li>
            <li>Would have liked extra disposable blade but for the money its fine.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a handy little trimmer, works in the shower (even with the water running over it), and it&#x27;s an amazing price for what you get.  </li>
            <li>Love the feeling of soft, hair free legs against bed sheets like myself?</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s super convenient</li>
            <li>The razor is adequate in my opinion for a women&#x27;s razor.  </li>
            <li>super close.</li>
            <li>The trimmer itself is the perfect size- not too wide and offers 4 settings to trim hair.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been a loyal Gillette Venus user for years, but when I saw this product, I had to try it.  </li>
            <li>The razor part seems great with the 4-blade razor, and the bikini trimmer actually does work very well</li>
            <li>I love how the handle is wider than most razors (I have larger hands).</li>
            <li>Quickly kills AAA batteries</li>
            <li>i did not realize it comes off to get super close.</li>
            <li>im hoping to purchase another to try out the super close shave to see if it helps.</li>
            <li>I have to go over the skin many many times until i cut all the hair in that area at the same length.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The razor dulled quickly, and did not work as well as my mens version that I already had.  </li>
            <li>There&#x27;s three adjustable lengths, but I remove the comb to get a close and quick trim.</li>
            <li>: most of the time, less than ten dollars seems fair price for 3 months of effective bikini trimming to me.</li>
            <li>just though &amp;#34;eh, whatever.&amp;#34; I think they could have done a better job with the razor, as it just doesn&#x27;t seem to be sharp or effective.</li>
            <li>First and foremost I received this product for free from Bzzagent.com.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve now had this 2nd one for about 3 years and am very satisfied.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very satisfied, I&#x27;ve only pinced myself with it once</li>
            <li>First off I received this razor for free in return for my unbiased review.</li>
            <li>Cheaper than most other razors of this type which is nice.</li>
            <li>I bought another one though because for the price two years might be a reasonable amount of operating time and it&#x27;s so easy to use and handy for those of us who like to keep it neat but don&#x27;t feel the need to be bare.</li>
            <li>Eight dollars for a new Schick Trimstyle, or Thirty-eight for a lovely Norelco.     </li>
            <li>This is my new favorite razor.</li>
            <li>The trimmer is easy and fast to use.</li>
            <li>Question: why would you keep the same (disposable) shaver for more than three months anyway?!?</li>
            <li>i can&#x27;t find this item in the stores, very nifty!!</li>
            <li>With the cost of blades it is almost more economical to just buy a new unit anyway.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It is easy to get into the \\&quot;crevices\\&quot; and is smooth action.</li>
            <li>It was easy to hold on to, and I didn&#x27;t have the problem others talked about with resting their finger at the top and having the blade come off, but I think that&#x27;s because all of us hold our razors differently.     </li>
            <li>It seems to be a great concept, you can get all your shaving/trimming needs done in the shower with just one little device.  </li>
            <li>This is a great little bikini trimmer for about 10 bucks.</li>
            <li>but I just didn&#x27;t think that either the trimmer worked very well or that the razor gave a comfortable shave</li>
            <li>I still like my Schick Intuition better because I don&#x27;t like having the extra step of fussing with shaving cream in the shower, but I don&#x27;t have any huge complaints about this one.  </li>
            <li>She likes the feel of this razor and says it does a fast, smooth shave.  </li>
            <li>This is an amazing razor/ trimmer, especially for the cost.  </li>
            <li>it gave me a really close silky smooth shave.</li>
            <li>Totally worth the money.</li>
            <li>The trimmer was rarely used.</li>
            <li>Fun product to have.  </li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t remember the last time I was so satisfied with a product; it&#x27;s now as indispensable to me as my dishwasher or bicycle.</li>
            <li>I thought it was worth a try.</li>
            <li>I will probably buy another one soon just to have a fresh start.</li>
            <li>At under $10, it&#x27;s worth the price.</li>
            <li>i bought this razor because I liked the idea of having two different tools in one.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li>The bikini trimmer is a great extra; I use it frequently.</li>
            <li>it is well worth your money.</li>
            <li>this is the perfect gadget its quiet enough so it does not scare the living daylights out of my cats and it has just enough vibration for them to love it.</li>
            <li>Really worth every penny.</li>
            <li>This one isn&#x27;t worth the time.  </li>
            <li>So if you just want the trimmer, it would be worth the buy.</li>
            <li>I suppose I shouldn&#x27;t be surprised that the battery-operated trimmer attached to this disposable razor is mostly a gimmick.</li>
            <li>It is totally worth the money.</li>
            <li>razor is pretty sweet too, no complaints there.  </li>
            <li>the razor part isnt as good as I expected.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t submurse the razor in the water, and I don&#x27;t abuse it, and I keep fresh batteries in it -</li>
            <li>This is the first one I&#x27;ve tried and I can over all say it&#x27;s not bad.  </li>
            <li>Shaves better than many of the other disposables I have tried.</li>
            <li>The winter is mild here for the first time in a decade</li>
            <li>The only grip is with most razors is that is dulls out quickly, but that is a fault of most razors with 4 or more blades.  </li>
            <li>Make sure you have plenty of battery left to do a clean job.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a good enough razor for me, the trimmer is decent.  </li>
            <li>Therefore this was just right for me.</li>
            <li>it arrived right on time</li>
            <li>that well, but maybe I am just not using it right.  </li>
            <li>and I was right.</li>
            <li>The reviews seemed favorable and the price was right, so I went ahead and bought this.</li>
            <li>The handle was just the right size</li>
            <li>I think 3 1/2 would be about right.</li>
            <li>The trimmer is the right width to shape that area.</li>
            <li>color is ok, not a big fan of the purple color/shade, it&#x27;s not ugly, just not a color that I prefer.</li>
            <li>This makes the whole thing waterproof and since I am not a fan of dry shaving, this is good.</li>
            <li>Fortunately I have large animal clippers (for my large animals)</li>
            <li>The trimmer works great and is convenient to use because it is small and cordless.  </li>
            <li>THE RAZOR WAS FAIR BUT NOT WORTH THE PRICE I PAID FOR IT.</li>
            <li>It works WONDERS for all the wonderful areas of your body you might want to trim, never cuts delicate skin, always an even cut (don&#x27;t let the batteries go low, or you&#x27;ll end up PULLING and not cutting!</li>
            <li>On the other hand, the razor offers a fairly close and comfortable shave.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t tried it in the shower yet, but it works amazing when you are dry.  </li>
            <li>The price point for this body and the razor replacements are less than the competitors, making it a bargain and a good</li>
            <li>Does an awesome job trimming your hair down before shaving so the head doesnt get clogged up with long hair.</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have already bought one for a friend who is more of the hippie persuasion (if you know what I mean) and she claimed the guard settings were great in giving options that actually suited almost everyone, including those of the more natural sentiment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I liked the first one so much that when it recently lost it&#x27;s ability to trim my hairs in the bikini area I bought another one.</li>
            <li>The trimmer takes one AAA battery but it kills the battery life very fast, plus it doesn&#x27;t trim the way i want it too.</li>
            <li>The razor is fine but for me this item is all about the trimmer, which has a guard so that you can protect &amp; avoid sensitive areas.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The Venus does a better job IMO, and there are several other men&#x27;s razors that give a much more comfortable shave.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t wear a bathing suit every day or even every week, and a special razor for the occasion just doesn&#x27;t seem like it is important enough to me.  </li>
            <li>I love the silky smoothness it left my legs feeling</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s much better than having to use two different razors!</li>
            <li>There are better and longer lasting options out there.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m irritated in more ways than one, and plan to demand my money back.</li>
            <li>The only thing I would do better is put a shave bar around the razor so I wouldn&#x27;t have to use shaving creme at all.</li>
            <li>This product works well and is exactly as advertised.  </li>
            <li>There are many complaints of the same, therefore Schick is aware and yet continue to sell this faulty product.</li>
            <li>I need to shave daily and most razors</li>
            <li>The first time I used this bikini trimmer</li>
            <li>;)</li>
            <li>Very convenient!  </li>
            <li>first time I used the razor part on my legs, my grip kept accidentally pushing the button for the trimmer, so it would vibrate as I was shaving.  </li>
            <li>The first time it quit within a couple of months.  </li>
            <li>At first I thought it was just a fluke, but now since two of them have bit the dust, I&#x27;m no longer going to buy them.</li>
            <li>The trimming was not uncomfortable at all and did not nick me.</li>
            <li>I have had this product since they first came out</li>
            <li>the first one I bought lasted a year and then it broke</li>
            <li>With the trimmer, I was able to trim several months&#x27; growth of hair in 5 - 10 minutes</li>
            <li>the Quattro seemed to miss consistently.</li>
            <li>It really works!  </li>
            <li>Works really well for the price!</li>
            <li>Really like it!</li>
            <li>It gets pretty close, glides well.  </li>
            <li>I really like this styler!  </li>
            <li>This was exactly what I was looking for and worked exactly as described.</li>
            <li>My first one lasted exactly one use.</li>
            <li>The razor is ok, but I really only use it because it&#x27;s there.  </li>
            <li>The ONLY flaw I have found is that the trimmer/razor doesn&#x27;t come with a holder for it like most razors do, but</li>
            <li>It only uses one battery, it&#x27;s waterproof, and it attaches to most Schick blades.  </li>
            <li>the first time i purchased it, it lasted for about 6 months.</li>
            <li>It stopped working after the first use.</li>
            <li>cats have claimed my first one.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m pretty well convinced this has</li>
            <li>You&#x27;d be SO much better off getting an actual electric razor</li>
            <li>Makes this daunting task much easier!</li>
            <li>First, the trimmer does not cut hair from the first time.</li>
            <li>It worked okay once, then it seemed like it didn&#x27;t have enough power.</li>
            <li>First of all- as a leg shaver, it doesnt shave closely at all.</li>
            <li>It is a regular razor on one end, used for shaving legs and arms, and a trimmer for the more delicate/bikini area.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The first one I bought lasted about 2 months, then died.</li>
            <li>it is great quality and does not break (at least not for me).</li>
            <li>but this thing is pretty</li>
            <li>The first one of these I bought worked better than the second one I bought.</li>
            <li>The first one died after about 6 months of use (replacing the battery didn&#x27;t help -</li>
            <li>I was able to get this with a coupon, so the cost was equal to what it would be to purcase another razor without the trimmer function.</li>
            <li>After cleaning and drying be sure to oil the blades (I use a simple 3-in-1 oil you can get at any hardware store).</li>
            <li>The trimmer is fantastic and worked wonders while I&#x27;m 8 months pregnant and have to maneuver around a big belly to shave anywhere.</li>
            <li>I normally use the Schick Intuition because it&#x27;s so quick to use in the shower and do any bikini trimming by hand.  </li>
            <li>Japan cosme recommended products, very good, just a little big sound〜</li>
            <li>I got this because it was cheaper than other reusable razors out there, and I thought the trim tool would be nice.</li>
            <li>It works well on flat areas, but it can be challenging to use on curved areas.</li>
            <li>I think I am on my 2nd one in a year or so, so they last a pretty good time.</li>
            <li>While the overall design, ergonomics, and razors are really good, the engine that powers the trimmer appears to be of extremely low quality.</li>
            <li>The first thing I have to say about this is that the suction cup doesn&#x27;t work very well for holding it to the shower wall.  </li>
            <li>Love this razor, and the battery lasts a long time in it too.</li>
            <li>and then you can go back for more precise styling later.</li>
            <li>It will be much easier to consistently take care of the bikini area.of the bikini area.</li>
            <li>will say that I am a huge fan of waxing but at $65 for a brazillian (and the hassle of keeping the area ingrown hair free), I looked for other options.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Schick blades where as usual good</li>
            <li>Razor and trimmer, small, works well with longer (1 inch) hairs, Schick is a good brand&lt;</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to travel with and it last a while.</li>
            <li>Finally, I have found a razor that does the job easily without tearing up my legs.</li>
            <li>I find it works better dry because the water seems to clog the blades...</li>
            <li>Very clever idea.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;However, I feel this is a strong tool overall.</li>
            <li>If you run out of razor blades, a close trim will certainly tide you over.</li>
            <li>While it&#x27;s more comfortable to hold while shaving due to the thickness, it&#x27;s also bulkier and more stiff than I like in a razor.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, it works fine - except for my mysterious motor failures.</li>
            <li>but it is a pretty decent trimmer.</li>
            <li>This waterproof razor and trimmer is pretty decent as a trimmer.</li>
            <li>Left my legs and underarms very smooth and soft with no irritation.  </li>
            <li>And, amazingly, their is little to no razor burn, even on the bikini area.  </li>
            <li>Part of this could very well be LA metal filled hard water, but it seems like something like this should hold up a bit better.</li>
            <li>, otherwise the 5 year old one was still going strong (with new a new battery every 5 or 6 months).</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s waterproof, the 4-blade razor gives you a very close shave (when it&#x27;s not nicking you), and the bikini trimmer works very well, and the holder is actually very functional and works well.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s waterproof, the 4-blade razor gives you a very close shave (when it&#x27;s not nicking you), and the bikini trimmer works very well, and the holder is actually very functional and works well.  </li>
            <li>It is too much of a hassle to send back and too cheap for me to even care anymore.  </li>
            <li>It trim very well.</li>
            <li>I bought one of these from my local Target and it&#x27;s fantastic.</li>
            <li>The waterproff feature is a real plus.  </li>
            <li>I took the cap off and trimmed my whole bikini area</li>
            <li>The bikini trimmer is wide and bulky and requires some interesting contortions in the shower to use.  </li>
            <li>I have to say that this razor/ trimmer didn&#x27;t really impress me.</li>
            <li>I also really like the attached trimmer for my bikini area.  </li>
            <li>Very convenient to have the two products combined into one.  </li>
            <li>I used the guard on the lowest setting, and much to my surprise</li>
            <li>I prefer a really close trim rather than shaving because I don&#x27;t like the itchy feeling shaving leaves,</li>
            <li>The whole razor is waterproof.  </li>
            <li>Both the shaver and trimmer also resisted rusting very well</li>
            <li>It disapponted me as I really want to have a trimmer to work well.</li>
            <li>It really does do what&#x27;s needed and there&#x27;s no fuss involved.</li>
            <li>, cord draped over my leg, hoping to achieve straight lines-</li>
            <li>thanks a lot.</li>
            <li>So I very reluctantly pay the money for it and the cartridges.</li>
            <li>Because it shaves and trims, the Schick Quattro for Women is very versatile.  </li>
            <li>I have used the Schick Quattro razor for women alone, and it doesn&#x27;t shave very well.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;That said, the trimmer is really good--dry.</li>
            <li>I have manual bikini trimmer that really doesn&#x27;t work well at all.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t used the trimmer much yet</li>
            <li>I was really hoping for a closer trim.</li>
            <li>I was just really hoping the trimmer would provide a closer shave than it did.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t really like the tricky job of shaving my bikini area</li>
            <li>The Quattro allows you to get a very close shave.</li>
            <li>The razor is comfortable to hold, although this trimstyle model is bulkier than the regular quattro.</li>
            <li>Much cheaper on Amazon when I ordered it.</li>
            <li>It also doesn&#x27;t trim very well.  </li>
            <li>it really was a razor&amp;#34; when I took it out.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so much cheaper here than a drugstore or HEB.</li>
            <li>Works really well.</li>
            <li>But to my surprise, that part would move along with my curves, so I didn&#x27;t have to worry about much.</li>
            <li>and it works really well.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a shame because this product worked really well...</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>It is very practical.</li>
            <li>Haha.</li>
            <li>I sent it back to the company and got another one for free.</li>
            <li>br /&gt;it wasn&#x27;t a lot of money and the razor works very nicely.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I was gentle on my skin, but the product didn&#x27;t do what others promised.</li>
            <li>Couldn&#x27;t get a close shave at all.&lt;br /&gt;However, these things really lack durability.</li>
            <li>so I can&#x27;t really complain.</li>
            <li>It works very well, and for a reasonable price.</li>
            <li>This works really well for me.</li>
            <li>The suction cups hold fast and I&#x27;ve had no issues with it at all.</li>
            <li>Definitely can&#x27;t use it in the shower like they make it sound like you can.  </li>
            <li>And it is not like I return things very often either.</li>
            <li>was really hesitant to try this razor.</li>
            <li>I dont want to spend that much money on just replacement razors, so I just use the bikini trimmer now and use a disposable razor.</li>
            <li>This item is really all about the trimmer for me.  </li>
            <li>I really do get a close shave that lasts me up to 2 weeks</li>
            <li>Its also fast as hell and takes about 5 minutes for the lady scaping.  </li>
            <li>This works really well and makes shaving a breeze.</li>
            <li>she wanted such a thing she wouls steal my beard trimmer which works far better</li>
            <li>I was actually quite a bit nervous to use the trimmer down there, but I tried it and it works pretty good.</li>
            <li>Overall I think it is worth the money since it doesn&#x27;t cost that much more than a regular razor and the trimmer does a decent job.  </li>
            <li>My first on burnt out when I tried to put a new battery in</li>
            <li>many other women, I tend to go into &#x27;hibernation&#x27; mode in the winter when my legs are covered by pants or tights at all times, and I don&#x27;t shave very often.</li>
            <li>Maybe other people have better luck with using it.  </li>
            <li>Maybe other people have better luck with using it.  </li>
            <li>It is also pretty loud, which isn&#x27;t all that important, but enough for me to comment on.</li>
            <li>rested.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The razor takes the same 4-blade replacement as the original Quattro for Women (so you can use any blades you may have)</li>
            <li>What I really enjoyed was the waterproof trimmer on the other end of the razor.</li>
            <li>Wife tends to like this item more than any other razor.  </li>
            <li>The trimmer on the other end is also okay.</li>
            <li>The main razor blade shaves the legs very well and doesn&#x27;t cut her legs.</li>
            <li>I recommend it to my friends all the time for quick clean up and trim down there.</li>
            <li>It does shave well, but I do not like shaving with it as much as my Venus 5 blade, which shaves better, faster, and with less effort.</li>
            <li>I felt uneasy at first using the trimmer side on my sensitive areas</li>
            <li>Overall a very sleek and stylish razor that does double duty.</li>
            <li>It is pretty loud</li>
            <li>First, let me start off by saying that my legs are extremely sensitive.</li>
            <li>One thing is for sure, the Quattro gives me a much smoother shave in some areas, like my bikini line and the back of my thighs but not in others (like my actually bikini area or legs).</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re looking for a decent razor, a great trimmer, and aren&#x27;t worried about about getting EVERY single little hair, I&#x27;d highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>I use it on the lowest setting to trim most everything down there and then take the cover off to do the sides, etc.  </li>
            <li>The trimmer is a little loud but works nicely.</li>
            <li>I want to give this product 4 stars because I do &amp;#34;like it&amp;#34; and it&#x27;s better than &amp;#34;it&#x27;s okay.&amp;#34; 4 stars seems like a little too much, though.</li>
            <li>My new fave razor!</li>
            <li>I usually use a straight razor for trimming my bikini line, but living Southern California means going to the beach and pool year-round, so I wanted something more precise.</li>
            <li>So far it is still superior to others I have used and trashed due to not working or causing bodily injury.</li>
            <li>so I don&#x27;t mind as much that I end up buying the new razor.</li>
            <li>The grip has a rubbery feel to it making it easy to hold even when wet.</li>
            <li>but it trims decently.</li>
            <li>You&#x27;d probably have to buy a lot of these to make it the same amount of time a better quality trimmer would last you.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The trimmer is powered by 1 AAA battery which has a rather clever compartment.</li>
            <li>However, it was not ridiculously loud.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The only downside is that I&#x27;ve found myself replacing the battery rather quickly, despite not using the trimmer too often.</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin and am prone to razor burn, which can be really embarrassing in the bikini bottom area.</li>
            <li>The razor works ok on your legs, but leaves a mess for the underarms.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>The razorblades are high quality.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Recommend this product highly.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend buying this razor in store since it runs at about $12.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend this razor.</li>
            <li>and I would highly recommend it to others.</li>
            <li>I had high hopes for this, but..</li>
            <li>Works great dry, but does not cut the same if used when wet.  </li>
            <li>Their ads need to be a little better explaining what this product does, but once I figured it out, I bought it immediately.  </li>
            <li>I love the thing and for the price there is little I can complain about.</li>
            <li>I proceeded to shave the area with the razor end which did an impressive job, although a few little ones got left out.</li>
            <li>The three lengths are also really helpful, though I like it pretty short</li>
            <li>Hope it lasts more than a few months.</li>
            <li>so I normally take that off.</li>
            <li>From the first shave to the last, you&#x27;re sure to be left with a stingy, burning discomfort that will last throughout the day.</li>
            <li>The razor is just a like a normal razor</li>
            <li>Because of that, this trimmer fell on the shower floor one too many times and didn&#x27;t last as long as it should have.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Waste of money better of using shaving  razor</li>
            <li>While there were a few straggling hairs which I missed, I think it was more my fault than that of the Quattro</li>
            <li>Take away from hair and it returned to normal speed.</li>
            <li>This is the 2nd one I&#x27;ve owned in a year, but worth it because my husband likes it too.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s good in theory, but poor in execution.  </li>
            <li>The razor blade part is ok, it does the job, but doesn&#x27;t last very long.  </li>
            <li>Not only that, but the price of a package of cartridges is just as much as buying a whole new razor!</li>
            <li>If I were going on a date with my husband, etc., and wanted a VERY close shave, I would probably still swipe his razor, but for everyday shaving, I think it&#x27;s just fine.  </li>
            <li>I decided to just use a Venus (which has no idiotic, useless wires in the back, and thus rinses completely clean very quickly), and my life got much easier.</li>
            <li>The Schick Quattro Razor is really smooth against the skin, does not leave razor bumps and adds moisture that other razors do not offer.</li>
            <li>Couldn&#x27;t live without it</li>
            <li>When I called the manufacturer they offered to send me a new one.  </li>
            <li>I tried new batteries, wiggling the connectors - no luck.  </li>
            <li>The new Schick Quattro for Women TrimStyle lets you shave, and trim with just the flip of a handle.</li>
            <li>I cannot say how much I live this product</li>
            <li>Shick&#x27;s new tool is a razor and bikini trimmer called the Quattro</li>
            <li>I have tried replacing the battery with a new one</li>
            <li>and I wanted a new color for my new bathroom</li>
            <li>and I live with people</li>
            <li>and I cringe when trying new things.</li>
            <li>so I get a new one.</li>
            <li>I buy a new one every year, because eventually the trimmer stops working.  </li>
            <li>, what new fangled thing can we design that will get women to buy our product?</li>
            <li>but if you make sure to not leave your razor in a wet place they last longer.</li>
            <li>The razor is good for everyday (absolutely no irritation with that either), but if you want a super-super-close shave, look elsewhere.</li>
            <li>The trimmer is quite slow, only good for light/delicate touch ups.  </li>
            <li>(also put out by Schick) years ago--I just am NOT able to get a close shave with it because it has wires holding down the razors.&lt;br /&gt;The trimmer part isn&#x27;t all that great either.  </li>
            <li>I have very very sensitive bikini line skin..</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li>this product is highly recommend to anyone who is prone to razor bumps &amp; anyone who doesn&#x27;t want to shave completely , but would like to keep the area trimmed.</li>
            <li>Wow!</li>
            <li>Personally, I don&#x27;t have that many tiny areas to worry about using a teeny tiny trimmer.</li>
            <li>razor is the standard schick quattro blade, it gives a close shave and for me it lasts through at least 7 bikini shaves and countless leg shaves without dulling, which is great.</li>
            <li>The shipping was speedy despite weather conditions and the packaging was not damaged or dented or folded in like many past Amazon purchases.</li>
            <li>and unfortunately I can&#x27;t no longer find it locally.</li>
            <li>It is completely waterproof so no worries!</li>
            <li>, you don&#x27;t have to get the &#x27;woman&#x27; version, because the &#x27;men&#x27; version is exactly the same in functionality.</li>
            <li>I bought this razor in pink about a year ago and was satisfied with it until the trimmer completely stopped working about 6 months later.  </li>
            <li>I mainly use both the trimmer and razor in the shower because I find it less of a hassle to clean</li>
            <li>I took off one star because, like someone else said, the wires holding down the blades kept my legs from being completely smooth.</li>
            <li>First all-in-one shaver and bikini trimmer .It is the only razor with 4 ultra-thin blades for long- lasting smooth skin and a built-in waterproof bikini trimmer in one.   </li>
            <li>The first one started to die out (not enough power to keep the trimmer blades moving fast enough, even with brand new batteries) after about a year of use.</li>
            <li>I usually prefer simple razors, but the trimmer is nice.</li>
            <li>The only problem is that the refill heads are becoming harder to find</li>
            <li>Also, the razor on the other end is nothing special.  </li>
            <li>I was surprised at the number of lower ratings - but did some of them are very old, so maybe the razor has changed since then.</li>
            <li>Like the original, there is a little rubber button to rest your finger, right above the razor blade, but I found that this was not where my finger naturally</li>
            <li>Better products out there for the same or less money.</li>
            <li>it does seem to go dead rather quickly but lasts much longer than the Cleancut</li>
            <li>I was so excited when I got it, but was immediately let down.  </li>
            <li>Pretty much like any other razor you&#x27;ve ever used...</li>
            <li>in my opinion, only leaves slight stubble with closest setting, no razor burn, pinching, or knicks so far though &#x3D;)</li>
            <li>/&gt;It doesn&#x27;t get rid of all the hair, which is fine since its not a huge bother.  </li>
            <li>This is a fantastic little trimmer.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;d recommend this for anyone who is wanting to keep down the bush and feel clean--</li>
            <li>This is actually the same thing that happened to me with the first one!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s strong &amp; sharp enough, though, to take off a couple months of growth without a problem.  </li>
            <li>As stated above it is good for trimming, but when I shave with this in the &#x27;on&#x27; position, the vibration actually allows me to get a just a little extra closer and do so without irritation.</li>
            <li>The trimmer left me sheek enough to be comfortable and besides, the razor could be used to smooth out the trim (If I felt like it) - and when it gets dull or if the battery is not connecting to the mechanical aspect of the shaver-  </li>
            <li>Some of you clearly dont know how to use this product.</li>
            <li>For a girl, with extremely sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>It deosnt completely get rid of the hair like a razor</li>
            <li>This all in one tool only needs one battery and it really trims the bikini area well.</li>
            <li>Took one star away for it being so loud.</li>
            <li>I was pleasantly surprised at how well</li>
            <li>Call me old-fashioned, but when I buy something that has no reason it should need to be replaced very often at all, I expect it to stick around for several years.</li>
            <li>I opened it up and found out that a ton of hair was getting inside the product and causing a clog, so I fixed that issue.</li>
            <li>After a couple of nicks, I was done trying to figure out why I was getting nicked and just stopped using it completely.  </li>
            <li>And though I lack technique, the initial results have been very promising.&lt;br</li>
            <li>no nicks so far.</li>
            <li>experience so far is...</li>
            <li>I was actually really surprised by how well this worked.  </li>
            <li>I have found that the trimmer doesn&#x27;t like being used without cleaning it often with professional blade cleaners.  </li>
            <li>I remove the cap completely, and swear by the results.</li>
            <li>but i dident want them completely shaved.</li>
            <li>I bought this at my local drug store on sale but really like&lt;br /&gt;it</li>
            <li>Came a day early.</li>
            <li>and I didn&#x27;t get any bumps on my sensitive legs</li>
            <li>but I have extremely sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I just use them and eventually like everything they get old</li>
            <li>Some reviews said it rusted; I haven&#x27;t seen anything so far (had it about 3 months) and frankly, at this price I&#x27;m surprised anyone is worried about a replacement cost, anyway.</li>
            <li>I used to use the male schick quattro titanium trimmer, and honestly I can&#x27;t really tell the difference between the two.  </li>
            <li>i kept it completely out of water also.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t actually tried investing in buying the razors for the handle, as I only use the trimmer, but if I were to try it out, I&#x27;d imagine it&#x27;d be just as useful.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Unfortunately, the trimmer wasn&#x27;t quite as effective - at least for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Personally, I would probably recommend just sticking with a standard razor and using something else as a trimmer.</li>
            <li>I would definitely say it is worth it for only around 10 bucks</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t grown out enough to get a good trim and thought about leaving it poor reviews.</li>
            <li>I LOVE this product, so much so, that even after it&#x27;s broken FOUR TIMES, i keep buying more!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Much easier to get everything looking pretty and neat down there.</li>
            <li>The cost of a new razor is almost the same as a new blade</li>
            <li>I find the battery runs down rather quickly on mine</li>
            <li>The Quattro For Women Trimstyle comes with a plastic holder which suctions to the shower wall but probably will not fit in the original shower</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m also a big creature of habit, so a new product would really have to blow me away to make enough of an impression for me to change products.</li>
            <li>The grip is fine for small hand.</li>
            <li>I only wish that it wasn&#x27;t as noisy and that the back of the razors would be less blocked so the hair could be cleaned out better.</li>
            <li>At the same time though, it&#x27;s the only razor/trimmer combo that I am aware of which makes it convenient.</li>
            <li>I tried two more and they didn&#x27;t last longer than a month, which was still not many uses.</li>
            <li>However, I have really only gotten two new ones over the years because they got old.</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin and the bikini area is extra sensitive.</li>
            <li>The razor is okay, but the trimmer is not good.</li>
            <li>And for a shorter cut ;) you can take off the pink think</li>
            <li>I replace the blade every few weeks and generally replace the entire thing about once a year just so that the trimmer is as efficient as possible, although I&#x27;m sure I could go longer without doing</li>
            <li>Luckily they seem to last a good amount of time without getting dull but that may also be due to the fact I don&#x27;t shave everyday.</li>
            <li>it simply would not turn on even with new batteries.  </li>
            <li>SO, pay attention, and buy a new razor every once in a blue moon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Occasionally the trimmer will stop running and a new battering won&#x27;t make it work again.</li>
            <li>It doesnt come in pretty colors (only comes in black) but its the exact same thing and gets the job done!</li>
            <li>My only complaint is that the design could be somewhat more ergonomic.  </li>
            <li>The trimmer is less practical, but it useful</li>
            <li>Being quite small,it does take a long,long while to finish,for example,a whole head of hair if using the 1 or 2 setting,but having the option of doing this myself,I´m personally never going back to a hair salon.</li>
            <li>I suppose it takes a few tries to get the hang of it and with more use, it becomes easier</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not crazy about the vibrating option, just personal preference I guess, but the blades are sharp, long lasting, and the razor is well balanced in the hand, easy to grip when wet.</li>
            <li>Even the first time I used it the razor was not as sharp as my weeks-old Gillette.</li>
            <li>I have had no other problems with this trimmer.</li>
            <li>The trimmer has two small screws that can be removed allowing you to thoroughly clean the blades.</li>
            <li>I did buy a new one after a couple of years just to buy a new one and no real reason...</li>
            <li>The tool itself is the same teal and white so while it&#x27;s different from the pink of the original Quattro for Women, it&#x27;s still quite feminine.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The blade side has four blades and these can last over several shaves, which is nice, but being concerned about the cost I will probably just stick to my cheaper two blade razors (less than half the price).</li>
            <li>I just can&#x27;t get used to the painful waxing process so this bikini trimmer does a great job instead.</li>
            <li>It hydrates the skin while shaving, and leaves them extra soft afterwards.</li>
            <li>Extremely short life span (about 2/3 months) before it completely stops working.</li>
            <li>far as reviewing the actual trimmer, I&#x27;d have to break it into two parts:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only used it once so far</li>
            <li>The bikini trimmer lets me stay &#x27;almost bare&#x27; and not have razor burns.</li>
            <li>far as the 4-blade razor goes, it is very standard.</li>
            <li>The bikini trimmer, which does have adjustable settings for control that go from \\&quot;barely trimmed\\&quot; to \\&quot;almost gone\\&quot;, works well.</li>
            <li>Does not shave you bare to skin, just a trim.  </li>
            <li>The only reason I gave it four stars instead of five is because it is so loud.</li>
            <li>Most ppl usually leave their razor in the shower, but the trimmer part will rust if you do so, so this is not very practical.  </li>
            <li>The attached razor is ok, but not great.  </li>
            <li>A small trimmer for $10 is not bad.</li>
            <li>Comfortable to shave with and the handle is just the right size for those like me who are a little clumsy with razors in the shower.  </li>
            <li>The only difference is the color and the &#x27;women&#x27; refill razors have just a little more lubricant on the edge, but other than that the razors are interchangeable.</li>
            <li>The regular diposable/replaceable razor other end is remarkably good and does not cut me as others have in the past causing being careful of my choices.</li>
            <li>If I needed to shave after a couple weeks&#x27; worth of growth, trying to do it with this razor was a nightmare that could last upwards of half an hour.</li>
            <li>But the trimmer is very loud, and there are not a whole lot of options as far as choosing the length.</li>
            <li>I read a couple other reviews where others have had the exact same experience.  </li>
            <li>Experience shows they charge more for &#x27;pink&#x27; razors vs. a plain black or blue one that does the exact same thing.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>The trimmer cuts extremely close and is gentle on the skin.</li>
            <li>I would definitely  recommend this product especially for the duel action.</li>
            <li>The second major problem I had is when I nicked myself a couple of times.  </li>
            <li>Like some others said i was a little leery at first putting the trimmer&lt;</li>
            <li>No more throwing money at razors that cost less and work better-</li>
            <li>It is also awkward to use on your intimate area, it would be better with a regular razor.</li>
            <li>Much better than some other trimmers I&#x27;ve used in the past that were way more expensive.</li>
            <li>Keep looking if you are a woman who wants zero hair down there.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also loud enough to be annoying and potentially embarrassing, LOL.</li>
            <li>There are a few issues with it but overall a cheap alternative to other grooming methods.  </li>
            <li>This is the second one I bought, and the first one lasted a long time, unlike some of the other reviewers.  </li>
            <li>I guess I can at least use the normal razor side for a while and just chuck the whole thing when I&#x27;m done.</li>
            <li>If you are like me and need to tame the lion, the trimmer is the first tool for the job</li>
            <li>I liked the fact that this was waterproof, but considering what a poor job it did, it was not worth the money.</li>
            <li>The trimmer is too small and only works on non-curvy areas (because women&#x27;s bodies have lots of those, right?).</li>
            <li>Well, look no further, the Quattro&#x27;s dull blade technology produces consistent results!  </li>
            <li>It was easy to set it at the short or long lengths but the middle one was harder because the comb wanted to skip past that setting.</li>

            <li> I agree with the great review</li>
            <li> /&gt;First, the razor itself works great.  </li>
            <li> And it worked great - for a couple of months.  </li>
            <li> LOL    </li>
            <li> BTW, the motor is still great</li>
            <li> It works great in the shower or in the tub.</li>
            <li> Great product.</li>
            <li> TRIMMER PORTION STOPPED WORKING 4.21.20y April ximmer with guard end is great for body hair</li>

            <li> I&#x27;ve gotten great results and recommend this product to others.</li>
            <li> The trimmer has a great guard on it so you won&#x27;t cut yourself.</li>
            <li> I was so happy I didn&#x27;t have to buy a razor and a bikini trimmer.</li>
            <li> This is a great trimmer.</li>
            <li> Great tool for trimming the bikini area.</li>
            <li> but it works great</li>
            <li> Great razor.</li>
            <li> It is great for \\&quot;trimming\\&quot; unwanted</li>
            <li> I get a close shave with no irritation on my legs and bonus no razor burn on bikini area bc the trimmer works great.</li>

            <li> I am so happy I purchased this.</li>
            <li> So happy this product came onto the market.</li>
            <li> This is a great product.</li>
            <li> It does everything that the description said it would and was a great gift for myself.</li>
            <li> This is a great trimmer for the bikini area.</li>
            <li> I just know it is absolutely great for trimming the hairs in the bikini area.</li>
            <li> This works best at the lowest setting since it has an easier time catching hairs at the lowest setting.</li>
            <li> Really great product.</li>
            <li> and I think that it was a great purchase.</li>
            <li> Works great for keeping &#x27;order&#x27; so to speak.</li>
            <li> It does a great job of getting rid of excess hair when used at 0 setting (with the cap taken off),and</li>
            <li> I am sure I can find another $10 to replace the thing!!</li>
            <li> LOVE THIS PRODUCT!!</li>
            <li> The razor part is very nice.</li>
            <li> Works well, very handy.</li>
            <li> This trimmer is amazing!</li>
            <li> and this makes me feel amazing without the pain!  </li>
            <li> the price was excellent the shipping was even better</li>
            <li> I am sure for others it would be best if all you want is a good trim or groom.</li>
            <li> Sleek design make this gem so easy to handle, and the colors are beautiful!</li>
            <li> Works awesome in the shower, you can get a super close shave, no nicks or cuts!</li>
            <li> but I LOVED the trimmer.</li>
            <li> It would, however, be quite good for trimming a beard or sideburns.      </li>
            <li> The trimmer works so good in the shower and it&#x27;s a close shave for my legs too.</li>
            <li> So, the bottom line is: LOVED the trimmer; no pulling, no irritation.</li>
            <li> The battery life is good as well.</li>
            <li> Initially I loved it.</li>
            <li> Does the job and good value.</li>
            <li> Good razor in and out of the shower</li>
            <li> they were good</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re looking for a good 2 in 1 razor/trimmer combo, I&#x27;d skip this one.</li>
            <li> I absolutely loved this razor...while it worked.  </li>
            <li> but it does do a good job of trimming bikini area.</li>
            <li> I suppose for the price, it&#x27;s a good deal</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s a really good razor where you don&#x27;t have to use shaving cream.</li>
            <li> Great in the shower, no razor burn, trimmed and cleaned nicely.</li>
            <li> The razor is really good</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really good</li>
            <li> I got it in good time and it is everything it said it was</li>
            <li> I recieved The Schick Hydro Silk trimstyle razor from BzzAgent to try out for free and I love it!!!!!!</li>
            <li> This trimmer does a good job in trimming unruly and unsightly bikini and \\&quot;hooha\\&quot; hair.</li>
            <li> Just on your junk, remember to use some good shave cream.</li>
            <li> its good for the $.</li>
            <li> I am a medium-mantinance person in the sense that I like to look nice, smell nice, and be feminine and beautiful, however sometimes that just means putting on pearls with my jeans and a T-shirt.  </li>
            <li> The razor and trimmer functions are very easy to use and work great.</li>
            <li> Great smooth shave with the razor, and the trimmer works great, too.</li>
            <li> As a razor this is great, it didn&#x27;t feel like a razor, it was very smooth.</li>
            <li> The added vibration made for nice, clean trims.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am very happy with this product but prefer that it just be a trimmer.</li>
            <li> Maybe it would be a great thing for someone with more hair issues than I have.</li>
            <li> I have perfect success with the Gillette Venus even with the puny 3 blades and NO nicks/cuts</li>
            <li> I absolutely love the look or it!</li>
            <li> Love this razor!</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this razor!</li>
            <li> Love it!</li>
            <li> I recieved this product to test and review, and over all im pretty impressed.</li>
            <li> LOVE THIS!  </li>
            <li> I love this product!</li>
            <li> This is my favorite razor ever!</li>
            <li> Love this!</li>
            <li> Love it!</li>
            <li> No nicks or cuts, just a satisfied customer!  </li>
            <li> LOVE it!</li>
            <li> One more good thing about this razor is that its waterproof, I love that I can use it in the shower or out of the shower!</li>
            <li> Its an amazing trimmer</li>
            <li> This razor is amazing when it works.</li>
            <li> The razors are amazing.</li>
            <li> great deal when there is a coupon available too.</li>
            <li> The closeness of the shave is amazing.</li>
            <li> This is amazing.</li>
            <li> I do my own Brazilians at home</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t thrilled with the razor portion for shaving legs.  </li>
            <li> I liked it...until I tried using it again.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been meaning to try it again and give it another shot, but honestly, I can&#x27;t bring myself to do it.  </li>
            <li> to my dismay, I had to give up on loving this product.  </li>
            <li> So to my dismay, I had to give up on loving this product.  </li>
            <li> Since it&#x27;s a woman&#x27;s razor, my wife tried it and liked it.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried waxing and shaving, and this is a nice, painless alternative.</li>
            <li> I like to wax my arms, legs and underarms and am quite adept with the procedure.</li>
            <li> The razor does wonders, and that i really liked, but the trimmer, i honestly could do without.</li>
            <li> I bought this because I really like multipurpose devices, and this seemed great!  </li>
            <li> The blades feel nice and don&#x27;t cause burn or bleeding.</li>
            <li> but to each their own.</li>
            <li> and it came with its own batteries .</li>
            <li> This was a gift my daughter in law liked it.</li>
            <li> Nice trimmer and does well in the shower.  </li>
            <li> but all opinions are 100% my own.</li>
            <li> so I could get a nice grip on it when shaving.</li>
            <li> This is a nice combo product, with razor and trimmer all in one unit.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s nice to have a place to stash the razor without worry.</li>
            <li> The bikini trimmer was also really nice.</li>
            <li> It trims nicely and evenly too.</li>
            <li> Its just like having a barber shop in the comfort of your own home.</li>
            <li> I liked it so much I purchased one for my sister and my best friend.</li>
            <li> While I did not purchase this on Amazon I own it.</li>
            <li> but I find that a rechargeable AAA battery works just as well as the throwaway kind, though it does die sooner.</li>
            <li> Since I like to have absolutely no hair (lol), I use the razor to remove everything, and it&#x27;s great!</li>
            <li> This razor is very easy to use.</li>
            <li> The moisturizing bar on the razor side made for a very easy shave.</li>
            <li> It has 3 adjustable levels for trimming and is very easy to hold and maneuver.</li>
            <li> I have never once cut or nicked myself and it is very easy to use.</li>
            <li> Very easy</li>
            <li> The trimmer is perfect and the other end is great.</li>
            <li> This is the perfect razor to seriously get the perfect shave!</li>
            <li> I actually liked it better for my underarm area.  </li>
            <li> Whether shaving her legs or underarms, or trimming those sensitive areas, it works flawlessly.  </li>
            <li> but so far am impressed.</li>
            <li> I like to be able to shave and trim with this handy two-in-one tool.</li>
            <li> I have also used the trimmer (after cleaning of course) on my husbands neck and around his ears and face and honestly they are WAY better than all of the trimmers he has ever owned.</li>
            <li> My legs feel nice and smooth afterwards!</li>
            <li> (I&#x27;m not a terribly hairy person) which affords me a taste of the ever amazing college hygienic</li>
            <li> I loved the fact that it was waterproof and the razor was nice, but there is no way that I would recommend something like this that rusts as quickly as it did.</li>
            <li> It turns out that the Quattro has the nice 4 blades which is better than the Gillette Venus, but then it also has these 2 guard wires that run on top of and perpendicular to the razor blades.  </li>
            <li> Very fast shipping and a great price.</li>
            <li> It worked great at first, and if youre someplace where you need a trimmer</li>
            <li> I have tried many, many razors and this is the best by far.  </li>
            <li> The trimmer worked great the first time, but that&#x27;s about it.  </li>
            <li> Pretty great.</li>
            <li> Love this easy to travel with does the job!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to hold and gives an amazing shave with its 5 blades.</li>
            <li> The blade on the top however works like a charm, pretty great deal, just make sure you buy a box of Schick blades to replace them as needed.</li>
            <li> I received this for free as part of a promotion from the brand, and I love it!</li>
            <li> The trimmer is nice, and the moisturizing strips make it work just fine for me.</li>
            <li> I am giving it four stars because it could be very useful on trips and vacation, but I do hope they upgrade the trimmer to something better!</li>
            <li> and I love them.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t be a skeptic, it is better then venus if you&#x27;re wondering.</li>
            <li> The results are lovely.</li>
            <li> As a bikini trimmer this is lacking in so many levels.</li>
            <li> I like my Venus razor better.</li>
            <li> My wife reviewed this product and found the trimmer more gimick than function.  </li>
            <li> or I&#x27;m better off getting a bikini wax.</li>
            <li> I say partly because I&#x27;m still using the product in search of a better one.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love that I can use it in the shower.</li>
            <li> I love this razor.</li>
            <li> now, and having cleaned many a trimmer, I am completely confident that I cleaned the trimmer thoroughly, still it would not work.</li>
            <li> This time I was getting a bit fed up with it and went out thinking I&#x27;d look at men&#x27;s trimmers, since I&#x27;ve started to suspect that the quality is better than in products made for women.</li>
            <li> For the more practical buyer considering the \\&quot;long-run\\&quot; price, you might want to shop around for something nicer.</li>
            <li> I used the trimmer BEFORE I got in the shower, and was extremely satisfied with it.  </li>
            <li> I bought it more for the trimmer than the razor, but decided to give it a try as well.  </li>
            <li> Schick Quattro is one of my favorite razors.  </li>
            <li> I love the 4 blades &amp; it does a close shave on your legs.  </li>
            <li> i love it.</li>
            <li> the trimmer is also ok however when using the razor I keep pushing the trimmer button and would freak out that I might cut myself.  </li>
            <li> What&#x27;s not to love???     </li>
            <li> For a razor blade that I got simply for the bikini trimmer, this is an awesome razor to have.</li>
            <li> I love it</li>
            <li> Considering it has many blades, it didn&#x27;t cause me any irritation.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve used this thing SO many times.</li>
            <li> The look of it is not that appealing.</li>
            <li> With the economy the way it is, it should be priced more affordably.</li>
            <li> The razor and trimmer combo concept is fantastic though!</li>
            <li> And it does shave smoothly and trim nicely.</li>
            <li> They need to do something about that because I am sure that the Trimstyle would sell well if they made a better razor.</li>
            <li> :)\\&quot;</li>
            <li> This does the job better.</li>
            <li> I love that you can trim and do close shaving.</li>
            <li> a woman.....&#x3D;)</li>
            <li> I found that wetting the blade makes ut work better.</li>
            <li> looking forward to more years with my trimming razor :)</li>
            <li> although the razor cap slides on from the end instead of over the top (this might be better.</li>
            <li> It seems more secure).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This made the more precision shaving which was to come a lot easier.</li>
            <li> It sounds like an electric razor and if you feel the need to hide what you&#x27;re doing, make sure to have the shower on or to be home alone.</li>
            <li> that well--it was okay, but</li>
            <li> I LOVE this razor trimmer combination product.  </li>
            <li> : I&#x27;ve bought the women&#x27;s version of this many times</li>
            <li> I have used Schick razors for many years</li>
            <li> I love that it adjusts so you can choose the length/closeness of the shave.</li>
            <li> Will update after 6 months which seems to be the self destruct date of most</li>
            <li> I love how they made the razor with a stand</li>
            <li> I love the trimmer, except the guard is a MUST.</li>
            <li> Glad I purchased this item.  </li>
            <li> :)</li>
            <li> and I love it.</li>
            <li> Favorite razor.</li>
            <li> I love it.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t cut myself or get as many bumps.</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> love it, it makes everything about grooming easier.</li>
            <li> and you have to move your wrist and make sure you don&#x27;t cut yourself.</li>
            <li> will admit I do get more ingrown hairs with this razor though.</li>
            <li> Yes, it is wider than most, but I find I like the wider handle.</li>
            <li> I love this razor set.</li>
            <li> Love this.  </li>
            <li> Love that it came with a AAA battery and a shower holder as well.</li>
            <li> Does what it needs to, but I wish it had more power...</li>
            <li> I read many of the&lt;br /&gt;reviews</li>
            <li> Love the ease of just flipping over to do both jobs.</li>
            <li> And I love the attachment to stick it to the shower wall...</li>
            <li> A four pack is more than what I paid for the razor.</li>
            <li> The trimmer is ok.</li>
            <li> I love</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m glad I found it on Amazon cus</li>
            <li> I thought the trimmer would be a bit better.</li>
            <li> I love the idea, but at this price, you aren&#x27;t going to get a quality trimmer.</li>
            <li> I love the convenience of having it in the shower and trimming whenever I notice the need.</li>
            <li> I love this razor.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this bikini trimmer.</li>
            <li> Love the razor too.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a nice, smooth, razor bump free shave!</li>
            <li> I love what it does, so I&#x27;ll probably keep</li>
            <li> :)</li>
            <li> I LOVE the holder for the shower.</li>
            <li> I used this razor for years and was very happy with it until it finally gave out</li>
            <li> Love this .</li>
            <li> :)</li>
            <li> The cap for the trimmer is cute and I love the holder for gadget.</li>
            <li> My mother wants one now also and will proudly be ordering one for her.</li>
            <li> many others who bought this razor, my trimmer has died.</li>
            <li> Okay--</li>
            <li> love that it&#x27;s waterproof.  </li>
            <li> I love that it is waterproof and can be used in the shower.</li>
            <li> I love this razor.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s okay.</li>
            <li> It does the job, but it isn&#x27;t her favorite.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s okay for a razor.  </li>
            <li> I get a nice clean shave every time.</li>
            <li> The shape of it makes it very easy to manage the razor and trimming turns to be smooth.</li>
            <li> The razor doesn&#x27;t move nicely, it glides right over, no fear in shaving around the knees now!</li>
            <li> a normal razor can&#x27;t go and does a great job.  </li>
            <li> this product was good the first time.</li>
            <li> It uses 1 single AAA battery and is waterproof which ladies lets face it, WIN!</li>
            <li> On a positive note, the unit is water proof and the battery lasts for a good while.</li>
            <li> This a great razor and trimmer but keep the trimmer out of water because if you do it wears out pretty quick.</li>
            <li> Perfect little device, I use the trimmer part about 1X per week or so and the razor to shave every-other-day and replace the blade about every 3 weeks, maybe more often in the summer when I shave my legs more.  </li>
            <li> It allows for a more accurate shave.</li>
            <li> I personally end up in the jacuzzi/pool about once or twice a week, so this trimmer is ideal for me</li>
            <li> ok, I think this is SCHICK cheap trick to force people to buy Razor end refills, will not buy again from them.</li>
            <li> My legs have never felt more smooth and moisturized after shaving.</li>
            <li> Otherwise good, no pinching, and the batteries have lasted very well.</li>
            <li> When I say this with a Bikini Trimmer on the other end thought it was awesome.  </li>
            <li> Other than that it is perfect!</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t even consider any other type or brand, this works perfectly for legs, underarms and bikini area.</li>
            <li> Perfect set: shaver on one side, trimmer on the other.</li>
            <li> The trimmer on the other hand is great!</li>
            <li> I was much more impressed with it the first time, but the second one doesn&#x27;t catch my hairs as well.</li>
            <li> It won&#x27;t do an easy great job, but it does a good job with a little effort.</li>
            <li> She also found it easy on the legs and the underarms.  </li>
            <li> Clogged EASILY.</li>
            <li> And besides it is easily replacable.</li>
            <li> It is easy to use.</li>
            <li> electric face razor- Easy instructions and easy to use</li>
            <li> Trimmer has 3 settings, glides easy without nicking as the slider acts as a guard.</li>
            <li> it looked easy to use</li>
            <li> Easy to store as well since it comes with a holder that has suction cups, allowing you to keep it within reach in the shower.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s slim design fits well in my hand and is easy to use.</li>
            <li> It was easy to hold and use.</li>
            <li> and I lose things like that easily, lol.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The problem is relatively easy to solve however.</li>
            <li> Do not waste your money, the company had some good marketing and cute ads with funky music-wow.</li>
            <li> This makes it easy to trim hair down to almost non noticeable levels and if i don&#x27;t want to shave the rest them awesome!</li>
            <li> Do note that Schick now has a much more attractive version of the same trimmer available for Men:</li>
            <li> The men&#x27;s Quattro is a much better, more robust razor, and for a bikini trimmer, both the Bikini Baby and the Bikini Touch trimmers are infinitely more maneuverable and so much easier to use.</li>
            <li> I am used to using the higher end razors with the nice soap bar attached to the razor</li>
            <li> (I&#x27;m sure it was a board room full of execs who said, \\&quot;Hey</li>
            <li> For that purpose, it does fine.  </li>
            <li> I dont change the battery often and it works just fine.</li>
            <li> Still, a fine product.</li>
            <li> and it still functions fine.</li>
            <li> It took no time to use it without any knicks and gave a very smooth and fresh result.  </li>
            <li> This is an awesome little razor and trimmer combined.</li>
            <li> (I got this free as a promotion from the company)</li>
            <li> Honestly, I didnt really like it.</li>
            <li> It makes your legs silky smooth after using the razor as well.</li>
            <li> If you are looking for a great razor, then pick this up but the regular razor, not with the trimmer.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if the power button is cheaply constructed or what.  </li>
            <li> Just don&#x27;t expect a baby smooth shave in the bikini area.  </li>
            <li> --I&#x27;m not seeking a baby smooth shave, I just don&#x27;t want to don a bathing suit looking like Yeti.  </li>
            <li> this this is really nice, Shaves well and the trimmer really works.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Otherwise, I&#x27;m happy with the price and product overall.  </li>
            <li> I was still plenty smooth after using it.  </li>
            <li> A GREAT BUY ESPECIALLY WITH THIS PRICE</li>
            <li> You can tell by the sound of the razor if it&#x27;s time to change the battery.  </li>
            <li> I was fortunate to receive this from Amazon Vine in return for a review.  </li>
            <li> I was suprised how simple the razor was to use and that I experienced no rash or bumps.</li>
            <li> I bought this for the trimmer and it does a fantastic job.</li>
            <li> Also, the razor doesn&#x27;t work as well as the cheap, disposable ones.</li>
            <li> push the suctions cups to secure once a week.</li>
            <li> I even tried using tweezers to pull hair out to free up the blade.</li>
            <li> Electric shaver end is cheap and docent cut hair</li>
            <li> The razor is a VERY close shave and leaves your legs feeling like silk and the trimmer is AMAZING.</li>
            <li> My legs do not feel smooth like they do when I use a mens Gilette Fusion.</li>
            <li> I was not as happy with the razor part and have switched back to the Hydro so the dual function is lost on me.</li>
            <li> I got it free through bzzagent</li>
            <li> I got a smooth, close shave</li>
            <li> I got invited to try it for free</li>
            <li> I imagine that this would be fantastic for a guy too since the guard is good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I got it as a free sample</li>
            <li> This razor/trimmer combo provides smooth, close results.</li>
            <li> Comfortable close cut.</li>
            <li> The size adjustments are of a good length if you still want a natural look that&#x27;s groomed.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a comfort-first, jeans &amp; t-shirt most days, too busy chasing my 1-yr-old to fuss a lot with a beauty routine kind of girl.  </li>
            <li> So far so good.</li>
            <li> One of the better women&#x27;s razors I have used, gives a nice close, soft, clean shave.</li>
            <li> Like many other women, I thought this would be a great, time-saving product.  </li>
            <li> I am able to keep the trimmer happy by cleaning it every other time, but it is a pain to have to do this so often.  </li>
            <li> My wife says that the trimmer is very useful.</li>
            <li> When you turn on the trimmer, it buzzes very powerfully and trims well.  </li>
            <li> and I have to say that this one is much cheaper and does just as good of a job with the added bonus of having a great razor on the other end!</li>
            <li> The AAA battery is super easy to replace.</li>
            <li> Quick and easy</li>
            <li> I love how it&#x27;s a 2-in-one making it a very convenient purchase!</li>
            <li> For ten dollars, I couldn&#x27;t be more pleased. :-)</li>
            <li> Was excited to get and was excited to use.</li>
            <li> Also, the trimmer wasn&#x27;t user friendly, didn&#x27;t seem to work well at all.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure what to expect the first time I tried this, now its a must have in my shower and bathroom.  </li>
            <li> It works fine for a quick clean up</li>
            <li> Cut just the right amount of with trimmer for a clean look for this upcoming summer!</li>
            <li> The large button for ejecting the razor head is nice when you want to change heads, but if you steady your razor by placing your index finger along the top of the razor while you shave, the head pops off.  </li>
            <li> I have always loved the regular Schick Quattro Razor and was excited to try this version of it as a free sample.</li>
            <li> just felt like after a couple years A new one would be nice...</li>
            <li> It didnt get as clean of a shave as venus.</li>
            <li> I contacted Schick and they sent me a list of ways to clean the trimmer.</li>
            <li> crossing my fingers hoping this means they&#x27;ve actually updated the model and made it better, but I kind of doubt it.    </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not as clean or as close as I&#x27;d like..</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had many trimmers and electric razors, and this is by far my favorite.</li>
            <li> honestly if that&#x27;s the only flaw I find, no harm no foul :).</li>
            <li> It works great for trimming, I knocked off one star because it stopped working unexpectedly when I really needed it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good option if you don&#x27;t like filling your bathroom with \\&quot;girly\\&quot; pink and sometimes the price is more affordable than the version for women.</li>
            <li> experience with Shick&#x27;s new Quattro For Women Trimstyle was pretty good.</li>
            <li> I was impressed how comfortable it is to hold in my very small hands and the comfort of the product.</li>
            <li> And yes, there is nothing special about the razor.  </li>
            <li> It is very handy for shaving underarms dry if you don&#x27;t need a close shave.</li>
            <li> I was more then surprised and excited about how my legs felt, and looked after shaving!</li>
            <li> I use this mainly for my arm pits and lady bits because I was very prone to razor burn, and the trimmer gets surprisingly close.</li>
            <li> The razor is very good, but seems to run into some trouble if you don&#x27;t trim beforehand.</li>
            <li> I liked this product so much that after the first one broke on me (would no longer turn on), I went and bought another.</li>
            <li> The only good thing about this is the quattro razor.  </li>
            <li> I love it so much it works</li>
            <li> I really wanted to love this product.  </li>
            <li> The trimmer is not great to use on its own without the razor since it doesnt trim very neatly, but its perfect for my purposes since I just use it to shorten the hairs before shaving.</li>
            <li> Love how they made grooming so much easier and convenient.</li>
            <li> I tried swirling it around in a basin full of water.</li>
            <li> I love this product so much</li>
            <li> I love the bikini trimmer, it works very well.</li>
            <li> love the straight razor, use it every day under the arms.</li>
            <li> Truely hassle</li>
            <li> trimmer is good because it has 3 settings, depending on how short of a trim you want.</li>
            <li> , I recommend it because it&#x27;s cheap, mostly effective, and comfortable enough to use.</li>
            <li> While the plastic piece for the trimmer doesn&#x27;t really do much (it works better with it off)</li>
            <li> The trimmer is painless, perfect, and makes everything down below look very cleaned up.</li>
            <li> With this trimmer I was able to trim up the &amp;#34;bush&amp;#34; (lol) in the shower and get right to waxing when I got out of the shower and dried off.</li>
            <li> I love the soft grip handle, which makes it easy to hold and manuevor.</li>
            <li> Would have liked extra disposable blade but for the money its fine.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a handy little trimmer, works in the shower (even with the water running over it), and it&#x27;s an amazing price for what you get.  </li>
            <li> Love the feeling of soft, hair free legs against bed sheets like myself?</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s super convenient</li>
            <li> The razor is adequate in my opinion for a women&#x27;s razor.  </li>
            <li> super close.</li>
            <li> The trimmer itself is the perfect size- not too wide and offers 4 settings to trim hair.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been a loyal Gillette Venus user for years, but when I saw this product, I had to try it.  </li>
            <li> The razor part seems great with the 4-blade razor, and the bikini trimmer actually does work very well</li>
            <li> I love how the handle is wider than most razors (I have larger hands).</li>
            <li> Quickly kills AAA batteries</li>
            <li> i did not realize it comes off to get super close.</li>
            <li> im hoping to purchase another to try out the super close shave to see if it helps.</li>
            <li> I have to go over the skin many many times until i cut all the hair in that area at the same length.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The razor dulled quickly, and did not work as well as my mens version that I already had.  </li>
            <li> There&#x27;s three adjustable lengths, but I remove the comb to get a close and quick trim.</li>
            <li> : most of the time, less than ten dollars seems fair price for 3 months of effective bikini trimming to me.</li>
            <li> just though &amp;#34;eh, whatever.&amp;#34; I think they could have done a better job with the razor, as it just doesn&#x27;t seem to be sharp or effective.</li>
            <li> First and foremost I received this product for free from Bzzagent.com.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve now had this 2nd one for about 3 years and am very satisfied.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very satisfied, I&#x27;ve only pinced myself with it once</li>
            <li> First off I received this razor for free in return for my unbiased review.</li>
            <li> Cheaper than most other razors of this type which is nice.</li>
            <li> I bought another one though because for the price two years might be a reasonable amount of operating time and it&#x27;s so easy to use and handy for those of us who like to keep it neat but don&#x27;t feel the need to be bare.</li>
            <li> Eight dollars for a new Schick Trimstyle, or Thirty-eight for a lovely Norelco.     </li>
            <li> This is my new favorite razor.</li>
            <li> The trimmer is easy and fast to use.</li>
            <li> Question: why would you keep the same (disposable) shaver for more than three months anyway?!?</li>
            <li> i can&#x27;t find this item in the stores, very nifty!!</li>
            <li> With the cost of blades it is almost more economical to just buy a new unit anyway.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It is easy to get into the \\&quot;crevices\\&quot; and is smooth action.</li>
            <li> It was easy to hold on to, and I didn&#x27;t have the problem others talked about with resting their finger at the top and having the blade come off, but I think that&#x27;s because all of us hold our razors differently.     </li>
            <li> It seems to be a great concept, you can get all your shaving/trimming needs done in the shower with just one little device.  </li>
            <li> This is a great little bikini trimmer for about 10 bucks.</li>
            <li> but I just didn&#x27;t think that either the trimmer worked very well or that the razor gave a comfortable shave</li>
            <li> I still like my Schick Intuition better because I don&#x27;t like having the extra step of fussing with shaving cream in the shower, but I don&#x27;t have any huge complaints about this one.  </li>
            <li> She likes the feel of this razor and says it does a fast, smooth shave.  </li>
            <li> This is an amazing razor/ trimmer, especially for the cost.  </li>
            <li> it gave me a really close silky smooth shave.</li>
            <li> Totally worth the money.</li>
            <li> The trimmer was rarely used.</li>
            <li> Fun product to have.  </li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t remember the last time I was so satisfied with a product; it&#x27;s now as indispensable to me as my dishwasher or bicycle.</li>
            <li> I thought it was worth a try.</li>
            <li> I will probably buy another one soon just to have a fresh start.</li>
            <li> At under $10, it&#x27;s worth the price.</li>
            <li> i bought this razor because I liked the idea of having two different tools in one.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li> The bikini trimmer is a great extra; I use it frequently.</li>
            <li> it is well worth your money.</li>
            <li> this is the perfect gadget its quiet enough so it does not scare the living daylights out of my cats and it has just enough vibration for them to love it.</li>
            <li> Really worth every penny.</li>
            <li> This one isn&#x27;t worth the time.  </li>
            <li> So if you just want the trimmer, it would be worth the buy.</li>
            <li> I suppose I shouldn&#x27;t be surprised that the battery-operated trimmer attached to this disposable razor is mostly a gimmick.</li>
            <li> It is totally worth the money.</li>
            <li> razor is pretty sweet too, no complaints there.  </li>
            <li> the razor part isnt as good as I expected.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t submurse the razor in the water, and I don&#x27;t abuse it, and I keep fresh batteries in it -</li>
            <li> This is the first one I&#x27;ve tried and I can over all say it&#x27;s not bad.  </li>
            <li> Shaves better than many of the other disposables I have tried.</li>
            <li> The winter is mild here for the first time in a decade</li>
            <li> The only grip is with most razors is that is dulls out quickly, but that is a fault of most razors with 4 or more blades.  </li>
            <li> Make sure you have plenty of battery left to do a clean job.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good enough razor for me, the trimmer is decent.  </li>
            <li> Therefore this was just right for me.</li>
            <li> it arrived right on time</li>
            <li> that well, but maybe I am just not using it right.  </li>
            <li> and I was right.</li>
            <li> The reviews seemed favorable and the price was right, so I went ahead and bought this.</li>
            <li> The handle was just the right size</li>
            <li> I think 3 1/2 would be about right.</li>
            <li> The trimmer is the right width to shape that area.</li>
            <li> color is ok, not a big fan of the purple color/shade, it&#x27;s not ugly, just not a color that I prefer.</li>
            <li> This makes the whole thing waterproof and since I am not a fan of dry shaving, this is good.</li>
            <li> Fortunately I have large animal clippers (for my large animals)</li>
            <li> The trimmer works great and is convenient to use because it is small and cordless.  </li>
            <li> THE RAZOR WAS FAIR BUT NOT WORTH THE PRICE I PAID FOR IT.</li>
            <li> It works WONDERS for all the wonderful areas of your body you might want to trim, never cuts delicate skin, always an even cut (don&#x27;t let the batteries go low, or you&#x27;ll end up PULLING and not cutting!</li>
            <li> On the other hand, the razor offers a fairly close and comfortable shave.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t tried it in the shower yet, but it works amazing when you are dry.  </li>
            <li> The price point for this body and the razor replacements are less than the competitors, making it a bargain and a good</li>
            <li> Does an awesome job trimming your hair down before shaving so the head doesnt get clogged up with long hair.</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have already bought one for a friend who is more of the hippie persuasion (if you know what I mean) and she claimed the guard settings were great in giving options that actually suited almost everyone, including those of the more natural sentiment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I liked the first one so much that when it recently lost it&#x27;s ability to trim my hairs in the bikini area I bought another one.</li>
            <li> The trimmer takes one AAA battery but it kills the battery life very fast, plus it doesn&#x27;t trim the way i want it too.</li>
            <li> The razor is fine but for me this item is all about the trimmer, which has a guard so that you can protect &amp; avoid sensitive areas.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The Venus does a better job IMO, and there are several other men&#x27;s razors that give a much more comfortable shave.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t wear a bathing suit every day or even every week, and a special razor for the occasion just doesn&#x27;t seem like it is important enough to me.  </li>
            <li> I love the silky smoothness it left my legs feeling</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s much better than having to use two different razors!</li>
            <li> There are better and longer lasting options out there.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m irritated in more ways than one, and plan to demand my money back.</li>
            <li> The only thing I would do better is put a shave bar around the razor so I wouldn&#x27;t have to use shaving creme at all.</li>
            <li> This product works well and is exactly as advertised.  </li>
            <li> There are many complaints of the same, therefore Schick is aware and yet continue to sell this faulty product.</li>
            <li> I need to shave daily and most razors</li>
            <li> The first time I used this bikini trimmer</li>
            <li> ;)</li>
            <li> Very convenient!  </li>
            <li> first time I used the razor part on my legs, my grip kept accidentally pushing the button for the trimmer, so it would vibrate as I was shaving.  </li>
            <li> The first time it quit within a couple of months.  </li>
            <li> At first I thought it was just a fluke, but now since two of them have bit the dust, I&#x27;m no longer going to buy them.</li>
            <li> The trimming was not uncomfortable at all and did not nick me.</li>
            <li> I have had this product since they first came out</li>
            <li> the first one I bought lasted a year and then it broke</li>
            <li> With the trimmer, I was able to trim several months&#x27; growth of hair in 5 - 10 minutes</li>
            <li> the Quattro seemed to miss consistently.</li>
            <li> It really works!  </li>
            <li> Works really well for the price!</li>
            <li> Really like it!</li>
            <li> It gets pretty close, glides well.  </li>
            <li> I really like this styler!  </li>
            <li> This was exactly what I was looking for and worked exactly as described.</li>
            <li> My first one lasted exactly one use.</li>
            <li> The razor is ok, but I really only use it because it&#x27;s there.  </li>
            <li> The ONLY flaw I have found is that the trimmer/razor doesn&#x27;t come with a holder for it like most razors do, but</li>
            <li> It only uses one battery, it&#x27;s waterproof, and it attaches to most Schick blades.  </li>
            <li> the first time i purchased it, it lasted for about 6 months.</li>
            <li> It stopped working after the first use.</li>
            <li> cats have claimed my first one.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m pretty well convinced this has</li>
            <li> You&#x27;d be SO much better off getting an actual electric razor</li>
            <li> Makes this daunting task much easier!</li>
            <li> First, the trimmer does not cut hair from the first time.</li>
            <li> It worked okay once, then it seemed like it didn&#x27;t have enough power.</li>
            <li> First of all- as a leg shaver, it doesnt shave closely at all.</li>
            <li> It is a regular razor on one end, used for shaving legs and arms, and a trimmer for the more delicate/bikini area.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The first one I bought lasted about 2 months, then died.</li>
            <li> it is great quality and does not break (at least not for me).</li>
            <li> but this thing is pretty</li>
            <li> The first one of these I bought worked better than the second one I bought.</li>
            <li> The first one died after about 6 months of use (replacing the battery didn&#x27;t help -</li>
            <li> I was able to get this with a coupon, so the cost was equal to what it would be to purcase another razor without the trimmer function.</li>
            <li> After cleaning and drying be sure to oil the blades (I use a simple 3-in-1 oil you can get at any hardware store).</li>
            <li> The trimmer is fantastic and worked wonders while I&#x27;m 8 months pregnant and have to maneuver around a big belly to shave anywhere.</li>
            <li> I normally use the Schick Intuition because it&#x27;s so quick to use in the shower and do any bikini trimming by hand.  </li>
            <li> Japan cosme recommended products, very good, just a little big sound〜</li>
            <li> I got this because it was cheaper than other reusable razors out there, and I thought the trim tool would be nice.</li>
            <li> It works well on flat areas, but it can be challenging to use on curved areas.</li>
            <li> I think I am on my 2nd one in a year or so, so they last a pretty good time.</li>
            <li> While the overall design, ergonomics, and razors are really good, the engine that powers the trimmer appears to be of extremely low quality.</li>
            <li> The first thing I have to say about this is that the suction cup doesn&#x27;t work very well for holding it to the shower wall.  </li>
            <li> Love this razor, and the battery lasts a long time in it too.</li>
            <li> and then you can go back for more precise styling later.</li>
            <li> It will be much easier to consistently take care of the bikini area.of the bikini area.</li>
            <li> will say that I am a huge fan of waxing but at $65 for a brazillian (and the hassle of keeping the area ingrown hair free), I looked for other options.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Schick blades where as usual good</li>
            <li> Razor and trimmer, small, works well with longer (1 inch) hairs, Schick is a good brand&lt;</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to travel with and it last a while.</li>
            <li> Finally, I have found a razor that does the job easily without tearing up my legs.</li>
            <li> I find it works better dry because the water seems to clog the blades...</li>
            <li> Very clever idea.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;However, I feel this is a strong tool overall.</li>
            <li> If you run out of razor blades, a close trim will certainly tide you over.</li>
            <li> While it&#x27;s more comfortable to hold while shaving due to the thickness, it&#x27;s also bulkier and more stiff than I like in a razor.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, it works fine - except for my mysterious motor failures.</li>
            <li> but it is a pretty decent trimmer.</li>
            <li> This waterproof razor and trimmer is pretty decent as a trimmer.</li>
            <li> Left my legs and underarms very smooth and soft with no irritation.  </li>
            <li> And, amazingly, their is little to no razor burn, even on the bikini area.  </li>
            <li> Part of this could very well be LA metal filled hard water, but it seems like something like this should hold up a bit better.</li>
            <li> , otherwise the 5 year old one was still going strong (with new a new battery every 5 or 6 months).</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s waterproof, the 4-blade razor gives you a very close shave (when it&#x27;s not nicking you), and the bikini trimmer works very well, and the holder is actually very functional and works well.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s waterproof, the 4-blade razor gives you a very close shave (when it&#x27;s not nicking you), and the bikini trimmer works very well, and the holder is actually very functional and works well.  </li>
            <li> It is too much of a hassle to send back and too cheap for me to even care anymore.  </li>
            <li> It trim very well.</li>
            <li> I bought one of these from my local Target and it&#x27;s fantastic.</li>
            <li> The waterproff feature is a real plus.  </li>
            <li> I took the cap off and trimmed my whole bikini area</li>
            <li> The bikini trimmer is wide and bulky and requires some interesting contortions in the shower to use.  </li>
            <li> I have to say that this razor/ trimmer didn&#x27;t really impress me.</li>
            <li> I also really like the attached trimmer for my bikini area.  </li>
            <li> Very convenient to have the two products combined into one.  </li>
            <li> I used the guard on the lowest setting, and much to my surprise</li>
            <li> I prefer a really close trim rather than shaving because I don&#x27;t like the itchy feeling shaving leaves,</li>
            <li> The whole razor is waterproof.  </li>
            <li> Both the shaver and trimmer also resisted rusting very well</li>
            <li> It disapponted me as I really want to have a trimmer to work well.</li>
            <li> It really does do what&#x27;s needed and there&#x27;s no fuss involved.</li>
            <li> , cord draped over my leg, hoping to achieve straight lines-</li>
            <li> thanks a lot.</li>
            <li> So I very reluctantly pay the money for it and the cartridges.</li>
            <li> Because it shaves and trims, the Schick Quattro for Women is very versatile.  </li>
            <li> I have used the Schick Quattro razor for women alone, and it doesn&#x27;t shave very well.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;That said, the trimmer is really good--dry.</li>
            <li> I have manual bikini trimmer that really doesn&#x27;t work well at all.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used the trimmer much yet</li>
            <li> I was really hoping for a closer trim.</li>
            <li> I was just really hoping the trimmer would provide a closer shave than it did.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really like the tricky job of shaving my bikini area</li>
            <li> The Quattro allows you to get a very close shave.</li>
            <li> The razor is comfortable to hold, although this trimstyle model is bulkier than the regular quattro.</li>
            <li> Much cheaper on Amazon when I ordered it.</li>
            <li> It also doesn&#x27;t trim very well.  </li>
            <li> it really was a razor&amp;#34; when I took it out.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so much cheaper here than a drugstore or HEB.</li>
            <li> Works really well.</li>
            <li> But to my surprise, that part would move along with my curves, so I didn&#x27;t have to worry about much.</li>
            <li> and it works really well.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a shame because this product worked really well...</li>
            <li> Thanks</li>
            <li> It is very practical.</li>
            <li> Haha.</li>
            <li> I sent it back to the company and got another one for free.</li>
            <li> br /&gt;it wasn&#x27;t a lot of money and the razor works very nicely.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I was gentle on my skin, but the product didn&#x27;t do what others promised.</li>
            <li> Couldn&#x27;t get a close shave at all.&lt;br /&gt;However, these things really lack durability.</li>
            <li> so I can&#x27;t really complain.</li>
            <li> It works very well, and for a reasonable price.</li>
            <li> This works really well for me.</li>
            <li> The suction cups hold fast and I&#x27;ve had no issues with it at all.</li>
            <li> Definitely can&#x27;t use it in the shower like they make it sound like you can.  </li>
            <li> And it is not like I return things very often either.</li>
            <li> was really hesitant to try this razor.</li>
            <li> I dont want to spend that much money on just replacement razors, so I just use the bikini trimmer now and use a disposable razor.</li>
            <li> This item is really all about the trimmer for me.  </li>
            <li> I really do get a close shave that lasts me up to 2 weeks</li>
            <li> Its also fast as hell and takes about 5 minutes for the lady scaping.  </li>
            <li> This works really well and makes shaving a breeze.</li>
            <li> she wanted such a thing she wouls steal my beard trimmer which works far better</li>
            <li> I was actually quite a bit nervous to use the trimmer down there, but I tried it and it works pretty good.</li>
            <li> Overall I think it is worth the money since it doesn&#x27;t cost that much more than a regular razor and the trimmer does a decent job.  </li>
            <li> My first on burnt out when I tried to put a new battery in</li>
            <li> many other women, I tend to go into &#x27;hibernation&#x27; mode in the winter when my legs are covered by pants or tights at all times, and I don&#x27;t shave very often.</li>
            <li> Maybe other people have better luck with using it.  </li>
            <li> Maybe other people have better luck with using it.  </li>
            <li> It is also pretty loud, which isn&#x27;t all that important, but enough for me to comment on.</li>
            <li> rested.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The razor takes the same 4-blade replacement as the original Quattro for Women (so you can use any blades you may have)</li>
            <li> What I really enjoyed was the waterproof trimmer on the other end of the razor.</li>
            <li> Wife tends to like this item more than any other razor.  </li>
            <li> The trimmer on the other end is also okay.</li>
            <li> The main razor blade shaves the legs very well and doesn&#x27;t cut her legs.</li>
            <li> I recommend it to my friends all the time for quick clean up and trim down there.</li>
            <li> It does shave well, but I do not like shaving with it as much as my Venus 5 blade, which shaves better, faster, and with less effort.</li>
            <li> I felt uneasy at first using the trimmer side on my sensitive areas</li>
            <li> Overall a very sleek and stylish razor that does double duty.</li>
            <li> It is pretty loud</li>
            <li> First, let me start off by saying that my legs are extremely sensitive.</li>
            <li> One thing is for sure, the Quattro gives me a much smoother shave in some areas, like my bikini line and the back of my thighs but not in others (like my actually bikini area or legs).</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re looking for a decent razor, a great trimmer, and aren&#x27;t worried about about getting EVERY single little hair, I&#x27;d highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I use it on the lowest setting to trim most everything down there and then take the cover off to do the sides, etc.  </li>
            <li> The trimmer is a little loud but works nicely.</li>
            <li> I want to give this product 4 stars because I do &amp;#34;like it&amp;#34; and it&#x27;s better than &amp;#34;it&#x27;s okay.&amp;#34; 4 stars seems like a little too much, though.</li>
            <li> My new fave razor!</li>
            <li> I usually use a straight razor for trimming my bikini line, but living Southern California means going to the beach and pool year-round, so I wanted something more precise.</li>
            <li> So far it is still superior to others I have used and trashed due to not working or causing bodily injury.</li>
            <li> so I don&#x27;t mind as much that I end up buying the new razor.</li>
            <li> The grip has a rubbery feel to it making it easy to hold even when wet.</li>
            <li> but it trims decently.</li>
            <li> You&#x27;d probably have to buy a lot of these to make it the same amount of time a better quality trimmer would last you.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The trimmer is powered by 1 AAA battery which has a rather clever compartment.</li>
            <li> However, it was not ridiculously loud.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The only downside is that I&#x27;ve found myself replacing the battery rather quickly, despite not using the trimmer too often.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin and am prone to razor burn, which can be really embarrassing in the bikini bottom area.</li>
            <li> The razor works ok on your legs, but leaves a mess for the underarms.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> The razorblades are high quality.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Recommend this product highly.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend buying this razor in store since it runs at about $12.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend this razor.</li>
            <li> and I would highly recommend it to others.</li>
            <li> I had high hopes for this, but..</li>
            <li> Works great dry, but does not cut the same if used when wet.  </li>
            <li> Their ads need to be a little better explaining what this product does, but once I figured it out, I bought it immediately.  </li>
            <li> I love the thing and for the price there is little I can complain about.</li>
            <li> I proceeded to shave the area with the razor end which did an impressive job, although a few little ones got left out.</li>
            <li> The three lengths are also really helpful, though I like it pretty short</li>
            <li> Hope it lasts more than a few months.</li>
            <li> so I normally take that off.</li>
            <li> From the first shave to the last, you&#x27;re sure to be left with a stingy, burning discomfort that will last throughout the day.</li>
            <li> The razor is just a like a normal razor</li>
            <li> Because of that, this trimmer fell on the shower floor one too many times and didn&#x27;t last as long as it should have.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Waste of money better of using shaving  razor</li>
            <li> While there were a few straggling hairs which I missed, I think it was more my fault than that of the Quattro</li>
            <li> Take away from hair and it returned to normal speed.</li>
            <li> This is the 2nd one I&#x27;ve owned in a year, but worth it because my husband likes it too.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s good in theory, but poor in execution.  </li>
            <li> The razor blade part is ok, it does the job, but doesn&#x27;t last very long.  </li>
            <li> Not only that, but the price of a package of cartridges is just as much as buying a whole new razor!</li>
            <li> If I were going on a date with my husband, etc., and wanted a VERY close shave, I would probably still swipe his razor, but for everyday shaving, I think it&#x27;s just fine.  </li>
            <li> I decided to just use a Venus (which has no idiotic, useless wires in the back, and thus rinses completely clean very quickly), and my life got much easier.</li>
            <li> The Schick Quattro Razor is really smooth against the skin, does not leave razor bumps and adds moisture that other razors do not offer.</li>
            <li> Couldn&#x27;t live without it</li>
            <li> When I called the manufacturer they offered to send me a new one.  </li>
            <li> I tried new batteries, wiggling the connectors - no luck.  </li>
            <li> The new Schick Quattro for Women TrimStyle lets you shave, and trim with just the flip of a handle.</li>
            <li> I cannot say how much I live this product</li>
            <li> Shick&#x27;s new tool is a razor and bikini trimmer called the Quattro</li>
            <li> I have tried replacing the battery with a new one</li>
            <li> and I wanted a new color for my new bathroom</li>
            <li> and I live with people</li>
            <li> and I cringe when trying new things.</li>
            <li> so I get a new one.</li>
            <li> I buy a new one every year, because eventually the trimmer stops working.  </li>
            <li> , what new fangled thing can we design that will get women to buy our product?</li>
            <li> but if you make sure to not leave your razor in a wet place they last longer.</li>
            <li> The razor is good for everyday (absolutely no irritation with that either), but if you want a super-super-close shave, look elsewhere.</li>
            <li> The trimmer is quite slow, only good for light/delicate touch ups.  </li>
            <li> (also put out by Schick) years ago--I just am NOT able to get a close shave with it because it has wires holding down the razors.&lt;br /&gt;The trimmer part isn&#x27;t all that great either.  </li>
            <li> I have very very sensitive bikini line skin..</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li> this product is highly recommend to anyone who is prone to razor bumps &amp; anyone who doesn&#x27;t want to shave completely , but would like to keep the area trimmed.</li>
            <li> Wow!</li>
            <li> Personally, I don&#x27;t have that many tiny areas to worry about using a teeny tiny trimmer.</li>
            <li> razor is the standard schick quattro blade, it gives a close shave and for me it lasts through at least 7 bikini shaves and countless leg shaves without dulling, which is great.</li>
            <li> The shipping was speedy despite weather conditions and the packaging was not damaged or dented or folded in like many past Amazon purchases.</li>
            <li> and unfortunately I can&#x27;t no longer find it locally.</li>
            <li> It is completely waterproof so no worries!</li>
            <li> , you don&#x27;t have to get the &#x27;woman&#x27; version, because the &#x27;men&#x27; version is exactly the same in functionality.</li>
            <li> I bought this razor in pink about a year ago and was satisfied with it until the trimmer completely stopped working about 6 months later.  </li>
            <li> I mainly use both the trimmer and razor in the shower because I find it less of a hassle to clean</li>
            <li> I took off one star because, like someone else said, the wires holding down the blades kept my legs from being completely smooth.</li>
            <li> First all-in-one shaver and bikini trimmer .It is the only razor with 4 ultra-thin blades for long- lasting smooth skin and a built-in waterproof bikini trimmer in one.   </li>
            <li> The first one started to die out (not enough power to keep the trimmer blades moving fast enough, even with brand new batteries) after about a year of use.</li>
            <li> I usually prefer simple razors, but the trimmer is nice.</li>
            <li> The only problem is that the refill heads are becoming harder to find</li>
            <li> Also, the razor on the other end is nothing special.  </li>
            <li> I was surprised at the number of lower ratings - but did some of them are very old, so maybe the razor has changed since then.</li>
            <li> Like the original, there is a little rubber button to rest your finger, right above the razor blade, but I found that this was not where my finger naturally</li>
            <li> Better products out there for the same or less money.</li>
            <li> it does seem to go dead rather quickly but lasts much longer than the Cleancut</li>
            <li> I was so excited when I got it, but was immediately let down.  </li>
            <li> Pretty much like any other razor you&#x27;ve ever used...</li>
            <li> in my opinion, only leaves slight stubble with closest setting, no razor burn, pinching, or knicks so far though &#x3D;)</li>
            <li> /&gt;It doesn&#x27;t get rid of all the hair, which is fine since its not a huge bother.  </li>
            <li> This is a fantastic little trimmer.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;d recommend this for anyone who is wanting to keep down the bush and feel clean--</li>
            <li> This is actually the same thing that happened to me with the first one!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s strong &amp; sharp enough, though, to take off a couple months of growth without a problem.  </li>
            <li> As stated above it is good for trimming, but when I shave with this in the &#x27;on&#x27; position, the vibration actually allows me to get a just a little extra closer and do so without irritation.</li>
            <li> The trimmer left me sheek enough to be comfortable and besides, the razor could be used to smooth out the trim (If I felt like it) - and when it gets dull or if the battery is not connecting to the mechanical aspect of the shaver-  </li>
            <li> Some of you clearly dont know how to use this product.</li>
            <li> For a girl, with extremely sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> It deosnt completely get rid of the hair like a razor</li>
            <li> This all in one tool only needs one battery and it really trims the bikini area well.</li>
            <li> Took one star away for it being so loud.</li>
            <li> I was pleasantly surprised at how well</li>
            <li> Call me old-fashioned, but when I buy something that has no reason it should need to be replaced very often at all, I expect it to stick around for several years.</li>
            <li> I opened it up and found out that a ton of hair was getting inside the product and causing a clog, so I fixed that issue.</li>
            <li> After a couple of nicks, I was done trying to figure out why I was getting nicked and just stopped using it completely.  </li>
            <li> And though I lack technique, the initial results have been very promising.&lt;br</li>
            <li> no nicks so far.</li>
            <li> experience so far is...</li>
            <li> I was actually really surprised by how well this worked.  </li>
            <li> I have found that the trimmer doesn&#x27;t like being used without cleaning it often with professional blade cleaners.  </li>
            <li> I remove the cap completely, and swear by the results.</li>
            <li> but i dident want them completely shaved.</li>
            <li> I bought this at my local drug store on sale but really like&lt;br /&gt;it</li>
            <li> Came a day early.</li>
            <li> and I didn&#x27;t get any bumps on my sensitive legs</li>
            <li> but I have extremely sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I just use them and eventually like everything they get old</li>
            <li> Some reviews said it rusted; I haven&#x27;t seen anything so far (had it about 3 months) and frankly, at this price I&#x27;m surprised anyone is worried about a replacement cost, anyway.</li>
            <li> I used to use the male schick quattro titanium trimmer, and honestly I can&#x27;t really tell the difference between the two.  </li>
            <li> i kept it completely out of water also.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t actually tried investing in buying the razors for the handle, as I only use the trimmer, but if I were to try it out, I&#x27;d imagine it&#x27;d be just as useful.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Unfortunately, the trimmer wasn&#x27;t quite as effective - at least for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Personally, I would probably recommend just sticking with a standard razor and using something else as a trimmer.</li>
            <li> I would definitely say it is worth it for only around 10 bucks</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t grown out enough to get a good trim and thought about leaving it poor reviews.</li>
            <li> I LOVE this product, so much so, that even after it&#x27;s broken FOUR TIMES, i keep buying more!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Much easier to get everything looking pretty and neat down there.</li>
            <li> The cost of a new razor is almost the same as a new blade</li>
            <li> I find the battery runs down rather quickly on mine</li>
            <li> The Quattro For Women Trimstyle comes with a plastic holder which suctions to the shower wall but probably will not fit in the original shower</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m also a big creature of habit, so a new product would really have to blow me away to make enough of an impression for me to change products.</li>
            <li> The grip is fine for small hand.</li>
            <li> I only wish that it wasn&#x27;t as noisy and that the back of the razors would be less blocked so the hair could be cleaned out better.</li>
            <li> At the same time though, it&#x27;s the only razor/trimmer combo that I am aware of which makes it convenient.</li>
            <li> I tried two more and they didn&#x27;t last longer than a month, which was still not many uses.</li>
            <li> However, I have really only gotten two new ones over the years because they got old.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin and the bikini area is extra sensitive.</li>
            <li> The razor is okay, but the trimmer is not good.</li>
            <li> And for a shorter cut ;) you can take off the pink think</li>
            <li> I replace the blade every few weeks and generally replace the entire thing about once a year just so that the trimmer is as efficient as possible, although I&#x27;m sure I could go longer without doing</li>
            <li> Luckily they seem to last a good amount of time without getting dull but that may also be due to the fact I don&#x27;t shave everyday.</li>
            <li> it simply would not turn on even with new batteries.  </li>
            <li> SO, pay attention, and buy a new razor every once in a blue moon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Occasionally the trimmer will stop running and a new battering won&#x27;t make it work again.</li>
            <li> It doesnt come in pretty colors (only comes in black) but its the exact same thing and gets the job done!</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that the design could be somewhat more ergonomic.  </li>
            <li> The trimmer is less practical, but it useful</li>
            <li> Being quite small,it does take a long,long while to finish,for example,a whole head of hair if using the 1 or 2 setting,but having the option of doing this myself,I´m personally never going back to a hair salon.</li>
            <li> I suppose it takes a few tries to get the hang of it and with more use, it becomes easier</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not crazy about the vibrating option, just personal preference I guess, but the blades are sharp, long lasting, and the razor is well balanced in the hand, easy to grip when wet.</li>
            <li> Even the first time I used it the razor was not as sharp as my weeks-old Gillette.</li>
            <li> I have had no other problems with this trimmer.</li>
            <li> The trimmer has two small screws that can be removed allowing you to thoroughly clean the blades.</li>
            <li> I did buy a new one after a couple of years just to buy a new one and no real reason...</li>
            <li> The tool itself is the same teal and white so while it&#x27;s different from the pink of the original Quattro for Women, it&#x27;s still quite feminine.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The blade side has four blades and these can last over several shaves, which is nice, but being concerned about the cost I will probably just stick to my cheaper two blade razors (less than half the price).</li>
            <li> I just can&#x27;t get used to the painful waxing process so this bikini trimmer does a great job instead.</li>
            <li> It hydrates the skin while shaving, and leaves them extra soft afterwards.</li>
            <li> Extremely short life span (about 2/3 months) before it completely stops working.</li>
            <li> far as reviewing the actual trimmer, I&#x27;d have to break it into two parts:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used it once so far</li>
            <li> The bikini trimmer lets me stay &#x27;almost bare&#x27; and not have razor burns.</li>
            <li> far as the 4-blade razor goes, it is very standard.</li>
            <li> The bikini trimmer, which does have adjustable settings for control that go from \\&quot;barely trimmed\\&quot; to \\&quot;almost gone\\&quot;, works well.</li>
            <li> Does not shave you bare to skin, just a trim.  </li>
            <li> The only reason I gave it four stars instead of five is because it is so loud.</li>
            <li> Most ppl usually leave their razor in the shower, but the trimmer part will rust if you do so, so this is not very practical.  </li>
            <li> The attached razor is ok, but not great.  </li>
            <li> A small trimmer for $10 is not bad.</li>
            <li> Comfortable to shave with and the handle is just the right size for those like me who are a little clumsy with razors in the shower.  </li>
            <li> The only difference is the color and the &#x27;women&#x27; refill razors have just a little more lubricant on the edge, but other than that the razors are interchangeable.</li>
            <li> The regular diposable/replaceable razor other end is remarkably good and does not cut me as others have in the past causing being careful of my choices.</li>
            <li> If I needed to shave after a couple weeks&#x27; worth of growth, trying to do it with this razor was a nightmare that could last upwards of half an hour.</li>
            <li> But the trimmer is very loud, and there are not a whole lot of options as far as choosing the length.</li>
            <li> I read a couple other reviews where others have had the exact same experience.  </li>
            <li> Experience shows they charge more for &#x27;pink&#x27; razors vs. a plain black or blue one that does the exact same thing.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> The trimmer cuts extremely close and is gentle on the skin.</li>
            <li> I would definitely  recommend this product especially for the duel action.</li>
            <li> The second major problem I had is when I nicked myself a couple of times.  </li>
            <li> Like some others said i was a little leery at first putting the trimmer&lt;</li>
            <li> No more throwing money at razors that cost less and work better-</li>
            <li> It is also awkward to use on your intimate area, it would be better with a regular razor.</li>
            <li> Much better than some other trimmers I&#x27;ve used in the past that were way more expensive.</li>
            <li> Keep looking if you are a woman who wants zero hair down there.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also loud enough to be annoying and potentially embarrassing, LOL.</li>
            <li> There are a few issues with it but overall a cheap alternative to other grooming methods.  </li>
            <li> This is the second one I bought, and the first one lasted a long time, unlike some of the other reviewers.  </li>
            <li> I guess I can at least use the normal razor side for a while and just chuck the whole thing when I&#x27;m done.</li>
            <li> If you are like me and need to tame the lion, the trimmer is the first tool for the job</li>
            <li> I liked the fact that this was waterproof, but considering what a poor job it did, it was not worth the money.</li>
            <li> The trimmer is too small and only works on non-curvy areas (because women&#x27;s bodies have lots of those, right?).</li>
            <li> Well, look no further, the Quattro&#x27;s dull blade technology produces consistent results!  </li>
            <li> It was easy to set it at the short or long lengths but the middle one was harder because the comb wanted to skip past that setting.</li>
            <li> I just don&#x27;t shave down there during this week and use the time to go buy the next razor because the new battery never works for me.</li>
            <li> It stayed sharp and so far \\&quot;knocking on wood</li>
            <li> I have trouble around my bony knees with other razors but this one contours just right.</li>
            <li> The shaving razor end was highly moisturizing, and the little buzzer let me keep my bikini area in control.</li>
            <li> but I spent several minutes trying to trim down some neglected hairs and absolutely NOTHING happened.</li>
            <li> I was rather skeptical using this down there, but I ended up loving it.</li>
            <li> VERY loud, like a vibrator, Wall suction cup is not strong enough, will not trim short hairs</li>
            <li> Its super nimble and small enough to get into tight quarters.</li>
            <li> At the very least, if you are interested in keeping yourself trim down under, this is something that I found very helpful.</li>
            <li> wife say the trimmer is too small and too usless to be of real beefit and</li>
            <li> I really LOVE the bikini trimmer part of the razor, but I&#x27;m not so crazy about the actual razor, doesn&#x27;t provide a close enough shave for me.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s been a year since I bought this and the one AAA battery that it uses last a really long time</li>
            <li> be ware, they don&#x27;t last long.</li>
            <li> Until today when it died for no apparent reason.</li>
            <li> The blades last long</li>
            <li> a bald 6 year old girl down there.  </li>
            <li> They last way longer and don&#x27;t have the mess behind it to clean up!</li>
            <li> it ripped bikini line hair out when I used the trimmer in that area and the upkeep was too costly the razor doesnt last long!</li>
            <li> but if you&#x27;ve ever tried that, you would know how easily it can go wrong.</li>
            <li> I will add that I use it dry and to only trim my bikini area.</li>
            <li> Sometimes I would find myself perched on the toilet, with an electric trimmer</li>
            <li> The trimmer has a guard you can remove if you want to get closer mine is medium pink and white with white shower holder.</li>
            <li> I was surprised how well this little Trimstyle razor worked.</li>
            <li> It can be a little loud, but doesn&#x27;t bother me or my roommates.</li>
            <li> However, it&#x27;s hard to really trim with it.</li>
            <li> Trim Style, thank you for being just under $10 at Walmart, or I&#x27;d be REALLY more angry at this money that&#x27;s being flushed down the toilet.</li>
            <li> Though I probably should have stuck with a normal rasor, since i hardly use its second feature.</li>
            <li> At first look I was a little worried because the razor looked so thick and heavy, but it really wasn&#x27;t a problem.  </li>
            <li> The result was it didn&#x27;t cut the hair very close at least not all of it</li>
            <li> Schick really ought to include instructions on its packaging about this as it extends the life of the trimmer and would help them avoid negative reviews.</li>
            <li> I know getting a nicer trimmer is probably cheaper in the long run, but dollar signs in my eyes, and the bank account feeling pinched at the moment, I grabbed another one of these.     </li>
            <li> I think that would happen no matter where the button is located on the handle as long as it is that shaft and is the style it is.</li>
            <li> I don beekeeper style gear, grab a hatchet and set to work for long hours under the blinding sun.</li>
            <li> and I can&#x27;t remember how long I&#x27;ve had it -</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s quite a long time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have used the trimmer enough to go through a few batteries and the razor enough to go through several heads.  </li>
            <li> it didn&#x27;t take long for it to come in</li>
            <li> Batteries last as expected.</li>
            <li> Basically, all this does is create a larger chunk of garbage to toss when the razor dulls.</li>
            <li> The battery lasted a long time for me.  </li>
            <li> I have not purchased razors marketed to women in a long time.  </li>
            <li> which is how long I had mine..).</li>
            <li> I wont spend a long time shaving.</li>
            <li> The small trimmer can trim down the Course hair first then Shape the bikini area with the razor.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m usually a little clumsy with razors, but the handle is just thick enough to make it easy to keep a grip on, without being so big that it&#x27;s cumbersome in the bikini area.  </li>
            <li> The trimmer head is very small and does not cut very close to the skin.</li>
            <li> It takes one AA battery and the unit is entirely waterproof making it extremely versatile.</li>
            <li> Like some other reviewers, I bought it for the trimmer, and the trimmer does a solid job.  </li>
            <li> This also lasts a long time!</li>
            <li> I have purchased other bikini trimmers that are bigger and clunkier and that you have to store separately</li>
            <li> I have never tried any other electric trimmers outside of this one.  </li>
            <li> , I like the novelty of the regular razor on the other end.  </li>
            <li> Decent trimmers are hard to find.</li>
            <li> Thus, to spend the extra money for this instead of buying a plain old razor is not worth it.</li>
            <li> I always used the trimmer dry and cleaned it well.  </li>
            <li> but when I go to dry trim</li>
            <li> I believe it drained battery dry. ??</li>
            <li> going to just use mine dry and see if it doesn&#x27;t quit on  me.  </li>
            <li> there was a review I read when looking at buying this product that complained about it being to loud, I do not agree, it is not silent but its quieter than my husbands</li>
            <li> Two, after awhile the blades on the bikini trimmer side tend to dull or quit working, which may be normal, and you have to buy another one because you can&#x27;t replace the trimmer part.</li>
            <li> Normally, I make due with a pair of small scissors</li>
            <li> Also, I once noticed that there was a bit of rust near the screw as well, not healthy.  </li>
            <li> I was thrilled to try this product because I had been looking for something to help trim the \\&quot;forest\\&quot; but I was really disappointed with this product.</li>
            <li> so this really works for me because you have the trimmer on one side to shave down the long and thick hairs</li>
            <li> Also, the screw that holds the trimmer portion on got loose after about 2 or 3 uses, and stopped working.  </li>
            <li> (so double-check before you start trimming), (2) it will rust the trimmer, and (3) the suction cups will loose suction, and the trimmer will end up on the floor of the shower (</li>
            <li> and I used to despise grooming \\&quot;down there\\&quot; with my traditional razor.</li>
            <li> If you have coarse hair you have to work at it before you get the hair cut down.</li>
            <li> You know it&#x27;s time to change it out when the trimmer either won&#x27;t go on with a new battery, or it gets really slow.  </li>
            <li> The trimmer is not super quiet.</li>
            <li> As of the end of March the trimmer started acting odd.</li>
            <li> You must need to get into some pretty interesting twisted contortions to use it because the way it sits, it&#x27;s impossible to actually get rid of any hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I actually prefer the black color.</li>
            <li> Being that I am of the younger 20&#x27;s generation, it is just a personal hygiene preference to keep things tame down there.</li>
            <li> I have been losing some weight recently, exercising a little, and shaping up.</li>
            <li> The entire unit is waterproof and comes with a little holder that sticks onto your shower wall by suction cups.  </li>
            <li> However, I now only use it for the trimmer and the little suction cup holder it comes with.</li>
            <li> It was loud, hard to use, and just didn&#x27;t do it for me.</li>
            <li> The trimmer was a huge disappointment.  </li>
            <li> \\&quot;Smooth Moves and Dangerous</li>
            <li> The bikini trimmer works great but the razor is just awful.</li>
            <li> For $10 I&#x27;m not sure how long it will last-</li>
            <li> There is also not much choice on hair length.  </li>
            <li> Yes, I like the purple/ pink color</li>
            <li> but the handle got mildewy and dark from being in a moist environment for long.</li>
            <li> Someone in my household finally got around to giving this a go for a few months.</li>
            <li> however, I&#x27;ve spent $8 on a Schick Intuition 3 or 4 times a year.</li>
            <li> Works as expected.</li>
            <li> I am not much of a shaver.</li>
            <li> so I replaced it with the pink one</li>
            <li> and it comes in a feminine pink and teal-ish package.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s pink</li>
            <li> My initial reaction was that it worked, but after a few uses, the body, where it twists apart to insert the batteries, began to loosen, until it was a balancing act to shave while holding the razor together</li>
            <li> So you have to take care of business before getting yourself wet.  </li>
            <li> and it is not what I expected</li>
            <li> Its a little loud but does a quick job cutting things down to managable size.&lt;br</li>
            <li> All the other (affordable) trimmers I&#x27;ve tried have left me dissatisfied at best, angry at worst; they catch/pull hairs or don&#x27;t catch the hair enough to cut it.  </li>
            <li> A new battery did no good.</li>
            <li> Unless you swim everyday, this is generally not a problem.</li>
            <li> I checked inside and it was quite rusty, so it isn&#x27;t entirely waterproof (at least not over a long period of time).  </li>
            <li> so for me, this little gadget will be a mainstay in my bathroom for a long time.  </li>
            <li> I would recommend other.</li>
            <li> Also the plastic guard on the trimmer had sharp edges that scratched sensative skin.  </li>
            <li> No more razor burn or cuts in private spots.</li>
            <li> Other than the blades, which need replacing periodically, I&#x27;d expect this razor/trimmer to be a relatively \\&quot;permanent,\\&quot; or non-disposable item, like buying a hair dryer or other small appliance.     </li>
            <li> I read some of the other reviews about the longevity of the razor and other concerns.</li>
            <li> (My other razors have never had an issue.)  </li>
            <li> (could that be on account of a leak, or some other defect?)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I LOVE the idea of this, but I have to say I was disappointed.</li>
            <li> The rust doesn&#x27;t come from the blades themselves but from the other parts and probably the insides as well.  </li>
            <li> While being careful of course!</li>
            <li> razor is just like other Schick razors.</li>
            <li> Just sharp enough...but not too sharp.</li>
            <li> so it has a razor on one end and trimmer on the other.  </li>
            <li> I am extremely disapponited.</li>
            <li> The razor on the other hand, lasted me for four months.</li>
            <li> The trimmer I find really pretty useless.</li>
            <li> The other ones I got were because i move a lot</li>
            <li> The thing is amazingly safe, even when getting into the nooks and crannies, and the hair doesn&#x27;t get cut short enough to feel like stubble and cause irritation (which was always horrible 2 weeks or so after a wax).  </li>
            <li> However, this has never happened with any other of the quattro razors I&#x27;ve owned.</li>
            <li> The electronic shaver barely works, and by barely I mean not at all.</li>
            <li> I tried it a few times and it caused nicks every single time.</li>
            <li> The electric bikini trimmer actually cut my skin - not very pleasant at all.</li>
            <li> I finally threw it away when I opened it to replace the batteries and saw that due to the shoddy design, water had gotten inside the battery compartment and corroded the batteries and mechanism.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not going to get a tiny screwdriver and clean it out, that&#x27;s just stupid.  </li>
            <li> Worse still, Schick customer service couldn&#x27;t have cared less about wasting their loyal customers hard earned $$!</li>
            <li> I purchased this for my wife and she says it works well, but is not worth the money.</li>
            <li> AVERAGE BUT STILL</li>
            <li> This is not worth the money.</li>
            <li> not worth the money at all</li>
            <li> Razor is average, but too bulky compared to others.</li>
            <li> Even then, the hair that it trims is not really noticeable unless you run over it a few passes.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve purchased a few of these in black and there is absolutely no difference between the men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s versions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;7.</li>
            <li> You have to hold the button down in order to keep it on as it&#x27;s a pressure switch.  </li>
            <li> I am looking for the hair down there to be a bit shorter</li>
            <li> One star down because after two years of ownership it stopped working.</li>
            <li> The smallest trimmer setting gets me down to what looks like about 3 days of growth after shaving.</li>
            <li> razor settings to cater to the amount of hair you want to trim down.</li>
            <li> This being clarified,I use this practical machine to trim down my body hair,trim my beard(or mow it down before a shave),and cut my hair.</li>
            <li> I can trim down to just above the skin, no more ingrown hairs!</li>
            <li> I used this razor for bikini and legs 2 or 3 times and it stayed really sharp!</li>
            <li> I mean, given the price-point and the disposable-ness of the product, it&#x27;s not like it would make sense to have a solid trimmer attached.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have the problem of being overweight or \\&quot;curvy\\&quot; as other women put it, but I feel like I have partly wasted my money.</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t be disappointed if I had to purchase a 2nd or 3rd in a years time; after all, $30-$40 a year- is far cheaper than a bikini wax.</li>
            <li> But the trimmer stopped working for me at all within maybe three months, maybe less.  </li>
            <li> in less than 3 months, it&#x27;s rusted and won&#x27;t work.  </li>
            <li> Purchased the Schick Quattro Titanium Trimmer with a dollar off coupon- making less than $10.</li>
            <li> This is just like a typical razor but with a trimmer at the bottom.</li>
            <li> The worst part was they didn&#x27;t seem to believe me that it was a razor making the sound and a security guard stood over smirking while I fixed it.</li>
            <li> I think you can buy this in Walmart for less</li>
            <li> Previously I had purchased Gilette razors but I decided to get this when I noticed it was on sale</li>
            <li> It cuts time in half so</li>
            <li> Some moron decided to cover the rear of the razor with tiny wires that seem to function only to keep shaved hair stuck in the blade, making the blade impossible to rinse, and thus gumming up your shave pretty much immediately.</li>
            <li> I had to pass over each area several times, pressing very hard, to get anything even approximating a shave, and needless to say, the Schick razor never gave me a very close one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, however, the second one has also broken much to my dismay this morning.</li>
            <li> That said, this poor thing barely worked at all, and completed choked on hair coarser than arm hair.</li>
            <li> Even after drying out the compartment and putting in a new battery, my trimmer buzzed very weakly and then conked out altogether.  </li>
            <li> but as the battery starts to wear down the vibrating action does as well making for a bit of an uncomfortable shave.</li>
            <li> I was not a fan of this, having to hold down the button as you need to use the trimmer was not easy at all.</li>
            <li> basically, you would have to let your bikini line hairs grow out a little bit before you could trim them.</li>
            <li> I wish it was a little cheaper</li>
            <li> I decided to try this to see how it compared, as it was a little cheaper.  </li>
            <li> It *is* a little noisy, but not obnoxiously so.  </li>
            <li> The comb was a little tricky to maneuver.</li>
            <li> Removing the comb can help for cleaning up any little hairs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little noisy</li>
            <li> and it cut my skin and bled a little.</li>
            <li> Even with replacing the battery, hairs get stuck inside the little compartment where the screw is.  </li>
            <li> I prefer other kinds of razors (gillette women&#x27;s stuff usually).</li>
            <li> Do you wish your shaving experience was a little more frustrating and painful?  </li>
            <li> They work well for a few months, then go into a moody phase where they&#x27;ll work sort of well, but also occasionally stop mid-trim causing painful hair grabbing/snagging, regardless of battery condition, then eventually die completely.</li>
            <li> Disappointing because it worked really well.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money on this.  </li>
            <li> Both of them stopped working within a few weeks.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money on this.  </li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t believe I&#x27;m harsh with it--</li>
            <li> I kept this in the shower shower holder it came with and the trimmer blade rusted within a few months.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not cheap, I&#x27;m frugal.</li>
            <li> Being given the ability to a skip bikini waxing a few times a year is what made me a product evangelist.</li>
            <li> While shaving the bikini area after trimming, I did bring out my Venus to get a few hairs</li>
            <li> I have wasted my money on.  </li>
            <li> I had one of these before and it died after a few years.</li>
            <li> The razor works for a few months before I have any issues with it</li>
            <li> But if you ever get behind on your shaving, Schick is definitely NOT the razor for you.</li>
            <li> However, after a year or so (and a few batteries), the trimmer part stopped working.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve seen some reviews stating that it dies after a few uses...</li>
            <li> , after a few uses it did die.</li>
            <li> in a few months.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve gotten these a few these</li>
            <li> so this hasn&#x27;t been a giant put off for me, but it&#x27;s definitely not great.</li>
            <li> I still have this razor and use it almost everyday.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> It stops working after a few months and then I can&#x27;t trim my vagina anymore.</li>
            <li> Does the job, but it died after a few months.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> The battery went dead after one use, so I switched batteries</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure why it has such poor reviews.</li>
            <li> So in order to tame the dragon, I tried disposable razors.</li>
            <li> P*ss poor excuse for a razor and a trimmer.  </li>
            <li> I have gotten a few of these in the past because I like the trimmer - however the motor always seems to die.</li>
            <li> A little embarassing!</li>
            <li> Just don&#x27;t lose the little plastic guard unless you want a knick here or there!</li>
            <li> While the shave end worked just fine, since it is just like any other manual shaver, the trimmer part was terrible.</li>
            <li> I was trying to find a good trimmer for my bikini area because I was sick of the oh so painful razor bumps!&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve owned 3 in the past two years.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not as bulky as the Intuition, but it&#x27;s not as thin (and thus, prone to slipping side-to-side) as my hubby&#x27;s razor.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure</li>
            <li> Decent and durable almost impossible.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure what the problem is</li>
            <li> Totally disappointed because it is too expensive to spend another $10 on a trimmer that MAY or MAY NOT work for more than 4 months (</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m not sure what happens.</li>
            <li> What a waste of money!</li>
            <li> so I definitely needed something to trim my hairs down there to make for a less painful session.</li>
            <li> If you get mad because it&#x27;s not leaving anything baby smoothe then take a little while to reflect on your knowledge of the English language.</li>
            <li> However, the automatic side of the trimmer hurts me so much :(</li>
            <li> That makes for very awkward maneuvers in certain areas.  </li>
            <li> 4 blades so less irritating</li>
            <li> The problem is it doesn&#x27;t get as close a shave as this one, doesn&#x27;t have the trimmer this one has, and this razor gets in the really hard to reach places.</li>
            <li> These blades don&#x27;t get dull so it all balances out.</li>
            <li> The razor is fine, too, but I hate buying expensive replacement blades, so I&#x27;ll stick with my dollar shave club razors for the close shave areas.  </li>
            <li> ALL IN ALL A BIG DISAPPOINTMENT.</li>
            <li> At least I got a battery out of it.</li>
            <li> all the negative Nacy&#x27;s out there, stop hating on the product.</li>
            <li> At least it feels like it.</li>
            <li> Tweeked the battery contact and streched spring on the negative end.</li>
            <li> It lasted a lot longer than you would think a trimmer under $10 would though, at least 2-3 years.</li>
            <li> but the trimmer sucks ass</li>
            <li> Sadly I got pink</li>
            <li> This thing sucks balls.</li>
            <li> Unless this thing broke soon after people got it or was cheaper somewhere else, i am not understanding the negative reviews.</li>
            <li> If the battery is lacking in power the razors will move slowly and tug the hair.</li>
            <li> I have thick hair.</li>
            <li> After the shaving I applied a thick emollient on the area and braced myself for what was to follow.. IRRITATED SKIN..</li>
            <li> DON&#x27;T WASTE YOUR MONEY!!</li>
            <li> I mean, would you rather use a 1\\&quot; trimmer or a 2\\&quot; trimmer?</li>
            <li> It is somewhat annoying that this particular razor&#x27;s trimmer guard keeps falling off.</li>
            <li> Seriously, there is nothing else so convenient out there.  </li>
            <li> The trimmer on the other hand, is by far the worst I&#x27;ve ever used.  </li>
            <li> The trimmer is no good.</li>
            <li> Not good.  </li>
            <li> I was actually quite shocked.  </li>
            <li> razor is a useless, gimmicky toy</li>
            <li> However, after having tried all, and I mean ALL, other methods that resulted in either burns or those awful itchy shave bumps, I decided it was time to investigate my final option: the bikini</li>
            <li> However, the razor part was incompetently designed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Whether this represented poor quality control or damage in shipping or handling was unclear.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> THE SCHICK QUATTRO BIKINI TRIMMER PERFORMED POORLY.</li>
            <li> Tired of close shaves?</li>
            <li> the only reason i gave this 2 stars instead of 1, is that the razor will always work, but the trimmer is crap.  </li>
            <li> And finally, it&#x27;s not a great quality trimmer.  </li>
            <li> and I really like the trimmer, though I think the razor is absolutely awful.</li>
            <li> If you are not happy with the item we suggest you contact the manufacturer with your displeasure.</li>
            <li> I mean, wtf.</li>
            <li> The only thing I hate is how expensive the replacement razors are.</li>
            <li> Useless weak powered trimmer included.</li>
            <li> Got it about 6 months ago after being so disappointed with other \\&quot;skinny\\&quot; womens&#x27; shavers.</li>
            <li> If you use the suction-cup holder, three things will happen: (1) the length setting you set on the trimmer will adjust simply due to the weight of the shaver</li>
            <li> so I don&#x27;t risk cutting myself from trying too hard with the trimmer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, I was wrong.  </li>
            <li> WAS SORRY</li>
            <li> Either I&#x27;m using this product wrong</li>
            <li> but they are so expensive.  </li>
            <li> I was extremely skeptical about this one, but my bikini area was in dire need of a trim, so</li>
            <li> Blades are a bit expensive but not as expensive as Gillette Venus.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, this wasn&#x27;t it.</li>
            <li> It is water proof and has suction shower holder included(which stayscup for several weeks but willl fall and may leave a nasty suprise ti step on in your shower.</li>
            <li> I like the trimmer although I think the plastic cover is close to useless.  </li>
            <li> so, i was thinking to use it on them since the groomers is so expensive</li>
            <li> I bought this because at the time, I was unable to find the shaver I had been using for years.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it a couple of times and both times was not particularly impressed.</li>
            <li> sorry I&#x27;m not gonna accept any return.</li>
            <li> And the replacement heads are really expensive, which seems like a trap to me.  </li>
            <li> Refills are expensive.</li>
            <li> but if you have parts that you always prefer to trim rather than shave, it&#x27;s not best tool.</li>
            <li> now it is virtually useless.</li>
            <li> well i have long haired cats that get really nasty knots in their fur</li>
            <li> but I do not love the price of blade refills! :(</li>
            <li> but it still seemed a bit awkward in usage.</li>
            <li> It feels a bit awkward maneuvering the trimmer but the trimmer</li>
            <li> and I had to replace way too often for my liking because it would stop cutting hair after two or so uses.   </li>
            <li> Horrible, waste of money.</li>
            <li> With the comb on, I never worried about cutting myself nor did I find the trimmer to be too bulky.</li>
            <li> I have always been too chicken to wax</li>
            <li> That was disappointing.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s expensive!</li>
            <li> It pulls at your hair and its unpleasant.</li>
            <li> so bad I swore never to do it again.</li>
            <li> Worked once then repeated the bad preformace.</li>
            <li> I always get really bad razor burn whether here or there.</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ive always reviewed the Quattro For Women razor and while I like it, I wound up defaulting to my Venus Divine because I was sick of buying 2 sets of blades.</li>
            <li> I was really disappointed with the razor.  </li>
            <li> I realize that the automatic razor side isn&#x27;t supposed to offer a close shave, but I was disappointed with it&#x27;s performance.</li>
            <li> and I have not been disappointed since owning it.</li>
            <li> Very disappointing.</li>
            <li> Worthless crap.  </li>
            <li> This is worthless.  </li>
            <li> I hate having to go through batteries</li>
            <li> Very disappointed in this product.</li>
            <li> I was very disappointed with this product!!</li>
            <li> This gizmo is absolutely terrible.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t shave or I get terrible razor bumps, they sometimes even bleed.</li>
            <li> The motor is terrible in this razor.</li>
            <li> The trimmer is awful.  </li>
            <li> The razor was terrible.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s awful.</li>

    <ol>
            <li> This is my second one in about 4 years.  They last forever and I love them.  Couldn&#x27;t live without it so I bought another.  Totally worth the money.</li>
            <li> This razor is very easy to use. I like the size of the handle. It&#x27;s not too big and has just enough grip on it. The moisturizing bar on the razor side made for a very easy shave. I felt uneasy at first using the trimmer side on my sensitive areas but I gave it a shot. I was nervous it might pinch my skin but nothing like that happened. It will take me some getting used to. Overall a very sleek and stylish razor that does double duty. I absolutely love the look or it! (I got this free as a promotion from the company)</li>
            <li> I got it as a bzz mission, and I tried it last night. Honestly, I didnt really like it. It didnt get as clean of a shave as venus.</li>
            <li> For a girl, with extremely sensitive skin. I was more then surprised and excited about how my legs felt, and looked after shaving! I had no blotchy skin, no irritation. And! I didn&#x27;t cut myself! The razor doesn&#x27;t move nicely, it glides right over, no fear in shaving around the knees now! It hydrates the skin while shaving, and leaves them extra soft afterwards. The bikini trimmer is awesome too! Cut just the right amount of with trimmer for a clean look for this upcoming summer! Love the feeling of soft, hair free legs against bed sheets like myself? This is the perfect razor to seriously get the perfect shave!</li>
            <li> Its an amazing trimmer</li>
            <li> It trim very well. It deosnt completely get rid of the hair like a razor would but. It lessens hair. So ilike it. I havent had to replace the battery yet either.</li>
            <li> Love this razor! Don&#x27;t be a skeptic, it is better then venus if you&#x27;re wondering. I love the silky smoothness it left my legs feeling and it&#x27;s super convenient</li>
            <li> I finally do not have to steal my husband&#x27;s razors! This all in one tool only needs one battery and it really trims the bikini area well. The size adjustments are of a good length if you still want a natural look that&#x27;s groomed. It&#x27;s much better than having to use two different razors! Great for vacations too.</li>
            <li> I actually didn&#x27;t use the razor portion of the trimstyle but I LOVED the trimmer. I do my own Brazilians at home so I definitely needed something to trim my hairs down there to make for a less painful session. Normally, I make due with a pair of small scissors but if you&#x27;ve ever tried that, you would know how easily it can go wrong. With this trimmer I was able to trim up the &amp;#34;bush&amp;#34; (lol) in the shower and get right to waxing when I got out of the shower and dried off. Its super nimble and small enough to get into tight quarters. Also, since it comes with a guard, its unlikely that you&#x27;ll have a trim accident :)</li>
            <li> This product is a great 2n1 shaver. It&#x27;s easy to travel with and it last a while. The trimmer doesn&#x27;t gwt extra close but it trims decently. I would recommend other. I received this product for my unbiased review.</li>
            <li> This product is genius. I was rather skeptical using this down there, but I ended up loving it. I will repurchase this. It makes your legs silky smooth after using the razor as well.</li>
            <li> My wife says that the trimmer is very useful. The main razor blade shaves the legs very well and doesn&#x27;t cut her legs.</li>
            <li> Japan cosme recommended products, very good, just a little big sound〜</li>
            <li> I bought one of these from my local Target and it&#x27;s fantastic. I already have multiple razors so I&#x27;m only using the trimmer part at the moment. It is pretty loud but I&#x27;m not using it in public so I don&#x27;t mind.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The trimmer is the best thing ever. I used to shave my bikini area entirely, but the last time I did that I got razor burn so bad I swore never to do it again. The trimmer is painless, perfect, and makes everything down below look very cleaned up. The three lengths are also really helpful, though I like it pretty short so I&#x27;ve just used the &amp;#34;1&amp;#34; setting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this to any woman! The results are lovely.</li>
            <li> As a razor this is great, it didn&#x27;t feel like a razor, it was very smooth. As a bikini trimmer this is lacking in so many levels. The trimmer takes one AAA battery but it kills the battery life very fast, plus it doesn&#x27;t trim the way i want it too. If you want a great bikini trimmer then i would suggest you go elsewhere. If you are looking for a great razor, then pick this up but the regular razor, not with the trimmer. It is also awkward to use on your intimate area, it would be better with a regular razor.</li>
            <li> The razor is adequate in my opinion for a women&#x27;s razor.  But the trimmer stopped working for me at all within maybe three months, maybe less.  The trimmer was rarely used. I replaced the batteries and it won&#x27;t come on at all.  I always used the trimmer dry and cleaned it well.  I don&#x27;t know if the power button is cheaply constructed or what.  I say don&#x27;t spend the extra money on the battery-operated end.  Very disappointing.</li>
            <li> This works well enough for me. the electric razor at the bottom doesn&#x27;t work well for me, but it could be because I&#x27;ve never used one before. The blade on the top however works like a charm, pretty great deal, just make sure you buy a box of Schick blades to replace them as needed. the blades do not rinse well, so you may have to change them often. This is also a waterproof item and comes with a suction cupped stand you can stick to your shower wall, mirror, etc</li>
            <li> The trimmer was a huge disappointment.  Not only does it not do an even job, but it snagged and ripped out hairs.  There is also not much choice on hair length.  I liked the fact that this was waterproof, but considering what a poor job it did, it was not worth the money. And yes, there is nothing special about the razor.  I like my Venus razor better.</li>
            <li> This is a trimmer razor.  For that purpose, it does fine.  Just don&#x27;t expect a baby smooth shave in the bikini area.  For me, it works great--I&#x27;m not seeking a baby smooth shave, I just don&#x27;t want to don a bathing suit looking like Yeti.  I wasn&#x27;t thrilled with the razor portion for shaving legs.  My legs aren&#x27;t yeti-like, but this razor didn&#x27;t shave off those hairs with anything resembling finesse.  That means two razors--this one isn&#x27;t as dual duty as it represents itself to be.  All in all, I&#x27;d probably not rush out to buy it.  I don&#x27;t wear a bathing suit every day or even every week, and a special razor for the occasion just doesn&#x27;t seem like it is important enough to me.  Maybe it would be a great thing for someone with more hair issues than I have.</li>
            <li> I purchased this for my wife and she says it works well, but is not worth the money. The trimmer head is very small and does not cut very close to the skin. There are better and longer lasting options out there. On a positive note, the unit is water proof and the battery lasts for a good while.</li>
            <li> My wife reviewed this product and found the trimmer more gimick than function.  Also the plastic guard on the trimmer had sharp edges that scratched sensative skin.  Whether this represented poor quality control or damage in shipping or handling was unclear.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Schick blades where as usual good but she commented the added weight in the handle did not help control&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My wife say the trimmer is too small and too usless to be of real beefit and fi she wanted such a thing she wouls steal my beard trimmer which works far better</li>
            <li> Bought this shaver for my wife on a lark.  It took no time to use it without any knicks and gave a very smooth and fresh result.  She also found it easy on the legs and the underarms.  The waterproff feature is a real plus.  I also used it as a simple trim.  Fun product to have.  Hope it lasts more than a few months.</li>
            <li> I was actually quite a bit nervous to use the trimmer down there, but I tried it and it works pretty good. Took one star away for it being so loud. Could definately be mistaken for something totally different if heard from outside the bathroom. A little embarassing!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know what everyone else&#x27;s problem is with the trimmer. I took the cap off and trimmed my whole bikini area super close. I took off one star because, like someone else said, the wires holding down the blades kept my legs from being completely smooth. But even for just the timmer, I thought this was a great deal!</li>
            <li> This works well. With the guard on it doesn&#x27;t get as close as I would like so I normally take that off.</li>
            <li> Like many other women, I thought this would be a great, time-saving product.  Unfortunately, I was wrong.  I found this to be an ergonomic nightmare.  The large button for ejecting the razor head is nice when you want to change heads, but if you steady your razor by placing your index finger along the top of the razor while you shave, the head pops off.  The bikini trimmer is wide and bulky and requires some interesting contortions in the shower to use.  It would, however, be quite good for trimming a beard or sideburns.      Don&#x27;t waste your money on this.  The men&#x27;s Quattro is a much better, more robust razor, and for a bikini trimmer, both the Bikini Baby and the Bikini Touch trimmers are infinitely more maneuverable and so much easier to use.</li>
            <li> I gave this item 1 star because the razor is actually great.  The trimmer on the other hand, is by far the worst I&#x27;ve ever used.  You have to hold the button down in order to keep it on as it&#x27;s a pressure switch.  The moment you let go, the trimmer turns off.  That makes for very awkward maneuvers in certain areas.  Also, it has a tendency to pull hairs sometimes.  OUCH!!  Trim Style, thank you for being just under $10 at Walmart, or I&#x27;d be REALLY more angry at this money that&#x27;s being flushed down the toilet.</li>
            <li> I was very disappointed with this product!! The trimmer is too small and only works on non-curvy areas (because women&#x27;s bodies have lots of those, right?). Even the first time I used it the razor was not as sharp as my weeks-old Gillette. Left me stubbly the day before my boyfriend&#x27;s birthday. I&#x27;m irritated in more ways than one, and plan to demand my money back.</li>
            <li> [[ASIN:B001TH8Q72 Schick Quattro For Women Trimstyle Razor &amp; Bikini Trimmer]]  THE SCHICK QUATTRO BIKINI TRIMMER PERFORMED POORLY. THE RAZOR WAS FAIR BUT NOT WORTH THE PRICE I PAID FOR IT. ALL IN ALL A BIG DISAPPOINTMENT. WAS SORRY I BOUGHT THIS PRODUCT. I WOULD NOT RECOMMEND THIS TO MY FRIENDS. WILL NOT EVER BUY IT AGAIN!!!!!!</li>
            <li> I like the razor part of it, no problem there. The trim style end however is not as great as advertised. It doesn&#x27;t trim away even the finest of hairs. Either I&#x27;m using this product wrong or I&#x27;m better off getting a bikini wax. I don&#x27;t have the problem of being overweight or \\&quot;curvy\\&quot; as other women put it, but I feel like I have partly wasted my money. I say partly because I&#x27;m still using the product in search of a better one.</li>
            <li> Finally a product that suits all my shaving needs. The trimmer is easy and fast to use. No more razor burn or cuts in private spots. I can trim down to just above the skin, no more ingrown hairs! Yay! I absolutely love that I can use it in the shower. The razor is great quality too, Schick did not skimp there.   I can&#x27;t remember the last time I was so satisfied with a product; it&#x27;s now as indispensable to me as my dishwasher or bicycle.</li>
            <li> Tired of close shaves? Do you wish your shaving experience was a little more frustrating and painful?  Well, look no further, the Quattro&#x27;s dull blade technology produces consistent results!  From the first shave to the last, you&#x27;re sure to be left with a stingy, burning discomfort that will last throughout the day. Turn heads at the beach with bumps and redness that say \\&quot;Hello world! I just shaved today!\\&quot;  No more throwing money at razors that cost less and work better- buy your Schick Quattro Burn Booster today! Useless weak powered trimmer included.</li>
            <li> I love this razor. The trimmer works so good in the shower and it&#x27;s a close shave for my legs too. The only thing I would do better is put a shave bar around the razor so I wouldn&#x27;t have to use shaving creme at all.</li>
            <li> I usually use a straight razor for trimming my bikini line, but living Southern California means going to the beach and pool year-round, so I wanted something more precise. I was pleasantly surprised at how well this trimmer worked.&lt;br /&gt;PROS: Razor and trimmer, small, works well with longer (1 inch) hairs, Schick is a good brand&lt;br /&gt;CONS: VERY loud, like a vibrator, Wall suction cup is not strong enough, will not trim short hairs&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So basically, you would have to let your bikini line hairs grow out a little bit before you could trim them. Unless you swim everyday, this is generally not a problem. I personally end up in the jacuzzi/pool about once or twice a week, so this trimmer is ideal for me</li>
            <li> I have to say that this razor/ trimmer didn&#x27;t really impress me. It&#x27;s helpful that it is waterproof but I just didn&#x27;t think that either the trimmer worked very well or that the razor gave a comfortable shave and I think those are the only things a razor like this can be judged on. Yes, I like the purple/ pink color but it still seemed a bit awkward in usage.</li>
            <li> I wish it WAS bikini weather! I have been losing some weight recently, exercising a little, and shaping up. The winter is mild here for the first time in a decade so I&#x27;m taking advantage of it! I was surprised how well this little Trimstyle razor worked. It is easy to get into the \\&quot;crevices\\&quot; and is smooth action. I wish it was a little cheaper but one gets what she pays for!</li>
            <li> Wow! this this is really nice, Shaves well and the trimmer really works.  The small trimmer can trim down the Course hair first then Shape the bikini area with the razor.  Besides that it shaves her legs. It is water proof and is not slippery being used.  The only grip is with most razors is that is dulls out quickly, but that is a fault of most razors with 4 or more blades.  The</li>
            <li> I have been using Venus razors for years but they are so expensive.  I decided to try this to see how it compared, as it was a little cheaper.  I was very impressed.  At first look I was a little worried because the razor looked so thick and heavy, but it really wasn&#x27;t a problem.  Just seemed to make it feel sturdier in my hand while I shaved.  Left my legs and underarms very smooth and soft with no irritation.  I also really like the attached trimmer for my bikini area.  Very convenient to have the two products combined into one.  It even comes with a suction cup holder to place on the shower wall.  I will hold on to the Venus, but I think this will be my go to razor for awhile!</li>
            <li> This product works well and is exactly as advertised.  My only complaint is that the design could be somewhat more ergonomic.  It feels a bit awkward maneuvering the trimmer but the trimmer and I take the razor off when using the trimmer because I feel like I could cut myself the way it&#x27;s designed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Otherwise, I&#x27;m happy with the price and product overall.  The 2-in-1 design would make it ideal for travelling. I&#x27;ll but this again when the trimmer eventually gives up.</li>
            <li> the only reason i gave this 2 stars instead of 1, is that the razor will always work, but the trimmer is crap.  in less than 3 months, it&#x27;s rusted and won&#x27;t work.  now i have to go in search of another trimmer and spend another $15.  DON&#x27;T WASTE YOUR MONEY!!</li>
            <li> The only good thing about this is the quattro razor.  The trimmer is no good.</li>
            <li> We have bought two of these items recently. Both of them stopped working within a few weeks. While the overall design, ergonomics, and razors are really good, the engine that powers the trimmer appears to be of extremely low quality.</li>
            <li> Extremely short life span (about 2/3 months) before it completely stops working. Replaced the batteries but still it would not work again. I contacted Schick and they sent me a list of ways to clean the trimmer. Being a licensed Barber for 20+ yrs. now, and having cleaned many a trimmer, I am completely confident that I cleaned the trimmer thoroughly, still it would not work. I contacted Schick again and they offered me a $1.00 COUPON off my next purchase!!! There are many complaints of the same, therefore Schick is aware and yet continue to sell this faulty product. Worse still, Schick customer service couldn&#x27;t have cared less about wasting their loyal customers hard earned $$!</li>
            <li> Call me old-fashioned, but when I buy something that has no reason it should need to be replaced very often at all, I expect it to stick around for several years. Other than the blades, which need replacing periodically, I&#x27;d expect this razor/trimmer to be a relatively \\&quot;permanent,\\&quot; or non-disposable item, like buying a hair dryer or other small appliance.     I&#x27;ve owned 3 in the past two years. They work well for a few months, then go into a moody phase where they&#x27;ll work sort of well, but also occasionally stop mid-trim causing painful hair grabbing/snagging, regardless of battery condition, then eventually die completely. This time I was getting a bit fed up with it and went out thinking I&#x27;d look at men&#x27;s trimmers, since I&#x27;ve started to suspect that the quality is better than in products made for women. Then I looked at the prices. Eight dollars for a new Schick Trimstyle, or Thirty-eight for a lovely Norelco.     I know getting a nicer trimmer is probably cheaper in the long run, but dollar signs in my eyes, and the bank account feeling pinched at the moment, I grabbed another one of these.     The one on the shelf at the store was purple this time instead of teal...crossing my fingers hoping this means they&#x27;ve actually updated the model and made it better, but I kind of doubt it.    Bottom line: most of the time, less than ten dollars seems fair price for 3 months of effective bikini trimming to me. For the more practical buyer considering the \\&quot;long-run\\&quot; price, you might want to shop around for something nicer. You&#x27;d probably have to buy a lot of these to make it the same amount of time a better quality trimmer would last you.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a comfort-first, jeans &amp; t-shirt most days, too busy chasing my 1-yr-old to fuss a lot with a beauty routine kind of girl.  I normally use the Schick Intuition because it&#x27;s so quick to use in the shower and do any bikini trimming by hand.  All the other (affordable) trimmers I&#x27;ve tried have left me dissatisfied at best, angry at worst; they catch/pull hairs or don&#x27;t catch the hair enough to cut it.  I was extremely skeptical about this one, but my bikini area was in dire need of a trim, so I figured I&#x27;d give it a shot.    I used the trimmer BEFORE I got in the shower, and was extremely satisfied with it.  I&#x27;m usually a little clumsy with razors, but the handle is just thick enough to make it easy to keep a grip on, without being so big that it&#x27;s cumbersome in the bikini area.  I used the guard on the lowest setting, and much to my surprise, it didn&#x27;t catch/pull hair--not even once! It&#x27;s strong &amp; sharp enough, though, to take off a couple months of growth without a problem.  I prefer a really close trim rather than shaving because I don&#x27;t like the itchy feeling shaving leaves, so for me, this little gadget will be a mainstay in my bathroom for a long time.  It *is* a little noisy, but not obnoxiously so.  I have a battery-operated toothbrush and it&#x27;s on par with that.    I bought it more for the trimmer than the razor, but decided to give it a try as well.  If I were going on a date with my husband, etc., and wanted a VERY close shave, I would probably still swipe his razor, but for everyday shaving, I think it&#x27;s just fine.  I was still plenty smooth after using it.  I still like my Schick Intuition better because I don&#x27;t like having the extra step of fussing with shaving cream in the shower, but I don&#x27;t have any huge complaints about this one.  I actually liked it better for my underarm area.  It&#x27;s not as bulky as the Intuition, but it&#x27;s not as thin (and thus, prone to slipping side-to-side) as my hubby&#x27;s razor. The handle was great for shaving, too.  It was easy to hold on to, and I didn&#x27;t have the problem others talked about with resting their finger at the top and having the blade come off, but I think that&#x27;s because all of us hold our razors differently.     So, the bottom line is: LOVED the trimmer; no pulling, no irritation. The razor is good for everyday (absolutely no irritation with that either), but if you want a super-super-close shave, look elsewhere. Comfortable to shave with and the handle is just the right size for those like me who are a little clumsy with razors in the shower.  If you&#x27;re looking for a decent razor, a great trimmer, and aren&#x27;t worried about about getting EVERY single little hair, I&#x27;d highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Schick Quattro is one of my favorite razors.  I love the 4 blades &amp; it does a close shave on your legs.  When I say this with a Bikini Trimmer on the other end thought it was awesome.  The whole razor is waterproof.  I used this product in the shower &amp; it did its job.  I will keep this product around &amp; use again &amp; again.</li>
            <li> great razor! will buy another one when mine needs to be replaced. i love it. i use it every day still</li>
            <li> Both the shaver and the trimmer work well. The battery life is good as well. The grip has a rubbery feel to it making it easy to hold even when wet. Both the shaver and trimmer also resisted rusting very well but the handle got mildewy and dark from being in a moist environment for long. Perhaps the non-slip surface of the handle is to blame.</li>
            <li> I bought this at Target and decided to give it a go.  I liked it...until I tried using it again.  It worked for 1 15 minute trimming session in the shower.  I changed the batteries, shook, everything I could think of, but the trimmer would not work.  When I called the manufacturer they offered to send me a new one.  I took the offer and that one died too.  Worthless crap.  Don&#x27;t waste your money on this.  Go and get a quality trimmer.</li>
            <li> Someone in my household finally got around to giving this a go for a few months. It worked great at first, and if youre someplace where you need a trimmer and this all they have (at a beach resort perhaps) this will perform well. Its a little loud but does a quick job cutting things down to managable size.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However three weeks later the trimmer really started to pull and unevenly cut. Part of this could very well be LA metal filled hard water, but it seems like something like this should hold up a bit better. Hopefully they have since added a rust resistant coating. If we have to get another one I&#x27;ll update this review</li>
            <li> I like the idea of this combo a razor and trimmer that is waterproof and usable in the shower!  There are a few issues with it but overall a cheap alternative to other grooming methods.  The razor is just a like a normal razor the trimmer is also ok however when using the razor I keep pushing the trimmer button and would freak out that I might cut myself.  The trimmer has 3 levels of length and I keep accidently changing it so it was not even.  Still it did the job and I didn&#x27;t cut myself.</li>
            <li> It disapponted me as I really want to have a trimmer to work well. However, the automatic side of the trimmer hurts me so much :(</li>
            <li> It does its job but makes my skin irritated sometimes</li>
            <li> This razor was a gift for christmas it ripped bikini line hair out when I used the trimmer in that area and the upkeep was too costly the razor doesnt last long!</li>
            <li> This gizmo is absolutely terrible. The electric bikini trimmer actually cut my skin - not very pleasant at all. I had a Remington before and that&#x27;s what I&#x27;ll buy again. A bleeding bikini area is kinda a deal breaker.</li>
            <li> Initially I loved it. The shaving razor end was highly moisturizing, and the little buzzer let me keep my bikini area in control. What&#x27;s not to love???     Let me tell you:  After a few months of usage (I used this product perhaps once a week at most, I&#x27;m not a frequent shaver as I&#x27;m lazy and I don&#x27;t believe I&#x27;m harsh with it-- I didn&#x27;t drop it all the time or anything)    -- Clogged EASILY. I mean, wtf. All these razorblades built up hair and I had to replace way too often for my liking because it would stop cutting hair after two or so uses.   -- The buzzer end died on me. I replaced the battery, and a week later it stopped working. I opened it up and found out that a ton of hair was getting inside the product and causing a clog, so I fixed that issue. It still died the next day anyway.    Do yourself a favor, buy a rechargeable buzzer and a Venus razor.</li>
            <li> If you leave this razor in the shower it will get rusty.  it is best that you remove this razor from the shower after each use.  Also, the trimmer is not that great.</li>
            <li> The razor does not vibrate, only the trimmer.  The trimmer is quite slow, only good for light/delicate touch ups.  Does the job and good value.</li>
            <li> For a razor blade that I got simply for the bikini trimmer, this is an awesome razor to have. It really does do what&#x27;s needed and there&#x27;s no fuss involved. I haven&#x27;t actually tried investing in buying the razors for the handle, as I only use the trimmer, but if I were to try it out, I&#x27;d imagine it&#x27;d be just as useful. At the very least, if you are interested in keeping yourself trim down under, this is something that I found very helpful.</li>
            <li> Good razor in and out of the shower</li>
            <li> I kept this in the shower shower holder it came with and the trimmer blade rusted within a few months.  I loved the fact that it was waterproof and the razor was nice, but there is no way that I would recommend something like this that rusts as quickly as it did.</li>
            <li> I read some of the other reviews about the longevity of the razor and other concerns. Question: why would you keep the same (disposable) shaver for more than three months anyway?!? To me that&#x27;s just not sanitary. And besides it is easily replacable. It is a $10 trimmer/razor!! You get what you pay for - but this product is by no means short handed. You get quality for the price and at this level it is not designed to be a miracle razor.    Just out of curiosity, I tried the trimmer and it worked as it was supposed to. I am a medium-mantinance person in the sense that I like to look nice, smell nice, and be feminine and beautiful, however sometimes that just means putting on pearls with my jeans and a T-shirt.  Therefore this was just right for me. The trimmer left me sheek enough to be comfortable and besides, the razor could be used to smooth out the trim (If I felt like it) - and when it gets dull or if the battery is not connecting to the mechanical aspect of the shaver-  I am sure I can find another $10 to replace the thing!!</li>
            <li> AVERAGE BUT STILL A GREAT BUY ESPECIALLY WITH THIS PRICE YOU CANT BEAT IT ....A TRIMMER WITH THE PROTECTED GUARD AWESOME SO YOU CAN GET CLOSE BUT NOT TOO LOW.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not a fan of waxing and I used to despise grooming \\&quot;down there\\&quot; with my traditional razor. Sometimes I would find myself perched on the toilet, with an electric trimmer, cord draped over my leg, hoping to achieve straight lines- you get the picture. Purchased the Schick Quattro Titanium Trimmer with a dollar off coupon- making less than $10. I&#x27;m not sure why it has such poor reviews. The trimmer itself is the perfect size- not too wide and offers 4 settings to trim hair. It takes one AA battery and the unit is entirely waterproof making it extremely versatile. The opposite end is a Schick Quattro razor and if used exclusively for that region- I find lasts quite some time. The trimmer did not tug at my hair nor nick or cut me. Overall, I think Schick hit the nail on the head with this one. For $10 I&#x27;m not sure how long it will last- however, I&#x27;ve spent $8 on a Schick Intuition 3 or 4 times a year. I wouldn&#x27;t be disappointed if I had to purchase a 2nd or 3rd in a years time; after all, $30-$40 a year- is far cheaper than a bikini wax. Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I love it so much it works so well the price was excellent the shipping was even better it arrived right on time they were good I love it thanks a lot.</li>
            <li> I have tried many, many razors and this is the best by far.  I&#x27;ve been using it for 3 months now and NEVER nicked or cut myself.  And, amazingly, their is little to no razor burn, even on the bikini area.  The trimmer works great and is convenient to use because it is small and cordless.  Finally, I have found a razor that does the job easily without tearing up my legs.</li>
            <li> I never use the razor. Works as expected.</li>
            <li> First, let me start off by saying that my legs are extremely sensitive. I need to shave daily and most razors cause me pain ESPECIALLY if they have 4+ blades. I tried this Schick Quattro razor and I actually like the actual razor. Considering it has many blades, it didn&#x27;t cause me any irritation. I could shave daily without any rashes or cuts. The trimmer, I wasn&#x27;t a big fan of. I tried it a few times and it caused nicks every single time. If you&#x27;re looking for a good 2 in 1 razor/trimmer combo, I&#x27;d skip this one. The razor works great but the trimmer doesn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> i can&#x27;t find this item in the stores, very nifty!!</li>
            <li> I have very very sensitive bikini line skin.. I can&#x27;t shave or I get terrible razor bumps, they sometimes even bleed. So I turned to electric razors. This is the first one I&#x27;ve tried and I can over all say it&#x27;s not bad.  If you have coarse hair you have to work at it before you get the hair cut down. It doesn&#x27;t cut as close to the skin with just the blades as I&#x27;d like.. but it makes the bikini line presentable.  Make sure you have plenty of battery left to do a clean job. If the battery is lacking in power the razors will move slowly and tug the hair. You can tell by the sound of the razor if it&#x27;s time to change the battery.  It can sometimes be a pain. It&#x27;s not as clean or as close as I&#x27;d like.. I might just have to resort to waxing.. but it gets the job done.</li>
            <li> The first time I used this bikini trimmer I wasn&#x27;t grown out enough to get a good trim and thought about leaving it poor reviews. But it&#x27;s been a year since then and I&#x27;ve used this thing SO many times. I recommend it to my friends all the time for quick clean up and trim down there. If you just want to get rid of some of the extra \\&quot;fluff\\&quot; lol..</li>
            <li> The razorblades are high quality. But the trimmer is very loud, and there are not a whole lot of options as far as choosing the length. I also don&#x27;t like that I have to continually change the betteries. The look of it is not that appealing. At the same time though, it&#x27;s the only razor/trimmer combo that I am aware of which makes it convenient. Blades are a bit expensive but not as expensive as Gillette Venus.</li>
            <li> The razor blade part is ok, it does the job, but doesn&#x27;t last very long.  The trimmer is perfect though!</li>
            <li> This a great razor and trimmer but keep the trimmer out of water because if you do it wears out pretty quick.</li>
            <li> I agree with the great review done titled: \\&quot;Smooth Moves and Dangerous Curves\\&quot;. I&#x27;ll add my couple of complaints. It&#x27;s expensive! Not only that, but the price of a package of cartridges is just as much as buying a whole new razor! With the economy the way it is, it should be priced more affordably. It&#x27;s also loud enough to be annoying and potentially embarrassing, LOL. The razor and trimmer combo concept is fantastic though! And it does shave smoothly and trim nicely. So I very reluctantly pay the money for it and the cartridges. I&#x27;m not cheap, I&#x27;m frugal. ;)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been a loyal Gillette Venus user for years, but when I saw this product, I had to try it.  It&#x27;s a razor and a bikini trimmer in one.  The entire unit is waterproof and comes with a little holder that sticks onto your shower wall by suction cups.  It seems to be a great concept, you can get all your shaving/trimming needs done in the shower with just one little device.  Very convenient!  I really wanted to love this product.  The razor part seems great with the 4-blade razor, and the bikini trimmer actually does work very well and I&#x27;m amazed that it works in the shower too!  So these were the pros...now for the cons...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first time I used the razor part on my legs, my grip kept accidentally pushing the button for the trimmer, so it would vibrate as I was shaving.  Not good.  I didn&#x27;t cut myself then, but I was definitely worried that I would and I didn&#x27;t like it at all.  It seems that I&#x27;m already trained in how I grip my razor to shave my legs in swift flicks of the wrist, and I just couldn&#x27;t do that with this unit without accidentally hitting the button here and there.  The second major problem I had is when I nicked myself a couple of times.  I was actually quite shocked.  I haven&#x27;t nicked myself shaving in years and I didn&#x27;t like it.  It turns out that the Quattro has the nice 4 blades which is better than the Gillette Venus, but then it also has these 2 guard wires that run on top of and perpendicular to the razor blades.  They are meant to be guard wires so you don&#x27;t nick yourself, but somehow, I think they were the reason why I did cut myself.  Sometimes it felt like a hair actually got caught in the corner between the guard wire and razor and would pull instead of cut.  After a couple of nicks, I was done trying to figure out why I was getting nicked and just stopped using it completely.  I&#x27;ve been meaning to try it again and give it another shot, but honestly, I can&#x27;t bring myself to do it.  I have perfect success with the Gillette Venus even with the puny 3 blades and NO nicks/cuts so I&#x27;m going to just stick with that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So to my dismay, I had to give up on loving this product.  Maybe other people have better luck with using it.  It definitely does what it&#x27;s supposed to:  it&#x27;s waterproof, the 4-blade razor gives you a very close shave (when it&#x27;s not nicking you), and the bikini trimmer works very well, and the holder is actually very functional and works well.  I just can&#x27;t use it because I keep hitting that \\&quot;On\\&quot; button making it vibrate while I&#x27;m trying to shave, and it nicks me.puny 3 blades and NO nicks/cuts so I&#x27;m going to just stick with that.

            <li> The first thing I have to say about this is that the suction cup doesn&#x27;t work very well for holding it to the shower wall.  (My other razors have never had an issue.)  Because of that, this trimmer fell on the shower floor one too many times and didn&#x27;t last as long as it should have.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As far as reviewing the actual trimmer, I&#x27;d have to break it into two parts:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First, the razor itself works great.  Pretty much like any other razor you&#x27;ve ever used...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately, the trimmer wasn&#x27;t quite as effective - at least for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Personally, I would probably recommend just sticking with a standard razor and using something else as a trimmer.</li>
            <li> This is a fantastic little trimmer. It is very handy for shaving underarms dry if you don&#x27;t need a close shave. I agree with others that you&#x27;d likely remove the guard whenever you use it (unless it was for trimming a beard or something that you want to stay longish?). I find the battery runs down rather quickly on mine (could that be on account of a leak, or some other defect?)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The blade side has four blades and these can last over several shaves, which is nice, but being concerned about the cost I will probably just stick to my cheaper two blade razors (less than half the price).</li>
            <li> I was fortunate to receive this from Amazon Vine in return for a review.  Since it&#x27;s a woman&#x27;s razor, my wife tried it and liked it.  Because it shaves and trims, the Schick Quattro for Women is very versatile.  She likes the feel of this razor and says it does a fast, smooth shave.  Whether shaving her legs or underarms, or trimming those sensitive areas, it works flawlessly.  She switched from her disposable razors that she&#x27;s used for years.  And now she doesn&#x27;t have to share my Philips Body Groomer anymore.[[ASIN:B000EG8HLE Philips Norelco BG2020 Bodygroom Shaver]]</li>
            <li> Being given the ability to a skip bikini waxing a few times a year is what made me a product evangelist. The trimmer is so simple to use, it does not nick or cut. The AAA battery is super easy to replace. I use it on my legs, bikini area and underarms. I get a nice clean shave every time. LOVE THIS PRODUCT!!</li>
            <li> Waste of money better of using shaving  razor</li>
            <li> Love this razor, and the battery lasts a long time in it too.</li>
            <li> I absolutely loved this razor...while it worked.  The first time it quit within a couple of months.  I tried new batteries, wiggling the connectors - no luck.  So I bought another one thinking that was a fluke.  And it worked great - for a couple of months.  It would be a  wonderful product if it was durable.</li>
            <li> I bought this for the trimmer, and not for the razor. I have used the Schick Quattro razor for women alone, and it doesn&#x27;t shave very well.  They need to do something about that because I am sure that the Trimstyle would sell well if they made a better razor. I prefer men&#x27;s Gillette or the Venus razors compared to Schick women&#x27;s.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That said, the trimmer is really good--dry. I&#x27;ve tried waxing and shaving, and this is a nice, painless alternative. So I will probably re-purchase when it stops working. A small trimmer for $10 is not bad.</li>
            <li> The razor part is very nice. It stayed sharp and so far \\&quot;knocking on wood :)\\&quot; it has yet to nick me. The trimmer is less practical, but it useful and it trims nicely.&lt;br /&gt;The color is ok, not a big fan of the purple color/shade, it&#x27;s not ugly, just not a color that I prefer.</li>
            <li> I liked this product so much that after the first one broke on me (would no longer turn on), I went and bought another. Unfortunately, however, the second one has also broken much to my dismay this morning. I tried replacing the battery to no avail. This is actually the same thing that happened to me with the first one! At first I thought it was just a fluke, but now since two of them have bit the dust, I&#x27;m no longer going to buy them. I will go back to my tried-and-true method of using scissors to trim the area.</li>
            <li> I usually prefer simple razors, but the trimmer is nice. I have manual bikini trimmer that really doesn&#x27;t work well at all. This does the job better. But keep in mind that the trimmer is a trimmer, not a shaver. It doesn&#x27;t work well for close shaves - but it does do a good job of trimming bikini area. Don&#x27;t keep it in the shower.</li>
            <li> I have always loved the regular Schick Quattro Razor and was excited to try this version of it as a free sample. I have very sensitive skin and the bikini area is extra sensitive. I was suprised how simple the razor was to use and that I experienced no rash or bumps. I love that you can trim and do close shaving. Another great razor!</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this razor! I love how the handle is wider than most razors (I have larger hands). I haven&#x27;t used the trimmer much yet but so far am impressed. VERY happy with my purchase!</li>
            <li> I am not much of a shaver. I like to wax my arms, legs and underarms and am quite adept with the procedure. However, I could not bring myself to wax my bikini area. So in order to tame the dragon, I tried disposable razors. The only thing to be done with them is to &#x27;dispose&#x27; of them. I had given up hope and resorted to just scissor trimming.. this until I came across Schick Quattro. I got it for $7 something, so I thought it was worth a try. And though I lack technique, the initial results have been very promising.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The trimmer itself gave me results close to my &#x27;disposable&#x27; razors, although I did use it without the guard coz I have thick hair. The trimming was not uncomfortable at all and did not nick me. I proceeded to shave the area with the razor end which did an impressive job, although a few little ones got left out. After the shaving I applied a thick emollient on the area and braced myself for what was to follow.. IRRITATED SKIN.. but it did not happen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Over all very happy with the product.</li>
            <li> This is going to show up as my hubby writing the review, but in fact I am his wife...a woman.....&#x3D;) LOL    I LOVE the idea of this, but I have to say I was disappointed. I was really hoping for a closer trim. The shaver itself was good/normal.....I had no problems with it. I was just really hoping the trimmer would provide a closer shave than it did. I am sure for others it would be best if all you want is a good trim or groom. It is also pretty loud, which isn&#x27;t all that important, but enough for me to comment on. I am looking for the hair down there to be a bit shorter and I will stick with my Noxema bikini trimmers!</li>
            <li> Horrible, waste of money. Does not work. At least I got a battery out of it. Do not waste your money, the company had some good marketing and cute ads with funky music-wow.</li>
            <li> The new Schick Quattro for Women TrimStyle lets you shave, and trim with just the flip of a handle. First all-in-one shaver and bikini trimmer .It is the only razor with 4 ultra-thin blades for long- lasting smooth skin and a built-in waterproof bikini trimmer in one.   I was thrilled to try this product because I had been looking for something to help trim the \\&quot;forest\\&quot; but I was really disappointed with this product. It was loud, hard to use, and just didn&#x27;t do it for me. I suppose it takes a few tries to get the hang of it and with more use, it becomes easier but I don&#x27;t have the time or the patience for that.   I suppose for the price, it&#x27;s a good deal but I won&#x27;t be using this product again.</li>
            <li> This product is a dream! Gives such a close shave, and the trainer works wonders! Sleek design make this gem so easy to handle, and the colors are beautiful! My new fave razor!</li>
            <li> This is not worth the money. The electronic shaver barely works, and by barely I mean not at all. It didn&#x27;t remove any hair! Thus, to spend the extra money for this instead of buying a plain old razor is not worth it. Very disappointed in this product. Will not buy again.</li>
            <li> I have had this product since they first came out and I have only bought two of them. I dont know how people say that they only last months! the first one I bought lasted a year and then it broke so I replaced it with the pink one and I have had this one for almost 2 years. I dont change the battery often and it works just fine. I mainly use both the trimmer and razor in the shower because I find it less of a hassle to clean but when I go to dry trim I found that wetting the blade makes ut work better. I cannot say how much I live this product enough!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For all the negative Nacy&#x27;s out there, stop hating on the product. Be smarter than the tool. Some of you clearly dont know how to use this product. I will probably buy another one soon just to have a fresh start. looking forward to more years with my trimming razor :)</li>
            <li> Shick&#x27;s new tool is a razor and bikini trimmer called the Quattro For Women Trimstyle and it comes in a feminine pink and teal-ish package. The tool itself is the same teal and white so while it&#x27;s different from the pink of the original Quattro for Women, it&#x27;s still quite feminine. Although wider than the Quattro razor, it&#x27;s not unwieldy. Like the original, there is a little rubber button to rest your finger, right above the razor blade, but I found that this was not where my finger naturally rested.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The razor takes the same 4-blade replacement as the original Quattro for Women (so you can use any blades you may have) although the razor cap slides on from the end instead of over the top (this might be better. It seems more secure).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The trimmer is powered by 1 AAA battery which has a rather clever compartment. This makes the whole thing waterproof and since I am not a fan of dry shaving, this is good. It also means the trimmer can be cleaned up by running water over it. The Quattro For Women Trimstyle comes with a plastic holder which suctions to the shower wall but probably will not fit in the original shower holder.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The trimmer has an adjustable comb for 3 different lengths and can be removed entirely. With the comb on, I never worried about cutting myself nor did I find the trimmer to be too bulky. The comb was a little tricky to maneuver. It was easy to set it at the short or long lengths but the middle one was harder because the comb wanted to skip past that setting. Removing the comb can help for cleaning up any little hairs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The trimmer is powered by a button on the handle. I found that, during shaving, I would occasionally bump this button. I think that would happen no matter where the button is located on the handle as long as it is that shaft and is the style it is. I would prefer a switch you push into an on/off position as opposed to the button.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My experience with Shick&#x27;s new Quattro For Women Trimstyle was pretty good. I don&#x27;t really like the tricky job of shaving my bikini area so I tend to let it go until I know something must be done. I don beekeeper style gear, grab a hatchet and set to work for long hours under the blinding sun. At least it feels like it. With the trimmer, I was able to trim several months&#x27; growth of hair in 5 - 10 minutes so I looked presentable. This made the more precision shaving which was to come a lot easier. While there were a few straggling hairs which I missed, I think it was more my fault than that of the Quattro For Women Trimstyle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Quattro For Women Trimstyle never once caught on my hair or cut me. I could use the trimmer in either direction; although, the cut was closer it I went against the grain. The trimmer is not super quiet. It sounds like an electric razor and if you feel the need to hide what you&#x27;re doing, make sure to have the shower on or to be home alone. However, it was not ridiculously loud.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ive always reviewed the Quattro For Women razor and while I like it, I wound up defaulting to my Venus Divine because I was sick of buying 2 sets of blades. One thing is for sure, the Quattro gives me a much smoother shave in some areas, like my bikini line and the back of my thighs but not in others (like my actually bikini area or legs). While shaving the bikini area after trimming, I did bring out my Venus to get a few hairs the Quattro seemed to miss consistently. I&#x27;m not sure what the rhyme or reason it for why the razor for so well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, I feel this is a strong tool overall. If you don&#x27;t have time to shave, the trimmer works well. If you like to do both, it&#x27;s 2 tools in 1. If you are like me and need to tame the lion, the trimmer is the first tool for the job and then you can go back for more precise styling later. If you run out of razor blades, a close trim will certainly tide you over. Now that I have the Quattro For Women Trimstyle, I don&#x27;t see myself ever needing to go into the jungle again. It will be much easier to consistently take care of the bikini area.of the bikini area.</li>
            <li> 1. This is an excellent razor with a perfectly designed body.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. The trimmer option that comes on the bottom side is excellent for sideburns and shaping.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3. The trimmer has a two fold purpose. As stated above it is good for trimming, but when I shave with this in the &#x27;on&#x27; position, the vibration actually allows me to get a just a little extra closer and do so without irritation. It&#x27;s unintended feature that works well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4. The price point for this body and the razor replacements are less than the competitors, making it a bargain and a good buy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;5. The Quattro Four blades seem to stay sharper longer than the Five bladed cousins, which are more expensive and wear out faster. I think the Four Bladed razor heads are still the best all around.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;6. I&#x27;m a man and I used this product even though it&#x27;s purple. I&#x27;ve purchased a few of these in black and there is absolutely no difference between the men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s versions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;7. The battery, which is provided, last forever. One AAA.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well done. An excellent product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using my husband&#x27;s cordless shaver/trimmers for years, so that&#x27;s what I&#x27;m used to...but I thought I&#x27;d be a lady and give this trimmer a shot. And well, my overall opinion is MEH. It&#x27;s just so TINY compared to what I&#x27;m used to that it seemed to take FOREVER to actually finish the job. I mean, would you rather use a 1\\&quot; trimmer or a 2\\&quot; trimmer? Personally, I don&#x27;t have that many tiny areas to worry about using a teeny tiny trimmer. That said, I didn&#x27;t feel like it actually trimmed that well--it was okay, but nothing I&#x27;d rave about. I&#x27;m also a big creature of habit, so a new product would really have to blow me away to make enough of an impression for me to change products. Unfortunately, this wasn&#x27;t it.</li>
            <li> I LOVE this razor trimmer combination product.  It really works!  Their ads need to be a little better explaining what this product does, but once I figured it out, I bought it immediately.  What used to take forever, now takes minutes.  Fantastic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I agree with everyone else, I just looked at the razor after having left it in the shower, and it&#x27;s rusted.  I&#x27;m hoping I can get the rust off it, but if not, I&#x27;ll buy another one.  BTW, the motor is still great and I can&#x27;t remember how long I&#x27;ve had it - but it&#x27;s quite a long time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recommend this product highly.</li>
            <li> I like to be able to shave and trim with this handy two-in-one tool. It works great in the shower or in the tub. I&#x27;d recommend for anyone looking to save space (and money) when it comes to shaving!</li>
            <li> I bought this for the trimmer and it does a fantastic job. Much better than some other trimmers I&#x27;ve used in the past that were way more expensive. At under $10, it&#x27;s worth the price. I wonder how I managed before I bought this!</li>
            <li> Great product. I&#x27;ve been using this for years on the bikini area, underarms and legs. The trimmer is not great to use on its own without the razor since it doesnt trim very neatly, but its perfect for my purposes since I just use it to shorten the hairs before shaving. I&#x27;ve never gotten nicked or cut by the trimmer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The razor is the standard schick quattro blade, it gives a close shave and for me it lasts through at least 7 bikini shaves and countless leg shaves without dulling, which is great. I replace the blade every few weeks and generally replace the entire thing about once a year just so that the trimmer is as efficient as possible, although I&#x27;m sure I could go longer without doing so.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hope this never gets discontinued!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;TIP: I&#x27;ve bought the women&#x27;s version of this many times but I have recently discovered the mens version to be cheaper on sites like ebay and amazon! It doesnt come in pretty colors (only comes in black) but its the exact same thing and gets the job done!</li>
            <li> I thought it would be easier to use the trimmer part. Also, the razor doesn&#x27;t work as well as the cheap, disposable ones.</li>
            <li> I have used Schick razors for many years and I hope I never have to switch. The Quattro allows you to get a very close shave. The razor is comfortable to hold, although this trimstyle model is bulkier than the regular quattro. It comes with a suction-cup style holder and the suction-cups actually stay stuck.</li>
            <li> Works really well for the price! Would buy again</li>
            <li> It is easy to use. Though I probably should have stuck with a normal rasor, since i hardly use its second feature. oh well.</li>
            <li> P*ss poor excuse for a razor and a trimmer.  I was so excited when I got it, but was immediately let down.  The razor works ok on your legs, but leaves a mess for the underarms.  The trimmer worked great the first time, but that&#x27;s about it.  I&#x27;m going back to Venus.</li>
            <li> I use this mainly for my arm pits and lady bits because I was very prone to razor burn, and the trimmer gets surprisingly close. I don&#x27;t actually use the razor for anything but my legs. I&#x27;ve had many trimmers and electric razors, and this is by far my favorite.</li>
            <li> This is perfect. Love it!</li>
            <li> This product is &amp;#34;okay&amp;#34;, meaning I used it and just though &amp;#34;eh, whatever.&amp;#34; I think they could have done a better job with the razor, as it just doesn&#x27;t seem to be sharp or effective. That bikini trimmer, though. I love that it adjusts so you can choose the length/closeness of the shave. Really like it!</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s a really good product for a women, perfect for the bikini line, it doesn&#x27;t hurt and cut smoothly.&lt;br /&gt;love it!</li>
            <li> I recieved this product to test and review, and over all im pretty impressed. This is just like a typical razor but with a trimmer at the bottom. The razor does wonders, and that i really liked, but the trimmer, i honestly could do without. It pulls at your hair and its unpleasant. I am giving it four stars because it could be very useful on trips and vacation, but I do hope they upgrade the trimmer to something better!</li>
            <li> TRIMMER PORTION STOPPED WORKING 4.21.20y April ximmer with guard end is great for body hair no nicks so far. The regular diposable/replaceable razor other end is remarkably good and does not cut me as others have in the past causing being careful of my choices. It gets pretty close, glides well.  No lubricants have built around  the blade or joint for battery installation in the middle of grip. The grip is fine for small hand. It is water proof and has suction shower holder included(which stayscup for several weeks but willl fall and may leave a nasty suprise ti step on in your shower. push the suctions cups to secure once a week. Would have liked extra disposable blade but for the money its fine. The trimmer has a guard you can remove if you want to get closer mine is medium pink and white with white shower holder. Decent trimmers are hard to find. Decent and durable almost impossible. Will update after 6 months which seems to be the self destruct date of most I have wasted my money on.  April 20, 2016 update...experience so far is... As of the end of March the trimmer started acting odd. When turned on it sounded different. When put to use it would stall. Take away from hair and it returned to normal speed. Changed the 1 AAA battery. Worked once then repeated the bad preformace. I believe it drained battery dry. ?? Changed battery again. Tweeked the battery contact and streched spring on the negative end. Now 2 uses from that it is still behaving well. In spite of this experience, I still would by it again. So far it is still superior to others I have used and trashed due to not working or causing bodily injury. Hope this help you decide.</li>
            <li> Love how they made grooming so much easier and convenient. I love how they made the razor with a stand so now your moisture strips stay off surfaces. They last way longer and don&#x27;t have the mess behind it to clean up! I love the trimmer, except the guard is a MUST. You will get hurt lol. Other than that it is perfect!</li>
            <li> I really like this styler!  My first on burnt out when I tried to put a new battery in, so I decided to order again.  Much cheaper on Amazon when I ordered it.</li>
            <li> I was actually really surprised by how well this worked.  Like some other reviewers, I bought it for the trimmer, and the trimmer does a solid job.  The razor is fine, too, but I hate buying expensive replacement blades, so I&#x27;ll stick with my dollar shave club razors for the close shave areas.  Still, a fine product.</li>
            <li> Glad I purchased this item.  :)</li>
            <li> I had one of these before and it died after a few years. I couldn&#x27;t find it in the store anymore then I saw it here. Great deal for a great razor!</li>
            <li> after a month or so the blades start to get rust on them.  The rust doesn&#x27;t come from the blades themselves but from the other parts and probably the insides as well.  It also doesn&#x27;t trim very well.  Because of the rust i end up having to throw it away.  This happened on multiple buys.</li>
            <li> This was exactly what I was looking for and worked exactly as described. I am very happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li> This razor is amazing when it works. It seems to me that when the battery runs out you are done. I have tried replacing the battery with a new one but it never seems to work at that point. The cost of a new razor is almost the same as a new blade so I don&#x27;t mind as much that I end up buying the new razor. The razor works for a few months before I have any issues with it but as the battery starts to wear down the vibrating action does as well making for a bit of an uncomfortable shave. I just don&#x27;t shave down there during this week and use the time to go buy the next razor because the new battery never works for me.</li>
            <li> This is my 2nd one of these in the last 5 years. I wouldn&#x27;t even consider any other type or brand, this works perfectly for legs, underarms and bikini area. I only purchased another one because I moved and I wanted a new color for my new bathroom, otherwise the 5 year old one was still going strong (with new a new battery every 5 or 6 months). I use the vibration when I shave my legs/underarms and it seems to give me a smoother shave. I shave my legs/underarms 2 to 3 times a week and the blades last me about 6 to 8 weeks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend removing the battery if you take it on vacation. Mine got stuck on in my suitcase when I was checking in on an international flight and I had to step out of line to open my suitcase and fix it. The worst part was they didn&#x27;t seem to believe me that it was a razor making the sound and a security guard stood over smirking while I fixed it. He actually said, &amp;#34;oh it really was a razor&amp;#34; when I took it out. It was a simple mistake but it was still embarrassing.</li>
            <li> The trimmer part of this razor-trimmer combo, I have no qualms with. However, the razor part was incompetently designed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Like many other women, I tend to go into &#x27;hibernation&#x27; mode in the winter when my legs are covered by pants or tights at all times, and I don&#x27;t shave very often. If I needed to shave after a couple weeks&#x27; worth of growth, trying to do it with this razor was a nightmare that could last upwards of half an hour. Some moron decided to cover the rear of the razor with tiny wires that seem to function only to keep shaved hair stuck in the blade, making the blade impossible to rinse, and thus gumming up your shave pretty much immediately. I tried rinsing the blade under all temperatures and pressure of water. I tried swirling it around in a basin full of water. I even tried using tweezers to pull hair out to free up the blade. I had to pass over each area several times, pressing very hard, to get anything even approximating a shave, and needless to say, the Schick razor never gave me a very close one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then I decided to just use a Venus (which has no idiotic, useless wires in the back, and thus rinses completely clean very quickly), and my life got much easier. Of course, if you are the type to shave every day or two, you probably won&#x27;t experience this issue. But if you ever get behind on your shaving, Schick is definitely NOT the razor for you.</li>
            <li> The motor is terrible in this razor. My first one lasted exactly one use. I tried two more and they didn&#x27;t last longer than a month, which was still not many uses. That was enough trialing for me. I won&#x27;t buy this again and would not recommend it.</li>
            <li> The color is not peach but who cares. It&#x27;s pink and I love it. It&#x27;s so much cheaper here than a drugstore or HEB. It works great. Favorite razor. This is my 4th one Not counting replacement heads. The trimmer is perfect and the other end is great. 4 blades so less irritating and it has some give to it so it gets around curves well. I have trouble around my bony knees with other razors but this one contours just right. The shipping was speedy despite weather conditions and the packaging was not damaged or dented or folded in like many past Amazon purchases. Would recommend.</li>
            <li> I love how it&#x27;s a 2-in-one making it a very convenient purchase! It&#x27;s also waterproof--I have used it in the shower!</li>
            <li> Works great- there was a review I read when looking at buying this product that complained about it being to loud, I do not agree, it is not silent but its quieter than my husbands electric face razor- Easy instructions and easy to use</li>
            <li> Talk about a close shave.  I love it.  I don&#x27;t think the trimmer works that well, but maybe I am just not using it right.  The blade part is awesome.  I don&#x27;t cut myself or get as many bumps.</li>
            <li> The razor and trimmer functions are very easy to use and work great. I&#x27;ve gotten great results and recommend this product to others. Very handy!</li>
            <li> I have been using this razor for several months, maybe a year.  I have used the trimmer enough to go through a few batteries and the razor enough to go through several heads.  I like the trimmer although I think the plastic cover is close to useless.  I use it on the lowest setting to trim most everything down there and then take the cover off to do the sides, etc.  I have found that the trimmer doesn&#x27;t like being used without cleaning it often with professional blade cleaners.  Fortunately I have large animal clippers (for my large animals) and so I know all about cleaning the blades with blade cleaner and lubes/oils.  I am able to keep the trimmer happy by cleaning it every other time, but it is a pain to have to do this so often.  The razor is ok, but I really only use it because it&#x27;s there.  The Venus does a better job IMO, and there are several other men&#x27;s razors that give a much more comfortable shave.  Overall I think it is worth the money since it doesn&#x27;t cost that much more than a regular razor and the trimmer does a decent job.  However, if I find a nicer trimmer I will probably switch.</li>
            <li> does not give a close shave at all. trimmer works well.</li>
            <li> The trimmer is a little loud but works nicely. The razors are amazing. You can definitely tell the difference between shaves with this and disposable razors. Would definitely recommend.</li>
            <li> i bought this razor because I liked the idea of having two different tools in one.  It comes with a holder that sticks to the shower.  It&#x27;s a good enough razor for me, the trimmer is decent.  This is the second one I bought, and the first one lasted a long time, unlike some of the other reviewers.  I&#x27;m a mother of three so it works for me, convenience is key!</li>
            <li> Perfect set: shaver on one side, trimmer on the other. Comes with a suction cup shower holder which is perfect to keep it close by. Trimmer has 3 settings, glides easy without nicking as the slider acts as a guard. While being careful of course! I will keep getting this one!</li>
            <li> Pretty great. I love it.</li>
            <li> Electric shaver end is cheap and docent cut hair ok, I think this is SCHICK cheap trick to force people to buy Razor end refills, will not buy again from them.</li>
            <li> First and foremost I received this product for free from Bzzagent.com. So far so good. The razor is A LOT smaller than I imagined. I was impressed how comfortable it is to hold in my very small hands and the comfort of the product. The razor is a VERY close shave and leaves your legs feeling like silk and the trimmer is AMAZING. It uses 1 single AAA battery and is waterproof which ladies lets face it, WIN! I have also used the trimmer (after cleaning of course) on my husbands neck and around his ears and face and honestly they are WAY better than all of the trimmers he has ever owned. The ONLY flaw I have found is that the trimmer/razor doesn&#x27;t come with a holder for it like most razors do, but honestly if that&#x27;s the only flaw I find, no harm no foul :). Happy shaving ladies!</li>
            <li> Very awesome trimmer! Works really well. Gets a lot closer than I thought it would which is a plus in my opinion, only leaves slight stubble with closest setting, no razor burn, pinching, or knicks so far though &#x3D;) it does seem to go dead rather quickly but lasts much longer than the Cleancut PS335 T-Shape Shaver</li>
            <li> I really LOVE the bikini trimmer part of the razor, but I&#x27;m not so crazy about the actual razor, doesn&#x27;t provide a close enough shave for me. Going to stick to my Venus Embrace for regular shaving tasks.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s worth it. It&#x27;s a little noisy and I live with people so I have to find a time when no one is home.&lt;br /&gt;The razor is just like other Schick razors. The trimmer is a trimmer. If you get mad because it&#x27;s not leaving anything baby smoothe then take a little while to reflect on your knowledge of the English language. Trimmer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love it, it makes everything about grooming easier. I would definitely recommend it to everyone.</li>
            <li> I bought this because I really like multipurpose devices, and this seemed great!  It only uses one battery, it&#x27;s waterproof, and it attaches to most Schick blades.  When you turn on the trimmer, it buzzes very powerfully and trims well.  I like the guard/length adustor on this item as well.  However, after a year or so (and a few batteries), the trimmer part stopped working.  I checked inside and it was quite rusty, so it isn&#x27;t entirely waterproof (at least not over a long period of time).  Even after drying out the compartment and putting in a new battery, my trimmer buzzed very weakly and then conked out altogether.  So, I would recommend getting a separate razor &amp; trimmer if you want your trimmer to last.</li>
            <li> When I heard of this product, I thought the razor head would be like the others.....just stays still and you have to move your wrist and make sure you don&#x27;t cut yourself. But to my surprise, that part would move along with my curves, so I didn&#x27;t have to worry about much. I only wish that it wasn&#x27;t as noisy and that the back of the razors would be less blocked so the hair could be cleaned out better. The trimmer is nice, and the moisturizing strips make it work just fine for me.</li>
            <li> This is an awesome little razor and trimmer combined. I keep it in my shower and accidentally keep dropping it in water. It still survives! The blades feel nice and don&#x27;t cause burn or bleeding. The trimmer is fantastic and worked wonders while I&#x27;m 8 months pregnant and have to maneuver around a big belly to shave anywhere. The trimmer has a great guard on it so you won&#x27;t cut yourself. Its been a lifesaver.</li>
            <li> I would definitely  recommend this product especially for the duel action. I was so happy I didn&#x27;t have to buy a razor and a bikini trimmer.</li>
            <li> I purchased this at Walmart for about the same price as listing on Amazon... and the trimmer turns on and the blades appear to be moving the way they should, but I spent several minutes trying to trim down some neglected hairs and absolutely NOTHING happened.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used it once so far and it works really well. Hopefully it will last a while. I&#x27;ve seen some reviews stating that it dies after a few uses...so we&#x27;ll see.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well, after a few uses it did die. Disappointing because it worked really well. I would have updated sooner, but I kept forgetting.</li>
            <li> As the title says, this product worked only once.  I cleaned it and even kept the battery out of it while stored away, yet the very next time I tried to use it it simply would not turn on even with new batteries.  It is too much of a hassle to send back and too cheap for me to even care anymore.  It&#x27;s a shame because this product worked really well...when it was actually working.</li>
            <li> I received my shaver on time and it works great! Thanks</li>
            <li> This is my new favorite razor. I used to just use the Venus Spa Breeze razor with the soap bar. That&#x27;s a really good razor where you don&#x27;t have to use shaving cream. The problem is it doesn&#x27;t get as close a shave as this one, doesn&#x27;t have the trimmer this one has, and this razor gets in the really hard to reach places. This also lasts a long time! I used this razor for bikini and legs 2 or 3 times and it stayed really sharp! These blades don&#x27;t get dull so it all balances out. You have to buy shave gel but the razors don&#x27;t need to be changed as often.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will admit I do get more ingrown hairs with this razor though. I&#x27;m not sure what the problem is but that&#x27;s the only downside.</li>
            <li> This item barley lasted a year before it stopped working. And that&#x27;s only using it every 3-4 weeks.</li>
            <li> not worth the money at all</li>
            <li> One star down because after two years of ownership it stopped working. A new battery did no good. I bought another one though because for the price two years might be a reasonable amount of operating time and it&#x27;s so easy to use and handy for those of us who like to keep it neat but don&#x27;t feel the need to be bare.</li>
            <li> I have no problems with this razor. Got it about 6 months ago after being so disappointed with other \\&quot;skinny\\&quot; womens&#x27; shavers. Shaves better than many of the other disposables I have tried. The bikini trimmer is a great extra; I use it frequently. Yes, it is wider than most, but I find I like the wider handle. It is easier for me to handle and keep the razor where I want it.    I did not buy it here, just came to get replacement blades. I was surprised at the number of lower ratings - but did some of them are very old, so maybe the razor has changed since then.</li>
            <li> Im a guy and bought this cause it looked easy to use and I was right. Great in the shower, no razor burn, trimmed and cleaned nicely. I recommend it.</li>
            <li> I love this razor set. Got it from amazon and use nothing but. Just sharp enough...but not too sharp. Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> Love this.  I&#x27;ve had it for like over 6 months and it still works beautifully!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had zero issues with this razor after several years.  I&#x27;ve only had to change the battery twice. Perfect little device, I use the trimmer part about 1X per week or so and the razor to shave every-other-day and replace the blade about every 3 weeks, maybe more often in the summer when I shave my legs more.  I did buy a new one after a couple of years just to buy a new one and no real reason... just felt like after a couple years A new one would be nice... I&#x27;ve now had this 2nd one for about 3 years and am very satisfied.</li>
            <li> Excellent. I believe every women should have one. It is very practical. The shape of it makes it very easy to manage the razor and trimming turns to be smooth.</li>
            <li> I have been using this for years for the trimmer part, and finally had to replace it with this order. It lasted a lot longer than you would think a trimmer under $10 would though, at least 2-3 years. I remove the cap completely, and swear by the results. I have very sensitive skin and am prone to razor burn, which can be really embarrassing in the bikini bottom area. It can be a little loud, but doesn&#x27;t bother me or my roommates. The trimmer will outlast the suction cups on the included shower hanger, and I personally didn&#x27;t bother to keep using the regular razor part  -but it is well worth your money. As a side note, I&#x27;ve noticed some reviewers talk about the color, but it says in the description that color may vary so don&#x27;t get too hung up on that.</li>
            <li> This is a combo razor and trimmer so it has a razor on one end and trimmer on the other.  Most ppl usually leave their razor in the shower, but the trimmer part will rust if you do so, so this is not very practical.  Also, the screw that holds the trimmer portion on got loose after about 2 or 3 uses, and stopped working.  And finally, it&#x27;s not a great quality trimmer.  I&#x27;d recommend keeping your razor separate from your trimmer and getting a different one.</li>
            <li> Love this easy to travel with does the job!</li>
            <li> I love this product so much and unfortunately I can&#x27;t no longer find it locally. I just can&#x27;t get used to the painful waxing process so this bikini trimmer does a great job instead. I hope the manufacturer doesn&#x27;t discontinue it.</li>
            <li> This thing is a gem! I always get really bad razor burn whether here or there. Haha. This makes it easy to trim hair down to almost non noticeable levels and if i don&#x27;t want to shave the rest them awesome! Just don&#x27;t lose the little plastic guard unless you want a knick here or there! My fault totally. Only wish this thing was rechargeable and had replacement trimmer heads.</li>
            <li> Quickly kills AAA batteries but it is a pretty decent trimmer.</li>
            <li> Works well, very handy.</li>
            <li> this product has a defect. the first time i purchased it, it lasted for about 6 months. After refusing to turn on afterwards, i bought another. It stopped working after the first use. I sent it back to the company and got another one for free. this one stopped after 2 uses.</li>
            <li> i bought thisin hopes of \\&quot;trimming\\&quot; easier but the cap on mine i did not realize it comes off to get super close. So it just sat in my shower. well i have long haired cats that get really nasty knots in their fur so, i was thinking to use it on them since the groomers is so expensive but i dident want them completely shaved. this is the perfect gadget its quiet enough so it does not scare the living daylights out of my cats and it has just enough vibration for them to love it. they come running now when i turn it on. im hoping to purchase another to try out the super close shave to see if it helps. cats have claimed my first one.</li>
            <li> This trimmer is amazing! I love the soft grip handle, which makes it easy to hold and manuevor. The tilting razor head with four blades gives the smoothest shave I have ever had compared to a disposable razor. The trimmer cuts extremely close and is gentle on the skin. Not once did I nick myself while working on my bikini area. I will definitely buy the replacement razors for continued future use. Thinking about purchasing another one as a backup. Love that it came with a AAA battery and a shower holder as well. Really worth every penny.</li>
            <li> Does an awesome job trimming your hair down before shaving so the head doesnt get clogged up with long hair.</li>
            <li> This is a great trimmer. The razor will do in a pinch, but I prefer to use a separate one. The only downside is that I&#x27;ve found myself replacing the battery rather quickly, despite not using the trimmer too often.</li>
            <li> Does what it needs to, but I wish it had more power...</li>
            <li> The razor is really good but the trimmer sucks ass</li>
            <li> LOVE THIS!  Can&#x27;t find one anywhere but on Amazon!  It&#x27;s the BEST!</li>
            <li> The smallest trimmer setting gets me down to what looks like about 3 days of growth after shaving. All in all I&#x27;m very satisfied, I&#x27;ve only pinced myself with it once and there was no blood. I find it works better dry because the water seems to clog the blades... but to each their own.</li>
            <li> I bought this at my local drug store on sale but really like&lt;br /&gt;it so wanted to review it. Like some others said i was a little leery at first putting the trimmer&lt;br /&gt;downstairs but no problem and it works very good.  I don&#x27;t like to shave&lt;br /&gt;everything off and this leaves a very short crop without making you look&lt;br /&gt;like a bald 6 year old girl down there.  I read many of the&lt;br /&gt;reviews that said the trimmer stopped working after a couple months.&lt;br /&gt;If I had to guess I&#x27;d say that maybe water is getting inside and killing the connections so&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m going to just use mine dry and see if it doesn&#x27;t quit on  me.  If it still does no big deal&lt;br /&gt;it wasn&#x27;t a lot of money and the razor works very nicely.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;December 19, 2012 Update!&lt;br /&gt;Well here we are over a year later and this thing still works awesome!&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve not used it in the shower and I&#x27;m pretty well convinced this has&lt;br /&gt;made the difference between mine continuing to work while others are&lt;br /&gt;dead in a few months.  Awesome purchase imo.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve recommended this to all my friends.</li>
            <li> This is both a great razor and bikini trimmer! Love the ease of just flipping over to do both jobs. I have purchased other bikini trimmers that are bigger and clunkier and that you have to store separately and I have to say that this one is much cheaper and does just as good of a job with the added bonus of having a great razor on the other end! Easy to store as well since it comes with a holder that has suction cups, allowing you to keep it within reach in the shower.</li>
            <li> The trimmer is awful.  You&#x27;d be SO much better off getting an actual electric razor one like a Panasonic or Remington.  This one isn&#x27;t worth the time.  Also, the razor on the other end is nothing special.  It&#x27;s just a regular razor.  It&#x27;s good in theory, but poor in execution.  It just isn&#x27;t built to last.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really good it didn&#x27;t take long for it to come in and it came with its own batteries . And for a shorter cut ;) you can take off the pink think</li>
            <li> buenas noches la compra todo fue muy rapido y sin ningun problama y en excelentes condiciones y llego a tiempo gracias</li>
            <li> where have you been all my life!?</li>
            <li> I love this product! Makes this daunting task much easier!</li>
            <li> One of the better women&#x27;s razors I have used, gives a nice close, soft, clean shave. I love the bikini trimmer, it works very well. And I love the attachment to stick it to the shower wall... but I do not love the price of blade refills! :( A four pack is more than what I paid for the razor. Luckily they seem to last a good amount of time without getting dull but that may also be due to the fact I don&#x27;t shave everyday.</li>
            <li> I am extremely disapponited. First, the trimmer does not cut hair from the first time. I have to go over the skin many many times until i cut all the hair in that area at the same length.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for the razer, i used it for bikini area. My hair was cut short and i applied hair conditioner before shaving. When i shaved, i did NOT go against the skin instead i went with hair or from side to side. The result was it didn&#x27;t cut the hair very close at least not all of it and it cut my skin and bled a little. I was gentle on my skin, but the product didn&#x27;t do what others promised. I am not going to buy again.</li>
            <li> I bought this because at the time, I was unable to find the shaver I had been using for years. The reviews seemed favorable and the price was right, so I went ahead and bought this. My initial reaction was that it worked, but after a few uses, the body, where it twists apart to insert the batteries, began to loosen, until it was a balancing act to shave while holding the razor together so it would work. I finally threw it away when I opened it to replace the batteries and saw that due to the shoddy design, water had gotten inside the battery compartment and corroded the batteries and mechanism.</li>
            <li> The razor was terrible. The trimmer is ok. I think you can buy this in Walmart for less and then you can return it easier if you do not like it.</li>
            <li> Great tool for trimming the bikini area. Batteries last as expected. Does the job. I&#x27;ve owned two of these. The first one started to die out (not enough power to keep the trimmer blades moving fast enough, even with brand new batteries) after about a year of use. For the inexpensive price, I didn&#x27;t mind. The second one I&#x27;ve had for a year and it still functions fine.</li>
            <li> This was a gift my daughter in law liked it.</li>
            <li> I got this because it was cheaper than other reusable razors out there, and I thought the trim tool would be nice. However, I now only use it for the trimmer and the little suction cup holder it comes with. The blades just don&#x27;t get close enough, and irritated my legs. I would not recommend this for the razor part.  The trimmer on the other hand is great! So if you just want the trimmer, it would be worth the buy. Just don&#x27;t count on liking the blades!</li>
            <li> What a great alternative to waxing or razor shaving!  The bikini trimmer lets me stay &#x27;almost bare&#x27; and not have razor burns. I have always been too chicken to wax and this makes me feel amazing without the pain!  I just wish the blades would stay sharper longer. This is the 2nd one I&#x27;ve owned in a year, but worth it because my husband likes it too.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve gotten these a few these and I really like the trimmer, though I think the razor is absolutely awful. Couldn&#x27;t get a close shave at all.&lt;br /&gt;However, these things really lack durability. Each one I&#x27;ve owned has lasted a maximum of six months before it just stops working. I have no idea why. I changed the batteries but it will not turn on. They&#x27;re not too pricey so this hasn&#x27;t been a giant put off for me, but it&#x27;s definitely not great.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the razor I love and I&#x27;m glad I found it on Amazon cus it was sold out everywhere local.  Sadly I got pink but it works great so I can&#x27;t really complain.</li>
            <li> This is an amazing razor/ trimmer, especially for the cost.  Works awesome in the shower, you can get a super close shave, no nicks or cuts!</li>
            <li> Nice trimmer and does well in the shower.  No complaints.</li>
            <li> I got it in good time and it is everything it said it was</li>
            <li> I searched everywhere for a trimmer that wouldn&#x27;t cut me without the guard on, and this one finally accomplishes said task!  Great smooth shave with the razor, and the trimmer works great, too.</li>
            <li> I thought the trimmer would be a bit better. It gets the job done but you have to work a bit at it. Great razor.</li>
            <li> The razor is okay, but the trimmer is not good. It worked okay once, then it seemed like it didn&#x27;t have enough power. I changed the batteries, but it still didn&#x27;t seem to be working properly. I love the idea, but at this price, you aren&#x27;t going to get a quality trimmer.</li>
            <li> I suppose I shouldn&#x27;t be surprised that the battery-operated trimmer attached to this disposable razor is mostly a gimmick. I mean, given the price-point and the disposable-ness of the product, it&#x27;s not like it would make sense to have a solid trimmer attached. That said, this poor thing barely worked at all, and completed choked on hair coarser than arm hair. Basically, all this does is create a larger chunk of garbage to toss when the razor dulls. Can&#x27;t recommend.</li>
            <li> This thing is junk! First of all- as a leg shaver, it doesnt shave closely at all. My legs do not feel smooth like they do when I use a mens Gilette Fusion. The rubber fins or whatever you call them that surround this thing are way too big which prevents a close shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. The \\&quot;bikini trimmer\\&quot; doesn&#x27;t work at all. You must need to get into some pretty interesting twisted contortions to use it because the way it sits, it&#x27;s impossible to actually get rid of any hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This razor is a useless, gimmicky toy and I won&#x27;t be buying one again. I&#x27;ll stick w/ my mens Gilette Fusion.</li>
            <li> Very clever idea.  Works great dry, but does not cut the same if used when wet.  So you have to take care of business before getting yourself wet.  The battery lasted a long time for me.  The razor dulled quickly, and did not work as well as my mens version that I already had.  I have not purchased razors marketed to women in a long time.  Experience shows they charge more for &#x27;pink&#x27; razors vs. a plain black or blue one that does the exact same thing.&lt;br /&gt;I will continue to use it until it breaks, but would not buy one.</li>
            <li> The razor is very good, but seems to run into some trouble if you don&#x27;t trim beforehand. Otherwise good, no pinching, and the batteries have lasted very well. Definitely water-safe.</li>
            <li> Razor &amp; Trimmer work excellent! This is my favorite razor ever!</li>
            <li> battery is tempermental, broke after about 4 months.</li>
            <li> I still have this razor and use it almost everyday. The only problem is that the refill heads are becoming harder to find</li>
            <li> This is a great little bikini trimmer for about 10 bucks. The trimmer has caddy that actually sticks (and stays!) on the shower stall with a suction cup. I love the convenience of having it in the shower and trimming whenever I notice the need. The razor is fine but for me this item is all about the trimmer, which has a guard so that you can protect &amp; avoid sensitive areas.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A great deal when there is a coupon available too.</li>
            <li> It works as advertised. I would purchase again.</li>
            <li> I was not a fan of this, having to hold down the button as you need to use the trimmer was not easy at all. I tried it for about a minute and then gave up. Felt like I was going to buzz some skin off.</li>
            <li> Came a day early. Works wonders.</li>
            <li> This waterproof razor and trimmer is pretty decent as a trimmer. I was not as happy with the razor part and have switched back to the Hydro so the dual function is lost on me.</li>
            <li> The Shick Quattro for Women Trimstyle Razor and Bikini Trimmer is a neat idea. It is a regular razor on one end, used for shaving legs and arms, and a trimmer for the more delicate/bikini area. Inside the packaging you receive the razor with the trimmer, a AA battery, and a case to store your razor/trimmer in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As far as the 4-blade razor goes, it is very standard. I am used to using the higher end razors with the nice soap bar attached to the razor so I don&#x27;t have to use shave cream. What I really enjoyed was the waterproof trimmer on the other end of the razor. The trimmer is awesome! It has 3 adjustable levels for trimming and is very easy to hold and maneuver. It is great for \\&quot;trimming\\&quot; unwanted hair- however it does not \\&quot;shave\\&quot;. When trimming, the razor did not pull or snag at all! It worked flawlessly. The added vibration made for nice, clean trims.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am very happy with this product but prefer that it just be a trimmer. I guess the idea is after you trim, you can shave off where necessary. Neat product.</li>
            <li> I love this razor. it gave me a really close silky smooth shave. I got it free through bzzagent but all opinions are 100% my own. The handle was just the right size so I could get a nice grip on it when shaving. This razor kept me moisturized and I didn&#x27;t get any cuts or razor bumps after using it. I highly recommend buying this razor in store since it runs at about $12. One more good thing about this razor is that its waterproof, I love that I can use it in the shower or out of the shower!</li>
            <li> I recieved The Schick Hydro Silk trimstyle razor from BzzAgent to try out for free and I love it!!!!!! I got a smooth, close shave and I didn&#x27;t get any bumps on my sensitive legs like I do with some razors. Highly recommend this razor.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this bikini trimmer. There&#x27;s three adjustable lengths, but I remove the comb to get a close and quick trim. It&#x27;s been a year since I bought this and the one AAA battery that it uses last a really long time (I&#x27;ve only changed the batteries three times)! The razor on the other hand, lasted me for four months. I didn&#x27;t buy replacements. I bought the Schick Intuition instead because one four-blades razor last me for one year.</li>
            <li> Love this! I use to dress when it came time to trim my bikini area because I could never get that perfect trim. Now it&#x27;s easier than ever plus I get to do it in or out of the shower! Love the razor too. My legs have never felt more smooth and moisturized after shaving.</li>
            <li> I was trying to find a good trimmer for my bikini area because I was sick of the oh so painful razor bumps!&lt;br /&gt;This does the trick! The trimmer provides a close trim without any irritation. Since I like to have absolutely no hair (lol), I use the razor to remove everything, and it&#x27;s great! It&#x27;s a nice, smooth, razor bump free shave! And that&#x27;s saying something since every form of hair removal (including tweezing) irritates me. For ten dollars, I couldn&#x27;t be more pleased. :-)</li>
            <li> This is a nice combo product, with razor and trimmer all in one unit.  It works very well, and for a reasonable price.</li>
            <li> AWESOME product!!! I purchased 3 and I will say WE ALL ARE HAPPY! Every woman should have one!</li>
            <li> I LOVE this product, so much so, that even after it&#x27;s broken FOUR TIMES, i keep buying more!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love the straight razor, use it every day under the arms. The battery operated end.. that&#x27;s the part that drives me nuts! It works WONDERS for all the wonderful areas of your body you might want to trim, never cuts delicate skin, always an even cut (don&#x27;t let the batteries go low, or you&#x27;ll end up PULLING and not cutting! OUCH!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first one I bought lasted about 2 months, then died. I returned it, and ended up buying another! That one lasted about 3 months, then died. i again bought another. This one lasted about 3 months as well, then died. While I understand this is not a long-lasted product, it should be a disposable one either! I love what it does, so I&#x27;ll probably keep buying.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just be ware, they don&#x27;t last long. Expect to be buying another in a couple months. Maybe Amazon should set up an auto-ship option? :) hehehe&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;P.S. If you use the suction-cup holder, three things will happen: (1) the length setting you set on the trimmer will adjust simply due to the weight of the shaver (so double-check before you start trimming), (2) it will rust the trimmer, and (3) the suction cups will loose suction, and the trimmer will end up on the floor of the shower (perhaps the reason it doesn&#x27;t last long)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Really hopes this helps!</li>
            <li> This works really well for me. I have no complaints. Only gave 4 stars because I saw it at Kroger cheaper.</li>
            <li> this product was good the first time. then it broke after the second time. just stopped working. it&#x27;s awful. Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> This thing sucks balls. It stops working after a few months and then I can&#x27;t trim my vagina anymore. I think water eventually gets into it, because changing the battery didn&#x27;t work.  I&#x27;ve bought 2 of these and the same thing happened (neither from amazon)</li>
            <li> The razor is excellent. It&#x27;s slim design fits well in my hand and is easy to use. The blade cuts close without being nicking the skin. I LOVE the holder for the shower. The suction cups hold fast and I&#x27;ve had no issues with it at all. It&#x27;s nice to have a place to stash the razor without worry. The trimmer I find really pretty useless. I&#x27;ve used it a couple of times and both times was not particularly impressed.</li>
            <li> I used this razor for years and was very happy with it until it finally gave out so I bought another one here. Very fast shipping and a great price.</li>
            <li> Love this . Had one for 5 years just bought another .</li>
            <li> I was really disappointed with the razor.  However, it reminded me why I stopped using the silk effects razor (also put out by Schick) years ago--I just am NOT able to get a close shave with it because it has wires holding down the razors.&lt;br /&gt;The trimmer part isn&#x27;t all that great either.  Definitely can&#x27;t use it in the shower like they make it sound like you can.  You just can&#x27;t get a good trim that way!!</li>
            <li> I just got this thing today. However,the product doesn&#x27;t work that well and it is not what I expected so I asked for a return. I&#x27;ve never had any problem returning things on amazon. And it is not like I return things very often either. They replied back &amp;#34;Sorry for the problem on the order. However, it is against Amazon policy to return a Health and Beauty item . If you are not happy with the item we suggest you contact the manufacturer with your displeasure. &amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;So basically they are saying, sorry I&#x27;m not gonna accept any return.</li>
            <li> I Bought one of schick Quattro about 5 years ago and it still working very good. I have no bumps when I use it which that&#x27;s why I love this product!!!</li>
            <li> First off I received this razor for free in return for my unbiased review. My opinions on this product are all mine.&lt;br /&gt;I was really hesitant to try this razor. I have very sensitive skin and I cringe when trying new things. I got invited to try it for free so I figured I&#x27;d give it a go. The closeness of the shave is amazing. My legs feel nice and smooth afterwards! The bikini trimmer was also really nice. It was easy to hold and use. It trims nicely and evenly too. I am very impressed with this 2 in 1 razor. I get a close shave with no irritation on my legs and bonus no razor burn on bikini area bc the trimmer works great. Much easier to get everything looking pretty and neat down there. :) Try this razor! It&#x27;s easy to hold and gives an amazing shave with its 5 blades.</li>
            <li> Love it! Was excited to get and was excited to use. I can become quite hairy so this really works for me because you have the trimmer on one side to shave down the long and thick hairs, then you switch it around and let the razor do the rest if you want to be bald. The cap for the trimmer is cute and I love the holder for gadget. Great product. My mother wants one now also and will proudly be ordering one for her. Unless this thing broke soon after people got it or was cheaper somewhere else, i am not understanding the negative reviews.</li>
            <li> I was fairly impressed with this product but I have extremely sensitive skin. The lowest trimmer setting doesn&#x27;t get the hair as close as I&#x27;d like it before shaving so I take off the attachment. It is completely waterproof so no worries!</li>
            <li> Does the job, but it died after a few months.  That was disappointing.</li>
            <li> This has held up for a while now. The only thing I hate is how expensive the replacement razors are. I dont want to spend that much money on just replacement razors, so I just use the bikini trimmer now and use a disposable razor.</li>
            <li> This is amazing. I am so happy I purchased this. It is totally worth the money. Seriously, there is nothing else so convenient out there.  I have not gone back to a different razor. it is great quality and does not break (at least not for me). I just use them and eventually like everything they get old so I get a new one. However, I have really only gotten two new ones over the years because they got old. The other ones I got were because i move a lot and I lose things like that easily, lol.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, you don&#x27;t have to get the &#x27;woman&#x27; version, because the &#x27;men&#x27; version is exactly the same in functionality. The only difference is the color and the &#x27;women&#x27; refill razors have just a little more lubricant on the edge, but other than that the razors are interchangeable. I actually prefer the black color. So happy this product came onto the market.</li>
            <li> This is a great product. It does everything that the description said it would and was a great gift for myself.</li>
            <li> This product is excellent. Its just like having a barber shop in the comfort of your own home. this product is highly recommend to anyone who is prone to razor bumps &amp; anyone who doesn&#x27;t want to shave completely , but would like to keep the area trimmed.</li>
            <li> I realize that the automatic razor side isn&#x27;t supposed to offer a close shave, but I was disappointed with it&#x27;s performance. I guess I can at least use the normal razor side for a while and just chuck the whole thing when I&#x27;m done.</li>
            <li> This is a great trimmer for the bikini area. I have never once cut or nicked myself and it is very easy to use. I liked the first one so much that when it recently lost it&#x27;s ability to trim my hairs in the bikini area I bought another one. I am giving it 4 stars instead of 5 for two reasons. One, I bought it for the bikini trimmer and wish that was all it was. Two, after awhile the blades on the bikini trimmer side tend to dull or quit working, which may be normal, and you have to buy another one because you can&#x27;t replace the trimmer part. I have had no other problems with this trimmer. I will add that I use it dry and to only trim my bikini area. I cannot speak for the razor part of this product because I did not buy it for that and have never used the razor. I just know it is absolutely great for trimming the hairs in the bikini area. I would definitely say it is worth it for only around 10 bucks (I didn&#x27;t buy it from Amazon.com) and I would highly recommend it to others.</li>
            <li> The Schick Quattro Razor is really smooth against the skin, does not leave razor bumps and adds moisture that other razors do not offer.</li>
            <li> This trimmer does a good job in trimming unruly and unsightly bikini and \\&quot;hooha\\&quot; hair. There&#x27;s 2 (or 3?) razor settings to cater to the amount of hair you want to trim down. I find last (bottom) setting is the only one that works sufficiently. Even then, the hair that it trims is not really noticeable unless you run over it a few passes. All too often, I take off the plastic protective razor cover and just use the razor flush against my skin. Keep looking if you are a woman who wants zero hair down there. On the other hand, the razor offers a fairly close and comfortable shave.</li>
            <li> Razor is average, but too bulky compared to others. Also, the trimmer wasn&#x27;t user friendly, didn&#x27;t seem to work well at all. Better products out there for the same or less money.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a handy little trimmer, works in the shower (even with the water running over it), and it&#x27;s an amazing price for what you get.  The attached razor is ok, but not great.  This item is really all about the trimmer for me.  Some reviews said it rusted; I haven&#x27;t seen anything so far (had it about 3 months) and frankly, at this price I&#x27;m surprised anyone is worried about a replacement cost, anyway. I would buy it again for sure!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update:  Had it for almost two years now, still works great!  No rust or any issues whatsoever.</li>
            <li> Being that I am of the younger 20&#x27;s generation, it is just a personal hygiene preference to keep things tame down there. However, after having tried all, and I mean ALL, other methods that resulted in either burns or those awful itchy shave bumps, I decided it was time to investigate my final option: the bikini trimmer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This razor came to my rescue! The bikini trimmer, which does have adjustable settings for control that go from \\&quot;barely trimmed\\&quot; to \\&quot;almost gone\\&quot;, works well. Being that my personal preference is the latter, taking the guard off of the trimmer does just the trick and I don&#x27;t get any of those gross itchy shave bumps as it just closely trims instead of shaves.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have already bought one for a friend who is more of the hippie persuasion (if you know what I mean) and she claimed the guard settings were great in giving options that actually suited almost everyone, including those of the more natural sentiment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now about the razor, the razor blades themselves are a tad pricey but if you make sure to not leave your razor in a wet place they last longer. I really do get a close shave that lasts me up to 2 weeks (I&#x27;m not a terribly hairy person) which affords me a taste of the ever amazing college hygienic laziness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Seriously, this is the best investment I have made in a razor!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**UPDATE**&lt;br /&gt;Like many others who bought this razor, my trimmer has died. I changed the battery and cleaned the blades but it will not turn back on. I kept it out of water and cleaned it after every use and it will not work anymore. Totally disappointed because it is too expensive to spend another $10 on a trimmer that MAY or MAY NOT work for more than 4 months (which is how long I had mine..). -3 stars.</li>
            <li> Okay-- I have never tried any other electric trimmers outside of this one.  So I may be bias but this thing is pretty amazing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will say that I am a huge fan of waxing but at $65 for a brazillian (and the hassle of keeping the area ingrown hair free), I looked for other options.  I found this for $10.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It doesn&#x27;t get rid of all the hair, which is fine since its not a huge bother.  The thing is amazingly safe, even when getting into the nooks and crannies, and the hair doesn&#x27;t get cut short enough to feel like stubble and cause irritation (which was always horrible 2 weeks or so after a wax).  I haven&#x27;t tried it in the shower yet, but it works amazing when you are dry.  Its also fast as hell and takes about 5 minutes for the lady scaping.  I imagine that this would be fantastic for a guy too since the guard is good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d recommend this for anyone who is wanting to keep down the bush and feel clean-- Truely hassle free!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;--The razor is pretty sweet too, no complaints there.  Just on your junk, remember to use some good shave cream.</li>
            <li> I have used this razor for about 3 years now and it worked perfectly. Until today when it died for no apparent reason. It works great for trimming, I knocked off one star because it stopped working unexpectedly when I really needed it.</li>
            <li> Previously I had purchased Gilette razors but I decided to get this when I noticed it was on sale (Amazon \\&quot;clip this coupon\\&quot;).  The trimmer is phenomenal---small, which is actually a benefit considering the bikini area.  No nicks or cuts, just a satisfied customer!  The razor works just as well.  I liked it so much I purchased one for my sister and my best friend.</li>
            <li> I want to give this product 4 stars because I do &amp;#34;like it&amp;#34; and it&#x27;s better than &amp;#34;it&#x27;s okay.&amp;#34; 4 stars seems like a little too much, though. I think 3 1/2 would be about right. The razor itself is only 3 blades and does not shave as well as my Venus. While it&#x27;s more comfortable to hold while shaving due to the thickness, it&#x27;s also bulkier and more stiff than I like in a razor. It does shave well, but I do not like shaving with it as much as my Venus 5 blade, which shaves better, faster, and with less effort. Therefore, I really only use this for the trimmer. The first one of these I bought worked better than the second one I bought. I was much more impressed with it the first time, but the second one doesn&#x27;t catch my hairs as well. The first one died after about 6 months of use (replacing the battery didn&#x27;t help - it just stopped working.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The trimmer is good because it has 3 settings, depending on how short of a trim you want. This works best at the lowest setting since it has an easier time catching hairs at the lowest setting. It works well on flat areas, but it can be challenging to use on curved areas. I will finish the job with a comb and scissors so I don&#x27;t risk cutting myself from trying too hard with the trimmer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yes, I recommend it because it&#x27;s cheap, mostly effective, and comfortable enough to use. It won&#x27;t do an easy great job, but it does a good job with a little effort.</li>
            <li> Broke after two weeks and one use. Won&#x27;t turn on and started rusting. Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> While I did not purchase this on Amazon I own it. I got it as a free sample and I have not been disappointed since owning it. The blades last long and I am just replacing them</li>
            <li> LOVE it! It allows for a more accurate shave.</li>
            <li> This is the only razor I buy.  I buy a new one every year, because eventually the trimmer stops working.  Even with replacing the battery, hairs get stuck inside the little compartment where the screw is.  I&#x27;m not going to get a tiny screwdriver and clean it out, that&#x27;s just stupid.  You know it&#x27;s time to change it out when the trimmer either won&#x27;t go on with a new battery, or it gets really slow.  Also, I once noticed that there was a bit of rust near the screw as well, not healthy.  SO, pay attention, and buy a new razor every once in a blue moon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love that it&#x27;s waterproof.  It&#x27;s probably the loudest trimmer on the planet, though.  And the replacement heads are really expensive, which seems like a trap to me.  Spend money on this excellent product, now that we have you, continue to spend insane amounts of money on it.</li>
            <li> Purchased this item twice, once in June 2013 and then again in Nov 2013. On both occasions, it lasted only for 4-6 weeks and then suddenly stopped working. Replaced the battery but could not make it work.</li>
            <li> Schick Quattro For Women Trimstyle Razor &amp; Bikini Trimmer Pink/White  -- Wife tends to like this item more than any other razor.  Easier to hold and to use.</li>
            <li> I bought this razor in pink about a year ago and was satisfied with it until the trimmer completely stopped working about 6 months later.  I tried changing the battery, but that didn&#x27;t work.  I thought it might be a fluke with that one razor, so I bought another (this time in teal).  Again, it worked well for about 6 months and then quit working, and changing the battery did nothing.  I read a couple other reviews where others have had the exact same experience.  I won&#x27;t be buying another.  (I bought both razors from Wal-Mart, not Amazon).</li>
            <li> Girlfriend approves, finds it convenient. Man duties fulfilled.</li>
            <li> This is worthless.  Ran one time and that was it!</li>
            <li> Really great product. I love that it is waterproof and can be used in the shower.</li>
            <li> its good for the $. it does the trick. the razor part isnt as good as I expected. I would buy it again</li>
            <li> I love this razor. It cuts time in half so I wont spend a long time shaving. Best razor I&#x27;ve ever had!</li>
            <li> I used to use the male schick quattro titanium trimmer, and honestly I can&#x27;t really tell the difference between the two.  While the plastic piece for the trimmer doesn&#x27;t really do much (it works better with it off), I like the novelty of the regular razor on the other end.  Works well in showers and the battery lasts quite a while unless you&#x27;re using the shaver daily.</li>
            <li> This works really well and makes shaving a breeze. Very easy and I think that it was a great purchase.</li>
            <li> luv it.&lt;br /&gt;Best bikini trimmer I&#x27;ve found.</li>
            <li> Havn&#x27;t had any problems, works well and gives you a low trim.  Does not shave you bare to skin, just a trim.  Quick and easy I use for bikini area only.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this brand for several years.I like the trimmer attachment. It is somewhat annoying that this particular razor&#x27;s trimmer guard keeps falling off. However, this has never happened with any other of the quattro razors I&#x27;ve owned.</li>
            <li> This razor/trimmer combo provides smooth, close results. I&#x27;m not crazy about the vibrating option, just personal preference I guess, but the blades are sharp, long lasting, and the razor is well balanced in the hand, easy to grip when wet. Refills are expensive.</li>
            <li> The battery went dead after one use, so I switched batteries and it still didn&#x27;t work.  It worked for one time...I want my money back.</li>
            <li> One end is a regular schick quattro for women refillable razor. It&#x27;s okay. I prefer other kinds of razors (gillette women&#x27;s stuff usually). The trimmer on the other end is also okay. Cheaper than most other razors of this type which is nice. However, it&#x27;s hard to really trim with it. It works fine for a quick clean up but if you have parts that you always prefer to trim rather than shave, it&#x27;s not best tool.</li>
            <li> Works like I expect it.</li>
            <li> trimmer only worked for about 2 months and then broke. now it is virtually useless. i kept it completely out of water also.</li>
            <li> Gave this to my wife for Christmas. It does the job, but it isn&#x27;t her favorite. She likes the idea of it, but in execution, it falls short.</li>
            <li> The trimmer is the right width to shape that area. Comfortable close cut. Not found in stores, online only.</li>
            <li> I received this for free as part of a promotion from the brand, and I love it! The razor side gives such a close shave, I don&#x27;t feel any stubble after using this. The only reason I gave it four stars instead of five is because it is so loud.</li>
            <li> The bikini trimmer works great but the razor is just awful. Definitely won&#x27;t be purchasing the overpriced refills for the razor.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s okay for a razor.  The trimmer only lasted about 6 months before it died so I wouldn&#x27;t buy this again just because that part didn&#x27;t last.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure what to expect the first time I tried this, now its a must have in my shower and bathroom.  It can trim in those places a normal razor can&#x27;t go and does a great job.  It is only a battery powered trimmer, so it will not last forever.  I think I am on my 2nd one in a year or so, so they last a pretty good time.</li>
            <li> I have gotten a few of these in the past because I like the trimmer - however the motor always seems to die. I don&#x27;t submurse the razor in the water, and I don&#x27;t abuse it, and I keep fresh batteries in it - so I&#x27;m not sure what happens. I was able to get this with a coupon, so the cost was equal to what it would be to purcase another razor without the trimmer function. With the cost of blades it is almost more economical to just buy a new unit anyway.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, it works fine - except for my mysterious motor failures.</li>
            <li> I have been using one of these trimmers for about three years now. I love the thing and for the price there is little I can complain about. I hate having to go through batteries but I find that a rechargeable AAA battery works just as well as the throwaway kind, though it does die sooner. When traveling I like to remove the battery to avoid the trimmer turning on in my luggage. Occasionally the trimmer will stop running and a new battering won&#x27;t make it work again. The problem is relatively easy to solve however. The trimmer has two small screws that can be removed allowing you to thoroughly clean the blades. After cleaning and drying be sure to oil the blades (I use a simple 3-in-1 oil you can get at any hardware store). Schick really ought to include instructions on its packaging about this as it extends the life of the trimmer and would help them avoid negative reviews. This razor/trimmer set my be affordable, but it does not need to be treated like a disposable. Do note that Schick now has a much more attractive version of the same trimmer available for Men: [[ASIN:B001MIZMRK Schick Quattro Titanium Trimmer]] It&#x27;s a good option if you don&#x27;t like filling your bathroom with \\&quot;girly\\&quot; pink and sometimes the price is more affordable than the version for women.</li>
            <li> While the shave end worked just fine, since it is just like any other manual shaver, the trimmer part was terrible. What a waste of money! I had high hopes for this, but.. just a gimmick, if you ask me. (I&#x27;m sure it was a board room full of execs who said, \\&quot;Hey, what new fangled thing can we design that will get women to buy our product? Oh, I know!! Let&#x27;s see if they&#x27;ll hand over money for a TRIMMER. I bet they won&#x27;t care that it doesn&#x27;t even work - especially if we make it PINK.\\&quot;)</li>
            <li> I like this product. Works great for keeping &#x27;order&#x27; so to speak.</li>
            <li> I´m a man actually so let´s start off with that.This being clarified,I use this practical machine to trim down my body hair,trim my beard(or mow it down before a shave),and cut my hair.So practical is the key word here.It does a great job of getting rid of excess hair when used at 0 setting (with the cap taken off),and gives a neat finish for hair or beard when used at 1 or 2,depending on your necessity.Being quite small,it does take a long,long while to finish,for example,a whole head of hair if using the 1 or 2 setting,but having the option of doing this myself,I´m personally never going back to a hair salon.</li>
