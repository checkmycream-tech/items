            <li>Amazing!</li>
            <li>Nice Toothbrush!</li>
            <li>The toothbrush was nice and looked great.</li>
            <li>thought was suppose to be a spinbrush and wasnt good product though</li>
            <li>Bought as a gift and she loved it</li>
            <li>Well, when it arrived (on time like most Amazon shipments), it appeared well made and the sound quality was excellent.  </li>
            <li>She was appropriately horrified to be seen with it!  </li>
            <li>Very happy by my purchase...very well and secured packaged and exactly as was described.</li>
            <li>Its not the most pleasant thing in the world.</li>
            <li>It is very cheaply made.  </li>
            <li>ok.</li>
            <li>For the price, it does what it&#x27;s supposed to :)</li>
            <li>We all got a good laugh out of it.  </li>
            <li>I was amazed to find out it worked perfectly, and the song only plays for 2 minutes, so you know when to stop brushing.</li>
            <li>I love it</li>
            <li>It really spoiled what would have been a great gift.</li>
            <li>We love this product and how it works.</li>
            <li>Love the toothbrush.</li>
            <li>I thought this would make sure she brushes her teeth.</li>
            <li>Out of all the gifts my 4 year old niece received this is the one she loved the most definitely a good buy.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended, and great quality for the price.</li>
            <li>so I thought it would be nice to still hear his voice while she has her mouth full of toothpaste...</li>
            <li>it really wasn&#x27;t as good as I had hoped it would be, but still glad that I got it.</li>
            <li>Great gift for any young girl!</li>
            <li>My Justin Beiber Singing Toothbrush was perfect for what I wanted it for - a gag gift for a teenage girl who is too cool for Justin.  </li>
            <li>The sound quality is ok conisdering</li>
            <li>I like that the replacement heads and batteries are easy to find on here</li>
            <li>Shipped very quickly.</li>
            <li>As for the music playing, it works fine.</li>
            <li>My daughter&#x27;s friends are HUGE Bieber fans</li>
            <li>Otherwise the technology is quite surprising - you can clearly hear his voice and what he is singing.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Perfect for Beliebers (are there still any out there after his latest escapades?),as a white elephant gift for a brother-in-law who can&#x27;t stand his singing, or to re-enact the printer scene from Office Space, this toothbrush also keeps your pearly whites in tip top shape!</li>
            <li>OK so I&#x27;m writing this review for my SISTER because her computer died and first off my SISTER</li>
            <li>OK my SISTER did not say that exactly</li>
            <li>I would have returned it, but she was so excited to use it</li>
            <li>When she opened it, she was so excited.  </li>
            <li>On a positive note they love brushing their teeth with it and it is no longer a battle to get them to brush for the full 2 minutes.</li>
            <li>She wanted to go right then to brush her teeth!</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s TRUE....</li>
            <li>Justin Bieber&#x27;s sweet sweet soprano did nothing to suppress my gag reflex as I had to finger these barf inducers out of my throat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>My kids LOVED the tooth brushes..... except only one of them played music.</li>
            <li>Plays two full length songs.</li>
            <li>I think the shipper should always check the batteries to make sure they are in full charge mainly in this time of year.</li>
            <li>My other daughter has a Lady Ga Ga brush and it works great.</li>
            <li>I love this, mainly because I got it for someone else.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I bought two luckily</li>
            <li>This toothbrush was a fun &amp;#34;gag&amp;#34; gift for my extremely cool nephew.  </li>
            <li>I know now that I will need them for sure), and are not expensive and that this was the same price pretty much as any good toothbrush.</li>
            <li>the head of the brush is made very well, like a higher end toothbrush, which is even better.</li>
            <li>While not really expensive, the price was definitely worth the quality!</li>
            <li>and she uses it to make me laugh</li>
            <li>once we bought a new one it works fine</li>
            <li>you get what you pay for really holds true.  </li>
            <li>So far it is working just fine.</li>
            <li>The toothbrush was in good shape and came in good packaging, but the batteries were almost dead and with my buying this for a grandchild in another state and with money being tight between the two families</li>
            <li>Brushing her teeth is now a fun thing to do not so much a chore anymore.</li>
            <li>So glad to find it on Amazon after looking everywhere locally.  </li>
            <li>another thing is that the bristles wear out kind of fast and it has nothing at all to do with how long someone like my SISTER spends brushing her teeth in the shower, over and over again as the mirror fogs with steam as that enviable soprano echoes off the tiles...</li>
            <li>At first glance, this product seems like a brush of genius.  </li>
            <li>I told her she had to brush her teeth the whole time he&#x27;s singing!</li>
            <li>She really loves it!  </li>
            <li>, she brushes her teeth about 7/8 times a day now,i have to tell her its too much!</li>
            <li>The first time she went to use it, it broke.  </li>
            <li>Was exactly as described.</li>
            <li>I got myself one of these as well (not Justin bieber though lol), and really like it a lot, I like the brush head better than my old more expensive tooth brush head!</li>
            <li>The wife and I bought this as a white elephant gift and it was a huge success.</li>
            <li>Long as You Love Me\\&quot; or \\&quot;Somebody to Love\\&quot;...</li>
            <li>Despite it&#x27;s flaws I would buy it again simply because it saves me an argument and a huge headache twice a day.</li>
            <li>I like to see sellers who place reasonable prices on their items.  </li>
            <li>This toothbrush is reasonably priced at $10.99 since you can get it for $9.99 at any Rite-Aid drug store.  </li>
            <li>It was much cheaper than a tooth tunes which is really what she wanted</li>
            <li>fast delievery ended up being color i wanted</li>
            <li>she has never fussed about brushing her teeth, always has for some reason even done it without even being asked, so that&#x27;s not been a problem, but now she just loves the toothbrush she wants to brush too much.</li>
            <li>highly recommended!</li>
            <li>A real bummer.</li>
            <li>This toothbrush is fun, different, serves a purpose and brought a smile to my neice&#x27;s face when she received it.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve seen these for as high as $29.00 on ebay...</li>
            <li>All we got was a high priced toothbrush.  </li>
            <li>Next time I&#x27;ll save the effort and go to Amazon first!</li>
            <li>and I think the singing has made her brush her teeth longer than she normally would.</li>
            <li>I bought it for my teenage daughter for fun</li>
            <li>so I had to buy new batteries</li>
            <li>and now my daughter can&#x27;t use it until I get new batteries for it.</li>
            <li>I am debating on whether or not to just buy a new brush all together or tell her I can&#x27;t find one</li>
            <li>When my 8 year old niece opened this for Christmas, she squealed with delight and launched herself into my arms!</li>
            <li>Plays songs well, quite LOUD!</li>
            <li>first and last time I used this thing, the bristles started falling out and having a party in my soft palate.  </li>
            <li>it does play 2 full songs, (the 2 listed), and is easy to turn on and off, just push one button for one song, and push it again to turn it off, push the other button for the other song, and again to turn off, or just switch the song by pushing the other button, very easy, even for a little kid.</li>
            <li>it is a tooth brush, but it is so loud</li>
            <li>I purchased this toothbrush for a 9 year old girl.  </li>
            <li>Our young grandson asked for this Justin Bieber toothbrush for Christmas.  </li>
            <li>I was surprised but decided to purchase one.  </li>
            <li>I got this item for my 8 year old who loves Justin Bieber.</li>
            <li>I bought this for my 6-year old daughter for Christmas.</li>
            <li>My grandson (5) has had Toothtunes and they weren&#x27;t as loud.  </li>
            <li>I purchased this product for my 7 year old Granddaughter who loves JB.  </li>
            <li>I bought this as Christmas gifts for my 2 oldest children 7 &amp; 4 and while they love the fact that Bieber sings to them while they brush their teeth, I found the brush head to be a little on the large side for their small mouths.</li>
            <li>I mean my SISTER more recent songs like \\&quot;As</li>
            <li>each 2 minutes long- decent volume.</li>
            <li>You can barely understand what Justin Bieber is singing...</li>
            <li>, this product is marketed to children, yet it is loud enough for any senior citizen within two rooms to hear it.  </li>
            <li>I bought this toothbrush for my ten year old sister, #1 JB fan.</li>

            <li> I bought this as Christmas gifts for my 2 oldest children 7 &amp; 4 and while they love the fact that Bieber sings to them while they brush their teeth, I found the brush head to be a little on the large side for their small mouths.</li>
            <li> I mean my SISTER more recent songs like \\&quot;As</li>
            <li> each 2 minutes long- decent volume.</li>
            <li> You can barely understand what Justin Bieber is singing...</li>
            <li> , this product is marketed to children, yet it is loud enough for any senior citizen within two rooms to hear it.  </li>
            <li> I bought this toothbrush for my ten year old sister, #1 JB fan.</li>
            <li> Oh yea, it&#x27;s kind of annoying to the older siblings.</li>
            <li> the music will only last for probably long enough to use one time.</li>
            <li> I mean not TRUE TRUE because I&#x27;ve actually done that</li>
            <li> tells me that the toothbrush works fine and that the only problem, according to my SISTER, is that it only plays two songs, which is sooooo ridiculous as my SISTER would say because Justin Bieber has tons and tons of hit singles, at least that&#x27;s what my SISTER says, so</li>
            <li> Second and third one came with dead batties(wouldn&#x27;t play at all/song cut out after a second or two).</li>
            <li> She sings his songs all day long</li>
            <li> I recommend this to anybody that has a kid that doesn&#x27;t want to brush their teeth, cus now they will, also to any Justin fan, and there are other brush buddies that are of different singers,so if not Justin you can get someone else.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t work for very long before it broke or wouldn&#x27;t play music anymore.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not 100% sick of the Biebster yet, so it&#x27;s pretty fun to have a little musical company when my daughter is brushing her teeth.  </li>
            <li> The head fits too loose and will fall out when you brush.  </li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t tried to take it apart to replace it yet, but 2 months is a little short in my opinion.</li>
            <li> When I flushed it down the toilet, I could still hear Justin making his way to the sewers until the song was over.</li>
            <li> and so the other head fits tight enough.</li>
            <li> How many Justin Bieber posters can you have without driving your mom crazy with tape marks and holes in the walls!  </li>
            <li> It is extremely helpful at getting her to brush her teeth for the correct amount of time.</li>
            <li> its way over due</li>
            <li> Well made item can get wet without a problem!</li>
            <li> but it is pretty useless.  </li>
            <li> I ordered two of these in the hopes of getting my gd a purple one but alas, she got red and yellow.</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that after 2 months the battery is fizziling already.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product for a friend of mine&#x27;s little girl.</li>
            <li> A little dissapointed.</li>
            <li> Sometimes we put this one on the counter like a little radio and let it play while he brushes with another toothbrush.</li>
            <li> Tip falls off with little effort though.</li>
            <li> 1st one was missing the brush itself.</li>
            <li> so I don&#x27;t have to waste the money.</li>
            <li> Waste of money for such a poor quality product.</li>
            <li> The sound quality is so bad!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t see (I mean my SISTER doesn&#x27;t see) why they can&#x27;t give me</li>
            <li> I mean I have NOT done that</li>
            <li> Our 5 year old was really disappointed.</li>
            <li> It was neat when the child received it as a gift, but not great quality.</li>
            <li> I got this for my son and they sent the wrong toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> so it was hard to do. :(</li>
            <li> The parents thanked me(even though they aren&#x27;t as crazy about Justin as their daughter is).</li>
            <li> that is ridiculous!!!</li>
            <li> My daughter loves it but the music sounds like crap.</li>
            <li> It comes in two pieces and when she tried to connect the brush into the base that is when it broke.  </li>

            <li> How many Justin Bieber posters can you have without driving your mom crazy with tape marks and holes in the walls!  This toothbrush is fun, different, serves a purpose and brought a smile to my neice&#x27;s face when she received it.  Great item!</li>
            <li> My daughter loves this, too!  But now she gets some exercise while brushing her teeth because she likes to dance to the music!</li>
            <li> ok. it really wasn&#x27;t as good as I had hoped it would be, but still glad that I got it.</li>
            <li> What can I say?  It&#x27;s a toothbrush...I&#x27;m not 100% sick of the Biebster yet, so it&#x27;s pretty fun to have a little musical company when my daughter is brushing her teeth.  She gets the biggest kick of out it.  For the price, it does what it&#x27;s supposed to :)</li>
            <li> My Justin Beiber Singing Toothbrush was perfect for what I wanted it for - a gag gift for a teenage girl who is too cool for Justin.  She was appropriately horrified to be seen with it!  Otherwise the technology is quite surprising - you can clearly hear his voice and what he is singing.  Whether you LIKE his music will be another matter!</li>
            <li> I was like baby, baby, baby ohhh... like baby, baby, ohhhh!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now I just need the Justin Bieber singing thermometer, because I&#x27;ve got Bieber Fever!!</li>
            <li> Returned 3 of these to get one that worked. 1st one was missing the brush itself. Second and third one came with dead batties(wouldn&#x27;t play at all/song cut out after a second or two). Waste of money for such a poor quality product.</li>
            <li> I got this for my son and they sent the wrong toothbrush.  Played different songs than the one I ordered.</li>
            <li> My niece loves this! It is extremely helpful at getting her to brush her teeth for the correct amount of time. Brushing her teeth is now a fun thing to do not so much a chore anymore.</li>
            <li> I ordered two of these in the hopes of getting my gd a purple one but alas, she got red and yellow. Still, like I told her when it&#x27;s in your mouth think \\&quot;purple!\\&quot;</li>
            <li> This is a great gift for any tween or anyone who loves Justin Bieber. Plays 2 songs- each 2 minutes long- decent volume. Comes with set of batteries. Received promptly in mail. Thank you to the sender.</li>
            <li> I love this, mainly because I got it for someone else.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Perfect for Beliebers (are there still any out there after his latest escapades?),as a white elephant gift for a brother-in-law who can&#x27;t stand his singing, or to re-enact the printer scene from Office Space, this toothbrush also keeps your pearly whites in tip top shape!</li>
            <li> I ad 2 of them both where red  they did not work send a E-mail already did not get a  no where.</li>
            <li> I never recieved thos item..its way over due</li>
            <li> This toothbrush was a fun &amp;#34;gag&amp;#34; gift for my extremely cool nephew.  We all got a good laugh out of it.  So glad to find it on Amazon after looking everywhere locally.  Next time I&#x27;ll save the effort and go to Amazon first!</li>
            <li> You can barely understand what Justin Bieber is singing... The sound quality is so bad! I would not recommend buying this toothbrush.</li>
            <li> The wife and I bought this as a white elephant gift and it was a huge success. I cannot speak to its dental prowess.</li>
            <li> OK so I&#x27;m writing this review for my SISTER because her computer died and first off my SISTER tells me that the toothbrush works fine and that the only problem, according to my SISTER, is that it only plays two songs, which is sooooo ridiculous as my SISTER would say because Justin Bieber has tons and tons of hit singles, at least that&#x27;s what my SISTER says, so I don&#x27;t see (I mean my SISTER doesn&#x27;t see) why they can&#x27;t give me I mean my SISTER more recent songs like \\&quot;As Long as You Love Me\\&quot; or \\&quot;Somebody to Love\\&quot;...another thing is that the bristles wear out kind of fast and it has nothing at all to do with how long someone like my SISTER spends brushing her teeth in the shower, over and over again as the mirror fogs with steam as that enviable soprano echoes off the tiles...OK my SISTER did not say that exactly but it&#x27;s TRUE....I mean not TRUE TRUE because I&#x27;ve actually done that...ha ha...wait I mean I have NOT done that but I imagine it could happen...Nice Toothbrush!</li>
            <li> Baby, Baby, Baby! What can I say? Great novel item. Loved one just dotes on brushing his teeth with this! Well made item can get wet without a problem!</li>
            <li> I ordered this product 4 days ago, and got it yesterday. It only took me an estimated 3 days to receive it! I was amazed to find out it worked perfectly, and the song only plays for 2 minutes, so you know when to stop brushing. Amazing!</li>
            <li> I bought this as Christmas gifts for my 2 oldest children 7 &amp; 4 and while they love the fact that Bieber sings to them while they brush their teeth, I found the brush head to be a little on the large side for their small mouths. The sound quality is ok conisdering it is a tooth brush, but it is so loud I can hear it 3 rooms away. On a positive note they love brushing their teeth with it and it is no longer a battle to get them to brush for the full 2 minutes. Despite it&#x27;s flaws I would buy it again simply because it saves me an argument and a huge headache twice a day.</li>
            <li> Very happy by my purchase...very well and secured packaged and exactly as was described. Highly recommended, and great quality for the price.</li>
            <li> My daughter&#x27;s friends are HUGE Bieber fans so I ordered these for her to give to them for Christmas. They loved them!!!</li>
            <li> I like to see sellers who place reasonable prices on their items.  This toothbrush is reasonably priced at $10.99 since you can get it for $9.99 at any Rite-Aid drug store.  I&#x27;ve seen these for as high as $29.00 on ebay...that is ridiculous!!!</li>
            <li> My roommates got me this for my 24th birthday.  At first glance, this product seems like a brush of genius.  I&#x27;m all about controlling my tartar.  One button has sunshine on it, and one button has a crescent moon, indicating that one is for when you wake up and one is for when you go to bed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first and last time I used this thing, the bristles started falling out and having a party in my soft palate.  Justin Bieber&#x27;s sweet sweet soprano did nothing to suppress my gag reflex as I had to finger these barf inducers out of my throat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, this product is marketed to children, yet it is loud enough for any senior citizen within two rooms to hear it.  So imagine that next to your head.  When I flushed it down the toilet, I could still hear Justin making his way to the sewers until the song was over.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product for a friend of mine&#x27;s little girl. It came as described and was shipped on time. The girl opened it immediately and started playing it. She wanted to go right then to brush her teeth! The parents thanked me(even though they aren&#x27;t as crazy about Justin as their daughter is). The fact that it plays for 2 minutes is awesome! I told her she had to brush her teeth the whole time he&#x27;s singing! What a great idea and product! Thank you.</li>
            <li> So, again I bought another JB product for my daughter. She loves this toothbrush and I think the singing has made her brush her teeth longer than she normally would. My only complaint is that after 2 months the battery is fizziling already. I haven&#x27;t tried to take it apart to replace it yet, but 2 months is a little short in my opinion. Oh yea, it&#x27;s kind of annoying to the older siblings. Overall, I would buy this again.</li>
            <li> The head fits too loose and will fall out when you brush.  I bought two luckily and so the other head fits tight enough.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my daughter.  She really loves it!  Its a great stockingstuffer for your Justin Beiber tween fan!</li>
            <li> My kids LOVED the tooth brushes..... except only one of them played music. My oldest daughters would not play at all. I would have returned it, but she was so excited to use it she ripped the box and threw it away. She was upset that hers doesn&#x27;t work, but her sisters did. If both of them worked I would give this product 5 stars. I was going to just buy another one, but didn&#x27;t want to take the change of it not working either. Plus they were gifts from santa so it was hard to do. :(</li>
            <li> It has two settings, one for daytime, one for nightime with two different songs. Keeps my daughter brushing her teeth for 2 mins.</li>
            <li> I bought it for my teenage daughter for fun it works great and she uses it to make me laugh</li>
            <li> Mt granddaughter loves her toothbrush and brushes longer!!!!</li>
            <li> The battery that came with it didn&#x27;t work but once we bought a new one it works fine and my daughter loves it!</li>
            <li> I bought this toothbrush for my ten year old sister, #1 JB fan. She sings his songs all day long so I thought it would be nice to still hear his voice while she has her mouth full of toothpaste...hehe.  HBD has not come yet but I checked the item to see how it works.  I love it and...I am sure she will too!!</li>
            <li> The toothbrush was in good shape and came in good packaging, but the batteries were almost dead and with my buying this for a grandchild in another state and with money being tight between the two families the music will only last for probably long enough to use one time. I think the shipper should always check the batteries to make sure they are in full charge mainly in this time of year.</li>
            <li> I purchased this toothbrush for a 9 year old girl.  When she opened it, she was so excited.  However, the toothbrush did not work.  I contacted the company for customer support via both voice mail and email 2 weeks ago and have yet to receive a response.</li>
            <li> I bought for my granddaughter, she is a Bieber fan.  It appeared to be cleaver enough to get girls to brush longer, while playing the song.</li>
            <li> The internal battery was smashed and so it did not work. How could this happen I have no idea. It really spoiled what would have been a great gift.</li>
            <li> I got this as an add on and I guess the saying you get what you pay for really holds true.  My daughter loves it but the music sounds like crap.</li>
            <li> The Justin Bieber Singing Toothbrush didn&#x27;t work. Had to return it for a refund. Would not recommend this. Low quality.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t work!  All we got was a high priced toothbrush.  DO NOT BUY!!!!!!!!!!!  Our 5 year old was really disappointed.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t work for very long before it broke or wouldn&#x27;t play music anymore. It was neat when the child received it as a gift, but not great quality.</li>
            <li> The toothbrush was nice and looked great. But the music that plays on the toothbrush tends to skip! A little dissapointed.</li>
            <li> Great idea.  My child loves brushing with this.  Finally, tooth brushing without a fight.  We love this product and how it works.</li>
            <li> I can not comment on the quality because she just loves it for what it is a Justin Beiber toothbrush that plays music.</li>
            <li> This singing toothbrush is awesome! Great gift for any young girl! Bought it for my teenager. Plays two full length songs. Daughter loved it!</li>
            <li> Our young grandson asked for this Justin Bieber toothbrush for Christmas.  I was surprised but decided to purchase one.  Well, when it arrived (on time like most Amazon shipments), it appeared well made and the sound quality was excellent.  It&#x27;s Still working over one month later so that&#x27;s a good sign!</li>
            <li> Love the toothbrush. Since my daughter loves justin bieber I thought this would make sure she brushes her teeth. It does</li>
            <li> I got this item for my 8 year old who loves Justin Bieber. So far it is working just fine. It was much cheaper than a tooth tunes which is really what she wanted and it does the trick</li>
            <li> fast delievery ended up being color i wanted thought was suppose to be a spinbrush and wasnt good product though</li>
            <li> Out of all the gifts my 4 year old niece received this is the one she loved the most definitely a good buy.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my 6-year old daughter for Christmas. When it arrived it didn&#x27;t work so I had to buy new batteries and they were about the same price as the entire toothbrush. The batteries lasted about a week and now my daughter can&#x27;t use it until I get new batteries for it. I am debating on whether or not to just buy a new brush all together or tell her I can&#x27;t find one so I don&#x27;t have to waste the money. My other daughter has a Lady Ga Ga brush and it works great.</li>
            <li> Purchased it as a gag Christmas present for a roommate. He hates the thing but everyone else found it to be an awesome gift. Now you can have Justin Bieber in your mouth whenever you want!</li>
            <li> My grandson (5) has had Toothtunes and they weren&#x27;t as loud.  Sometimes we put this one on the counter like a little radio and let it play while he brushes with another toothbrush. It still works like a timer, but not blaring in his ears.</li>
            <li> When my 8 year old niece opened this for Christmas, she squealed with delight and launched herself into my arms! That, in and of itself, made me rate this 5 stars!</li>
            <li> The bristles fell out of the head of the toothbrush into my mouth. Its not the most pleasant thing in the world.</li>
            <li> I got this for my daughter, yes she is a Justin bieber fan, and she just loves it, she brushes her teeth about 7/8 times a day now,i have to tell her its too much! she has never fussed about brushing her teeth, always has for some reason even done it without even being asked, so that&#x27;s not been a problem, but now she just loves the toothbrush she wants to brush too much. I recommend this to anybody that has a kid that doesn&#x27;t want to brush their teeth, cus now they will, also to any Justin fan, and there are other brush buddies that are of different singers,so if not Justin you can get someone else. I like that the replacement heads and batteries are easy to find on here (im going to go ahead and get some cus I know now that I will need them for sure), and are not expensive and that this was the same price pretty much as any good toothbrush. the head of the brush is made very well, like a higher end toothbrush, which is even better. it does play 2 full songs, (the 2 listed), and is easy to turn on and off, just push one button for one song, and push it again to turn it off, push the other button for the other song, and again to turn off, or just switch the song by pushing the other button, very easy, even for a little kid. I got myself one of these as well (not Justin bieber though lol), and really like it a lot, I like the brush head better than my old more expensive tooth brush head! highly recommended!</li>
            <li> Bought as a gift and she loved it</li>
            <li> I bought this as a gift for a friend. When she tried to turn it on, nothing happened. Upon opening the case we found one of the batteries was severally corroded. A real bummer.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product for my 7 year old Granddaughter who loves JB.  The first time she went to use it, it broke.  It comes in two pieces and when she tried to connect the brush into the base that is when it broke.  It is very cheaply made.  Her Dad tried taping it together but it is pretty useless.  As for the music playing, it works fine.</li>
            <li> Daughter loves it! Plays songs well, quite LOUD! Tip falls off with little effort though. Where to find replacement heads?</li>
            <li> Terrific product. Shipped very quickly. Was exactly as described. While not really expensive, the price was definitely worth the quality!</li>
