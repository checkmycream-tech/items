            <li>fantastic stuff really works good on my hair excellent moisturizer.</li>
            <li>So, very FAST shipping, which i LOVED!</li>
            <li>So you can save yourselves the headache and lost of searching for anything better than what you have here that has already been proven to be among the best, real brands of argan oil out there in a crowded oil market.</li>
            <li>The 1st bottle had a very strong smell (even though i didnt like it)</li>
            <li>Love, Love this product!</li>
            <li>My skin is more hydrated and even my skin tone looks better!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s left my skim feeling great, and it smells good too!</li>
            <li>For years a good moisturizer was fine, now I need something stronger and more effective.  </li>
            <li>Argan oil is an amazing product that has so many healing properties for all parts of your body, it&#x27;s almost a</li>
            <li>Loved the light ungreasy feeling of Argan Oil to use on my hair face and nails.</li>
            <li>I am very happy with this product so far.  </li>
            <li>but this one seems to be the best I have used so far.</li>
            <li>Moisture is the most important thing I have found the keeps my skin happy and mostly acne-free.</li>
            <li>I love the fact that when you put it in your hands it feels warm</li>
            <li>It is one of my favorite carrier oils because it absorbs so well and it nice on the face and doesn&#x27;t cause break</li>
            <li>Has so many uses and works amazing</li>
            <li>Product comes with an eye dropper, but I found putting a spray bottle top from one of my travel bottles fit great and delivered the product better for my hair.</li>
            <li>I put it directly on my skin and my skin feels wonderful.</li>
            <li>Additionally, Foxbrim is cruelty free and organic, so you can feel good about buying this</li>
            <li>But so far, I have been very happy with it.</li>
            <li>It feels more sturdy and kind of makes it feel fancier, if that makes sense.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s definitely worth the price,  works great</li>
            <li>your arms and legs it just moisturizes and leaves that nice healthy glow.</li>
            <li>It seemed like a fairly nourishing but light oil for this purpose.</li>
            <li>It is the best, leaves the skin soft.  </li>
            <li>what an amazing product, i love it</li>
            <li>Wow, this oil is wonderful.  </li>
            <li>I have been using it for nearly a month and my skin is softer, feels great, and no breakouts!!</li>
            <li>and like it but feel that the argan oil is a bit more effective in keeping skin hydrated and plumped without being greasy at all.</li>
            <li>It is so smooth and feels good going on.</li>
            <li>This is by far the best version of this product I have ever tried.</li>
            <li>I like how they have really nice quality oil for your hair (mostly).</li>
            <li>Applying this product on my damp hair for the first time I could feel the velvety texture return and reminded me of a very excellent hot oil treatment except it took no time!!  </li>
            <li>Applying this oil on my skin doesn&#x27;t feel as nice and easy as it does when I&#x27;m applying a creamy moisturizer, but it&#x27;s really nice knowing</li>

            <li>I used this oil to mix with Shea butter and carrot seed oil  to make a moisturizer for my face and it is so rich and feels so good.  </li>
            <li>Its a mild smell, but I don&#x27;t find it pleasant.  </li>
            <li>Not only is it my go-to pre-shave, but it also doubles as a great moisturizer that gives the skin a great feel and helps eliminate dryness and oiliness.  </li>
            <li>it was so nice to get a follow up email to make sure I enjoyed it, or if there was any issues.</li>

            <li>Free of Parabens, Phthalates, or Sulfates.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;The only downfall I experienced was the dropper container.</li>
            <li>It is the same as the others from what I have experienced.  </li>
            <li>The 2nd one doesn&#x27;t work (even in this spring) as great as the 1st one did in winter.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>

            <li>I am a huge fan of argan oil and can’t say enough good about argan oil.</li>
            <li>Pat it on your face and let the water/steam seep into your pores and clean dat oil out ur</li>
            <li>and I’ve seen great improvement that my skin; my skin is not as dry as it was before.</li>

            <li>have used it on my hair, lips and dry skin, it feels great, and the smallest amount, just a couple drops is all thats needed.</li>
            <li>I am learning that natural and simple can sometimes be the best.</li>

            <li>i love how soft and healthy it leaves my hair.</li>
            <li>It works great for my dry hair.</li>

            <li>It makes mixing the Argan Oil very easy,  particularly with shampoos, conditioners.</li>
            <li>Dries naturally with healthy shine!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m preparing to buy another bottle, for it is more cost effective, both monetarily and healthy wise, to  use Argan oil instead of any other type of facial or hair care product.</li>
            <li>I use argan oil on my face and hair and its such a great way to hydrate your skin and keep it looking healthy, bring back that healthy glow we all want.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also GREAT for HAIR and dry skin!  </li>
            <li>Absorbed into Skin&lt;br /&gt;Repairs and Replenishes your skin&#x27;s moisture allowing fine lines/wrinkles to diminish&lt;br /&gt;Safe</li>
            <li>So, I was very excited to see that this was absorbed right away in to the skin of my son and cleared up that dryness.</li>
            <li>I love argan oil, but had never tried it in it&#x27;s pure form.</li>
            <li>I always make sure it&#x27;s pure and not diluted by anything.</li>
            <li>One of the most versatile oils in my opinion is Foxbrim’s 100% Pure Argan Oil.  </li>
            <li>I am a PhD organic chemist and I love the sense of pure organic oils.</li>
            <li>I love that it is 100% pure but still bottled in the US.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m confident it is pure</li>
            <li>I love the pure Argan Oil for my face as it does seem to soften the lines of time.  </li>
            <li>specially for what it has done for my hair alone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>love using Foxbrim’s Pure Organic Argan Oil.</li>
            <li>Lovely 100% Pure Argan Oil.  </li>
            <li>Works great for very dry skin.</li>
            <li>We are at the tale end of the winter eczema season for my kids, so this is really nothing, but I thought it was the perfect small spot to test out to make sure that they didn&#x27;t feel anything because believe it or not there have been different eczema creams that sting my kids although the interesting thing is that what stings one is the best eczema cream for the other and vice versa.</li>
            <li>Where the differences are at between a good high quality argan and a lesser argan is in the very things that make argan superior to olive for the skin and hair.</li>
            <li>Works great for rough patches on skin.</li>
            <li>You don&#x27;t need much, and you&#x27;ll love the results.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a blogger that states my true opinion.</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t say enough good things about it.</li>
            <li>I am really liking how my neck looks better.</li>
            <li>overall it is a really good products and works well on my face.</li>
            <li>but I need more time to see if it will really help.  </li>
            <li>so don&#x27;t know full benefits as yet</li>
            <li>It really helps with many skin and hair issues.</li>
            <li>Essentially, argan oil is good for you via ingestion.</li>
            <li>So far I am thrilled with this product</li>
            <li>Good product overall</li>
            <li>I am an true awe.</li>
            <li>I use personally and believe will be good for my readers.</li>
            <li>I use personally and believe will be good for my readers.</li>

            <li>We couldn&#x27;t recommend it more highly</li>
            <li>even the most $$$ high dollar Dermatologist prescribed products that I have used.  </li>

            <li>just soaks right in, feels clean.  </li>
            <li>I have been wanting to try Argan Oil for awhile and can&#x27;t believe I got such a super deal!!!</li>
            <li>So I’ve been very interested in it.</li>
            <li>It applies pretty smoothly and doesn&#x27;t leave a greasy film on my skin.</li>
            <li>so I was interested in trying this product free* to review.</li>

            <li>I was using a more expensive product that has a model&#x27;s name attached to it but found that this is just as good!  </li>

            <li>It is an awesome moisturizing agent even if used in conjunction with other facial or body lotions</li>

            <li>I even use this on my hair when I can not style it the right way and it helps me tame my fly a ways.</li>

            <li>Eh, I&#x27;m not super impressed with this argan oil, it looks different from the picture shown on amazon, the bottle is amber though.</li>
            <li>This oil is light and goes on easily during my morning/evening facial routines.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s no exaggeration that my crow&#x27;s feet have diminished greatly over the past year.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very affordable, and to top it off, it&#x27;s all natural!</li>
            <li>I love the fact that it contains no fillers, additives, parabens or silicones and is 100% pure and is derived directly from Morocco.  </li>

            <li>Now granted I haven&#x27;t been using this product for very long I did notice a nice luster to my hair.</li>
            <li>I have textured dry damaged colored hair and this product works amazing.  </li>
            <li>Four drops applied to my cracked, dry heels and I&#x27;m no longer having to peel them to keep it from catching on sheets and carpet.</li>
            <li>I also love to put 3 drops of the oil on my clean, dry hair.</li>
            <li>Makes me obsessed with touching my skin after using it lol.</li>
            <li>My skin is not a dry and my hair is shiny an healthy witHout appearing or feeling greasy.</li>
            <li>The product has worked flawlessly, and helped bring a glow back to some trouble spots.  </li>
            <li>I agreed to give my honest opinion about the product I really love how it conditions the hair leaving it very soft and manageable its also great as a moisturizer without all the bad chemicals</li>
            <li>and this took it to a whole new level (just as rich, shiny and full of body as when I was in my twenties).</li>
            <li>You don&#x27;t need to use very much to see results.</li>
            <li>but I can say my skin feels very much softer</li>
            <li>While I like the organic argan oil, I very much dislike being harrassed to do a review which is what Troy at Foxbrim did.</li>
            <li>I love that it is organic and free from parabens and other harmful chemicals.  </li>
            <li>Just a few drops on freshly washed hair makes it shine and feel wonderful when dry.  </li>
            <li>This one being pure and nothing else added to it, gives off a fresh smell.</li>
            <li>and it thanks you so much!!</li>
            <li>The main natural phenols in argan oil are caffeic acid, oleuropein, vanillic acid, tyrosol, catechol, resorcinol, (−)-epicatechin and (+)-catechin are rich in nutrients and flavor rich constituents.</li>
            <li>It has hardly any &amp;#34;smell&amp;#34; which is great, compared to using coconut oil.</li>
            <li>However, and it is a huge &amp;#34;however,&amp;#34; my nails are so soft, they are peeling away.  </li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t trigger my eczema which was huge to me since I tend to be a bit sensitive.</li>
            <li>It leaves my hands feeling smooth and it makes my hair feel silky and soft.</li>
            <li>but after trying it on my entire face, I noticed that my skin felt smooth and nourished like never before!</li>
            <li>At the health food stores-you get 1 ounce &amp; no dropper at a much higher price.  </li>
            <li>I have recently discovered the many benefits of using Argan oil.  </li>
            <li>totally adore products that serve many purposes.</li>
            <li>I use it for many different reasons.</li>
            <li>Fast Shipping too!</li>
            <li>it helps keep it soft an smooth.</li>
            <li>and I’m really liking it!</li>
            <li>A whole bunch of things!</li>
            <li>You can use it for many different cosmetic applications.</li>
            <li>I would defiently buy more of this only when it runs out.</li>
            <li>After the first treatment my hands are noticeably softer.</li>
            <li>and we wear it under our foundation (made by the well-known cosmetic company), and we get a very dewy, fresh look.  </li>
            <li>fast shipping too!</li>
            <li>I could see a difference in my skin the first time I used this oil</li>
            <li>The product is light..easy to absorb and my skin feel so soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>The feature I just described is my FAVORITE thing about the argan oil, but I&#x27;m open to discovering others!  </li>
            <li>this is my first experience with Argon Oil</li>
            <li>So I am so soft and smooth all over.</li>
            <li>I lovvvve, love the way it instantly plumps up my skin--</li>
            <li>Makes my hair shinny, soft, and smooth.</li>
            <li>Thank you so much!</li>
            <li>it smells a bit different though,but i am ok with the smell.  </li>
            <li>first i started using this on my nails..</li>
            <li>All-natural and leaves my skin soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t cause me to break out;)</li>
            <li>I love, love, love Argan oil (I&#x27;m s bit obsessed).</li>
            <li>have used this Argan oil for many different things.</li>
            <li>a carrier oil: I use tihs as a carrier oil for my essential oils and it makes a lovely carrier oil which I put into roller balls.</li>
            <li>It is exactly what it says it is.</li>
            <li>I am trying to grow it out, so keeping that length, which is the oldest part of all my hair, healthy and moisturized is a big part of my hair care routine.  </li>
            <li>Like any reputable brand of argan oil, this is the only ingredient you should find in your bottle.</li>
            <li>Exactly as described.</li>
            <li>I have never written a review until now, but this product absolutely deserves 5 stars!</li>
            <li>This is the first time I have purchased Argan Oil.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried many different brands of Argan oil</li>
            <li>It is clear, and the scent is light.</li>
            <li>It works exactly how I wanted it to.</li>
            <li>It makes my hair and skin smooth and soft.</li>
            <li>My hair is silky smooth, soft, and has no fly-aways.</li>
            <li>this is a big bottle with a dropper, which are my favorite.</li>
            <li>I realize that at my age it is not possible to erase all the years etched on my face for many years</li>
            <li>premium light weight soft oil with no additives, no fillers, no fragrances, and no silicones.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s light, non-oily feeling, and thankfully nearly unscented.  </li>
            <li>- Thank you so much Foxbrim !</li>
            <li>It was absorbed fast by skin.</li>
            <li>Granted that when I put a drop of the oil on top of the hand, I can&#x27;t smell the odor unless I actually put my hand to the nose.</li>
            <li>Not only will you see healthy, shiny hair</li>
            <li>I will definitively be back for more</li>
            <li>Argan Oil is not called &amp;#34;liquid gold&amp;#34; just because of the soft golden color of the oil, it&#x27;s also because this all natural oil has so many hair &amp; skincare benefits.  </li>
            <li>When I was first introduced to Argan Oil</li>
            <li>There are so many uses for this product - I will definitely order again.</li>
            <li>My skin felt soft and smooth - another plus is that the Argan Oil soaked in immediately and wasn&#x27;t oily at all.</li>
            <li>but I’ll definitely be being more when I need it.</li>
            <li>;)</li>
            <li>I use it for so many things such as moisturizer my skin, cuticles, and hair.  </li>
            <li>First, I would like to thank Argan Oil Co for try their Argan Oil.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m preparing to purchase 1 or 2 more bottles because this one suddenly disappeared when my daughter visited.</li>
            <li>The shipment was really fast!</li>
            <li>Works well on my nails too, which is why I bought it in the first place.</li>
            <li>five very shiny, golden stars.</li>
            <li>and this is the first product that I have ever used that did not cause even the smallest breakout.  </li>
            <li>I am using it for my hair and for my personal skin care products and the texture is lovely.</li>
            <li>This is my first time using the Argan Oil for my face.</li>
            <li>I read about Argan oil and purchased a bottle for her and after the first use or two you could see a definitive difference.</li>
            <li>But TODAY I&#x27;m ordering the one I should have ordered in the first place.  </li>
            <li>First, the bottle is devine.</li>
            <li>My hands are so smooth and soft now.  </li>
            <li>It was my first time buying it.</li>

            <li>Thanks!  </li>
            <li>This is my first experience with this product and I foresee a reorder in the coming months.  </li>
            <li>That dark bottle is great for preserving the natural oil.</li>
            <li>I really like this Argan oil!</li>
            <li>:) I will definitely buy it again and continue to use it on a routine basis.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s exactly what she wanted.</li>
            <li>Argan oil can be used in so many different ways.  </li>
            <li>This is a first time product for me</li>
            <li>I really have rarely had anything that has worked this well.</li>
            <li>It leaves my skin so soft and smooth, and doesn&#x27;t clog my pores.</li>
            <li>I instantly fell in love.</li>
            <li>I am red headed and have many freckles...</li>
            <li>My skin is more even toned and the pores seem to be getting smaller.  </li>
            <li>It absorbed fast on the skin and not greasy at all.</li>
            <li>makes my hair so soft and frizz free</li>
            <li>Great for the hair, just a few drops is enough to make shine and smooth.</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>although this one smells exactly the same, and I am sure it is also 100% organic Argan oil just like the first one I purchased.  </li>
            <li>It only takes a couple of drops to smooth my hair!</li>
            <li>I also have another oil-free facial moisturizer which had too many exfoliating ingredients in it</li>
            <li>Just a few drops leaves my skin with a dewy, gorgeous glow.</li>
            <li>Works great on your face also as a moisturizer instead of your regular cream one if you have really dry skin there, too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Works great on your face also as a moisturizer instead of your regular cream one if you have really dry skin there, too.</li>
            <li>The oil goes on light, absorbs quickly and moisturized for several hours.</li>
            <li>She has been using this for a couple of weeks and wow!!!!</li>
            <li>I love this oil, I mix it with rosehip oil and other essential oils to make my own custom skincare blend.</li>

            <li>It is perfectly clear and rubs in without any residue, unlike some of the very popular, super moisturizing, heavy lotions on the market!  </li>
            <li>I can easily just add the essential oils I want right to the bottle and then use as a moisturizer.</li>
            <li>This is my first experience with Argan oil and it extremely positive.</li>
            <li>100% Pure Certified Organic Argan Oil  makes my skin feel so soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>I have been using the argan oil (2 drops mixed with 1/2 my normal squeeze of face lotion) on my face for several weeks now and it has been great,</li>
            <li>/&gt;After comparing the two argan oil brands, I have come to the consensus that I will be purchasing Foxbrim from now on, rather than the other trendy brand I was purchasing.</li>
            <li>I really liked the tips this seller sent for other uses of argan oil.</li>
            <li>I like Foxbrim because it smells fresher than any other kind I&#x27;ve used and after being on my skin for a while there is no greasy feel.</li>
            <li>So far I really like how smooth it makes my skin feel.  </li>
            <li>I did a 4-week trial and did see a reduction in fine lines, to some even smoothing out and barely noticeable.</li>
            <li>My review is based on my experience with the product and/or brand, which may differ from yours.n fine lines, to some even smoothing out and barely noticeable.</li>
            <li>so after washing my hair with shampoo and conditioner,before blow drying i apply few drop on my hair concentrating more on rots,it leaves my hair smooth and silky,and works goo as a heat protectant  which is always a bonus .as</li>
            <li>After a few days, my skin is no longer flaky and my makeup goes on much more smoothly.  </li>
            <li>My overall review is a 4 out of 5 and is recommended by me for anyone who wants a healthy way and non-chemical way to moisturize their Hair, Body and Skin.</li>
            <li>Have used others that have been much more expensive, and believe me, this is just as good.  </li>
            <li>I am outside a lot and need moisturizing that is effective but not heavy.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m sure it is good but soooo expensive.</li>
            <li>This oil have many uses, I use it for shaving; my shavings using this oil are much, much smoother than with regular shaving</li>
            <li>If I do decide that the smell is gone that quickly, it should work fine for my dry feet/heels.  </li>
            <li>also enjoyed the sweet slightly nutty</li>
            <li>My wife loves this oil, very affordable and makes the hair very shiney!</li>
            <li>Not really anymore, not to mention, mixed with the vitamin c serums I use, I am basically pimple free, which is really nice.</li>
            <li>The smell did seem to go away pretty fast.  </li>
            <li>And this is a much heavier oil than the first one I used...</li>
            <li>3 drops goes a long way. :)</li>
            <li>I recieved this super fast and it was very inexpensive with high quality.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also great for your hair, I have naturally curly hair and hair products generally leave my hair dry and damaged.</li>
            <li>This Argan Oil was easy to apply and helped relieve my dry skin right away.</li>
            <li>Super soft hair and skin with no clogged pores or greasy feel.</li>
            <li>It also very quickly healed a scar I had from a recent surgery.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t magically make wrinkles disappear, but my dry skin feels moister.</li>
            <li>as my hands are more dry..</li>
            <li>I used on my hair and it made it super soft and</li>
            <li>Nice change from typical over the counter products.</li>
            <li>combat dry skin, add a bit of Argan oil to your favorite lotion.  </li>
            <li>It does have a slight warm scent but it goes away in a couple minutes.</li>

            <li>The oil makes my hair super soft and tames my hair on humid days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Good size bottle and should last us both a long time.</li>
            <li>Josie Maran&#x27;s Pure Argan Oil is somehow different, as my nails are wonderfully strong when I use it</li>
            <li>Our hair is looking shiny, healthy, moisturized and not dirty or weighed down.</li>
            <li>so I jumped at the chance to use the pure stuff.</li>
            <li>You just might need some Foxbrim 100% Pure Organic Argan Oil.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s 100% pure and</li>
            <li>BUT I started applying the oil to my face and EUREKA my large pores started shrinking.  </li>
            <li>Foxbrim makes a 100% Pure Argan Oil that is Certified Organic.  </li>
            <li>I will certainly buy it again.</li>

            <li>Pure Argan oil soaks into face, skin and nails.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s 100% pure.</li>
            <li>If this is 100 % pure Argan oil, then why the hell is kernel oil one of the ingredients?</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s just how pure argan oil smells.  </li>
            <li>I purchased Foxbrim 100% pure organic Argan Oil.</li>
            <li>after body scrub that 100% Pure Organic Argan Oil works miracle.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It’s a 100% Pure Organic Argan Oil</li>
            <li>Or maybe thats how 100% pure argan oil smells...</li>
            <li>It smells as argan oil should smell, I think it is definetly pure, since I have bought some that as not as pure, this one is.  </li>
            <li>I was introduced to pure Argan Oil during a &#x27;spa package&#x27; on a cruise.</li>
            <li>so this review is based purely off of her experiences with it.</li>
            <li>According to the label, you can also use the Foxbrim Certified Organic Pure Argan Oil on your hair, face, and nails.</li>
            <li>Everything about this 100% PURE ORGANIC ARGAN OIL is Amazing!!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>So you may be asking, what can I use Foxbrim 100% Pure Argan Oil for?</li>
            <li>It is pure and quite inexpensive.  </li>
            <li>I use this 100% pure argan oil on my face and in my hair.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve also been putting it on a large mole that I&#x27;ve had all my life along my jaw line.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used it all my life and know that as a beauty product, a 100% pure oil, improves and maintains the beauty of skin and hair.</li>
            <li>Its pure organic.</li>
            <li>but I think I put a little too much, but it&#x27;s 100% pure and you can&#x27;t get better than that!</li>
            <li>A few drops worked into the hair or added to your favorite face cream yields results!</li>
            <li>Since I started applying Foxbrim every morning on my damp hair once it dried up I applied just a drop more and my hair looked super shinny, with my curl texture</li>
            <li>I use this oil for de-frizzing and conditioning fine, fragile hair--</li>
            <li>I have been using Argan Oil for a short time and my fine lines are fading.</li>
            <li>I use this Argan oil on my face -especially around my eyes and mouth where there are fine lines and wrinkles.  </li>
            <li>After receiving the Foxbrim 100% Argan Oil I was made aware that this product had so many other uses besides the hair.  </li>
            <li>time and especially if you address the problem areas, like around your eyes, fine lines, wrinkles, you will see an improvement with texture.</li>
            <li>This is a very high quality oil.  </li>
            <li>Argan oil, which is simply the oil of the nut of the argan tree, is a lot like olive oil in many ways and the less high quality argan oils are more like olive oil than the higher quality ones.</li>
            <li>100% Pure and Organic making it a very lightweight oil.  </li>
            <li>Thanks to Foxbrim 100% pure organic argan oil</li>
            <li>The oil is smooth and light absorbing quickly and not feeling greasy in the least bit.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried many other brands, and none come close to having all the positive characteristics that real argan oil is most famous for,  other than the 2 brands I&#x27;ve had the best experience with, you own FOXBRIM, as well as the MOGADOR brands, though I prefer the Foxbrim brand simply because it&#x27;s cost less to get the same results as with any of other 100% certified all natural brands that actually what they say they are.   </li>
            <li>Soaks right into skin and leaves you so soft!</li>
            <li>So far so good a little change in my hair.</li>
            <li>It is super cheap compared to other oils I&#x27;ve looked at.</li>
            <li>and I really like it.  </li>
            <li>I really like this Argan oil.</li>

            <li>Really like this product.  </li>
            <li>didn’t use this on my face, since my face is fickle with straight oils.</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t see much difference there.</li>
            <li>I really like this argan oil.</li>
            <li>and I really like the product and the results.</li>
            <li>I will say if you use too much oil on your hair, it will get greasy.  </li>

            <li>for a much, much lower price.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t remember ever using a product that made it all so much easier.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m getting ready for Spring and Summer by going to a tanning salon.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>I mix this with coconut oil to put in my hair and it really help it to grow</li>
            <li>Smooths very well.</li>
            <li>I really like the feel of the argan oil though.</li>
            <li>I really like this brand.</li>
            <li>and I have really noticed a difference on</li>
            <li>In my opinion this is a very versatile product that you could get a lot of use out of.</li>
            <li>and I really like the effect it has had with my feet .</li>
            <li>This argan oil has made my hands and face so smooth and this is only after using for a couple of days.</li>
            <li>The product came in bubble wrap and in a padded package, so it was very well protected.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t see a whole lot difference except</li>
            <li>Careful with it, three drops is potent.</li>

            <li>It does no have much of a scent which can be a plus, so you can wear</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li>This is the real deal.</li>

            <li>Argan Oil goes on very &amp;#34;clean&amp;#34; feeling, leaving your skin very refreshed.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>and I really like it.</li>
            <li>I have waist length, fairly straight hair and a pea sized amount leaves my hair clumpy and sticky.</li>
            <li>I can see  much added shine to my hair.</li>
            <li>In addition, I have found that it really works well on my fingers.  </li>
            <li>and this oil has really helped so much.</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>One of the best things about it is that it doesn&#x27;t leave a thick residue on my hands and my hair is much more manageable after using only a few drops.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s reasonably priced.</li>
            <li>I got this for my wife and she is very please with it.</li>
            <li>It does work really well in both mine and my daughter&#x27;s hair though.</li>
            <li>It really does work wonders.  </li>
            <li>Foxbrim Argan Oil really does do wonders for your hair.</li>
            <li>I have heard so much about Argan Oil.</li>
            <li>and you can add as much as you like to get the result you want.</li>
            <li>Thanks for prompt shipping and delivery.</li>
            <li>I have been hearing so much about Argan  oil and wanted to try it.</li>
            <li>Fast delivery.</li>
            <li>Thank you so much</li>
            <li>I decided then, that i would just save ALOT of money, and order straight Argan Oil from a retailer.</li>
            <li>This stuff feels and smells like the real deal.</li>
            <li>Argan happens to be one of her very favorites.....</li>
            <li>but it is not known how much this amount is.</li>
            <li>My mid-60&#x27;s skin really needed some pick-up.  </li>
            <li>I had blotches and puffiness, being very susceptible to the summer sun and heat.  </li>
            <li>Feels so light-weighted and very supple.</li>
            <li>It works very well on my skin and hair without a greasy residue.</li>
            <li>It is much softer.</li>
            <li>I like the product and absolutely zero complaints about it.</li>
            <li>Thanks again.</li>
            <li>AND IT REALLY DOES THE TRICK.  </li>
            <li>I think it would work very well as an additive to your hair color, developer, or bleaching product to prevent damage.  </li>
            <li>after a week now my scars are really getting lighter...</li>
            <li>it really works...</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>I tried mixing it with a bit of aloe vera gel which instantly creates a light weight moisturizer</li>
            <li>but it is very pricey.</li>
            <li>I have short, course, thick, naturally curly/frizzy hair, Argan oil infused products are perfect.  </li>
            <li>When I put the first dropper full in the palm of my hands, I thought, &amp;#34;Oh Brother!&amp;#34;, I&#x27;m going to be rubbing this into my skin for the next 20 minutes</li>
            <li>more deep lines have developed but by using this oil every night and morning, the lines are softened.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m still only 33 years old, but because I slather my face with these oils at night, I look better than I did when I was 23.</li>
            <li>Having soft supple skin is a very positive attribute to possess.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s OK but certainly not a miracle worker.</li>
            <li>and it is working as good, if not better, than anything else he has tried!  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried a few brands of Argan Oil recently because they have become very popular for skin care.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s good for dry ends on your hair, your dry skin, or cuticles.</li>
            <li>I had originally bought the Argan oil to moisturize my eye area in addition to my facial cream</li>
            <li>After application, I&#x27;m left with richly moisturized skin.</li>
            <li>Your hair will shine with a small dab of argan oil, and your hands will look better too!</li>
            <li>It actually does exactly what it&#x27;s described to do for both hair and skin, and even have that familiar roasted nutty scent, as natural !00</li>
            <li>Foxbrim Argan Oil absorbs better than other brands I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li>Haven&#x27;t use long enough to rate but so far so good.</li>
            <li>The next day my dry hair was so much better!  </li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve read that this oil is really good for the skin and cuticles too, but I haven&#x27;t tried it directly on my skin yet as I am currently working on using up some other products first.</li>
            <li>Jojoba and avacado oil caused sensitivity/breakouts, coconut oil is not absorbed very well and rosehip oil was okay.</li>
            <li>hands didn&#x27;t dry out as easily and they started to feel softer compared to when I would just use lotion or nothing at all.  </li>
            <li>I am glad I ordered 2 of them as it is very useful especially I live in the midwest, weather here is quite harsh for my skin, it also helps my grey hair..........</li>
            <li>For anyone wanting and needing organic and pure oils, the smell will not offend you, and you will probably love the slight aroma it has.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve bought other brands in the past, and so far this one is the best.  </li>
            <li>and this is like the only thing saving it right now!</li>
            <li>Would recommend highly and the price here is much better than other places I have seen it for sale.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also amazing for split ends, cracked cuticles, dry skin on your hands, knees, ankles, sole of your feet, etc.</li>
            <li>Usually next day, my hair feels soft, shiny, and easy to handle.</li>
            <li>The package arrived quickly and trouble free.</li>
            <li>Using as a beard balm and it absorbs quickly and definitely makes the hair much softer.</li>
            <li>I have very long fine hair.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t usually comment on a product - however this one is absolutely amazing.  </li>
            <li>This oil not only keeps it smooth looking, it makes my hair so soft!</li>
            <li>Hair – I put an entire dropper full into my conditioner</li>
            <li>It just takes a minute amount to have your hair shiny, frizz free, and soft, soft soft</li>
            <li>This is enough to make it shiny and soft and great to use prior to blow drying to using the flat iron.</li>
            <li>For the first time ever my hair was soft and not corse after coloring.</li>
            <li>First, I tried applying a couple of drops directly to my face at night.</li>
            <li>It is a little oily when I first apply it, but about 10 minutes later, most of it is absorbed</li>
            <li>, my skin is more combo/oily due to aging and this is not greasy or make me break-out at all!</li>
            <li>The scent is very organic smelling, a bit sour, a bit nutty but quickly dissipates once absorbed.</li>
            <li>That being said, this product is my new obsession!</li>
            <li>This oil is saving my hair, and I will definitely continue using it even after I finish off my first bottle, because I have used many supposedly professional products without obtaining similar results.</li>
            <li>This oil is saving my hair, and I will definitely continue using it even after I finish off my first bottle, because I have used many supposedly professional products without obtaining similar results.</li>
            <li>me.&lt;br /&gt;I used them regularly on face and lips , the results being just above average and for the price i paid , i am sure to expect more than this.</li>
            <li>My hair is a lot more manageable and sheds less.</li>
            <li>I rub it like you would a cuticle cream, I do not know if my nails are better, but I do know that the cuticle area looks less damaged.</li>
            <li>My hands have started looking more youthful and there are less wrinkles on them.  </li>
            <li>Love the improvement it&#x27;s made on my skin in less than a week.</li>
            <li>As I get older, I&#x27;m allergic to everything-not this oil.</li>
            <li>I use it daily as a face moisturizer and it makes my skin so soft and smooth.  </li>
            <li>My face definitely was moisturized, and it absorbed very well and didn&#x27;t leave an oily feeling or look.</li>
            <li>I have actually had numerous complements on how healthy my hair is.</li>
            <li>I have also used it mixed with my regular body moisturizer, and love it.</li>
            <li>--my hair feels more coarse, damaged, and fragile as a result.</li>
            <li>I have been using this particular bottle of Argan Oil on my skin.  </li>
            <li>I have super dry skin and love using Argan Oil on the elbows, heels and my hands where my skin is really rough.</li>
            <li>Overall, I love the product and I purchased second bottle.</li>
            <li>I have purchased many products for my face and hair and not only is this the only product that I can use for both, it out performs</li>
            <li>I have been using for over 2 weeks, skin still the same, makes hair super greasy .&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Fast absorbing, and makes hands really soft.</li>
            <li>Let me tell you, I am in my mid 30&#x27;s (closer to 40 now) and have always had oily skin with mild break-outs.</li>
            <li>This is not a miracle worker for reversing aging (although I am sure it helps) but merely takes what you have to give you more glow, smoothness, firmness and hydration</li>
            <li>I have super dry skin and love using Argan Oil on the elbows, heels and my hands where my skin is really rough.</li>
            <li>The main ingredient was Argan Oil.</li>
            <li>Otherwise your hair will be super greasy the next day.</li>
            <li>This product works very well, it leaves my hair very soft.</li>
            <li>I have combination skin that is very sensitive and gets very oily.</li>
            <li>Makes your hair very soft and touchable!</li>
            <li>The oil takes a long time to absorb this way and I&#x27;m pretty sure most of it rubbed off, but what was left behind left my cuticles looking a lot better than they were.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a great moisturizer with a very faint earthy smell that fades quickly.  </li>
            <li>highly recommend it</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>This brand of argan oil exceeded my expectations and I would highly recommend this</li>

            <li>My new favorite and ONLY facial moisturizer that I will use.  </li>
            <li>i put it on at nice with other essential oils but remove it in the am..</li>
            <li>I use it mixed with jojoba oil on my legs after shaving, on my dry aging neck in the winter, and mixed with some tea trea oil in my hair (still not as good as Wen hair oil$, but infinitely cheaper).</li>
            <li>In the mornings, I applied it to the ends of my very dry hair to help smooth and add shine.</li>
            <li>For the first several days, when I applied the oil under my makeup, my skin did it very oily compared to when I use my oil-free moisturizer, but it&#x27;s gotten better and there is less oil now.</li>
            <li>A little dab in your hair makes it behave better also.</li>
            <li>so soft!!</li>
            <li>maybe this brand is a little more thinned out.</li>
            <li>Second, it lists how exactly to use the oil for your skin, hair, face and nails!</li>
            <li>It also has nice, subtle packaging that I really like.</li>
            <li>Even having curly super dry bleach hair I need to wash my hair after 3 days because it looks un-groomed and feels very oily on the ends.</li>
            <li>It really helps my super dry hair and skin.</li>
            <li>It hydrates very well, it also rubs in easily but does leave a slight film.</li>
            <li>I had tried at times on my hair mixing with other oils and cant ascertain on its effect on hair at this moment, but i never felt that strong smell of agran in the oil.</li>
            <li>and you need so little that it is vey economical compared to so many facial creams on the market.</li>
            <li>and I like it since it absorbs very quickly, lasts long time, left my nails soft and most of all healed my dry cuticles.</li>
            <li>It’s not like conventional oils that leave a greasy residue; it absorbs fast in the skin and is fragrance free.</li>
            <li>This oil is very light, absorbs quickly, not greasy and makes my skin and hair feel really soft.</li>
            <li>You then rinse and you are left with smooth lips that look healthy and fresh, but not left dry due to the gentle exfoliation you get from the sugar and the moisture from the Argan oil.</li>
            <li>It really helps regulate your natural oil production and helps control acne if you have oily or acne prone skin.</li>
            <li>It is also great for basically any weird skin issues.</li>
            <li>So far I have only used it on my face and my skin absorbed it very well.</li>
            <li>I really like to use natural oils to help condition both mine and my daughter&#x27;s hair</li>
            <li>I use it in the morning after washing my face, and it has really helped my skin stay hydrated and as a result stay clear.</li>
            <li>Thanks for a natural product that works as advertised.&lt;br /&gt;-Phyllis</li>
            <li>worked very well made my skin feel soft and helped my nails grow</li>
            <li>It totally absorbed by skin and not left a oily residue.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad a dropper came with it-I tend to waste products without a dropper.</li>
            <li>doesn&#x27;t look oily, more this i drink 8 glasses of water everyday</li>
            <li>I applied a few more drops in the morning and finished styling my hair.  </li>
            <li>i applied few drops on my face and massaged ,it is so moisturising and good,i love my skin when i wake up in the morning</li>
            <li>i was using josie maran brand argan oil and made the switch to foxbrim - seems to be exactly the same and much cheaper.</li>
            <li>I use argan oil on the ends of my hair everyday, which has eliminated the need for many of my hair</li>
            <li>When I got it I accidentally put too much on the first day but just left it.</li>
            <li>totally worth the extra 3 minutes in the shower.</li>
            <li>used the oil on my face in the evenings in place of my normal moisturizer.</li>
            <li>I have been using Argan Oil in my hair for a few weekss now and love the way it feels.</li>
            <li>I used the oil on my face in the evenings in place of my normal moisturizer.</li>
            <li>It worked instantly and my skin absorbed it without problems.</li>
            <li>Get more than a few drops and you will be shampooing again.</li>
            <li>Normal.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried several different kinds but this one from Foxbrim is my favorite so far.</li>
            <li>I have been using Argan Oil in my hair for a few years now and love the way it feels.</li>
            <li>It is pretty much the only moisturizing product I use on my face now.</li>
            <li>Even my nails are looking better with less chipping and cracking!  </li>
            <li>I was having dry patches on my face and this cleared those right up!</li>
            <li>My favorite ways to use Argan oil is as a hair care routine, facial moisturizer, dry skin, and frizzy hair.</li>
            <li>and it just soaks into my skin and all I am left with is super soft, supple skin!&lt;br</li>
            <li>I guess it is okay if you have really dry skin and want the extra layer of oil always on your face.</li>
            <li>It is absorbed quickly and it takes so few drops.</li>
            <li>Additionally, Foxbrim&#x27;s oil is certified organic, is imported from Morocco and bottled in the USA, and is cruelty free, just like the other brand&#x27;s oil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I use the Agadir shampoo/conditioner and gel, my new permanent hair product.  </li>
            <li>I have both eczema and combination skin, prone to breakouts with new products.</li>
            <li>This is my new staple product.</li>
            <li>I live in AZ.</li>
            <li>Hollywood&#x27;s new  &amp;#34;must have&amp;#34; item.</li>
            <li>I noticed my daughter&#x27;s hair was looking absolutely beautiful for the past few months</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve primarily used it on my beard and mustache, and it&#x27;s definitely helped to soften things up a bit and has essentially eliminated the dreaded beard dandruff.</li>
            <li>Shipping was fast but the product is very greasy even using a tiny bit</li>
            <li>It works wonderfully on my super dry skin and hair.</li>
            <li>and I am very surprised that it doesn&#x27;t make your head or hair greasy at all.</li>
            <li>It makes hair, skin and cuticles very soft.</li>
            <li>I do notice that my face is very soft and I have not had any breakouts.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It leaves my face very soft and hydrated.</li>
            <li>I am of a certain age where those fine lines have started being just plain old wrinkles,</li>
            <li>I desperately needed a good argan oil right now and this fits the bill.</li>
            <li>Pure Argan Oil is packed with Vitamin E, and essential Unsaturated Fatty Acids and more.</li>
            <li>face is clear!</li>
            <li>Wow!</li>
            <li>after the first day of using it on my face - folks were trying to figure out what was different about me...</li>
            <li>It made my hair really soft and shiny, which is just what I wanted!</li>
            <li>I bought this for a specific reason and have actually fallen in love with it for an altogether different one.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m using it on my hands regularly and it is really helping them NOT look like something that escaped from a mummy&#x27;s tomb!  </li>
            <li>This is the second bottle after months of usage of the first one.</li>
            <li>Argan Oil is not my first purchase and will not be my last.  </li>
            <li>, Foxbrim&#x27;s oil is exactly the same.</li>
            <li>This is the first time we ordered it &amp; My Wife loves this product &amp; has become a regular user.  </li>
            <li>My hair is so soft afterward!</li>
            <li>plus this is my second review ( Seller Deleted my first one)  </li>
            <li>To start with, I only used 2 drops on the first day I tested this out.</li>
            <li>Wow I just don&#x27;t know where to start!</li>
            <li>This product performs about the same if not a bit better than my other product in regards to making my hair softer and keeping the frizzes under control.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>so oil cleanse first followed by regular cleanser.</li>
            <li>It makes my skin so soft!</li>
            <li>Pleased with skin softness, jury is still out on skin improvements due to short time in use.</li>
            <li>This is the first argan oil I&#x27;ve tried and I have been using it in different ways.</li>
            <li>This product has been an awesome treat for my poor old and dried up skin.....</li>
            <li>I also use it to moisturizer my formerly dry and frizzy hair and it improved it after the first use!  </li>
            <li>It smooths down the frizzies and make hair soft, i only use a little or it makes it a little greasy, its great for rough feet and makes my skin softer, good for chapped lips too.</li>
            <li>A few drops on wet hair and your blow dry will be salon beautiful.</li>
            <li>Using the argan in the day, and argan+organic virgin coconut oil at night may seem like a high maintence chore to keep up with, but it&#x27;s really not, and it&#x27;s beyond worth it.</li>
            <li>It’s all-natural, and isn’t mixed with other kinds of oils to dilute the natural effect, as many oils are.</li>
            <li>I regularly use argan oil on my skin and I have noticed great difference in my skin texture .It  is pretty cold where i live</li>
            <li>Pleasantly surprised to learn it really was non-greasy, unlike Josie Maran&#x27;s generally revolting version of argan oil</li>
            <li>Just a few drops is all I need and it absorbs very quickly.  </li>
            <li>There is a marked improvement on my facial skin with the use of Argan oil and the results started to show from the first week of usage.</li>
            <li>The oil does not leave any gleasiness since the oil sinks in quickly.</li>
            <li>I was looking for first cold press, but for the price this was really good.</li>
            <li>We found this helps our hair stay in good health without being weighed down to much by heavy conditioners, leave in treatments, etc.</li>
            <li>Plus I tried a little in my hair and it made it super oily!</li>
            <li>I use it for my face and so far no break outs and my skin is always soft afterwards!</li>
            <li>It may feel a little greasy at first but as long as you don&#x27;t use too much it will absorb quickly and not leave a shine.</li>
            <li>It helps relieve the dry skin and gives a smooth and soft texture back.</li>
            <li>It absorbs instantly and just leaves my dry skin feeling soft and smooth.  </li>
            <li>Those dry patches are so much better when I use this following a shower or facial wash.  </li>
            <li>As the owner of very coarse, curly hair I am always on the lookout for styling solutions that are pure.</li>
            <li>need a lot of drops to properly cover large spaces (skin and hair)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Use Pure Argan Oil as a treatment by massaging it into your scalp before bed and washing it out in the morning with your regular shampoo.</li>
            <li>I recently started using Foxbrim 100% Pure Organic Argan Oil</li>
            <li>just want the seller to explain me which one of them is actually 100% pure??????</li>
            <li>I have combination skin, with occasional break outs and large pores.</li>
            <li>product is 100% pure and natural and lists 2 ingredients---not 20 ingredients that look like they&#x27;re out of a medical encyclopedia.</li>
            <li>Very good because it takes only a few drops for your face and neck and moisturizes nicely, not greasy.</li>
            <li>Will post an accurate review in a few weeks.</li>
            <li>and it helped clear up my sunburn in a couple of days.</li>
            <li>I used it in the evening on towel dried hair and when I woke up my hair was soft and almost frizz free.  </li>
            <li>oily skin and Argan oil has helped to clear redness,lesions and control the oil.</li>
            <li>My skin has been really clear too.</li>
            <li>After using I could clearly feel the difference between the two.</li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t get to clear up</li>
            <li>I may try a bottle of it in the near future to see how much I might like it, too.  </li>
            <li>Works wonders on my daughters dandruff, use once a week and her scalp is clear.  </li>
            <li>I applied two drops to my conditioner, it made my hair soft and manageable.</li>
            <li>Three drops, two times a day, added to my face care regimen and my skin is moisturized and soft.</li>
            <li>Also no breakouts so far.</li>
            <li>I am 45 and still look like I am in my early 30s and</li>
            <li>I also used on my skin too and it makes it so soft.</li>
            <li>It makes my hair soft and manageable.  </li>
            <li>wow...</li>
            <li>Natural shine</li>
            <li>Natural lip moisturizer</li>
            <li>Complete cuticle repair&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It’s a natural conditioner and can help with the frizzies, split ends and shine.</li>
            <li>You can use it on on you skin to make it supple and soft</li>
            <li>and my hands are soft again.</li>
            <li>My daughter has curly hair and when I use this on her hair after it’s towel dried it helps her curls stay smooth and curly.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 68 years old and believe me</li>
            <li>I was totally surprised by the results.  </li>
            <li>My face is really soft now.</li>
            <li>Even the doctor was surprised.</li>
            <li>she was about a year old.</li>
            <li>I have acne-prone, sensitive skin</li>
            <li>My hair remained soft and shiny throughout the day.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been shuffling through a lot of old paperwork, while cleaning out my garage</li>
            <li>but this should be natural since is oil.</li>
            <li>It makes my face so soft and if you give it 5 mins or so after application, it does not leave your face oily at all.</li>
            <li>Makes my skin feel soft.</li>
            <li>i cant say thus far.</li>
            <li>I use it on my under-eye area and the sensitive parts of my face.</li>
            <li>It does not leave my hair greasy just soft and silky.</li>
            <li>I hope the use of this product will become more common in this country.</li>
            <li>WOW</li>
            <li>all natural.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin with eczema, and I was hoping this would be helpful in alleviating the redness.</li>
            <li>I also put on drop on my lips each morning to keep them soft and moisturized.  </li>
            <li>It also leaves my curls feeling soft and bouncy.</li>
            <li>My skin is so soft, and I wish I had found it sooner.</li>
            <li>It makes my hair so soft and shiny.</li>

            <li>it make my hair soft, and my face</li>
            <li>I am 79 years old and still struggling with keeping my skin supple.  </li>
            <li>It is a natural alternative to hair serums.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s weightless, and leaves my skin feeling soft and non greasy.</li>
            <li>It leaves my hair feeling soft and even gives my hair a bounce.</li>
            <li>in all I thus far have had no problems and I like the way it makes my face feel.</li>
            <li>but this product has really improved the overall condition of my skin.</li>
            <li>So far using on face and hair and it absorbs well.</li>
            <li>If you are putting off trying this product, you will be very grateful when you finally give it a try.  </li>
            <li>It leaves my skin feeling soft and hydrated, not greasy.  </li>
            <li>Was unsure how it would do on my skin, as it is sensitive.</li>
            <li>I heat style my hair nearly every day.  </li>
            <li>that it&#x27;s completely natural and there are no chemicals added.</li>
            <li>Soft and glowy.</li>
            <li>I enjoy the way it makes my skin feels and when applied to my hair it gives it shine and softness without the heavy greasy look</li>
            <li>It leaves my hair so soft and shiny.</li>

            <li>and my flaking has become nearly nonexistent!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I put it directly on my skin</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know yet, if it&#x27;s helped decrease my natural oil production.</li>
            <li>It can leave your hair so soft and shiny.</li>
            <li>I only noticed it when applying the oil to my face, but I really didn&#x27;t smell anything when using it in my hair.</li>
            <li>By morning, my hair is soft and completely manageable.</li>
            <li>I use it every night before bed and it my skin feels soft when I wake up.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve bought 2 bottles of this so far.</li>
            <li>So, at our first long stop, I ordered this, as it specifically states it is for hair, skin, and nails.  </li>
            <li>Afterwards, I couldn&#x27;t believe how soft (not oily)</li>
            <li>However, I avoid my mouth, chine, and hairline as it will cause breakouts if you have naturally oily skin.</li>
            <li>I like the oil so far.</li>
            <li>but so far I can say that it is not greasy</li>
            <li>I tried over 5 different kinds of intense lotion, but I think it has to be oil.</li>
            <li>The scent is so soft that it is almost imperseptible.</li>
            <li>So far, I have no problems with this oil.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>for all skin types from sensitive skin to even acne prone skin&lt;br /&gt;What</li>
            <li>You can use your finger tips to get to the areas around your eyes by using a soft patting motion.</li>
            <li>And I&#x27;ve used it on my nails, face and hair so far and like all the results.</li>
            <li>Overall, I would highly recommend this product as a treatment for skin and nails!</li>
            <li>I use a tiny bit on my face and rub some into my hair just after a shower, makes it really shine.  </li>
            <li>And my face feels so soft.  </li>
            <li>ABSORBS QUICKLY, SOFT SKIN, THANK YOU</li>
            <li>I have naturally curly hair</li>
            <li>It absorbs into my skin and hair making it look soft and moisturized.</li>
            <li>This smelled perhaps old.</li>
            <li>For me this did not work as I developed an irritation on the skin at the outer edge of my eyes.  </li>
            <li>It can leave your hair so soft and shiny.</li>
            <li>The stubborn blackheads on my nose and forehead are GONE, which is a complete shocker.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s taming my split ends and making my hair shiny and soft.</li>
            <li>Leaves both hair and skin moisturized and silky soft.  </li>
            <li>Has my hair soft and manageable.</li>
            <li>So far it&#x27;s been a couple of weeks and</li>
            <li>I was pleasantly surprised.</li>
            <li>It not only works for me, but my whole family.</li>
            <li>This oil is a concentrated formula and natural.</li>
            <li>Works really well when mixed with Frankensense, Lavender and Peppermint  for stress and headaches.</li>
            <li>After blow drying my hair I immediately noticed how soft and shiny my hair was.</li>
            <li>My hair really needed the extra boost and this product has helped it a lot.</li>
            <li>but, since using this oil it leaves a soft feeling and I can run my fingers through my hair easier.</li>
            <li>I have never had anything make my hair feel so soft.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m transitioning to natural products.</li>
            <li>I love it in just a few short uses.</li>
            <li>I love it and it only takes a few drops.&lt;br</li>
            <li>No unpleasant smell as with other products purchased and returned.</li>
            <li>As I mentioned earlier, I have been using other Argon Oil products on my hair that I picked up at my local store and have been satisfied with the results.  </li>
            <li>This little bottle is some powerful stuff!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not first cold pressed, but it&#x27;s organic, and seems to be an excellent quality.</li>
            <li>free to check out my other reviews as I am getting around to reviewing all my essential oils (which is a lot).</li>
            <li>I have used a lot of others in the past and they always seem to be a little too heavy, but this one is perfect!</li>
            <li>No staining, love the smell and a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li>And now I am so confused as the new  bottle has very light scent...</li>
            <li>I originally bought it for my hair because it has been so dry and the Argan Oil has made my scalp not so dry and my hair soft.</li>
            <li>This is a nutrient-rich moisturizer chock full of fatty acids, vitamin E, and natural anti-oxidants.</li>
            <li>It has so many uses and you only need a small amout so it lasts forever.  </li>
            <li>I rubbed it into my cuticles with only 1 drop on the first nail which was enough to rub onto all five fingers of that hand.</li>
            <li>I dried my hair as I usually do and LOVED the texture and the shine.</li>
            <li>my verdict will be that the oil is good( not excellent) if you are not prone to acne and don&#x27;t expect wonders on your skin in a very near future.</li>
            <li>I love this stuff, I have curly hair and sometime it gets to looking a little dry</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had really dry, red, and sensitive skin around my eyes that no moisturizer has ever been able to correct but a few weeks of applying this argan oil around my eyes and my skin is now functioning normally.</li>
            <li>This product is definitely a quality product for any purpose other than if you want to use it on very fine hair when it is dry, not wet.  </li>
            <li>This wonderful product has eliminated my need for any other conditioners, which worked poorly as well as weighing my hair down.</li>
            <li>and they were jealous on how cheap, half the cost they paid, for similar product.</li>
            <li>Have also used a couple drops on shampooed hair, both towel dried and blown dry - hair is shinier, smoother, and more manageable either way.  </li>
            <li>No more flakes and my hair feels smooth and shiny.</li>
            <li>I really haven&#x27;t used this product long enough to review but what I find so far is a product that keeps my 60 year young skin soft.</li>
            <li>Exactly as described and expected.</li>
            <li>and what a difference my hair actually looks normal again .</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t believe people spend $50 or more on argan oil from other companies when this foxbrim argan is the exact same quality if not better.</li>
            <li>I am also trying it on my hair, my thoughts are that its no more effective than other oil treatments I have tried.</li>
            <li>Sure enough, it&#x27;s as if it brings dead looking hair back to life!  </li>
            <li>I do not like it as well as the more expensive one that I bought before because it seems to make my hair more oily in appearance than the other brand (I&#x27;ve also left a review for that one if you want to know what brand it was)</li>
            <li>Added three drops of NOW Essential Oils 100% Pure Peppermint (I bought at Amazon) and vigorously mixed, let set overnight</li>
            <li>I also mix this with tea tree oil, &amp; together it has definitely stimulated new growth all over.</li>
            <li>She has very long hair while mine is much shorter</li>
            <li>I bought this for my Hair and it works really well to moisturize my hair, which is very very long.</li>
            <li>My scalp gets very oily but my ends are dry and will split.</li>
            <li>and I do notice that my hair is not as dry and very moisturized.</li>
            <li>It really helps condition his dry course hair.</li>
            <li>Very helpful for dry winter skin on face and hands.</li>
            <li>My hair is really dry and frizzy and its helped so much.</li>
            <li>you have really frizzy hair or even just dry hair</li>
            <li>Within days, my dry cracked heels softened and my skin became much smoother.  </li>
            <li>you have really frizzy hair or even just dry hair</li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t purchase this again, it&#x27;s too expensive for an over refined argan oil, (I&#x27;d pay more though for the real thing and will)</li>
            <li>Using with peptide complex from the same company and my skin is noticably improving. :)</li>
            <li>My hair is thick and frizzes easily.</li>
            <li>I have a super oily T-zone, and using a few drops of argan oil as a day moisturizer (and under makeup) has regulated my spastic sebum.</li>
            <li>i said earlier i have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li>After purchasing this product I have decided to forego any facial moisturizers which usually contain a combination of ingredients the effectiveness of which is questionable at best.</li>
            <li>Upon first use I noticed that it does not have a smell, and it washes off of my hands unlike other oil products I use.</li>
            <li>I have no regrets!</li>
            <li>No other compensation was received.</li>
            <li>I had two areas of slight dryness on my face, and after two days the dryness just peeled right off.  </li>
            <li>Rich in Vitamin E, Essential Fatty Acids, and Proteins, Argan Oil helps fight lines and  repair imperfections.</li>
            <li>Even though it can be a little pricey, in my opinion it is worth it.</li>
            <li>I even enjoy it in my hair, a little goes a long way</li>
            <li>This was a moderately priced option and seemed to have all the important things the high priced ones do- exact same ingredient list of only pure argan oil, organic, cold pressed, and no synthetics in process or ingredient.</li>
            <li>I hope not because I generally won&#x27;t use scented products on my face.&lt;br</li>
            <li>and I was looking for something that would constantly moisturize and keep my skin that way for long without too much greasy feeling .</li>
            <li>It soothed his skin, made him beard soft and shiny and made the skin feel moisturized, Now he would like to take it for over from me on a regular basis :</li>
            <li>and I would recommend it to anyone especially to people that have sensitive skin because it is soothing to the skin and even on all skin types.</li>
            <li>Using 3 drops of this oil as a facial moisturizer morning and night has eliminated my blackheads completely.</li>
            <li>I notice a lot of direct sales selling similar product anymore.</li>
            <li>Sometimes I&#x27;m too busy (3 toddlers) and skip using conditioner step, but later uses this</li>
            <li>Then I see supple skin with natural glow next morning.</li>
            <li>I have completely stopped using cream moisturizer and only use oil.</li>
            <li>Such lightweight moisturizer,my skin feels soft and hydrated,never oily.</li>
            <li>Too early to tell if there&#x27;s an effect on my nails yet but definitely notice an increase in softness.</li>
            <li>Argan Oil is entirely plant based and natural.</li>
            <li>expected something much thinner than this, and when used by itself it doesn&#x27;t spread well.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I was surprised to find a product that actually met it&#x27;s claims.</li>
            <li>I now have barely any break-outs</li>
            <li>I have some face and hair plans for the near future for myself.</li>
            <li>I try to use all natural as much as possible.</li>
            <li>My combination skin feels soft after use; my heavily-dyed hair is still in the works for noticeable repair, but it&#x27;s been providing a lasting boost to help the frizz!</li>
            <li>It totally absorbs into your hair and leaves it soft and shiney.</li>
            <li>I have never had such soft and glowing skin in all my life.</li>
            <li>normally use organic extra virgin coconut oil and Watts brand retinol + hyaluaronic acid on my face, but adding this argan oil to my regimen has totally boosted the results, and therefore, changed my skin.</li>
            <li>Argan oil has kind of a weird smell</li>
            <li>I will be leaving thus behind, as our friends might use it on their dog&#x27;s coat if the vet says it is OK.  </li>
            <li>and I love to wash my face, tone and put a thin layer on my face before bed.</li>
            <li>Winter tends to be harsh on my skin, but Foxbrim&#x27;s Argan oil kept my skin looking dewy and fresh.</li>
            <li>Winter tends to be harsh on my skin, but Foxbrim&#x27;s Argan oil kept my skin looking dewy and fresh.</li>
            <li>: I use this as a leave in, and I use only 2-3 drops through my whole hair, which is long, while it is damp but not soaking and not dry.</li>
            <li>Knowing how much it takes, this bottle will last for a long time!</li>
            <li>To finish, I blow dry my hair, if I choose to do so; the whole day, my hair and face look terrific; coworkers have noticed and complimented on my make up, but it is not the make up, but the way the make up shows over the face rubbed with Argan oil.</li>
            <li>I use it everywhere on my skin, really helped my husband&#x27;s extra dry skin from diabetes.  </li>
            <li>(I have thick fine hair, my friend said it makes thinner hair a bit greasy so only use 1 drop if you have thinner hair)</li>
            <li>If you have other ingredients in your argan oil, then you really aren&#x27;t getting what you pay for.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very lightweight and doesn&#x27;t make my hair feel greasy afterward, like other products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>One other thing I learned, if you mix it in your conditioner, without the spray, it works really really well too.</li>
            <li>One long discolored nail has been restored to its natural color!</li>
            <li>use to have dull, not really shiney or healthy looking hair.</li>
            <li>This Argan Oil does not leave a greasy or oily feeling on my face like some Argan Oils or moisturizers and it only takes a couple drops for the whole face, which means, this bottle will last a very long time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>My hair is wavy to slightly curly and is super dry and frizzy so using this as a leave</li>
            <li>I also use a few drops with a heavy duty moisturizer on my feet and it helps the moisturizer absorb a lot better.</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin and was wary about trying it, but my skin has never been so soft and smooth and</li>
            <li>I can tell this is pure because it comes in a dark colored glass bottle rather than plastic.</li>
            <li>One of the things to look for when purchasing pure Argan Oil is a dark bottle.</li>
            <li>The first tanning session burned the belly are a little.</li>
            <li>The scent is a little like nuts at first, but then dissipates to no scent at all.  </li>
            <li>have very long hair that can be rather coarse, so I put about five drops into my hand, rub it into my other hand, and then apply it to the ends and bottom half of my outer layers toward the top of my head.</li>
            <li>I apply argan oil right after I washed my hair, rub few drops at the end of the hair and while there are still some oil left massage the scalp.</li>
            <li>So far we&#x27;ve been using this on my daughter&#x27;s long, curly hair.</li>
            <li>,i was scared to apply on my skin for the first few days..</li>
            <li>We&#x27;ve tried all kinds of remedies in the past, without much success.</li>
            <li>First I tried just rubbing a few drops in my palm and smoothing it onto my hair.</li>
            <li>New Mexico is a very dry state.</li>
            <li>I really like that it doesn&#x27;t weigh my hair down or make my face feel greasy (like the others I have used)</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s capable of dissolving all kinds of dirt and oil from your skin and washing it down the drain.</li>
            <li>The oil is exactly the same, yields the same results, and costs much, much less.</li>
            <li>This time of year I get really dry hands, so I have been using it around my cuticles to prevent hangnails and not only is my fingers and hands soft - my nails seem to be growing out faster and stronger!</li>
            <li>I have dry sensitive skin</li>
            <li>This cold-pressed oil, sourced directly from Morocco, is liquid gold for all your dry hair, skin, and nail needs.  </li>
            <li>About once a month I put the Argan oil directly on my ends of my dry hair and let it sit for a about 30 minutes before washing it out.  </li>
            <li>My hair is so soft once dry.  </li>
            <li>I have sensitive, fairly dry skin on my face.</li>
            <li>I used this and after the first few days I could see a big difference.</li>
            <li>I recently color treated my hair for the first time ever and it really dried it out.  </li>
            <li>I have to lather my hair few more time than usual to wash out oil from my hair.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Got it for nails and used several times a day the first few weeks.  </li>
            <li>It has the right consistency and a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li>I just wash it out the next day because it will weigh your hair down after a while of if you use too much.</li>
            <li>My hair is less frizzy, soft and easier to work with, my nails are growing fast and not braking, my skin isnt dry anymore, especially on my face and it has soothed and helped my stretch marks from having my baby boy</li>
            <li>I am a 28 year old African/Irish American with extremely dry skin and hair  (4A).  </li>
            <li>Little bit of argan oil can do whole lot.</li>
            <li>I was a little hesitant but because it was so reasonable, I figured I would give it a try.</li>
            <li>too little product too much money  will try to find wholesale</li>
            <li>Everyone does it a little differently but the way we use it is to rub a liberal amount into our hair the night before we plan on shampooing and pop on a scarf and sleep on it to really give it time to absorb.</li>
            <li>The high rating for this product fancied me to buy this, but frankly after couple of months regular usage , i should say that its not worth all the praises and standing ovation.</li>
            <li>Reading some of the other reviews and responses I have to wonder if the lack of a scent means that it is less than fresh, though...</li>
            <li>I live in the desert and dry hair is a constant problem along with dry skin.</li>
            <li>Surprisingly, this product is not too bad.</li>

            <li> great product, just starred to discover all the uses for it, but 1 amazing thing the maker sent me an emailing telling me all about the product and how to use always info to contact them with questions.</li>
            <li> Great quality and great cost performance, I just love it.  </li>
            <li> Great product - great transaction...VERY pleased</li>

            <li> , real quick, I just wanted to add that this seller was incredibly courteous, and the quality/quantity/price of the product is excellent</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s good for everywhere</li>
            <li> Smells good</li>
            <li> and when you refine argan oil all the good stuff that helps with your skin and hair gets ruined.</li>
            <li> I received this at a reduced price for a fair review &amp; I will be shopping this company again.  </li>
            <li> The dropper is great because this oil can effectively be used quite sparingly.</li>
            <li> I loved reviewing this product</li>
            <li> What is Argan Oil good for?</li>
            <li> This stuff is soooooo good.</li>
            <li> this does a good job separating the hair for an easier brush-through.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Feels really good.</li>
            <li> This brand is a good one.</li>
            <li> and she loved it,</li>
            <li> Feels good anywhere.</li>

            <li> It&#x27;s good</li>
            <li> A good product.</li>

            <li> this this brand is just as good as the others.</li>
            <li> it feel&#x27;s good..</li>
            <li> not as good as it was made out to be.</li>

            <li> Keep up your good work.  </li>
            <li> decided to try it on my son&#x27;s eczema spots since it is a good moisturizer, but it also says it is good for reliving redness and reducing inflammation.</li>
            <li> Superior quality argan oil.</li>
            <li> “Foxbrim Organic Argan Oil” worked good</li>

            <li> I love this product, best quality,, best price, ...wouldn&#x27;t buy any other one!!</li>
            <li> fantastic stuff really works good on my hair excellent moisturizer.</li>
            <li> So, very FAST shipping, which i LOVED!</li>
            <li> So you can save yourselves the headache and lost of searching for anything better than what you have here that has already been proven to be among the best, real brands of argan oil out there in a crowded oil market.</li>
            <li> The 1st bottle had a very strong smell (even though i didnt like it)</li>
            <li> Love, Love this product!</li>
            <li> My skin is more hydrated and even my skin tone looks better!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s left my skim feeling great, and it smells good too!</li>
            <li> For years a good moisturizer was fine, now I need something stronger and more effective.  </li>
            <li> Argan oil is an amazing product that has so many healing properties for all parts of your body, it&#x27;s almost a</li>
            <li> Loved the light ungreasy feeling of Argan Oil to use on my hair face and nails.</li>
            <li> I am very happy with this product so far.  </li>
            <li> but this one seems to be the best I have used so far.</li>
            <li> Moisture is the most important thing I have found the keeps my skin happy and mostly acne-free.</li>
            <li> I love the fact that when you put it in your hands it feels warm</li>
            <li> It is one of my favorite carrier oils because it absorbs so well and it nice on the face and doesn&#x27;t cause break</li>
            <li> Has so many uses and works amazing</li>
            <li> Product comes with an eye dropper, but I found putting a spray bottle top from one of my travel bottles fit great and delivered the product better for my hair.</li>
            <li> I put it directly on my skin and my skin feels wonderful.</li>
            <li> Additionally, Foxbrim is cruelty free and organic, so you can feel good about buying this</li>
            <li> But so far, I have been very happy with it.</li>
            <li> It feels more sturdy and kind of makes it feel fancier, if that makes sense.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s definitely worth the price,  works great</li>
            <li> your arms and legs it just moisturizes and leaves that nice healthy glow.</li>
            <li> It seemed like a fairly nourishing but light oil for this purpose.</li>
            <li> It is the best, leaves the skin soft.  </li>
            <li> what an amazing product, i love it</li>
            <li> Wow, this oil is wonderful.  </li>
            <li> I have been using it for nearly a month and my skin is softer, feels great, and no breakouts!!</li>
            <li> and like it but feel that the argan oil is a bit more effective in keeping skin hydrated and plumped without being greasy at all.</li>
            <li> It is so smooth and feels good going on.</li>
            <li> This is by far the best version of this product I have ever tried.</li>
            <li> I like how they have really nice quality oil for your hair (mostly).</li>
            <li> Applying this product on my damp hair for the first time I could feel the velvety texture return and reminded me of a very excellent hot oil treatment except it took no time!!  </li>
            <li> Applying this oil on my skin doesn&#x27;t feel as nice and easy as it does when I&#x27;m applying a creamy moisturizer, but it&#x27;s really nice knowing</li>
            <li> Love argan oil for my hair  excited to try it on skin!!</li>
            <li> Great for applying right before I shave.</li>
            <li> Love love love this product!</li>
            <li> I used this oil to mix with Shea butter and carrot seed oil  to make a moisturizer for my face and it is so rich and feels so good.  </li>
            <li> Its a mild smell, but I don&#x27;t find it pleasant.  </li>
            <li> Not only is it my go-to pre-shave, but it also doubles as a great moisturizer that gives the skin a great feel and helps eliminate dryness and oiliness.  </li>
            <li> it was so nice to get a follow up email to make sure I enjoyed it, or if there was any issues.</li>
            <li> Received my oil very quickly and love it!  </li>
            <li> My hair looks much healthier and has a beautiful shine.  </li>
            <li> I rarely write reviews but this stuff is amazing for your skin!</li>
            <li> The claims seemed too good to be true.  </li>
            <li> and I think it&#x27;s very light</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very light and doesn&#x27;t leave my hair or skin feeling overly greasy.  </li>
            <li> Just recieved my Argan oil and it has a very light scent but not over bearing.</li>
            <li> It is a very light nutty smell, but again it is hair to notice.</li>
            <li> Fantastic product; I love it!</li>
            <li> This Argan oil is amazing, helps for dry skin and hair and also works great as a beard oil!!!  </li>

            <li> I have really dry cuticles and with just one day of use they are close to being perfect.</li>

            <li> Use it for my face, it feels light and once it dries isn&#x27;t oily.</li>
            <li> I have used Organic Argan Oil for to reduce frizz and dryness of my hair recently and its results were great</li>
            <li> The bottle comes with an eye dropper type thing, fill that baby up, then squeeze it into the bottle you just filled with water.</li>
            <li> this one from Foxbrim makes a great choice not only because it&#x27;s made with Certified Organic Argan Oil, NO additives parabens, silicones fillers or fragrances but</li>

            <li> Foxbrim, I wanna thank you so much for your amazing products.</li>
            <li> You are so thoughtful when making your products and packaging for them.</li>

            <li> The 2nd one doesn&#x27;t work (even in this spring) as great as the 1st one did in winter.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>

            <li> I had been hearing about the virtues of Argan oil for some time and was pleased to find that it really does work!  </li>
            <li> I am a huge fan of argan oil and can’t say enough good about argan oil.</li>
            <li> Pat it on your face and let the water/steam seep into your pores and clean dat oil out ur</li>
            <li> and I’ve seen great improvement that my skin; my skin is not as dry as it was before.</li>
            <li> whoa my skin greatly improved, the dry patches disappeared.</li>
            <li> have used it on my hair, lips and dry skin, it feels great, and the smallest amount, just a couple drops is all thats needed.</li>
            <li> I am learning that natural and simple can sometimes be the best.</li>
            <li> A present that was delivered on time, nicely wrapped and much enjoyed.  </li>
            <li> It is great for dry and flaky legs and feet.  </li>
            <li> It also works great on dry patches of skin.</li>
            <li> When I use it my hair still feels clean and not oily or greasy at all.</li>
            <li> Great results with my itchy scalp and dry fingernails.</li>
            <li> Aside from the nutty smell, which quickly goes away, this product is fantastic.  </li>
            <li> i love how soft and healthy it leaves my hair.</li>
            <li> It works great for my dry hair.</li>
            <li> There is a light earthy,sweet smell that dissipates quickly.</li>
            <li> It makes mixing the Argan Oil very easy,  particularly with shampoos, conditioners.</li>
            <li> Dries naturally with healthy shine!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m preparing to buy another bottle, for it is more cost effective, both monetarily and healthy wise, to  use Argan oil instead of any other type of facial or hair care product.</li>
            <li> I use argan oil on my face and hair and its such a great way to hydrate your skin and keep it looking healthy, bring back that healthy glow we all want.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also GREAT for HAIR and dry skin!  </li>
            <li> Absorbed into Skin&lt;br /&gt;Repairs and Replenishes your skin&#x27;s moisture allowing fine lines/wrinkles to diminish&lt;br /&gt;Safe</li>
            <li> So, I was very excited to see that this was absorbed right away in to the skin of my son and cleared up that dryness.</li>
            <li> I love argan oil, but had never tried it in it&#x27;s pure form.</li>
            <li> I always make sure it&#x27;s pure and not diluted by anything.</li>
            <li> One of the most versatile oils in my opinion is Foxbrim’s 100% Pure Argan Oil.  </li>
            <li> I am a PhD organic chemist and I love the sense of pure organic oils.</li>
            <li> I love that it is 100% pure but still bottled in the US.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m confident it is pure</li>
            <li> I love the pure Argan Oil for my face as it does seem to soften the lines of time.  </li>
            <li> specially for what it has done for my hair alone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> love using Foxbrim’s Pure Organic Argan Oil.</li>
            <li> Lovely 100% Pure Argan Oil.  </li>
            <li> Works great for very dry skin.</li>
            <li> We are at the tale end of the winter eczema season for my kids, so this is really nothing, but I thought it was the perfect small spot to test out to make sure that they didn&#x27;t feel anything because believe it or not there have been different eczema creams that sting my kids although the interesting thing is that what stings one is the best eczema cream for the other and vice versa.</li>
            <li> Where the differences are at between a good high quality argan and a lesser argan is in the very things that make argan superior to olive for the skin and hair.</li>
            <li> Works great for rough patches on skin.</li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t need much, and you&#x27;ll love the results.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a blogger that states my true opinion.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t say enough good things about it.</li>
            <li> I am really liking how my neck looks better.</li>
            <li> overall it is a really good products and works well on my face.</li>
            <li> but I need more time to see if it will really help.  </li>
            <li> so don&#x27;t know full benefits as yet</li>

            <li> product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Before purchasing Foxbrim, I bought a a more high profile brand of argan oil that tends to go for $48 for 1.7oz.</li>
            <li> We couldn&#x27;t recommend it more highly</li>
            <li> even the most $$$ high dollar Dermatologist prescribed products that I have used.  </li>
            <li> , it actually soaks right in, smells and feels good</li>
            <li> just soaks right in, feels clean.  </li>
            <li> I have been wanting to try Argan Oil for awhile and can&#x27;t believe I got such a super deal!!!</li>
            <li> So I’ve been very interested in it.</li>
            <li> It applies pretty smoothly and doesn&#x27;t leave a greasy film on my skin.</li>
            <li> so I was interested in trying this product free* to review.</li>
            <li> Very pleased with initial use of Argan products.  </li>
            <li> Pure formula and easy to use because of the dropper.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s good for cuticles &amp; patchy dry skin too.  </li>
            <li> The fact that it comes in dark bottle ensures that it filters out the suns ultra-violet light is good because it ensures the oil won&#x27;t lose</li>
            <li> Works good on dry skin leaves a smoother feeling texture and look.</li>
            <li> You can also use it on your nails to strengthen your nails and soften your cuticles, it’s also good for dry, cracked hands.</li>
            <li> It goes on easy and it doesn&#x27;t take much.  </li>
            <li> Most argan oils I’ve used are pretty much scentless and while this one says there is no scent, I do detect a sort of citrusy smell.</li>
            <li> It is not greasy and is absorbed quickly into the skin.  </li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this product!!!  </li>
            <li> I used this as a pre-wash deep conditioning treatment and my has never felt or looked better!</li>

            <li> The oil is a very light color and crystal clear (it should be cloudy)</li>
            <li> The price is right and it arrives quickly.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure about A.O. but heard so much about it and read reviews of this company and they were quite positive</li>

            <li> It&#x27;s very light and adds a good deal of shine to my natural curly hair, that is normally very dry.</li>

            <li> It is definitely useful in your life.</li>
            <li> The first time I used it I took two full droppers and applied that to my hair.  </li>
            <li> The oil is not greasy, it is absorbed into your skin upon contact.  </li>
            <li> When there are so many natural formula can choice why chemicals.</li>
            <li> Feels good and really helps my facial skin....</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t buy all through amazon, some were purchased from the sellers website, so I may not show up as a verified reviewer on some, but I am only reviewing products I own and have tried.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s worth every penny.</li>
            <li> and I think that it is worth a try.</li>
            <li> Makes skin feel soft and healthy.</li>
            <li> The owner told me to try adding this product to freshly washed hair too</li>

            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Would&#x27;ve been nice if I only had to use 3 drops, but it comes as described and</li>
            <li> I love this stuff makes my skin so soft and absorbs well</li>
            <li> It is so silky, soft , shines and looks so much better.</li>

            <li> I love how soft it makes your hair feel</li>
            <li> Fox Brim has an extensive line of beauty products to which they have given me the product complimentary for my 100% honest opinion in regards to how it works for me.  </li>
            <li> and  I found that I had to use much more than the recommended few drops for it to be effective.</li>
            <li> I rec this in exc for my own personal review</li>
            <li> /&gt;Disclosure: I received a complimentary product to facilitate my review.</li>
            <li> This oil works great and offers similar results.</li>
            <li> I love it because it is 100% natural and absorbs right away in to your skin and hair.</li>
            <li> of my favorite uses for Agan Oil is using it as a hair treatment on the ends of my hair right after I get out of the shower, it tames my frizzies and leaves my hair feeling soft &amp; silky.  </li>
            <li> I am very very pleased with this product and can&#x27;t wait to see what it will do for my dry hair.</li>
            <li> I was using a more expensive product that has a model&#x27;s name attached to it but found that this is just as good!  </li>
            <li> Dropper could work better but other than that, I love it.</li>
            <li> It is an awesome moisturizing agent even if used in conjunction with other facial or body lotions</li>
            <li> It feels so clean and pure.  </li>
            <li> I have used it a few times and it is very nice oil.</li>
            <li> I even use this on my hair when I can not style it the right way and it helps me tame my fly a ways.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Honestly i would go for Extra virgin coconut oil which is very light, get absorbed quickly and gives you a feeling of being moisturized while not giving any greasy experiences.</li>
            <li> I think it is partly due to Foxbrim&#x27;s superior customer service and request for a follow up.</li>

            <li> This oil is light and goes on easily during my morning/evening facial routines.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s no exaggeration that my crow&#x27;s feet have diminished greatly over the past year.  </li>

            <li> but I can say my skin feels very much softer</li>

            <li> I love that it is organic and free from parabens and other harmful chemicals.  </li>
            <li> Just a few drops on freshly washed hair makes it shine and feel wonderful when dry.  </li>

            <li> and it thanks you so much!!</li>
            <li> The main natural phenols in argan oil are caffeic acid, oleuropein, vanillic acid, tyrosol, catechol, resorcinol, (−)-epicatechin and (+)-catechin are rich in nutrients and flavor rich constituents.</li>
            <li> It has hardly any &amp;#34;smell&amp;#34; which is great, compared to using coconut oil.</li>
            <li> However, and it is a huge &amp;#34;however,&amp;#34; my nails are so soft, they are peeling away.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t trigger my eczema which was huge to me since I tend to be a bit sensitive.</li>
            <li> It leaves my hands feeling smooth and it makes my hair feel silky and soft.</li>
            <li> but after trying it on my entire face, I noticed that my skin felt smooth and nourished like never before!</li>
            <li> At the health food stores-you get 1 ounce &amp; no dropper at a much higher price.  </li>

            <li> and we wear it under our foundation (made by the well-known cosmetic company), and we get a very dewy, fresh look.  </li>
            <li> fast shipping too!</li>

            <li> It is exactly what it says it is.</li>
            <li> I am trying to grow it out, so keeping that length, which is the oldest part of all my hair, healthy and moisturized is a big part of my hair care routine.  </li>
            <li> Like any reputable brand of argan oil, this is the only ingredient you should find in your bottle.</li>
            <li> Exactly as described.</li>
            <li> I have never written a review until now, but this product absolutely deserves 5 stars!</li>
            <li> This is the first time I have purchased Argan Oil.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried many different brands of Argan oil</li>
            <li> It is clear, and the scent is light.</li>
            <li> It works exactly how I wanted it to.</li>
            <li> It makes my hair and skin smooth and soft.</li>
            <li> My hair is silky smooth, soft, and has no fly-aways.</li>
            <li> this is a big bottle with a dropper, which are my favorite.</li>
            <li> I realize that at my age it is not possible to erase all the years etched on my face for many years</li>
            <li> premium light weight soft oil with no additives, no fillers, no fragrances, and no silicones.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s light, non-oily feeling, and thankfully nearly unscented.  </li>
            <li> - Thank you so much Foxbrim !</li>
            <li> It was absorbed fast by skin.</li>
            <li> Granted that when I put a drop of the oil on top of the hand, I can&#x27;t smell the odor unless I actually put my hand to the nose.</li>
            <li> Not only will you see healthy, shiny hair</li>
            <li> I will definitively be back for more</li>
            <li> Argan Oil is not called &amp;#34;liquid gold&amp;#34; just because of the soft golden color of the oil, it&#x27;s also because this all natural oil has so many hair &amp; skincare benefits.  </li>
            <li> When I was first introduced to Argan Oil</li>
            <li> There are so many uses for this product - I will definitely order again.</li>
            <li> My skin felt soft and smooth - another plus is that the Argan Oil soaked in immediately and wasn&#x27;t oily at all.</li>
            <li> but I’ll definitely be being more when I need it.</li>
            <li> ;)</li>
            <li> I use it for so many things such as moisturizer my skin, cuticles, and hair.  </li>
            <li> First, I would like to thank Argan Oil Co for try their Argan Oil.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m preparing to purchase 1 or 2 more bottles because this one suddenly disappeared when my daughter visited.</li>
            <li> The shipment was really fast!</li>
            <li> Works well on my nails too, which is why I bought it in the first place.</li>
            <li> five very shiny, golden stars.</li>
            <li> and this is the first product that I have ever used that did not cause even the smallest breakout.  </li>
            <li> I am using it for my hair and for my personal skin care products and the texture is lovely.</li>
            <li> This is my first time using the Argan Oil for my face.</li>
            <li> I read about Argan oil and purchased a bottle for her and after the first use or two you could see a definitive difference.</li>
            <li> But TODAY I&#x27;m ordering the one I should have ordered in the first place.  </li>
            <li> First, the bottle is devine.</li>
            <li> My hands are so smooth and soft now.  </li>
            <li> It was my first time buying it.</li>
            <li> So many different uses!!</li>
            <li> This is my first time using an argan oil product</li>
            <li> Really like this product!</li>
            <li> Thanks!  </li>
            <li> This is my first experience with this product and I foresee a reorder in the coming months.  </li>
            <li> That dark bottle is great for preserving the natural oil.</li>
            <li> I really like this Argan oil!</li>
            <li> :) I will definitely buy it again and continue to use it on a routine basis.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s exactly what she wanted.</li>
            <li> Argan oil can be used in so many different ways.  </li>
            <li> This is a first time product for me</li>
            <li> I really have rarely had anything that has worked this well.</li>
            <li> It leaves my skin so soft and smooth, and doesn&#x27;t clog my pores.</li>
            <li> I instantly fell in love.</li>
            <li> I am red headed and have many freckles...</li>
            <li> My skin is more even toned and the pores seem to be getting smaller.  </li>
            <li> It absorbed fast on the skin and not greasy at all.</li>
            <li> makes my hair so soft and frizz free</li>
            <li> Great for the hair, just a few drops is enough to make shine and smooth.</li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> although this one smells exactly the same, and I am sure it is also 100% organic Argan oil just like the first one I purchased.  </li>
            <li> It only takes a couple of drops to smooth my hair!</li>
            <li> I also have another oil-free facial moisturizer which had too many exfoliating ingredients in it</li>
            <li> Just a few drops leaves my skin with a dewy, gorgeous glow.</li>
            <li> Works great on your face also as a moisturizer instead of your regular cream one if you have really dry skin there, too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Works great on your face also as a moisturizer instead of your regular cream one if you have really dry skin there, too.</li>
            <li> The oil goes on light, absorbs quickly and moisturized for several hours.</li>
            <li> She has been using this for a couple of weeks and wow!!!!</li>
            <li> I love this oil, I mix it with rosehip oil and other essential oils to make my own custom skincare blend.</li>
            <li> Try using it right after a shower/bath so that you really lock in the moisture.</li>
            <li> Try using it right after a shower/bath so that you really lock in the moisture.</li>
            <li> I use it in my hair and it&#x27;s been looking very healthy and shiny; a lot less frizzy too.</li>
            <li> It is perfectly clear and rubs in without any residue, unlike some of the very popular, super moisturizing, heavy lotions on the market!  </li>
            <li> I can easily just add the essential oils I want right to the bottle and then use as a moisturizer.</li>
            <li> This is my first experience with Argan oil and it extremely positive.</li>
            <li> 100% Pure Certified Organic Argan Oil  makes my skin feel so soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> I have been using the argan oil (2 drops mixed with 1/2 my normal squeeze of face lotion) on my face for several weeks now and it has been great,</li>
            <li> /&gt;After comparing the two argan oil brands, I have come to the consensus that I will be purchasing Foxbrim from now on, rather than the other trendy brand I was purchasing.</li>
            <li> I really liked the tips this seller sent for other uses of argan oil.</li>
            <li> I like Foxbrim because it smells fresher than any other kind I&#x27;ve used and after being on my skin for a while there is no greasy feel.</li>
            <li> So far I really like how smooth it makes my skin feel.  </li>
            <li> I did a 4-week trial and did see a reduction in fine lines, to some even smoothing out and barely noticeable.</li>
            <li> My review is based on my experience with the product and/or brand, which may differ from yours.n fine lines, to some even smoothing out and barely noticeable.</li>
            <li> so after washing my hair with shampoo and conditioner,before blow drying i apply few drop on my hair concentrating more on rots,it leaves my hair smooth and silky,and works goo as a heat protectant  which is always a bonus .as</li>
            <li> After a few days, my skin is no longer flaky and my makeup goes on much more smoothly.  </li>
            <li> My overall review is a 4 out of 5 and is recommended by me for anyone who wants a healthy way and non-chemical way to moisturize their Hair, Body and Skin.</li>
            <li> Have used others that have been much more expensive, and believe me, this is just as good.  </li>
            <li> I am outside a lot and need moisturizing that is effective but not heavy.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m sure it is good but soooo expensive.</li>
            <li> This oil have many uses, I use it for shaving; my shavings using this oil are much, much smoother than with regular shaving</li>
            <li> If I do decide that the smell is gone that quickly, it should work fine for my dry feet/heels.  </li>
            <li> also enjoyed the sweet slightly nutty</li>
            <li> My wife loves this oil, very affordable and makes the hair very shiney!</li>
            <li> Not really anymore, not to mention, mixed with the vitamin c serums I use, I am basically pimple free, which is really nice.</li>
            <li> The smell did seem to go away pretty fast.  </li>
            <li> And this is a much heavier oil than the first one I used...</li>
            <li> 3 drops goes a long way. :)</li>
            <li> I recieved this super fast and it was very inexpensive with high quality.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also great for your hair, I have naturally curly hair and hair products generally leave my hair dry and damaged.</li>
            <li> This Argan Oil was easy to apply and helped relieve my dry skin right away.</li>
            <li> Super soft hair and skin with no clogged pores or greasy feel.</li>
            <li> It also very quickly healed a scar I had from a recent surgery.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t magically make wrinkles disappear, but my dry skin feels moister.</li>
            <li> as my hands are more dry..</li>
            <li> I used on my hair and it made it super soft and</li>
            <li> Nice change from typical over the counter products.</li>
            <li> combat dry skin, add a bit of Argan oil to your favorite lotion.  </li>
            <li> It does have a slight warm scent but it goes away in a couple minutes.</li>
            <li> It absorbs quickly and leaves my skin soft.  </li>
            <li> The oil makes my hair super soft and tames my hair on humid days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Good size bottle and should last us both a long time.</li>
            <li> Josie Maran&#x27;s Pure Argan Oil is somehow different, as my nails are wonderfully strong when I use it</li>
            <li> Our hair is looking shiny, healthy, moisturized and not dirty or weighed down.</li>
            <li> so I jumped at the chance to use the pure stuff.</li>
            <li> You just might need some Foxbrim 100% Pure Organic Argan Oil.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s 100% pure and</li>
            <li> BUT I started applying the oil to my face and EUREKA my large pores started shrinking.  </li>
            <li> Foxbrim makes a 100% Pure Argan Oil that is Certified Organic.  </li>
            <li> I will certainly buy it again.</li>
            <li> Rejuvenate skin with a pure, nourishing, organic oil pressed from the kernels of the argan tree, native to the desert of Morocco.</li>
            <li> and this is  100% Pure USDA Organic Argan Oil</li>
            <li> This product is 100% pure satisfaction.</li>
            <li> Pure Argan oil soaks into face, skin and nails.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s 100% pure.</li>
            <li> If this is 100 % pure Argan oil, then why the hell is kernel oil one of the ingredients?</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s just how pure argan oil smells.  </li>
            <li> I purchased Foxbrim 100% pure organic Argan Oil.</li>
            <li> after body scrub that 100% Pure Organic Argan Oil works miracle.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It’s a 100% Pure Organic Argan Oil</li>
            <li> Or maybe thats how 100% pure argan oil smells...</li>
            <li> It smells as argan oil should smell, I think it is definetly pure, since I have bought some that as not as pure, this one is.  </li>
            <li> I was introduced to pure Argan Oil during a &#x27;spa package&#x27; on a cruise.</li>
            <li> so this review is based purely off of her experiences with it.</li>
            <li> According to the label, you can also use the Foxbrim Certified Organic Pure Argan Oil on your hair, face, and nails.</li>
            <li> Everything about this 100% PURE ORGANIC ARGAN OIL is Amazing!!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> So you may be asking, what can I use Foxbrim 100% Pure Argan Oil for?</li>
            <li> It is pure and quite inexpensive.  </li>
            <li> I use this 100% pure argan oil on my face and in my hair.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve also been putting it on a large mole that I&#x27;ve had all my life along my jaw line.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it all my life and know that as a beauty product, a 100% pure oil, improves and maintains the beauty of skin and hair.</li>
            <li> Its pure organic.</li>
            <li> but I think I put a little too much, but it&#x27;s 100% pure and you can&#x27;t get better than that!</li>
            <li> A few drops worked into the hair or added to your favorite face cream yields results!</li>
            <li> Since I started applying Foxbrim every morning on my damp hair once it dried up I applied just a drop more and my hair looked super shinny, with my curl texture</li>
            <li> I use this oil for de-frizzing and conditioning fine, fragile hair--</li>
            <li> I have been using Argan Oil for a short time and my fine lines are fading.</li>
            <li> I use this Argan oil on my face -especially around my eyes and mouth where there are fine lines and wrinkles.  </li>
            <li> After receiving the Foxbrim 100% Argan Oil I was made aware that this product had so many other uses besides the hair.  </li>
            <li> time and especially if you address the problem areas, like around your eyes, fine lines, wrinkles, you will see an improvement with texture.</li>
            <li> This is a very high quality oil.  </li>
            <li> Argan oil, which is simply the oil of the nut of the argan tree, is a lot like olive oil in many ways and the less high quality argan oils are more like olive oil than the higher quality ones.</li>
            <li> 100% Pure and Organic making it a very lightweight oil.  </li>
            <li> Thanks to Foxbrim 100% pure organic argan oil</li>
            <li> The oil is smooth and light absorbing quickly and not feeling greasy in the least bit.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried many other brands, and none come close to having all the positive characteristics that real argan oil is most famous for,  other than the 2 brands I&#x27;ve had the best experience with, you own FOXBRIM, as well as the MOGADOR brands, though I prefer the Foxbrim brand simply because it&#x27;s cost less to get the same results as with any of other 100% certified all natural brands that actually what they say they are.   </li>
            <li> Soaks right into skin and leaves you so soft!</li>
            <li> So far so good a little change in my hair.</li>
            <li> It is super cheap compared to other oils I&#x27;ve looked at.</li>
            <li> and I really like it.  </li>
            <li> I really like this Argan oil.</li>

            <li> my skin feels very moisturized</li>

            <li> /&gt;It really moisturizes my feet and heels as well as my elbows.  </li>
            <li> Really like this product.  </li>
            <li> didn’t use this on my face, since my face is fickle with straight oils.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t see much difference there.</li>
            <li> I really like this argan oil.</li>
            <li> and I really like the product and the results.</li>

            <li> I especially like to use it to smooth my hair.  </li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this product and will purchase it again!</li>

            <li> so she warned me about being tempted to use too much.</li>
            <li> for a much, much lower price.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t remember ever using a product that made it all so much easier.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m getting ready for Spring and Summer by going to a tanning salon.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend!</li>

            <li> and I really like the effect it has had with my feet .</li>
            <li> This argan oil has made my hands and face so smooth and this is only after using for a couple of days.</li>
            <li> The product came in bubble wrap and in a padded package, so it was very well protected.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t see a whole lot difference except</li>

            <li> Argan Oil goes on very &amp;#34;clean&amp;#34; feeling, leaving your skin very refreshed.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> and I really like it.</li>
            <li> I have waist length, fairly straight hair and a pea sized amount leaves my hair clumpy and sticky.</li>
            <li> I can see  much added shine to my hair.</li>
            <li> In addition, I have found that it really works well on my fingers.  </li>
            <li> and this oil has really helped so much.</li>
            <li> Thanks</li>
            <li> One of the best things about it is that it doesn&#x27;t leave a thick residue on my hands and my hair is much more manageable after using only a few drops.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s reasonably priced.</li>
            <li> I got this for my wife and she is very please with it.</li>
            <li> It does work really well in both mine and my daughter&#x27;s hair though.</li>
            <li> It really does work wonders.  </li>
            <li> Foxbrim Argan Oil really does do wonders for your hair.</li>
            <li> I have heard so much about Argan Oil.</li>
            <li> and you can add as much as you like to get the result you want.</li>
            <li> Thanks for prompt shipping and delivery.</li>
            <li> I have been hearing so much about Argan  oil and wanted to try it.</li>
            <li> Fast delivery.</li>
            <li> Thank you so much</li>
            <li> I decided then, that i would just save ALOT of money, and order straight Argan Oil from a retailer.</li>
            <li> This stuff feels and smells like the real deal.</li>
            <li> Argan happens to be one of her very favorites.....</li>
            <li> but it is not known how much this amount is.</li>
            <li> My mid-60&#x27;s skin really needed some pick-up.  </li>
            <li> I had blotches and puffiness, being very susceptible to the summer sun and heat.  </li>
            <li> Feels so light-weighted and very supple.</li>
            <li> It works very well on my skin and hair without a greasy residue.</li>
            <li> It is much softer.</li>
            <li> I like the product and absolutely zero complaints about it.</li>
            <li> Thanks again.</li>
            <li> AND IT REALLY DOES THE TRICK.  </li>
            <li> I think it would work very well as an additive to your hair color, developer, or bleaching product to prevent damage.  </li>
            <li> after a week now my scars are really getting lighter...</li>
            <li> it really works...</li>
            <li> Thanks</li>
            <li> I tried mixing it with a bit of aloe vera gel which instantly creates a light weight moisturizer</li>
            <li> but it is very pricey.</li>
            <li> I have short, course, thick, naturally curly/frizzy hair, Argan oil infused products are perfect.  </li>
            <li> When I put the first dropper full in the palm of my hands, I thought, &amp;#34;Oh Brother!&amp;#34;, I&#x27;m going to be rubbing this into my skin for the next 20 minutes</li>
            <li> more deep lines have developed but by using this oil every night and morning, the lines are softened.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m still only 33 years old, but because I slather my face with these oils at night, I look better than I did when I was 23.</li>
            <li> Having soft supple skin is a very positive attribute to possess.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s OK but certainly not a miracle worker.</li>
            <li> and it is working as good, if not better, than anything else he has tried!  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried a few brands of Argan Oil recently because they have become very popular for skin care.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s good for dry ends on your hair, your dry skin, or cuticles.</li>
            <li> I had originally bought the Argan oil to moisturize my eye area in addition to my facial cream</li>
            <li> After application, I&#x27;m left with richly moisturized skin.</li>
            <li> Your hair will shine with a small dab of argan oil, and your hands will look better too!</li>
            <li> It actually does exactly what it&#x27;s described to do for both hair and skin, and even have that familiar roasted nutty scent, as natural !00</li>
            <li> Foxbrim Argan Oil absorbs better than other brands I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t use long enough to rate but so far so good.</li>
            <li> The next day my dry hair was so much better!  </li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve read that this oil is really good for the skin and cuticles too, but I haven&#x27;t tried it directly on my skin yet as I am currently working on using up some other products first.</li>
            <li> Jojoba and avacado oil caused sensitivity/breakouts, coconut oil is not absorbed very well and rosehip oil was okay.</li>
            <li> hands didn&#x27;t dry out as easily and they started to feel softer compared to when I would just use lotion or nothing at all.  </li>
            <li> I am glad I ordered 2 of them as it is very useful especially I live in the midwest, weather here is quite harsh for my skin, it also helps my grey hair..........</li>
            <li> For anyone wanting and needing organic and pure oils, the smell will not offend you, and you will probably love the slight aroma it has.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve bought other brands in the past, and so far this one is the best.  </li>
            <li> and this is like the only thing saving it right now!</li>
            <li> Would recommend highly and the price here is much better than other places I have seen it for sale.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also amazing for split ends, cracked cuticles, dry skin on your hands, knees, ankles, sole of your feet, etc.</li>
            <li> Usually next day, my hair feels soft, shiny, and easy to handle.</li>
            <li> The package arrived quickly and trouble free.</li>
            <li> Using as a beard balm and it absorbs quickly and definitely makes the hair much softer.</li>
            <li> I have very long fine hair.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t usually comment on a product - however this one is absolutely amazing.  </li>
            <li> This oil not only keeps it smooth looking, it makes my hair so soft!</li>
            <li> Hair – I put an entire dropper full into my conditioner</li>
            <li> It just takes a minute amount to have your hair shiny, frizz free, and soft, soft soft</li>
            <li> This is enough to make it shiny and soft and great to use prior to blow drying to using the flat iron.</li>
            <li> For the first time ever my hair was soft and not corse after coloring.</li>
            <li> First, I tried applying a couple of drops directly to my face at night.</li>
            <li> It is a little oily when I first apply it, but about 10 minutes later, most of it is absorbed</li>
            <li> , my skin is more combo/oily due to aging and this is not greasy or make me break-out at all!</li>
            <li> The scent is very organic smelling, a bit sour, a bit nutty but quickly dissipates once absorbed.</li>
            <li> That being said, this product is my new obsession!</li>
            <li> This oil is saving my hair, and I will definitely continue using it even after I finish off my first bottle, because I have used many supposedly professional products without obtaining similar results.</li>
            <li> This oil is saving my hair, and I will definitely continue using it even after I finish off my first bottle, because I have used many supposedly professional products without obtaining similar results.</li>
            <li> me.&lt;br /&gt;I used them regularly on face and lips , the results being just above average and for the price i paid , i am sure to expect more than this.</li>
            <li> My hair is a lot more manageable and sheds less.</li>
            <li> I rub it like you would a cuticle cream, I do not know if my nails are better, but I do know that the cuticle area looks less damaged.</li>
            <li> My hands have started looking more youthful and there are less wrinkles on them.  </li>
            <li> Love the improvement it&#x27;s made on my skin in less than a week.</li>
            <li> As I get older, I&#x27;m allergic to everything-not this oil.</li>
            <li> I use it daily as a face moisturizer and it makes my skin so soft and smooth.  </li>
            <li> My face definitely was moisturized, and it absorbed very well and didn&#x27;t leave an oily feeling or look.</li>
            <li> I have actually had numerous complements on how healthy my hair is.</li>
            <li> I have also used it mixed with my regular body moisturizer, and love it.</li>
            <li> --my hair feels more coarse, damaged, and fragile as a result.</li>
            <li> I have been using this particular bottle of Argan Oil on my skin.  </li>
            <li> I have super dry skin and love using Argan Oil on the elbows, heels and my hands where my skin is really rough.</li>
            <li> Overall, I love the product and I purchased second bottle.</li>
            <li> I have purchased many products for my face and hair and not only is this the only product that I can use for both, it out performs</li>
            <li> I have been using for over 2 weeks, skin still the same, makes hair super greasy .&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Fast absorbing, and makes hands really soft.</li>
            <li> Let me tell you, I am in my mid 30&#x27;s (closer to 40 now) and have always had oily skin with mild break-outs.</li>
            <li> This is not a miracle worker for reversing aging (although I am sure it helps) but merely takes what you have to give you more glow, smoothness, firmness and hydration</li>
            <li> I have super dry skin and love using Argan Oil on the elbows, heels and my hands where my skin is really rough.</li>
            <li> The main ingredient was Argan Oil.</li>
            <li> Otherwise your hair will be super greasy the next day.</li>
            <li> This product works very well, it leaves my hair very soft.</li>
            <li> I have combination skin that is very sensitive and gets very oily.</li>
            <li> Makes your hair very soft and touchable!</li>
            <li> The oil takes a long time to absorb this way and I&#x27;m pretty sure most of it rubbed off, but what was left behind left my cuticles looking a lot better than they were.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great moisturizer with a very faint earthy smell that fades quickly.  </li>
            <li> highly recommend it</li>

            <li> My new favorite and ONLY facial moisturizer that I will use.  </li>
            <li> i put it on at nice with other essential oils but remove it in the am..</li>
            <li> I use it mixed with jojoba oil on my legs after shaving, on my dry aging neck in the winter, and mixed with some tea trea oil in my hair (still not as good as Wen hair oil$, but infinitely cheaper).</li>
            <li> In the mornings, I applied it to the ends of my very dry hair to help smooth and add shine.</li>
            <li> For the first several days, when I applied the oil under my makeup, my skin did it very oily compared to when I use my oil-free moisturizer, but it&#x27;s gotten better and there is less oil now.</li>
            <li> A little dab in your hair makes it behave better also.</li>
            <li> so soft!!</li>
            <li> maybe this brand is a little more thinned out.</li>
            <li> Second, it lists how exactly to use the oil for your skin, hair, face and nails!</li>
            <li> It also has nice, subtle packaging that I really like.</li>
            <li> Even having curly super dry bleach hair I need to wash my hair after 3 days because it looks un-groomed and feels very oily on the ends.</li>
            <li> It really helps my super dry hair and skin.</li>
            <li> It hydrates very well, it also rubs in easily but does leave a slight film.</li>
            <li> I had tried at times on my hair mixing with other oils and cant ascertain on its effect on hair at this moment, but i never felt that strong smell of agran in the oil.</li>
            <li> and you need so little that it is vey economical compared to so many facial creams on the market.</li>
            <li> and I like it since it absorbs very quickly, lasts long time, left my nails soft and most of all healed my dry cuticles.</li>
            <li> It’s not like conventional oils that leave a greasy residue; it absorbs fast in the skin and is fragrance free.</li>
            <li> This oil is very light, absorbs quickly, not greasy and makes my skin and hair feel really soft.</li>
            <li> You then rinse and you are left with smooth lips that look healthy and fresh, but not left dry due to the gentle exfoliation you get from the sugar and the moisture from the Argan oil.</li>
            <li> It really helps regulate your natural oil production and helps control acne if you have oily or acne prone skin.</li>
            <li> It is also great for basically any weird skin issues.</li>
            <li> So far I have only used it on my face and my skin absorbed it very well.</li>
            <li> I really like to use natural oils to help condition both mine and my daughter&#x27;s hair</li>
            <li> I use it in the morning after washing my face, and it has really helped my skin stay hydrated and as a result stay clear.</li>
            <li> Thanks for a natural product that works as advertised.&lt;br /&gt;-Phyllis</li>
            <li> worked very well made my skin feel soft and helped my nails grow</li>
            <li> It totally absorbed by skin and not left a oily residue.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad a dropper came with it-I tend to waste products without a dropper.</li>
            <li> doesn&#x27;t look oily, more this i drink 8 glasses of water everyday</li>
            <li> I applied a few more drops in the morning and finished styling my hair.  </li>
            <li> i applied few drops on my face and massaged ,it is so moisturising and good,i love my skin when i wake up in the morning</li>
            <li> i was using josie maran brand argan oil and made the switch to foxbrim - seems to be exactly the same and much cheaper.</li>
            <li> I use argan oil on the ends of my hair everyday, which has eliminated the need for many of my hair</li>
            <li> When I got it I accidentally put too much on the first day but just left it.</li>
            <li> totally worth the extra 3 minutes in the shower.</li>
            <li> used the oil on my face in the evenings in place of my normal moisturizer.</li>
            <li> I have been using Argan Oil in my hair for a few weekss now and love the way it feels.</li>
            <li> I used the oil on my face in the evenings in place of my normal moisturizer.</li>
            <li> It worked instantly and my skin absorbed it without problems.</li>
            <li> Get more than a few drops and you will be shampooing again.</li>
            <li> Normal.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried several different kinds but this one from Foxbrim is my favorite so far.</li>
            <li> I have been using Argan Oil in my hair for a few years now and love the way it feels.</li>
            <li> It is pretty much the only moisturizing product I use on my face now.</li>
            <li> Even my nails are looking better with less chipping and cracking!  </li>
            <li> I was having dry patches on my face and this cleared those right up!</li>
            <li> My favorite ways to use Argan oil is as a hair care routine, facial moisturizer, dry skin, and frizzy hair.</li>
            <li> and it just soaks into my skin and all I am left with is super soft, supple skin!&lt;br</li>
            <li> I guess it is okay if you have really dry skin and want the extra layer of oil always on your face.</li>
            <li> It is absorbed quickly and it takes so few drops.</li>
            <li> Additionally, Foxbrim&#x27;s oil is certified organic, is imported from Morocco and bottled in the USA, and is cruelty free, just like the other brand&#x27;s oil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I use the Agadir shampoo/conditioner and gel, my new permanent hair product.  </li>
            <li> I have both eczema and combination skin, prone to breakouts with new products.</li>
            <li> This is my new staple product.</li>
            <li> I live in AZ.</li>
            <li> Hollywood&#x27;s new  &amp;#34;must have&amp;#34; item.</li>
            <li> I noticed my daughter&#x27;s hair was looking absolutely beautiful for the past few months</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve primarily used it on my beard and mustache, and it&#x27;s definitely helped to soften things up a bit and has essentially eliminated the dreaded beard dandruff.</li>
            <li> Shipping was fast but the product is very greasy even using a tiny bit</li>
            <li> It works wonderfully on my super dry skin and hair.</li>
            <li> and I am very surprised that it doesn&#x27;t make your head or hair greasy at all.</li>
            <li> It makes hair, skin and cuticles very soft.</li>
            <li> I do notice that my face is very soft and I have not had any breakouts.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It leaves my face very soft and hydrated.</li>
            <li> I am of a certain age where those fine lines have started being just plain old wrinkles,</li>
            <li> I desperately needed a good argan oil right now and this fits the bill.</li>
            <li> Pure Argan Oil is packed with Vitamin E, and essential Unsaturated Fatty Acids and more.</li>
            <li> face is clear!</li>
            <li> Wow!</li>
            <li> after the first day of using it on my face - folks were trying to figure out what was different about me...</li>
            <li> It made my hair really soft and shiny, which is just what I wanted!</li>
            <li> I bought this for a specific reason and have actually fallen in love with it for an altogether different one.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m using it on my hands regularly and it is really helping them NOT look like something that escaped from a mummy&#x27;s tomb!  </li>
            <li> This is the second bottle after months of usage of the first one.</li>
            <li> Argan Oil is not my first purchase and will not be my last.  </li>
            <li> , Foxbrim&#x27;s oil is exactly the same.</li>
            <li> This is the first time we ordered it &amp; My Wife loves this product &amp; has become a regular user.  </li>
            <li> My hair is so soft afterward!</li>
            <li> plus this is my second review ( Seller Deleted my first one)  </li>
            <li> To start with, I only used 2 drops on the first day I tested this out.</li>
            <li> Wow I just don&#x27;t know where to start!</li>
            <li> This product performs about the same if not a bit better than my other product in regards to making my hair softer and keeping the frizzes under control.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> so oil cleanse first followed by regular cleanser.</li>
            <li> It makes my skin so soft!</li>
            <li> Pleased with skin softness, jury is still out on skin improvements due to short time in use.</li>
            <li> This is the first argan oil I&#x27;ve tried and I have been using it in different ways.</li>
            <li> This product has been an awesome treat for my poor old and dried up skin.....</li>
            <li> I also use it to moisturizer my formerly dry and frizzy hair and it improved it after the first use!  </li>
            <li> It smooths down the frizzies and make hair soft, i only use a little or it makes it a little greasy, its great for rough feet and makes my skin softer, good for chapped lips too.</li>
            <li> A few drops on wet hair and your blow dry will be salon beautiful.</li>
            <li> Using the argan in the day, and argan+organic virgin coconut oil at night may seem like a high maintence chore to keep up with, but it&#x27;s really not, and it&#x27;s beyond worth it.</li>
            <li> It’s all-natural, and isn’t mixed with other kinds of oils to dilute the natural effect, as many oils are.</li>
            <li> I regularly use argan oil on my skin and I have noticed great difference in my skin texture .It  is pretty cold where i live</li>
            <li> Pleasantly surprised to learn it really was non-greasy, unlike Josie Maran&#x27;s generally revolting version of argan oil</li>
            <li> Just a few drops is all I need and it absorbs very quickly.  </li>
            <li> There is a marked improvement on my facial skin with the use of Argan oil and the results started to show from the first week of usage.</li>
            <li> The oil does not leave any gleasiness since the oil sinks in quickly.</li>
            <li> I was looking for first cold press, but for the price this was really good.</li>
            <li> We found this helps our hair stay in good health without being weighed down to much by heavy conditioners, leave in treatments, etc.</li>
            <li> Plus I tried a little in my hair and it made it super oily!</li>
            <li> I use it for my face and so far no break outs and my skin is always soft afterwards!</li>
            <li> It may feel a little greasy at first but as long as you don&#x27;t use too much it will absorb quickly and not leave a shine.</li>
            <li> It helps relieve the dry skin and gives a smooth and soft texture back.</li>
            <li> It absorbs instantly and just leaves my dry skin feeling soft and smooth.  </li>
            <li> Those dry patches are so much better when I use this following a shower or facial wash.  </li>
            <li> As the owner of very coarse, curly hair I am always on the lookout for styling solutions that are pure.</li>
            <li> need a lot of drops to properly cover large spaces (skin and hair)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Use Pure Argan Oil as a treatment by massaging it into your scalp before bed and washing it out in the morning with your regular shampoo.</li>
            <li> I recently started using Foxbrim 100% Pure Organic Argan Oil</li>
            <li> just want the seller to explain me which one of them is actually 100% pure??????</li>
            <li> I have combination skin, with occasional break outs and large pores.</li>
            <li> product is 100% pure and natural and lists 2 ingredients---not 20 ingredients that look like they&#x27;re out of a medical encyclopedia.</li>
            <li> Very good because it takes only a few drops for your face and neck and moisturizes nicely, not greasy.</li>
            <li> Will post an accurate review in a few weeks.</li>
            <li> and it helped clear up my sunburn in a couple of days.</li>
            <li> I used it in the evening on towel dried hair and when I woke up my hair was soft and almost frizz free.  </li>
            <li> oily skin and Argan oil has helped to clear redness,lesions and control the oil.</li>
            <li> My skin has been really clear too.</li>
            <li> After using I could clearly feel the difference between the two.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t get to clear up</li>
            <li> I may try a bottle of it in the near future to see how much I might like it, too.  </li>
            <li> Works wonders on my daughters dandruff, use once a week and her scalp is clear.  </li>
            <li> I applied two drops to my conditioner, it made my hair soft and manageable.</li>
            <li> Three drops, two times a day, added to my face care regimen and my skin is moisturized and soft.</li>
            <li> Also no breakouts so far.</li>
            <li> I am 45 and still look like I am in my early 30s and</li>
            <li> I also used on my skin too and it makes it so soft.</li>
            <li> It makes my hair soft and manageable.  </li>
            <li> wow...</li>
            <li> Natural shine</li>
            <li> Natural lip moisturizer</li>
            <li> Complete cuticle repair&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It’s a natural conditioner and can help with the frizzies, split ends and shine.</li>
            <li> You can use it on on you skin to make it supple and soft</li>
            <li> and my hands are soft again.</li>
            <li> My daughter has curly hair and when I use this on her hair after it’s towel dried it helps her curls stay smooth and curly.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 68 years old and believe me</li>
            <li> I was totally surprised by the results.  </li>
            <li> My face is really soft now.</li>
            <li> Even the doctor was surprised.</li>
            <li> she was about a year old.</li>
            <li> I have acne-prone, sensitive skin</li>
            <li> My hair remained soft and shiny throughout the day.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been shuffling through a lot of old paperwork, while cleaning out my garage</li>
            <li> but this should be natural since is oil.</li>
            <li> It makes my face so soft and if you give it 5 mins or so after application, it does not leave your face oily at all.</li>
            <li> Makes my skin feel soft.</li>
            <li> i cant say thus far.</li>
            <li> I use it on my under-eye area and the sensitive parts of my face.</li>
            <li> It does not leave my hair greasy just soft and silky.</li>
            <li> I hope the use of this product will become more common in this country.</li>
            <li> WOW</li>
            <li> all natural.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin with eczema, and I was hoping this would be helpful in alleviating the redness.</li>
            <li> I also put on drop on my lips each morning to keep them soft and moisturized.  </li>
            <li> It also leaves my curls feeling soft and bouncy.</li>
            <li> My skin is so soft, and I wish I had found it sooner.</li>
            <li> It makes my hair so soft and shiny.</li>
            <li> Like this argan oil, makes my hair feel so soft</li>

            <li> Makes my hair shine and really soft.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s supposed to be all natural</li>
            <li> it make my hair soft, and my face</li>
            <li> I am 79 years old and still struggling with keeping my skin supple.  </li>
            <li> It is a natural alternative to hair serums.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s weightless, and leaves my skin feeling soft and non greasy.</li>
            <li> It leaves my hair feeling soft and even gives my hair a bounce.</li>
            <li> in all I thus far have had no problems and I like the way it makes my face feel.</li>
            <li> but this product has really improved the overall condition of my skin.</li>
            <li> So far using on face and hair and it absorbs well.</li>
            <li> If you are putting off trying this product, you will be very grateful when you finally give it a try.  </li>
            <li> It leaves my skin feeling soft and hydrated, not greasy.  </li>
            <li> Was unsure how it would do on my skin, as it is sensitive.</li>
            <li> I heat style my hair nearly every day.  </li>
            <li> that it&#x27;s completely natural and there are no chemicals added.</li>
            <li> Soft and glowy.</li>
            <li> I enjoy the way it makes my skin feels and when applied to my hair it gives it shine and softness without the heavy greasy look</li>
            <li> It leaves my hair so soft and shiny.</li>
            <li> By morning, my hair is soft and completely manageable.</li>
            <li> and my flaking has become nearly nonexistent!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I put it directly on my skin</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know yet, if it&#x27;s helped decrease my natural oil production.</li>
            <li> It can leave your hair so soft and shiny.</li>
            <li> I only noticed it when applying the oil to my face, but I really didn&#x27;t smell anything when using it in my hair.</li>
            <li> By morning, my hair is soft and completely manageable.</li>
            <li> I use it every night before bed and it my skin feels soft when I wake up.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve bought 2 bottles of this so far.</li>
            <li> So, at our first long stop, I ordered this, as it specifically states it is for hair, skin, and nails.  </li>
            <li> Afterwards, I couldn&#x27;t believe how soft (not oily)</li>
            <li> However, I avoid my mouth, chine, and hairline as it will cause breakouts if you have naturally oily skin.</li>
            <li> I like the oil so far.</li>
            <li> but so far I can say that it is not greasy</li>
            <li> I tried over 5 different kinds of intense lotion, but I think it has to be oil.</li>
            <li> The scent is so soft that it is almost imperseptible.</li>
            <li> So far, I have no problems with this oil.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> for all skin types from sensitive skin to even acne prone skin&lt;br /&gt;What</li>
            <li> You can use your finger tips to get to the areas around your eyes by using a soft patting motion.</li>
            <li> And I&#x27;ve used it on my nails, face and hair so far and like all the results.</li>
            <li> Overall, I would highly recommend this product as a treatment for skin and nails!</li>
            <li> I use a tiny bit on my face and rub some into my hair just after a shower, makes it really shine.  </li>
            <li> And my face feels so soft.  </li>
            <li> ABSORBS QUICKLY, SOFT SKIN, THANK YOU</li>
            <li> I have naturally curly hair</li>
            <li> It absorbs into my skin and hair making it look soft and moisturized.</li>
            <li> This smelled perhaps old.</li>
            <li> For me this did not work as I developed an irritation on the skin at the outer edge of my eyes.  </li>
            <li> It can leave your hair so soft and shiny.</li>
            <li> The stubborn blackheads on my nose and forehead are GONE, which is a complete shocker.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s taming my split ends and making my hair shiny and soft.</li>
            <li> Leaves both hair and skin moisturized and silky soft.  </li>
            <li> Has my hair soft and manageable.</li>
            <li> So far it&#x27;s been a couple of weeks and</li>
            <li> I was pleasantly surprised.</li>
            <li> It not only works for me, but my whole family.</li>
            <li> This oil is a concentrated formula and natural.</li>
            <li> Works really well when mixed with Frankensense, Lavender and Peppermint  for stress and headaches.</li>
            <li> After blow drying my hair I immediately noticed how soft and shiny my hair was.</li>
            <li> My hair really needed the extra boost and this product has helped it a lot.</li>
            <li> but, since using this oil it leaves a soft feeling and I can run my fingers through my hair easier.</li>
            <li> I have never had anything make my hair feel so soft.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m transitioning to natural products.</li>
            <li> I love it in just a few short uses.</li>
            <li> I love it and it only takes a few drops.&lt;br</li>
            <li> No unpleasant smell as with other products purchased and returned.</li>
            <li> As I mentioned earlier, I have been using other Argon Oil products on my hair that I picked up at my local store and have been satisfied with the results.  </li>
            <li> This little bottle is some powerful stuff!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not first cold pressed, but it&#x27;s organic, and seems to be an excellent quality.</li>
            <li> free to check out my other reviews as I am getting around to reviewing all my essential oils (which is a lot).</li>
            <li> I have used a lot of others in the past and they always seem to be a little too heavy, but this one is perfect!</li>
            <li> No staining, love the smell and a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> And now I am so confused as the new  bottle has very light scent...</li>
            <li> I originally bought it for my hair because it has been so dry and the Argan Oil has made my scalp not so dry and my hair soft.</li>
            <li> This is a nutrient-rich moisturizer chock full of fatty acids, vitamin E, and natural anti-oxidants.</li>
            <li> It has so many uses and you only need a small amout so it lasts forever.  </li>
            <li> I rubbed it into my cuticles with only 1 drop on the first nail which was enough to rub onto all five fingers of that hand.</li>
            <li> I dried my hair as I usually do and LOVED the texture and the shine.</li>
            <li> my verdict will be that the oil is good( not excellent) if you are not prone to acne and don&#x27;t expect wonders on your skin in a very near future.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff, I have curly hair and sometime it gets to looking a little dry</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had really dry, red, and sensitive skin around my eyes that no moisturizer has ever been able to correct but a few weeks of applying this argan oil around my eyes and my skin is now functioning normally.</li>
            <li> This product is definitely a quality product for any purpose other than if you want to use it on very fine hair when it is dry, not wet.  </li>
            <li> This wonderful product has eliminated my need for any other conditioners, which worked poorly as well as weighing my hair down.</li>
            <li> and they were jealous on how cheap, half the cost they paid, for similar product.</li>
            <li> Have also used a couple drops on shampooed hair, both towel dried and blown dry - hair is shinier, smoother, and more manageable either way.  </li>
            <li> No more flakes and my hair feels smooth and shiny.</li>
            <li> I really haven&#x27;t used this product long enough to review but what I find so far is a product that keeps my 60 year young skin soft.</li>
            <li> Exactly as described and expected.</li>
            <li> and what a difference my hair actually looks normal again .</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe people spend $50 or more on argan oil from other companies when this foxbrim argan is the exact same quality if not better.</li>
            <li> I am also trying it on my hair, my thoughts are that its no more effective than other oil treatments I have tried.</li>
            <li> Sure enough, it&#x27;s as if it brings dead looking hair back to life!  </li>
            <li> I do not like it as well as the more expensive one that I bought before because it seems to make my hair more oily in appearance than the other brand (I&#x27;ve also left a review for that one if you want to know what brand it was)</li>
            <li> Added three drops of NOW Essential Oils 100% Pure Peppermint (I bought at Amazon) and vigorously mixed, let set overnight</li>
            <li> I also mix this with tea tree oil, &amp; together it has definitely stimulated new growth all over.</li>
            <li> She has very long hair while mine is much shorter</li>
            <li> I bought this for my Hair and it works really well to moisturize my hair, which is very very long.</li>
            <li> My scalp gets very oily but my ends are dry and will split.</li>
            <li> and I do notice that my hair is not as dry and very moisturized.</li>
            <li> It really helps condition his dry course hair.</li>
            <li> Very helpful for dry winter skin on face and hands.</li>
            <li> My hair is really dry and frizzy and its helped so much.</li>
            <li> you have really frizzy hair or even just dry hair</li>
            <li> Within days, my dry cracked heels softened and my skin became much smoother.  </li>
            <li> you have really frizzy hair or even just dry hair</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t purchase this again, it&#x27;s too expensive for an over refined argan oil, (I&#x27;d pay more though for the real thing and will)</li>
            <li> Using with peptide complex from the same company and my skin is noticably improving. :)</li>
            <li> My hair is thick and frizzes easily.</li>
            <li> I have a super oily T-zone, and using a few drops of argan oil as a day moisturizer (and under makeup) has regulated my spastic sebum.</li>
            <li> i said earlier i have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li> After purchasing this product I have decided to forego any facial moisturizers which usually contain a combination of ingredients the effectiveness of which is questionable at best.</li>
            <li> Upon first use I noticed that it does not have a smell, and it washes off of my hands unlike other oil products I use.</li>
            <li> I have no regrets!</li>
            <li> No other compensation was received.</li>
            <li> I had two areas of slight dryness on my face, and after two days the dryness just peeled right off.  </li>
            <li> Rich in Vitamin E, Essential Fatty Acids, and Proteins, Argan Oil helps fight lines and  repair imperfections.</li>
            <li> Even though it can be a little pricey, in my opinion it is worth it.</li>
            <li> I even enjoy it in my hair, a little goes a long way</li>
            <li> This was a moderately priced option and seemed to have all the important things the high priced ones do- exact same ingredient list of only pure argan oil, organic, cold pressed, and no synthetics in process or ingredient.</li>
            <li> I hope not because I generally won&#x27;t use scented products on my face.&lt;br</li>
            <li> and I was looking for something that would constantly moisturize and keep my skin that way for long without too much greasy feeling .</li>
            <li> It soothed his skin, made him beard soft and shiny and made the skin feel moisturized, Now he would like to take it for over from me on a regular basis :</li>
            <li> and I would recommend it to anyone especially to people that have sensitive skin because it is soothing to the skin and even on all skin types.</li>
            <li> Using 3 drops of this oil as a facial moisturizer morning and night has eliminated my blackheads completely.</li>
            <li> I notice a lot of direct sales selling similar product anymore.</li>
            <li> Sometimes I&#x27;m too busy (3 toddlers) and skip using conditioner step, but later uses this</li>
            <li> Then I see supple skin with natural glow next morning.</li>
            <li> I have completely stopped using cream moisturizer and only use oil.</li>
            <li> Such lightweight moisturizer,my skin feels soft and hydrated,never oily.</li>
            <li> Too early to tell if there&#x27;s an effect on my nails yet but definitely notice an increase in softness.</li>
            <li> Argan Oil is entirely plant based and natural.</li>
            <li> expected something much thinner than this, and when used by itself it doesn&#x27;t spread well.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I was surprised to find a product that actually met it&#x27;s claims.</li>
            <li> I now have barely any break-outs</li>
            <li> I have some face and hair plans for the near future for myself.</li>
            <li> I try to use all natural as much as possible.</li>
            <li> My combination skin feels soft after use; my heavily-dyed hair is still in the works for noticeable repair, but it&#x27;s been providing a lasting boost to help the frizz!</li>
            <li> It totally absorbs into your hair and leaves it soft and shiney.</li>
            <li> I have never had such soft and glowing skin in all my life.</li>
            <li> normally use organic extra virgin coconut oil and Watts brand retinol + hyaluaronic acid on my face, but adding this argan oil to my regimen has totally boosted the results, and therefore, changed my skin.</li>
            <li> Argan oil has kind of a weird smell</li>
            <li> I will be leaving thus behind, as our friends might use it on their dog&#x27;s coat if the vet says it is OK.  </li>
            <li> and I love to wash my face, tone and put a thin layer on my face before bed.</li>
            <li> Winter tends to be harsh on my skin, but Foxbrim&#x27;s Argan oil kept my skin looking dewy and fresh.</li>
            <li> Winter tends to be harsh on my skin, but Foxbrim&#x27;s Argan oil kept my skin looking dewy and fresh.</li>
            <li> : I use this as a leave in, and I use only 2-3 drops through my whole hair, which is long, while it is damp but not soaking and not dry.</li>
            <li> Knowing how much it takes, this bottle will last for a long time!</li>
            <li> To finish, I blow dry my hair, if I choose to do so; the whole day, my hair and face look terrific; coworkers have noticed and complimented on my make up, but it is not the make up, but the way the make up shows over the face rubbed with Argan oil.</li>
            <li> I use it everywhere on my skin, really helped my husband&#x27;s extra dry skin from diabetes.  </li>
            <li> (I have thick fine hair, my friend said it makes thinner hair a bit greasy so only use 1 drop if you have thinner hair)</li>
            <li> If you have other ingredients in your argan oil, then you really aren&#x27;t getting what you pay for.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very lightweight and doesn&#x27;t make my hair feel greasy afterward, like other products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> One other thing I learned, if you mix it in your conditioner, without the spray, it works really really well too.</li>
            <li> One long discolored nail has been restored to its natural color!</li>
            <li> use to have dull, not really shiney or healthy looking hair.</li>
            <li> This Argan Oil does not leave a greasy or oily feeling on my face like some Argan Oils or moisturizers and it only takes a couple drops for the whole face, which means, this bottle will last a very long time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My hair is wavy to slightly curly and is super dry and frizzy so using this as a leave</li>
            <li> I also use a few drops with a heavy duty moisturizer on my feet and it helps the moisturizer absorb a lot better.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin and was wary about trying it, but my skin has never been so soft and smooth and</li>
            <li> I can tell this is pure because it comes in a dark colored glass bottle rather than plastic.</li>
            <li> One of the things to look for when purchasing pure Argan Oil is a dark bottle.</li>
            <li> The first tanning session burned the belly are a little.</li>
            <li> The scent is a little like nuts at first, but then dissipates to no scent at all.  </li>
            <li> have very long hair that can be rather coarse, so I put about five drops into my hand, rub it into my other hand, and then apply it to the ends and bottom half of my outer layers toward the top of my head.</li>
            <li> I apply argan oil right after I washed my hair, rub few drops at the end of the hair and while there are still some oil left massage the scalp.</li>
            <li> So far we&#x27;ve been using this on my daughter&#x27;s long, curly hair.</li>
            <li> ,i was scared to apply on my skin for the first few days..</li>
            <li> We&#x27;ve tried all kinds of remedies in the past, without much success.</li>
            <li> First I tried just rubbing a few drops in my palm and smoothing it onto my hair.</li>
            <li> New Mexico is a very dry state.</li>
            <li> I really like that it doesn&#x27;t weigh my hair down or make my face feel greasy (like the others I have used)</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s capable of dissolving all kinds of dirt and oil from your skin and washing it down the drain.</li>
            <li> The oil is exactly the same, yields the same results, and costs much, much less.</li>
            <li> This time of year I get really dry hands, so I have been using it around my cuticles to prevent hangnails and not only is my fingers and hands soft - my nails seem to be growing out faster and stronger!</li>
            <li> I have dry sensitive skin</li>
            <li> This cold-pressed oil, sourced directly from Morocco, is liquid gold for all your dry hair, skin, and nail needs.  </li>
            <li> About once a month I put the Argan oil directly on my ends of my dry hair and let it sit for a about 30 minutes before washing it out.  </li>
            <li> My hair is so soft once dry.  </li>
            <li> I have sensitive, fairly dry skin on my face.</li>
            <li> I used this and after the first few days I could see a big difference.</li>
            <li> I recently color treated my hair for the first time ever and it really dried it out.  </li>
            <li> I have to lather my hair few more time than usual to wash out oil from my hair.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Got it for nails and used several times a day the first few weeks.  </li>
            <li> It has the right consistency and a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I just wash it out the next day because it will weigh your hair down after a while of if you use too much.</li>
            <li> My hair is less frizzy, soft and easier to work with, my nails are growing fast and not braking, my skin isnt dry anymore, especially on my face and it has soothed and helped my stretch marks from having my baby boy</li>
            <li> I am a 28 year old African/Irish American with extremely dry skin and hair  (4A).  </li>
            <li> Little bit of argan oil can do whole lot.</li>
            <li> I was a little hesitant but because it was so reasonable, I figured I would give it a try.</li>
            <li> too little product too much money  will try to find wholesale</li>
            <li> Everyone does it a little differently but the way we use it is to rub a liberal amount into our hair the night before we plan on shampooing and pop on a scarf and sleep on it to really give it time to absorb.</li>
            <li> The high rating for this product fancied me to buy this, but frankly after couple of months regular usage , i should say that its not worth all the praises and standing ovation.</li>
            <li> Reading some of the other reviews and responses I have to wonder if the lack of a scent means that it is less than fresh, though...</li>
            <li> I live in the desert and dry hair is a constant problem along with dry skin.</li>
            <li> Surprisingly, this product is not too bad.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s hard to always find the right product to use.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Simple to use and like any other beauty oil, a little goes a long way, Just a few drops can be applied to the skin&#x27;s surface and you want a nice thin layer, which will absorb quickly and leave your skin feeling hydrated.</li>
            <li> Also, when I put it in my hair (after diluting and rubbing on my hands) it was very shiny, but also seemed stiff?  </li>
            <li> I mixed it with other natural oils for my daughter&#x27;s hair.</li>
            <li> Its light, not as thick as other oils.</li>
            <li> It is supple, clear, clean, and it has a faint aromatic fragrance.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve noticed that my hair is less frizzy and dry and looks a whole lot</li>
            <li> It is so odd that the very areas I used to have problems with being oily are now tending towards being dry and flaky.  </li>
            <li> Their products (at least every one I’ve tried so far) are high in quality.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s high in vitamin E and essential fatty acids.  </li>
            <li> I have not gotten any new pimples since I began using this, as well as less sebum production.</li>
            <li> It helps it look in its ultimate form and the bottle will last very long for my short hair.</li>
            <li> Follow the valuable directions of another reviewer and fill a small spray bottle half way with water, then add a dropper full of oil.  </li>
            <li> am not disciplined enough to put it on my dry feet daily, but wish I would!&lt;br</li>
            <li> This stuff was amazing, but very expensive.</li>
            <li> Over the past couple weeks I have rubbed some Foxbrim oil into my palms and worked it through my hair after shampooing, really focusing on the damaged ends.</li>
            <li> This will last for a long time.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> but I used to flat iron my hair)</li>
            <li> I flat iron</li>
            <li> I will continue buying Foxbrim as long as the prices stay the same.  </li>
            <li> Wow, I have only tried a few oils before (jojoba and olive), but this one definitely beats all of them.</li>
            <li> I even bought an extra bottle for a guy at my local hardware store who has chronic dry skin!</li>
            <li> It only takes a pea sized amount on the back of each hand to do both hands and my once very dry cuticles.</li>
            <li> This bottle should last a long time!</li>
            <li> You also will likely find the reviews for other products I use with my essential oils such as rollerballs, carrier oils, inhalers, carrying cases, diffiusers, etc.</li>
            <li> u are dry or just want extra goodness.</li>
            <li> After just a couple weeks of using this not only are my dry spots gone</li>
            <li> I use it for my hair,which is dry from coloring it,AND I use it all over my body for overall dryness.</li>
            <li> I also use the same stuff on my face, I have a dry t-zone.</li>
            <li> As an African-American woman, my hair  is dry  and fragile.</li>
            <li> not red or dry</li>
            <li> If you have dry hair, a tiny bit of the oil helps it look moisture.  </li>
            <li> We also add a few drops into a palmful of lotion for body moisturizing and this leaves your skin feeling soft and silky all day!  </li>
            <li> The only reason it doesn&#x27;t get a 5 star from me is that Argan Oil itself is not complete for my aging, dry, skin&#x27;s needs.  </li>
            <li> The second bottle I ordered came to me broken and empty and Amazon quickly refunded me for that.</li>
            <li> Especially, the ends are very dry with a lot of split ends.</li>
            <li> feel like my hands look at least 10 years older than my actually age.  </li>
            <li> Not sure why this products rating is so high.</li>
            <li> I love that this one is cold pressed virgin argan oil and organic.</li>
            <li> Once my hair dried my hair felt soft and looked shiny without being oily.  </li>
            <li> It stays moisturizing for a long time without any greasy feeling.</li>
            <li> I am sold on this product and will continue to reorder as long as it continues to work.</li>
            <li> Use sparingly it goes a long ways.</li>
            <li> Hair - I have long, colored, highlighted hair.</li>
            <li> I wish I had found this oil a long time ago.  </li>
            <li> I think I&#x27;ll have this bottle for a long time.</li>
            <li> I stopped every thing that was not natural, and I was told about this oil.  </li>
            <li> I rub a few drops on the ends with my fingertips before going to bed and in the morning my hair is silky soft without any signs of damage.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve spent thousands on various products over the years and Argan Oil beats them all.</li>
            <li> A few drops  leaves my hair soft and shiny.</li>
            <li> Makes my skin few all dewy and soft.  </li>
            <li> I have used this for a long time</li>
            <li> Apologies in advance for the long review!*&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> This product goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> Noticeable improvements on condition of processed long hair, specifically regarding split ends.  </li>
            <li> The product was smaller than expected.</li>
            <li> My nails were very brittle and my hands were very dry a few drops about every other day</li>
            <li> On towel dried hair, I add about five drops of argan oil and finger comb it throughout my hair and let my hair dry naturally.</li>
            <li> Argan oil is very different than all the other oils I have tried.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve also started using it on those inevitable vertical little creases on our upper lip that remind us that &amp;#34;time marches on&amp;#34;!  </li>
            <li> I think this bottle is going to last me a long while as i only use a few drops at a time.  </li>
            <li> Just a couple drops goes a long way!</li>
            <li> I have used more expensive argan oils in the past and think that this oil from Foxbrim compares equally to those.</li>
            <li> The benefits and being that the product is Organic is big plus when it comes to other brands.  </li>

            <li> It has an earthy scent to it and has a similar, color and feel as some other Argan oils that I have tried.</li>

            <li> My skin is no longer dry and itchy.</li>
            <li> I apply it after I blow dry and just pat it all over my hair.</li>
            <li> used it on my dry heals and the cracks are almost gone.</li>
            <li> She uses it on her dry skin to keep from scratching.  </li>
            <li> Also, I use it on mine and my child&#x27;s dry skin.</li>
            <li> I PUT IT ON MY DRY</li>
            <li> I never liked the greasy feeling on my skin or hair but as I am getting older my skin changed and started feeling the need.</li>
            <li> After showering the next morning and before blow drying, I apply a few drops of the oil mixed in with my straightener product.  </li>

            <li> I usually used coconut oil since I started wearing my hair natural (I always have</li>
            <li> Her otherwise healthy hair has been damaged by the various bleaching and colors she has been experimenting with,  The ends of her hair were really looking terrible</li>
            <li> It has actually caused a fairly large sun-damage dark spot to almost disappear from my face in the past few weeks since I&#x27;ve started using it.  </li>
            <li> I found it a little more difficult to work into my hair compared with other oils I&#x27;ve used, but adding a bit of water helps.  </li>
            <li> Its become rather large in the past few years.  </li>
            <li> so I have lots of dry areas, itchy skin, especially in the winter and a small patch of eczema on my back, this oil just soothes and conditions my skin without being oily or sticky,</li>
            <li> Only warning: A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> A little bit goes a long way and it will last you quite some time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I will save the other brand for when I want to add a shine to my long hair when it is dry.  </li>
            <li> Maybe all those long words weren&#x27;t so bad, but they didn&#x27;t look safe to me.  </li>
            <li> Even used it on my chapped lips and my dry feet!</li>
            <li> you can use all over for hair, nails, face, dry skin....whatever!</li>
            <li> and I believe it has made a big difference in that smoothness and lessening if any slight wrinkles.</li>
            <li> I typically use Argan Oil on my hair, and this oil is no different.  </li>
            <li> I still use it on my face but now also use my regular face cream and only a small amount of the oil.</li>
            <li> I use this on wet hair or dry hair.  </li>
            <li> I can use it on my wet or dry hair and it tames my frizz.  </li>
            <li> Even rough and dry heels are no match for Argan oil.  </li>
            <li> I do not know if this stuff has anything to do with it, but It has been shedding less since starting to use this stuff in this way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I usually purchase a much more expensive brand from Sephora, but after a bit of research and reading the reviews</li>
            <li> but why, same thing for half the price..</li>
            <li> My mistake.....instead of going back to see which Argan Oil I purchased previously, I ordered TWO bottles of this stuff (what was I thinking???)  </li>
            <li> I am using this on my extremely dry skin on my legs and rough spots on my face.  </li>
            <li> I had old hair; dry, dull and no movement.  </li>
            <li> plan on using this on my heels, as I tend to have very dry and cracked heals.  </li>
            <li> Helps for very dry skin, but not by itself.</li>
            <li> I have very dry skin on my ankles, elbows and heels.</li>
            <li> I applied four drops and massaged it through my very dry hair.</li>
            <li> I have very dry hair, after years of damaging it from hair dyes, to curling irons, and powders, perfumes etc.</li>
            <li> I have very dry skin</li>
            <li> My face and hair was  always very dry.</li>
            <li> I have very dry skin and even break outs on my face</li>
            <li> I have very dry aging skin</li>
            <li> I have very dry skin</li>
            <li> So often companies make promises about their products that simply are NOT true.</li>
            <li> I have only used it a few times since I haven&#x27;t had it very long</li>
            <li> but overall a little oily</li>
            <li> I use this argan oil for my nails and use a little extra to moisturize my hands.</li>
            <li> Have only been using it for a little over a week</li>
            <li> Now I mix 6 drops with a little coconut oil and put it on before I go to bed as well as 6 drops mixed in with my morning lotion!</li>
            <li> but this Argan smoothed them a little with daily use.</li>
            <li> You only need a little bit.</li>
            <li> I also use it on my face and other dry parts of my skin as needed.</li>
            <li> My body skin has a few dry patches due to some skin conditions and oil help to moisturize it for couple days, especially elbows.</li>
            <li> You only need a small amount - it goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> It worked just as expected.</li>
            <li> My pores have almost totally closed over.  </li>
            <li> For both hands I only need a few drops.  </li>
            <li> Suffering from rough hands this winter, I decided to try Dr. Oz&#x27;s advice and get some Organic Argan Oil.</li>
            <li> It came on time, was well packaged, and everything that I expected.</li>
            <li> You only need a few drops.  </li>
            <li> Not much else</li>
            <li> Shake thoroughly and spray on wet hair--experiment with the amount needed for your hair.  </li>
            <li> I use a few drops as a facial mousturizer, and in the ends of my hair before blow drying.  </li>
            <li> At the same time, it’s been proven to have anti-inflammation (reduce redness), anti-aging, and inhibit melanin synthesis (prevents uneven complexion).</li>
            <li> Way to heavy for a daily hair moisturizer.  </li>
            <li> It is not very greasy and absorbs well into the skin</li>
            <li> Not really manageable to style after.</li>
            <li> Only have had for a few days now</li>
            <li> use the dropper and only a few drops is all I need.</li>
            <li> I am reserving the fifth star because I have only been using this a few days.</li>
            <li> in Essential Fatty Acids&lt;br /&gt;Deep</li>
            <li> I only had to use a few drops when brushing out Hadassah&#x27;s tangles.</li>
            <li> but that is expected.</li>
            <li> so I use it on my rough spots (elbows, feet heels, etc)  versus on my hair.</li>
            <li> I use this in my conditioner, just a few drops or so added, mixed up and added.</li>
            <li> I will definitely continue to add a few drops every time I shampoo.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t believe how soft and thick my hair felt.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way with the product and will last me a bit longer than previous products.  </li>
            <li> A little goes a long way with the product and will last me a bit longer than previous products.  </li>
            <li> And cuticles as well as though rough dry yucky heals!!</li>
            <li> I no longer have yucky dry peeling feet,yay!!</li>
            <li> Not pure and diluted.</li>
            <li> My mother has been buying countless products over the years to combat her insanely dried out hair due to years and years of chemically dying it.</li>
            <li> It reduces frizz, cuts down on blow dry time, and adds lots of shine.</li>
            <li> I like this product have used it previously, I put on face, hair and dry spots.  </li>
            <li> I spent much more on &amp;#34;Designer&amp;#34; argan oil from QVC and was so disappointed in when I looked at the ingredients.  </li>
            <li> I am 72 years old and over the past few years</li>
            <li> I typically have dry, flaky skin</li>
            <li> I rubbed a thin layer on my feet before bed, paying particular attention to the bottoms.  </li>
            <li> Remember a little goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> A little goes a long way</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> a little does go a long way.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> A  couple drops per use is all that&#x27;s needed - a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way with this product.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.&lt;br /&gt;What</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way in this regard.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> Being that Argan Oil is an oil a little bit goes a long way so keep this in mind as you are using the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> ( blonde with processed hair) just a drop while wet keeps the Grizzlies at bay!!!!</li>
            <li> I used to be very oily with some weird dry patches.</li>
            <li> It has a slightly nutty smell that dissipates after a few seconds which I actually like a lot.</li>
            <li> Anti-inflammatory to dramatically reduce redness brought on by acne and other skin ailments&lt;br</li>
            <li> A little bit goes a long way!</li>
            <li> I’ve used several body lotions in the past</li>
            <li> ☺ I&#x27;m trying other uses suggested on the label.</li>
            <li> I was amazed at how just a small amount will moisturize your entire body.</li>
            <li> We both raved about it to each other.  </li>
            <li> Plus.. it don&#x27;t have that nutty smell like some of the other brands.</li>
            <li> I do find it to be a bit runnier than the other Argan Oil I have used.</li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t notice a smell like I do with other brands.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s possible to have an allergy to Argan oil, but something about it reacted with my skin.</li>
            <li> other oil I used didn&#x27;t have this</li>
            <li> /&gt;In comparison to the other brand</li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t feel I would ever buy any other brand but Foxbrim.</li>
            <li> I usually use meadowfoam oil, especially because it has a uv protection to it.</li>
            <li> I have used other brands of Argan Oil for my hair and didn&#x27;t see any results.  </li>
            <li> It can also be used as a oil treatment for your hair, alone or added to other hair products.</li>
            <li> The biggest reason is it doesn&#x27;t feel like vegetable oil, which I&#x27;m convinced some other companies have stuck in their bottles.  </li>
            <li> The oil is thinner than other oils that I have used&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li> A little bit goes a long way!  </li>
            <li> Any Mamas out there with post--baby-delivery hemorrhoids (sorry, i know this may be yucky but have to share), this oil is very soothing for that area!</li>
            <li> (it&#x27;s not pretty).</li>
            <li> I have extremely oily skin, and it didn&#x27;t make it any oilier.</li>
            <li> I was in a dept store the other day and a label caught my eye of some night cream</li>
            <li> I use Foxbrim Argan Oil for other things as well, like skin moistener and helping my nails.</li>
            <li> and I add it to other products I use.</li>
            <li> A small bit goes a long way, so only use a few drops.</li>
            <li> People must to know other opinions!&lt;br /&gt;Thanks</li>
            <li> Is that the &amp;#34;earthy/grassy/nutty scent&amp;#34; that&#x27;s referred to in other reviews?  </li>
            <li> I was looking for a moisturizer for my face during the winter since my other moisturizer stopped working (coconut oil and jojoba oil).</li>
            <li> It just felt like any other oil to moisturize the skin.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I look forward to testing some of the other applications.  </li>
            <li> found this oil was comparable to other oils I have used.</li>
            <li> And a little goes a long way!</li>
            <li> This was extremely  cloudy and lumpy.</li>
            <li> A little goes a very long way.</li>
            <li> It comes in a 2oz bottle which might not seem like a lot, but trust me a little goes a very long way.</li>
            <li> The scent is very minimal.  </li>
            <li> I was very curious as to how this would compare.  </li>
            <li> I expected a fresh, nutty smell, but it rather smelled like a chicken coop.</li>
            <li> With this colder weather I was having trouble with my hair and skin being dry and frizzy.</li>
            <li> I have used this as a leave in condtinor as my hair is always so dry and dead</li>
            <li> it smells a little like super 8 oil which isn&#x27;t bad and the labels different than the one you advertised.</li>
            <li> Unlike other products it doesn&#x27;t weigh my hair down or make it look greasy in any way .</li>
            <li> it is a little bit heavier, thicker  and a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I have stopped using conventional skin lotions and have replaced it with this product.</li>
            <li> Well not right after.</li>
            <li> Specially since I am a very insecure</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m also just not impressed with the results on skin, it doesn&#x27;t seem to improve it at all, and real argan oil is called &amp;#34;liquid</li>
            <li> I usually use a few drops mixed in with my face moisturizer</li>
            <li> A small drop or two goes a long way.</li>
            <li> Really like the faint scent this argon oil has.</li>
            <li> Skin - I use some expensive products that work very well on my skin.</li>
            <li> It came in a dark brown with a glass dropper attached to the cap to help you dispense the product.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve noticed the dark circles under my eyes have lightened.</li>
            <li> Maybe not as thick of an oil as the last one was.</li>
            <li> My hair is naturally curly and thick and gets frizzy with even a small amount of humidity.  </li>
            <li> I bought this product for my teenage daughter who has very thick and very long hair.  </li>
            <li> My cuticles are no longer dry, inflamed and ragged and well just a plain mess</li>
            <li> As I&#x27;ve aged, my hair continues to lose it&#x27;s youthful luster, and looks dry and dull.  </li>
            <li> Just a drop smoothes her hair down and gets rid of the flyaways.</li>
            <li> so when I finish in the kitchen and come to sit down, it&#x27;s there to put a bit on my hands.</li>
            <li> This company never lets me down with their products.  </li>
            <li> and it does not weigh the hair down or make it look oily.</li>
            <li> So much better than greasy, unpleasant smelled coconut oil (UH!)</li>
            <li> I did however use this for other things!</li>
            <li> also use A LOT of retinol based products on my face (trying to minimize wrinkles and other calamities associated with aging!)</li>
            <li> I’ll consider the other uses a BONUS!</li>
            <li> I thought it smelled unpleasant, but it quickly took on that nutty aroma that you expect from argan oil once I started rubbing it in.  </li>
            <li> No more dry patches.  </li>
            <li> and I have tried jojoba oil, coconut oil, avacado oil and rosehip oil previously.</li>
            <li> possibly exfoliate, if you&#x27;re serious about upping your skin care</li>
            <li> Makes my skin less puffy under my eyes.</li>
            <li> I bought this on Amazon at half the price (even with shipping) and twice the size.  </li>
            <li> The color is a very faint yellow, the normal color of argan oil.</li>
            <li> And my hair is much less frizzy with just a couple drops.  </li>
            <li> no more dry skin!</li>
            <li> For about a week and a half I have been applying this to my face after I shower and before bed, and sometimes to my hands and nails.  </li>
            <li> and it breaks less.</li>
            <li> Fill that baby up about half way.</li>
            <li> A lot less flecks of skin flaking</li>
            <li> My hair looks shinier and feels less damaged.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Even the black heads were going away.</li>
            <li> Regarding using the product for the hair, I did not noticed difference in hair growth, but what I realize that my hair became software, and fall less.</li>
            <li> The previous argan oil I bought from another brand cannot compare.  </li>
            <li> I have an itchy rash that&#x27;s being less on a nuissance to my face with this oil.</li>
            <li> It does have a slight odor</li>
            <li> and I get less frizz or static.&lt;br</li>
            <li> and I get less frizz or static.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The smell is a little off but nothing a little peppermint oil or other fragrance can&#x27;t fix</li>
            <li> When I read my previous face moisturizer ingredients list, I cringed.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t apply it straight onto dry or damp hair because I&#x27;m afraid it might make it too heavy, but that being said, if you have time to spare you</li>
            <li> Using it on my fingernails that are very dry!!!</li>
            <li> It flattens my hair and creates a sticky mess.</li>
            <li> My hair was quite damaged when I had my dark hair colored a few shades lighter.</li>
            <li> Helps for thick, long curly hair people.</li>
            <li> Smells a little odd</li>
            <li> From having dull lifeless hair, to frizzy, to dry with no shine at all since I decided to get myself a semi perm, yeah I didn&#x27;t like how my hair turned out.</li>
            <li> I like that it is not super greasy or messy.</li>
            <li> I used just a little on hair and face and no breakout (im oily and prone) and my hair didnt become oily.</li>
            <li> and I have to say the oil is doing just as well as the 85 dollars little jar -</li>
            <li> Just a little on my ends</li>
            <li> i also use a little bid on my hand.</li>
            <li> I have tried a few kinds of Argan Oil in the past and I love some and hate some.  </li>
            <li> S. . A. Little</li>
            <li> I found it a little greasier than I like.</li>
            <li> I apply it all over my body while my skin is still a little damp</li>
            <li> Unlike other oils I&#x27;ve tried in the past, this one is not greasy at all.  </li>
            <li> I have Alopecia Areata so while the Argan Oil does not help with my hair thinness it does give it that moisture and a little bit of fullness to it.</li>
            <li> , so I was a little disappointed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Little</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a multi-purpose oil and a little goes</li>
            <li> I ALSO USE A LITTLE IN MY HAIR.  </li>
            <li> So, I was a little apprehensive about oil.  </li>
            <li> I wash dishes by hand several times a day and my skin is also very dry from the cold, dry winter air.</li>
            <li> Seriously I can not beleive I lived without this for so long.</li>
            <li> – I put a little dab on my nails and cuticles and it helps with the peeling from being dried out.  </li>
            <li> If my locks look a little limp, I&#x27;ll put a drop or two in my palms and rub them together before rubbing my hands through my hair and scrunching the oil through.</li>
            <li> 52 years old with very dry skin in a cold, Chicago winter....</li>
            <li> I have used this oil on my face after a shower, on the cuticles of my nails, on the dry ends of my hair and even just on random rough spots of skin on other parts of my body.</li>
            <li> but I was having some serious dry spots</li>
            <li> Be wary of oil sold in clear or plastic ones as both can allow sunlight to hit the oil, causing rapid deterioration.</li>
            <li> I tried it for a few days on my hands and it seems to moisturize well.</li>
            <li> Been using it a few weeks.</li>
            <li> I have been using Foxbrim‘s Argan Oil for a few weeks now</li>
            <li> I also like to put it on my cuticles and nails to keep them from getting too dried out.</li>
            <li> i applied a few drops to my scalp and worked it through to the ends.</li>
            <li> too..gently massage few drops of oil around the cuticles and nails..</li>
            <li> but after few times of usage on my nails and hair, i have tried on my face .. before going to bed</li>
            <li> Now I use it everyday, morning and evening.</li>
            <li> These contents: Argan oil contains tocopherols (vitamin E), phenols, carotenes, squalene, and fatty acids, (80% unsaturated fatty acids)[5]</li>
            <li> and it got really messy.</li>
            <li> The texture is great--it  works well and absorbs into skin and hair, leaving a non-greasy feeling within a few minutes.</li>
            <li> I tried and I think it actually dried my lips</li>
            <li> using it everyday............</li>
            <li> I also mix a few drops in with hand lotion at night.</li>
            <li> complaint is where the inarticulate day to use 3 drops, I need to use 3 dropper-fulls (like 15 drops)&lt;br</li>
            <li> does go on oily but don&#x27;t worry; it will absorb in a few minutes.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Nails, hair, skin, face---a few drops can be beneficial to just about every part of you!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> They were peeling back in thin layers.  </li>
            <li> I use it on them everyday.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Argan oil for a few years and this is the nicest brand I&#x27;ve found.  </li>
            <li> It is non- irritating, and absorbs instantly.</li>
            <li> I use a few drops on my face after a shower, a few drops rubbed into the ends of my hair</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for a few weeks.</li>
            <li> A few drops is all that is needed.</li>
            <li> and I got this GREEN covered bottle as shown in picture.</li>
            <li> There seems to be a ton of ways to use this oil, of which the  bottle lists a few.  </li>
            <li> I use this item almost everyday.</li>
            <li> I use it everyday.</li>
            <li> It absorbs into the skin, isn&#x27;t greasy or heavy.</li>
            <li> my hair and a few drops keep it looking straighter longer.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It won&#x27;t go to waste.</li>
            <li> Just a few drops is all you need.</li>
            <li> I drop a few drops in my conditioner  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t leave my hair oily or greasy looking after applying and when my hair has dried.</li>
            <li> Not too heavy.  </li>
            <li> I use it everyday.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t rinse out quite as well as the coconut oil, I had to  lather and rinse twice, not a huge deal though,</li>
            <li> Leaves my hair so silky and less frizzy!</li>
            <li> doesn&#x27;t do as advertised for me, and there is a slight funky small</li>
            <li> have complained about other brands.</li>
            <li> While the oil penetrates the hair, I put four/five drops on the palm of my hand and slowly, with my other hand, massage my face and neck, when the oil has almost penetrating the skin, if I desire to apply make up, I do it.</li>
            <li> Or perhaps, not even argan oil and just plain corn oil.</li>
            <li> I like this oil - not strong smelling.  </li>
            <li> There was no strong odor or anything like that, so I was relieved.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s deffinitly help tame my hair</li>
            <li> Have to tell that washing hair is not easy task also.</li>
            <li> I can tell a real difference as I&#x27;ve not had painful hangnails or broken nails since the daily use of this oil!</li>
            <li> (I apologize if I misplaced it, but if I misplaced it, it&#x27;s just that I forgot where I hid it before my daughter visited!)</li>
            <li> I have tried quite a few kinds of Argan Oil in the past.  </li>
            <li> No matter how little I used it made my hair greasy!</li>
            <li> I used 3-5 drops on my foot every morning and in less than a week my foot was healed (no more peeling) and it was softer than it has been in years!  </li>
            <li> Since use I&#x27;ve had very little acne but took note this is also known to heal blemishes and minimize scaring.</li>
            <li> Use just a small amount and it doesn&#x27;t leave any oily feeing or oily appearance.</li>
            <li> so I really am not sure about this product yet.</li>
            <li> He has crazy curly hair and this tames it and makes it soft.  </li>
            <li> so not sure if it works, others I have tried had no smell</li>
            <li> Seems to be of same quality as the expensive Josie Moran I have been using</li>
            <li> Not sure how it will do on the skin.</li>
            <li> I have even notice that my nails are stronger than they were in the past</li>

            <li> Not sure</li>
            <li> It has made my face softer than it ever has been in the past without causing any sign of a breakout.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m going to try mixing a few drops into my zims crack creme lotion as well!</li>
            <li> I put a small amount on once in the morning and once at night, and my lips have never been softer.  </li>
            <li> I use Argan oil on my damp hair, after washing, and style as usual.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t usually write reviews</li>
            <li> We use it everyday!</li>
            <li> Its very heavy oil.  </li>
            <li> I have suffered from Acne since the age of 15, and have pigmentation scars, and a very uneven skin tone.</li>
            <li> Sorry folks at of FOXBRIM, I did make a mistake in confusing your brand with another, as the bottle pictured looks different from the one your company sent me.   </li>
            <li> My hair takes on a subtle sheen when I apply it by rubbing a few drops together with my hands and then working it through to the ends.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I really like that this is cold pressed!</li>
            <li> I constantly have dry skin during the winter and hate lotions that leave my hands oily.</li>
            <li> I searched out amazon and found Foxbrim to be the least expensive product while still being organic, cold pressed, and 100% pure.</li>
            <li> Leaves my hair soft as ever and doesn&#x27;t have a bad smell.</li>
            <li> The cold weather wreaks havoc on my skin, especially my hands and cuticles.</li>
            <li> I did put some in a spray bottle with water and didn&#x27;t notice anything negative.  </li>
            <li> I ordered this item late in the evening on Feb. 20, 2015.</li>
            <li> I have thick, curly hair</li>
            <li> OMG, my hair has slowly changed.</li>
            <li> it supposed to be so thick and goopy?&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I have also been rubbing the oil on a scar that is on my arm and it is slowly fading.</li>
            <li> I need a product like this for my thick often frizzy hair.</li>
            <li> I have thick hair and it tends to tangle a lot</li>
            <li> and I were a flat to one of the tours that gave me a nasty blister with exposed raw skin on the left foot.</li>
            <li> But just before I left, I put a few drops in my hand and the smell hit me :-(  </li>
            <li> If you have a small spray bottle, you have the secret way.</li>
            <li> The smell does dissipate and is not unpleasant but I am very disappointed with the oil itself.</li>
            <li> At this time, I’ll reserve this 60cc bottle for my dry hands, which desperately needs a solution.</li>
            <li> And if you&#x27;re on the fence because of cost, seriously, don&#x27;t worry.</li>
            <li> (believe me, I shopped around to a ridiculous extent-</li>
            <li> My hair is thin and dull.</li>
            <li> Does amazon knows you have been deleting bad feeds left from buyers???</li>
            <li> It does not weigh down my hair, as the Foxbrim Argan Oil is almost weightless, it also does not have a harsh or bad head-turning/stomach-turning smell.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s hard to find!</li>
            <li> I tried other brands and was actually shipped rancid oil, which was nasty.</li>
            <li> This product is very thick oil</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t broken out since using it on my face.  </li>
            <li> When it touches the skin you know it is a product you&#x27;ve never experienced before.</li>
            <li> I have not tried it on my hair as I have thin hair and think it would be too oily.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li> has a secret weapon\\</li>
            <li> Basically addicted to this product.</li>
            <li> I have Caucasian, thin, wavy hair</li>
            <li> I take skin care really seriously partly because I am always trying to keep acne away!</li>
            <li> The bottle itself dispenses the oil with a dropper which is extremely inconvenient as the oil is so watery that it is impossible to screw the dropper back on and close the bottle without the oil dripping off of your hand.</li>
            <li> I have noticed a dramatic increase in the growth rate of my nails and hair also.</li>
            <li> it has bad smell a little bit</li>
            <li> In summer my head sweats copiously and I look as if I&#x27;ve seen a bad vision, my hair jumps all directions and looks messy.</li>
            <li> it with some other base substance for improved results&lt;br /&gt;-Minimal</li>
            <li> No more painful yanking of hair brushes and</li>
            <li> I also used it as a base for a lip exfoliatant by adding sugar and just using my lips (slight pressure) to rub the mixture for about 30 seconds.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical about putting oil on my face, but the hype got to me, so I had to try it.</li>
            <li> My daughter introduced me to Argan Oil, which was sold by a well-known cosmetic company, expensive stuff.  </li>
            <li> Like the fragrance, the flavor is so faint with an after sweetness that makes Argan oil divine to taste.</li>
            <li> No impressive results after 3 months use.</li>
            <li> I am 64 and have tried all kinds of expensive face creams.</li>
            <li> The oil appeared cloudy and had a faint scent of burning rubber which I thought might be from the rubber dropper.</li>
            <li> My mother is addicted to this oil, and i will keep her in stock as well!</li>
            <li> You just can&#x27;t go wrong here.</li>
            <li> Although it&#x27;s summer my hands dry out very badly from washing dishes or washing them when they are dirty.  </li>
            <li> She still has horrible issues with dry patches on her face and neck, as well as in crease areas.</li>
            <li> I am so sick and tired of these lies</li>
            <li> As for other uses, I&#x27;ve tried this on the nasty tangles that both my daughters get after coming out of the shower.  </li>
            <li> If you haven’t noticed lately the buzz on beauty is all about OILS!!!  </li>
            <li> The smell it  stinks,</li>
            <li> This bottle is 100% argan oil, unrefined, virgin, and cold pressed.</li>
            <li> I like the fact that it is organic and cold pressed.   </li>
            <li> /&gt;Foxbrim 100% Organic Argan Oil  is a Cold Pressed Virgin Argan Oil, and Certified</li>
            <li> I can use it anytime without worrying that I may make my keyboard dirty.</li>
            <li> I remember my EX mother-in-law used to collect chicken droppings and put them into her flowers on her front porch as fertilizer.</li>
            <li> Another thing I like is that it&#x27;s EcoCert &amp; Organic Certified - no preservatives, chemicals or artificial fragrances used.</li>
            <li> started to need a moisturizer to put on in the cold weather.  </li>
            <li> When it arrived, it was leaking(I was unhappy about this) .</li>
            <li> Nothing to go wrong here!</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t go wrong!</li>
            <li> I was using Jose Maran Argan oil which is also cold pressed but very very expensive.  </li>
            <li> Has a bit of unpleasant smell which goes away after putting on skin</li>
            <li> Not sure if it had gone bad or if Argan oil just smells totally nasty.</li>
            <li> Additionally, the smell is on point--almost none, perhaps a very faint nutty smell.</li>
            <li> My hair is very difficult to style.</li>
            <li> I  was using the very expensive WEN fig oil.</li>
            <li> My seemingly impossible quest continues.</li>
            <li> They were peeling and snagging badly</li>
            <li> This doesn&#x27;t have a bad smell like some others</li>
            <li> BAD-</li>
            <li> Tames the frizz and doesn&#x27;t make me sick.</li>
            <li> I was disappointed in the smell.  </li>
            <li> Disappointed in it.</li>
            <li> I was so disappointed when I opened the bottle.  </li>
            <li> :-(</li>
            <li> YOU WILL NOT BE DISAPPOINTED...</li>
            <li> With this very cold weather it helps to put the argon oil on to keep skin from chaffing.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it as a base oil to mix with tea tree for a scalp treatment.  </li>
            <li> I hate those crappy  plastic droppers.</li>
            <li> The results are dramatic!!!</li>
            <li> My bad!</li>
            <li> Smells very bad and oily on skin.</li>
            <li> The worst patch on her neck is healed.</li>
            <li> I tried this on my hair and found it to be very annoying to style.</li>
            <li> This one smells horrible.</li>
            <li> This product smells awful!</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I have been using this Argan Oil for several weeks now and I really like it.  It feels so clean and pure.  You only need a small amount - it goes a long way.  I have been using it on my hands &amp; nails and about once per week on my hair &amp; scalp.  I am so glad I found this Argan Oil!</li>
            <li> I really like this Argan oil. I have used on my hair for a once week a treatment and also on my face for a dry patch that I had.</li>
            <li> This stuff works well for everything.&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend it</li>
            <li> Its light, not as thick as other oils. I tried it for a few days on my hands and it seems to moisturize well. There almost no smell to this oil which I liked. The slight smell it has isn&#x27;t very pleasant. Overall, I recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I love this oil.  I use it on my feet, hands, face and hair.</li>
            <li> I just started using this Foxbrim Argan oil and really like it.  It leaves my hands feeling smooth and it makes my hair feel silky and soft. I love the light and non greasy feeling. Absorbs fast. I would definitely reccommend.</li>
            <li> Been using it a few weeks. Like how it makes my face feel</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t stop putting this stuff on..it&#x27;s good for everywhere u are dry or just want extra goodness. So awesome..thank you</li>
            <li> After purchasing this product I have decided to forego any facial moisturizers which usually contain a combination of ingredients the effectiveness of which is questionable at best. I had originally bought the Argan oil to moisturize my eye area in addition to my facial cream but after trying it on my entire face, I noticed that my skin felt smooth and nourished like never before! The oil immediately soaks into your skin without leaving an oily shine. And the price does not compare to the costs of a good moisturizer! And knowing that it&#x27;s organic is another big plus!</li>
            <li> I love argan oil, but had never tried it in it&#x27;s pure form. A couple drops to your hair, face or body and you are on your way to healthy moisture. I applied two drops to my conditioner, it made my hair soft and manageable. Two drops to my palms and ran it through my hair, frizz be gone! Three drops, two times a day, added to my face care regimen and my skin is moisturized and soft. Four drops applied to my cracked, dry heels and I&#x27;m no longer having to peel them to keep it from catching on sheets and carpet. Argan oil is an amazing product that has so many healing properties for all parts of your body, it&#x27;s almost a cure-all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*I received a product free for review. All opinions are my own and 100% honest.</li>
            <li> I love this  for my nails and hands</li>
            <li> I have dry sensitive skin and I have tried jojoba oil, coconut oil, avacado oil and rosehip oil previously. Jojoba and avacado oil caused sensitivity/breakouts, coconut oil is not absorbed very well and rosehip oil was okay. Argan oil is very different than all the other oils I have tried. It totally absorbed by skin and not left a oily residue. Also no breakouts so far. I am using it over my moisturizer  or serum at night and wake up with a plumped skin. I am happy with my purchase.  Update: I am on my 3.th bottle and I am very happy with this oil.</li>
            <li> Love it, food for my hair and skin.</li>
            <li> I love this oil.  It&#x27;s a great moisturizer with a very faint earthy smell that fades quickly.  It applies easily and absorbs into the skin quickly.  I would definitely buy this again.  Debi B.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using argan oil for years, but I never thought about how it would be so awesome on beards! So I smacked some onto my hairy Sasquatch man...... his beard was itching and I had just gotten this sent to me to review and I had an AHA moment and told him to rub some into his beard. It soothed his skin, made him beard soft and shiny and made the skin feel moisturized, Now he would like to take it for over from me on a regular basis :-)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bonus tip for us ladies? Schmear this on your legs before shaving and you skin will feel like satin, the razor will glade, no nicks and NO ingrown hairs!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I RECEIVED THIS PRODUCT FREE IN EXCHANGE FOR THE HONEST REVIEW</li>
            <li> I am absolutely in love with this product. It&#x27;s fantastic. Use it on dry skin and cuticles, even my husbands nails. Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> Nice product. Smells good</li>
            <li> I am a huge fan of argan oil and can’t say enough good about argan oil. I never liked the greasy feeling on my skin or hair but as I am getting older my skin changed and started feeling the need. Little bit of argan oil can do whole lot. I use argan oil on my face day and night twice and it really helps. I mix argan oil and shea for my hands and foot and it works wonderful. I used to buy loccitane hand cream/foot cream and they work great but wanted to go with simpler ingredients instead of mixture of lots of things I don’t really need. I love that this one is cold pressed virgin argan oil and organic. I tried on my skin and it feels great just like I expected!</li>
            <li> I was skeptical about putting oil on my face, but the hype got to me, so I had to try it. Wow! It makes my skin feel like a new baby, and it is so easy to do. I don&#x27;t notice a smell at all. Go lightly. You don&#x27;t need much, and you&#x27;ll love the results.</li>
            <li> Eh, I&#x27;m not super impressed with this argan oil, it looks different from the picture shown on amazon, the bottle is amber though. The oil is a very light color and crystal clear (it should be cloudy) which makes me think its been refined and it doesn&#x27;t have that nutty aroma it should have. I wouldn&#x27;t purchase this again, it&#x27;s too expensive for an over refined argan oil, (I&#x27;d pay more though for the real thing and will) and when you refine argan oil all the good stuff that helps with your skin and hair gets ruined. I&#x27;m also just not impressed with the results on skin, it doesn&#x27;t seem to improve it at all, and real argan oil is called &amp;#34;liquid gold&amp;#34; for a reason, you should see results.</li>
            <li> This is amazing! I use it the night before and wash it out in the morning. Leaves my hair so silky and less frizzy!</li>
            <li> Great for frizzy hair. Also used as lip balm.</li>
            <li> I love this oil, I mix it with rosehip oil and other essential oils to make my own custom skincare blend. I love using it with lavender.</li>
            <li> Love love love this product! I use it on my face for a mosturizer, rarely using traditionalnlotions anymore. I use it on my lips instead of chapstick, and in my hair before bed and in the morning for moisture!</li>
            <li> This oil has been great for using on my skin and face. I usually use a few drops mixed in with my face moisturizer and I believe it has made a big difference in that smoothness and lessening if any slight wrinkles. I am 45 and still look like I am in my early 30s and this product helps me to achieve that.</li>
            <li> I used this on my hair and face. My hair is much more soft. I also used on my skin too and it makes it so soft. I love this oil and will be buying more.</li>
            <li> Love my Argan Oil!!! I&#x27;m glad a dropper came with it-I tend to waste products without a dropper. At the health food stores-you get 1 ounce &amp; no dropper at a much higher price.  On one shopping channel, they show the model putting it on her face &amp; then rubbing her hands together &amp; applying to hair-good idea.  It&#x27;s good for cuticles &amp; patchy dry skin too.  As I get older, I&#x27;m allergic to everything-not this oil. I received this at a reduced price for a fair review &amp; I will be shopping this company again.  Thank You!</li>
            <li> I love argan oil! This stuff is fantastic and can be used for so many health benefits. I have used this oil on my face after a shower, on the cuticles of my nails, on the dry ends of my hair and even just on random rough spots of skin on other parts of my body. It is super moisturizing and since this is pure argan oil, I feel like I&#x27;m putting only good things on my skin- no junk! You don&#x27;t need to use very much to see results.</li>
            <li> I like this oil - not strong smelling.  And I like that I haven&#x27;t broken out since using it on my face.  I&#x27;ve also tried it on my hair and it doesn&#x27;t leave my hair oily or sticky.</li>
            <li> I love Argan Oil!!! This product is amazing!! It makes my hair soft and manageable.  It controls the frizzys also!!</li>
            <li> Awesome product, so versatile,  I use it on my hair to eliminate frizz and as a moisturizer for my skin. It has a nice smell and does not leave my skin feeling greasy. Love it!</li>
            <li> great for my skin. my skin feels very moisturized</li>
            <li> My hair has never felt softer! Love!</li>
            <li> I like to use this on my hands and hair.  Not too greasy!</li>
            <li> Loved the light ungreasy feeling of Argan Oil to use on my hair face and nails.</li>
            <li> I prefer Watts Beauty Aragon Oil</li>
            <li> I recieved this super fast and it was very inexpensive with high quality.</li>
            <li> Just started using this for an itchy scalp and thinning hair and I am very surprised that it doesn&#x27;t make your head or hair greasy at all. So far so good. Hope it helps the hair to grow back too!</li>
            <li> I have recently discovered the many benefits of using Argan oil.  I use the Agadir shampoo/conditioner and gel, my new permanent hair product.  I have short, course, thick, naturally curly/frizzy hair, Argan oil infused products are perfect.  I was so impressed with how the texture of my hair has become healthy and manageable that I bought this oil to use on my skin.  I&#x27;m approaching my 6th decade so I have lots of dry areas, itchy skin, especially in the winter and a small patch of eczema on my back, this oil just soothes and conditions my skin without being oily or sticky, just soaks right in, feels clean.  No staining, love the smell and a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve happily been using Foxbrim Certified Organic 100% Pure Argan Oil for many of my skin care, hair care, and other beauty needs for the last month.  I like that it&#x27;s free from Parabens, Phthalates, Sulfates, and fragrances. When choosing an oil,  I always make sure it&#x27;s pure and not diluted by anything. The fact that it comes in dark bottle ensures that it filters out the suns ultra-violet light is good because it ensures the oil won&#x27;t lose it&#x27;s potency.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This Argan oil doesn&#x27;t dry my skin out yet it doesn&#x27;t leave it oily either. It&#x27;s high in vitamin E and essential fatty acids.  I like that it&#x27;s easy to apply with the glass dropper attached to the lid. The dropper is great because this oil can effectively be used quite sparingly. The oil is smooth and light absorbing quickly and not feeling greasy in the least bit. After application, I&#x27;m left with richly moisturized skin. I have total peace knowing that my skin won&#x27;t clog up and have an undesirable reactions.  I&#x27;m left with an attractively glowing rejuvenated look.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using this oil on my face at night time and also before I apply my make up.  It&#x27;s been great for my chapped lips which always seem to get way worse during the winter season.  Since use I&#x27;ve had very little acne but took note this is also known to heal blemishes and minimize scaring. My hands and nails have greatly benefited. I can tell a real difference as I&#x27;ve not had painful hangnails or broken nails since the daily use of this oil! My hair and scalp is also benefiting. I see and feel desirable changes, and that&#x27;s what keeps me continuing to use and praise this beauty product so much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I totally adore products that serve many purposes. It can even be used in home-made beauty products such as scrubs! As for a downside, I can&#x27;t think of one! The oil has many benefits and the price is excellent! You can&#x27;t beat $13.95 for a two ounce bottle. Also if you aren&#x27;t happy, there&#x27;s a 100% Money Back Guarantee.</li>
            <li> Excellent product!  I am glad I ordered 2 of them as it is very useful especially I live in the midwest, weather here is quite harsh for my skin, it also helps my grey hair..........I am also thankful for Dr. Oz  TV Show I wouldn&#x27;t even know what Argan Oil is all about...</li>
            <li> Your hair will shine with a small dab of argan oil, and your hands will look better too!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t usually comment on a product - however this one is absolutely amazing.  after the first day of using it on my face - folks were trying to figure out what was different about me...wow...</li>
            <li> worked wonders on my hair and skin!!!GREAT PRODUCT to mix with any holistic moisturizer !</li>
            <li> I was disappointed in the smell.  Its a mild smell, but I don&#x27;t find it pleasant.  I don&#x27;t know if I would buy again.</li>
            <li> I had looked at argon oil from a home shopping network.  Pricey.  So I am trying yours.  I am very satisfied with it.  Using it exclusively on my face, neck and back.  I am well pleased that I stay hydrated for most of the day.  Thank you.  I will reorder when I am out of the product.</li>
            <li> I really haven&#x27;t used this product long enough to review but what I find so far is a product that keeps my 60 year young skin soft. I&#x27;ve always tried and used great cosmetics so this was a Must to try.</li>
            <li> I love it! I always used hair products containing argan oil so I jumped at the chance to use the pure stuff. It worked just as expected. My hair is a lot more manageable and sheds less.</li>
            <li> Dry skin?  Dry hair?  Dry nails?  You just might need some Foxbrim 100% Pure Organic Argan Oil.  This cold-pressed oil, sourced directly from Morocco, is liquid gold for all your dry hair, skin, and nail needs.  This is an organic-certified and triple extra virgin oil with no additives, preservatives, silicones, fillers, or fragrances. 100% pure!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fresh, light, and fast-absorbing, this argan oil is great for my dry skin.  I like to apply it right after getting out of the shower and drying off.  This gives is the opportunity to seal in the moisture still on my skin and be completely absorbed by the time I get dressed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It really moisturizes my feet and heels as well as my elbows.

            <li> Great product &amp; seller</li>
            <li> This argon oil is awesome. I use it for many different reasons. My skin is soft, my hair more softer and smoother. This is truly wonderful. I loved reviewing this product</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this Argan Oil by Foxbrim.  It&#x27;s 100% pure and although I&#x27;ve only used it as a face moisturizer, I love how it gives my face a healthy glowing look...even under my makeup.  I&#x27;ve used this product for two days now and I don&#x27;t think I ever want to give it up when it comes to a face moisturizer.  This Argan Oil does not leave a greasy or oily feeling on my face like some Argan Oils or moisturizers and it only takes a couple drops for the whole face, which means, this bottle will last a very long time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I plan on using this on my heels, as I tend to have very dry and cracked heals.  This product is like a miracle in a bottle!  I love the fact that it contains no fillers, additives, parabens or silicones and is 100% pure and is derived directly from Morocco.  I am very very pleased with this product and can&#x27;t wait to see what it will do for my dry hair.</li>
            <li> My face is so refresh and i even use it on my hair. .</li>
            <li> This can be used in so many ways from your hair to your nails to your face and more</li>
            <li> I know it&#x27;s been popular for a while but I&#x27;m only just trying it out. I don&#x27;t use it for my face or hair but like it as a foot moisturizer.</li>
            <li> Works good on dry skin leaves a smoother feeling texture and look.</li>
            <li> Love it!  I like to add it to shampoo and conditioner.</li>
            <li> A few drops worked into the hair or added to your favorite face cream yields results! I have thick, curly hair so I love to use this as a pre-treatment before showering.</li>
            <li> Absolutely love this! It&#x27;s the best brand around --- Will always buy this brand! Fast Shipping too!</li>
            <li> Brah. I am ALL ABOUT this argan oil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When my friend told me about the &amp;#34;oil cleansing method,&amp;#34; I was like wuuuut. That&#x27;s cray. I didn&#x27;t believe in it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But it works, bros. It works.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is what you do: Order this Argan oil. Wash your hands. Squirt some of the oil into your hands and massage it into your face. Cover a clean washcloth in hot water. Pat it on your face and let the water/steam seep into your pores and clean dat oil out ur face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(Then possibly exfoliate, if you&#x27;re serious about upping your skin care game).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, I recommend this product. It is definitely useful in your life. Having soft supple skin is a very positive attribute to possess.</li>

            <li> Leaves my skin silky and smooth! I am also using it to banish my stretch marks.</li>

            <li> Very good quality product.  Goes into skin quickly. With this very cold weather it helps to put the argon oil on to keep skin from chaffing.</li>
            <li> It keeps my stray hairs in place, it takes care of one of my son&#x27;s eczema spots, and it helps with dry skin. I love this product. When you use it, it doesn&#x27;t leave an oily look. It soaks into the skin, and hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I got this product free for review. I&#x27;m a blogger that states my true opinion.</li>

            <li> I have been using Foxbrim‘s Argan Oil for a few weeks now and I’m really liking it! What is Argan Oil good for? A whole bunch of things! You can use it for your hair for one. It’s a natural conditioner and can help with the frizzies, split ends and shine. You can also use it on your nails to strengthen your nails and soften your cuticles, it’s also good for dry, cracked hands. You can use it on on you skin to make it supple and soft, it’s especially good on dry skin, like on your elbows. Also it can help reduce the appearance of stretch marks! You can also use it on your face, it’s supposed be good for inflamed skin and last but not least another use is using it as a pre-shave oil!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I didn’t use this on my face, since my face is fickle with straight oils. I did however use this for other things! The cold weather wreaks havoc on my skin, especially my hands and cuticles. I started using this on my cuticles and hands and it worked wonders. My cuticles are no longer dry, inflamed and ragged and well just a plain mess and my hands are soft again. I also like using a few drops in the bathtub, it keeps my body moisturized after and the oil absorbs really well. I’ve also used this off and on in my hair after shampooing as a leave in conditioner, I’ve also used it on my daughters hair. I use a boar brush on her hair when sends her hair flying all over the place. Just a drop smoothes her hair down and gets rid of the flyaways. My hair is wavy to slightly curly and is super dry and frizzy so using this as a leave it keeps it fairly smooth and it doesn’t look or feel so dry. My daughter has curly hair and when I use this on her hair after it’s towel dried it helps her curls stay smooth and curly. I also use a few drops with a heavy duty moisturizer on my feet and it helps the moisturizer absorb a lot better. This is a fantastic Argan Oil. I like that it’s organic and has no fillers or junk in it. It’s on sale right now so the price is fantastictic</li>
            <li> Got this product at an amazing discount to provide honest feedback. I have been wanting to try Argan Oil for awhile and can&#x27;t believe I got such a super deal!!! This stuff is soooooo good. You can use it for many different cosmetic applications. It makes hair, skin and cuticles very soft. Great for split ends!</li>
            <li> This Argan oil is amazing, helps for dry skin and hair and also works great as a beard oil!!!  Would definitely recommend!!!</li>
            <li> Using it on my fingernails that are very dry!!! It seems to really help!!!</li>
            <li> I love it!  A little bit goes a long way!</li>
            <li> This is my first experience with Argan oil and it extremely positive. I&#x27;ve used it on my face, nails, hands and hair and I find it to be pleasingly effective. There is no discernible odor and I will continue to use it.  A small drop or two goes a long way. This bottle should last a long time!</li>
            <li> I ordered this oil hoping to cure my receding hair at the temples.  Didn&#x27;t see much difference there. BUT I started applying the oil to my face and EUREKA my large pores started shrinking.  I couldn&#x27;t believe the results in just 5 days.  I&#x27;m 68 years old and believe me I was totally surprised by the results.  My pores have almost totally closed over.  Can&#x27;t wait to see what happens in a month.</li>
            <li> I really like this argan oil. I have been using it for a week now, on my body, face, nails, and hair. I can see a difference already.  My face is really soft now. My cuticles were dry and damaged and this oil is helping heal them. My hair looks better. I would defiently buy more of this only when it runs out. I got a sunburn and put some of this oil on it shortly and it helped clear up my sunburn in a couple of days.</li>
            <li> I used a discount code on this product and in return I am giving my unbiased opinion. I used his only for my hair. It made my hair really soft and shiny, which is just what I wanted!</li>
            <li> Seems to be a very good, clean and beneficial oil; with a handy dropper for the lid.</li>
            <li> Sorry folks at of FOXBRIM, I did make a mistake in confusing your brand with another, as the bottle pictured looks different from the one your company sent me.   The right review of your brand is that it is, hands down, one of the best Argan oils on the market today. It actually does exactly what it&#x27;s described to do for both hair and skin, and even have that familiar roasted nutty scent, as natural !00% argan oil is best known for. I&#x27;ve tried many other brands, and none come close to having all the positive characteristics that real argan oil is most famous for,  other than the 2 brands I&#x27;ve had the best experience with, you own FOXBRIM, as well as the MOGADOR brands, though I prefer the Foxbrim brand simply because it&#x27;s cost less to get the same results as with any of other 100% certified all natural brands that actually what they say they are.   And no, I&#x27;m not getting paid, nor free products for this review, but have actually lost money trying to find argan oil as authentic as  what I&#x27;ve experienced with finding this brand. So you can save yourselves the headache and lost of searching for anything better than what you have here that has already been proven to be among the best, real brands of argan oil out there in a crowded oil market.</li>
            <li> I typically use Argan Oil on my hair, and this oil is no different.  The first time I used it I took two full droppers and applied that to my hair.  Once my hair dried my hair felt soft and looked shiny without being oily.  I have been using this oil on my cuticles.  For both hands I only need a few drops.  The oil takes a long time to absorb this way and I&#x27;m pretty sure most of it rubbed off, but what was left behind left my cuticles looking a lot better than they were.  At this moment I haven&#x27;t dealt with my cuticles in a month, so you can imagine just how unruly they are!&lt;br /&gt;*I received a bottle for review.  Opinion is my own!*</li>
            <li> I add this to lotion and use it on arms and legs-it has great consistency, a light scent and soaks in nicely</li>
            <li> love it- makes my skin very happy and supple.</li>
            <li> Best oil for my curly course hair ever. I use this and some argon oil conditioner I have together for a &amp;#34;product&amp;#34; before styling.</li>
            <li> i use this for my scalp on wash day, my cuticles and my skin after showering. I use so much, i just love how moisturizes everything!</li>
            <li> Love this stuff. I use it daily as a face moisturizer and it makes my skin so soft and smooth.  It evens out my complexion</li>
            <li> I received the product for free, as part of a promotion, and in exchanged I’m providing my honest opinion. I’ve used the Argon oil for a month and I really like the product and the results. I have used oils as moisturizer for my body and face and I’ve seen great improvement that my skin; my skin is not as dry as it was before. It helps relieve the dry skin and gives a smooth and soft texture back. I’ve used several body lotions in the past but I have not found something that works well as the Argon Oil. It’s not like conventional oils that leave a greasy residue; it absorbs fast in the skin and is fragrance free. It’s very good and helpful skin product and I would recommend it to anyone especially to people that have sensitive skin because it is soothing to the skin and even on all skin types. This would be my third time that I have tried this product and it has given me great results.</li>
            <li> This argan oil is great . I have frizzy hair and it&#x27;s deffinitly help tame my hair and it also leaves my skin feeling silky and smooth.</li>
            <li> Suffering from rough hands this winter, I decided to try Dr. Oz&#x27;s advice and get some Organic Argan Oil. This product had the best review and not only that, it was the most reasonable by a bunch! After the first treatment my hands are noticeably softer. I keep it by my reading table so when I finish in the kitchen and come to sit down, it&#x27;s there to put a bit on my hands. It only takes a pea sized amount on the back of each hand to do both hands and my once very dry cuticles. I&#x27;ll never be without this stuff again. I love it!!!</li>
            <li> Having very long hair it&#x27;s hard to always find the right product to use. This oil is lightweight and gives the nutrients my hair needs to stay healthy. My nails keep the benefits as well from applying the oil to my hair which a bonus!</li>
            <li> Bought this to add to my growth aid.  Also plan to use it on my skin.</li>
            <li> Using 3 drops of this oil as a facial moisturizer morning and night has eliminated my blackheads completely. It is marvelous.</li>
            <li> If you haven’t noticed lately the buzz on beauty is all about OILS!!!  One of the most versatile oils in my opinion is Foxbrim’s 100% Pure Argan Oil.  It is amazing.  Because of the increasing popularity of Argan Oil, many companies are jumping on the argan oil bandwagon – so to speak.  When choosing an argan oil be sure to make sure it pure.  Foxbrim makes a 100% Pure Argan Oil that is Certified Organic.  The price is so inexpensive when you see what the product can do and how versatile it is, I consider it a steal. This one product does so many things.  I use it for the following;  Hair – I put an entire dropper full into my conditioner I use daily and it makes my hair shiny and look more healthy.  About once a month I put the Argan oil directly on my ends of my dry hair and let it sit for a about 30 minutes before washing it out.  Body – I put the argan oil into a spray bottle in the shower each time after I shower before I dry off, I put it on my body.  My knees get really dried out in the winter, this helps them so much.  Face – I use so many products on my face already, but I just started using foxbrim’s argan oil on my face.  It is making my skin softer.  Nails – I put a little dab on my nails and cuticles and it helps with the peeling from being dried out.  The oil is not greasy, it is absorbed into your skin upon contact.  I will say if you use too much oil on your hair, it will get greasy.  Remember a little goes a long way.  Foxbirm has made a  wonderful product.  Update - my 2nd bottle and I absolutely love this oil!!!!  Foxbrim is an amazing company!!!!</li>
            <li> Extra moisturizing for face and hair. A little goes a long way</li>
            <li> This products absorbs quite well and it does moisturize. It&#x27;s good for dry ends on your hair, your dry skin, or cuticles.</li>
            <li> My face loves this oil!  I feel years younger.  Even my husband noticed!!</li>
            <li> Have used product for a month.Started using it on my cuticles which in turn strengthened my nails.  One long discolored nail has been restored to its natural color! ☺ I&#x27;m trying other uses suggested on the label.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product on my dry heels on both of my feet and it&#x27;s doing a great job of bringing back some softness to the touch.  As for other uses, I&#x27;ve tried this on the nasty tangles that both my daughters get after coming out of the shower.  No more painful yanking of hair brushes and this does a good job separating the hair for an easier brush-through.</li>
            <li> Very good oil. Will be continuing to order this product. Have introduced my friends as well to this oil and now they are hooked. Besides the amazing use for your skin this is a life saver for any girl with frizz hair problems. It has replaced having to use a handful of products daily to only needing a couple drops of this oil applied to hands and ran through hair.</li>
            <li> Excellent product! This quality of this Argan oil is superb. I would definitely reorder again.</li>
            <li> Works great on frizzy hair. Use just a small amount and it doesn&#x27;t leave any oily feeing or oily appearance.</li>
            <li> This product was pretty good. Used it for skin care as moisturizer, gave me a glow and worked well on my skin. I will buy again and again.</li>
            <li> Great product, you need so little for it to work wonders, definitely a good buy.</li>
            <li> Not sticky, very light in consistency and the smell is mild.</li>
            <li> Use this on both my hair and face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Feels really good.</li>
            <li> I will certainly buy it again. There is a marked improvement on my facial skin with the use of Argan oil and the results started to show from the first week of usage.</li>
            <li> skin SUPER FOOD! Rejuvenate skin with a pure, nourishing, organic oil pressed from the kernels of the argan tree, native to the desert of Morocco. Rich in Vitamin E, Essential Fatty Acids, and Proteins, Argan Oil helps fight lines and  repair imperfections. often referred to as &amp;#34;liquid gold&amp;#34; so get yourself some beauty bling.</li>
            <li> I am using this for my hair. It definitely helps with the frizz. Some were complaining of the smell and I think it&#x27;s very light and it dissipates quickly. I would recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I was amazed at how just a small amount will moisturize your entire body. It stays moisturizing for a long time without any greasy feeling. I have stopped using conventional skin lotions and have replaced it with this product.</li>
            <li> I have just started using as a face moisturizer. So far so good</li>
            <li> I love this Argan oil! It has so many uses and you only need a small amout so it lasts forever.  I especially like to use it to smooth my hair.  I also like to put it on my cuticles and nails to keep them from getting too dried out.</li>
            <li> My family loves this organic Argan oil! I use it on my face and as a hair treatment and my husband uses it on his beard. Super soft hair and skin with no clogged pores or greasy feel. It&#x27;s wonderful!</li>
            <li> Yes, one of my favorite organic oil. Every since I found the organic essential oil products, I&#x27;m no longer getting the store bought name brand beauty products. When there are so many natural formula can choice why chemicals. I apply argan oil right after I washed my hair, rub few drops at the end of the hair and while there are still some oil left massage the scalp. Great product! Love it!</li>
            <li> I have tried so many naturals oils for my face and body. This organic argan oil  superseded my expectations! Excellent product!</li>
            <li> love Argan oil. very best moisturizer for my face and has improved my skin so much since I started using it. It also very quickly healed a scar I had from a recent surgery. Even the doctor was surprised. The fact that it is organic makes it even better! This is all I need for my face and I am so glad I discovered it. A little dab in your hair makes it behave better also. My favorite beauty product.</li>
            <li> My wife loves this oil, very affordable and makes the hair very shiney!</li>
            <li> This is the greatest thing for hair I have ever seen!!!  It just takes a minute amount to have your hair shiny, frizz free, and soft, soft soft</li>
            <li> I am very happy with this product so far.  I have given a bottle to my daughter and I am waiting to hear how she feels.</li>
            <li> Saw the reviews on this Argon Oil and decided to purchase it for use on my daughters skin. She has dealt with eczema spice she was about a year old. She is now 14 and all the medications are not working. She still has horrible issues with dry patches on her face and neck, as well as in crease areas. We have tried just about everything on the market. She has been using this for a couple of weeks and wow!!!! We can already see a difference. The worst patch on her neck is healed. The Meds didn&#x27;t work that quick. I am sold on this product and will continue to reorder as long as it continues to work. Very pleased!!!</li>
            <li> Great stuff!  My daughter introduced me to Argan Oil, which was sold by a well-known cosmetic company, expensive stuff.  I bought this on Amazon at half the price (even with shipping) and twice the size.  I also bought one for my daughter.  We both raved about it to each other.  It goes on very smoothly and easily and we wear it under our foundation (made by the well-known cosmetic company), and we get a very dewy, fresh look.  I had two areas of slight dryness on my face, and after two days the dryness just peeled right off.  I would highly recommend this product!!!  Can&#x27;t say enough good things about it.</li>
            <li> This is one of the best products I have tried for my hair and skin. Love how it leaves my hair feeling stronger and my skin non-greasy!</li>
            <li> I have acne-prone, sensitive skin so I was worried to put oil on my face but I was having some serious dry spots so I tried it and I&#x27;m SO glad I did. After just a couple weeks of using this not only are my dry spots gone but i have had ZERO breakouts from this stuff. I use 4 drops before bed and mix one drop in with my primer in the morning.</li>
            <li> wonderful product, very fast absorbing. love the feel aftee applying. fast shipping too!</li>
            <li> I could see a difference in my skin the first time I used this oil and it just keeps getting better! I LOVE it. It only takes a couple drops. I also use it on my hands, nails and it makes my hair shine with-out being greasy.</li>
            <li> Excellent. Loving it !!!</li>
            <li> I love this oil. The product is light..easy to absorb and my skin feel so soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> I have textured dry damaged colored hair and this product works amazing.  I used it in the evening on towel dried hair and when I woke up my hair was soft and almost frizz free.  I applied a few more drops in the morning and finished styling my hair.  My hair remained soft and shiny throughout the day.  I highly recommend this product for anyone who wants healthy looking shiny hair.</li>
            <li> I bought this for a specific reason and have actually fallen in love with it for an altogether different one.  I&#x27;m using it on my hands regularly and it is really helping them NOT look like something that escaped from a mummy&#x27;s tomb!  I&#x27;ve been shuffling through a lot of old paperwork, while cleaning out my garage and my hands have paid the price.  This stuff is magical!  When I put the first dropper full in the palm of my hands, I thought, &amp;#34;Oh Brother!&amp;#34;, I&#x27;m going to be rubbing this into my skin for the next 20 minutes and then will probably have to blot off the excess!  But no!  It has no odor.  It is perfectly clear and rubs in without any residue, unlike some of the very popular, super moisturizing, heavy lotions on the market!  The feature I just described is my FAVORITE thing about the argan oil, but I&#x27;m open to discovering others!  I&#x27;ve also started using it on those inevitable vertical little creases on our upper lip that remind us that &amp;#34;time marches on&amp;#34;!  We&#x27;ll see how that works?!  A very satisfied customer, thank you.</li>
            <li> This product works very well, it leaves my hair very soft. It is actually 100% argan oil so that made me even happier.</li>
            <li> Too much for my hair but excellent on my face !!!  Feels good and really helps my facial skin....and you need so little that it is vey economical compared to so many facial creams on the market. I WILL be trying to use it for even more things !!!  Happy with my purchase. After using this product for  while I have found it works Excellent on my neck and chest !!!  I still use it on my face but now also use my regular face cream and only a small amount of the oil. I am really liking how my neck looks better.</li>
            <li> Purchased with discount. This Argon Oil works amazing! Even used it on my chapped lips and my dry feet! Definitely repurchasing!!!</li>
            <li> Advance oil is a great product and mixes well with any type of hair or skin product or is good alone. Nothing better for your skin.</li>
            <li> This argan oil smell ok..i cant smell any nutty smell though but overall a little oily but this should be natural since is oil. I have no breakout when i use it together with moisturiser.</li>
            <li> Its simply great, nothing to add.</li>
            <li> Amazing- this is my first experience with Argon Oil and I am very pleased. I even bought an extra bottle for a guy at my local hardware store who has chronic dry skin!</li>
            <li> Wonderful product! So much better than putting chemicals on your body.</li>
            <li> Will be ordering again. I love argan oil but this one seems to be the best I have used so far.</li>
            <li> i used this product before washing my hair earlier. i applied a few drops to my scalp and worked it through to the ends. i finished with my regular wash. i could definitely tell a difference in my hair. it was much softer and felt great. amazing purchase!</li>
            <li> mine came with a pick label..overall it is a really good products and works well on my face. i put it on at nice with other essential oils but remove it in the am..(sleep with a towel on my pillow) and it makes my skin look younger and plump..</li>
            <li> Smells clean and absorbs very quickly! I would highly recommend this product and will purchase it again!</li>
            <li> I love it love it love it, its great stuff, thankyou sooo much</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only started to use this product but I love using it as a moisturizer. It makes my face so soft and if you give it 5 mins or so after application, it does not leave your face oily at all. It also holds powder well so I can skip foundation and go straight to the transluscent powder and my face will be bright all day. I also saw the difference in my nails. it made them stronger.</li>
            <li> Excellent quality oil and tamed the frizzy hair. We&#x27;ve been using this oil for over a week. We love it and it makes our hair shiny, not oily, but shiny and healthy looking. Good size bottle and should last us both a long time.</li>
            <li> I have been going through Cancer treatments and right now I have no hair, so I have been rubbing this Argan Oil on my scalp in the evenings and on my face. So I am so soft and smooth all over. Love your product !</li>
            <li> Great all over moisturizer!</li>
            <li> My hair, Skin, Nails all are becoming healthier. I bleach my hair often and it was able to bring it to life again. It works amazingly. Recommended.</li>
            <li> Put a couple drops in lotions I already have.  It doesn&#x27;t magically make wrinkles disappear, but my dry skin feels moister.</li>
            <li> Quick delivery. Product works well.</li>
            <li> My scalp is really dry this oil has been a blessing it hasn&#x27;t flaked up and I am loving IT</li>
            <li> It is excellent, I am using it for one week but I can see the effect! awesome!</li>
            <li> fantastic oil for skin and face</li>
            <li> 100% Pure Certified Organic Argan Oil  makes my skin feel so soft and smooth. Doesn&#x27;t clog my pores or feel &amp;#34;oily,&amp;#34; I&#x27;ve been using it for about 2wks &amp; whoa my skin greatly improved, the dry patches disappeared. My skin became supple and moist. Definitely recommend!</li>
            <li> I have to agree this stuff smells funky. I added some essential oils to help. Makes my skin feel soft. I used just a little on hair and face and no breakout (im oily and prone) and my hair didnt become oily. Whether it is better than jojoba i cant say thus far.</li>
            <li> Well I bought it for my mother and she loves it awesome 😀</li>
            <li> Product is nice but I feel it is bit oily....otherwise it is a very nice product</li>
            <li> Very happy with the results recommend it to friends, will buy again</li>
            <li> Love this oil. I notice a lot of direct sales selling similar product anymore. Good buy and great price.</li>
            <li> I got Argan oil for my nails.  So far so good.  They were peeling and snagging badly but I need more time to see if it will really help.  I can state that it works on my face for a moisturizer quite well.</li>
            <li> Use this oil for the ebd of my hair. I have very long fine hair. My scalp gets very oily but my ends are dry and will split. I put the oil on the ends of my hair and braid my hair before going to bed. Have been using for about a month and it has helped my hair.</li>
            <li> I love it. I&#x27;ve bought other brands in the past, and so far this one is the best.  Plus.. it don&#x27;t have that nutty smell like some of the other brands.</li>
            <li> I have just started using it so I really am not sure about this product yet. I do find it to be a bit runnier than the other Argan Oil I have used.</li>
            <li> I love this oil! I use it for my face and so far no break outs and my skin is always soft afterwards!</li>
            <li> Really great stuff! I use it for my hair and skin!</li>
            <li> I love the product. Has many uses. Would highly recommend!</li>
            <li> great product, I use it on my face and hands at night before bed and also use it as hair oil every week.</li>
            <li> best stuff for my face and hair. bought a 2nd bottle. non greasy .</li>
            <li> Nice product,will buy it again.</li>
            <li> I like this product have used it previously, I put on face, hair and dry spots.  Very good oil</li>
            <li> Great product!  Arrived quickly and works wonders on my hair.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only been using the oil for a couple of weeks so don&#x27;t know full benefits as yet but I can say my skin feels very much softer and I&#x27;m hoping I&#x27;m not imagining a lessening of some wrinkles. A friend of mine uses only this oil on her face and her skin is flawless at age 71! Crossing my fingers for the same results with continued use!</li>
            <li> I use this head to toe! Leave in conditioning smooth sleek shine no frizz! Health care worker so hands are always dry cracked, wonderful For it And cuticles as well as though rough dry yucky heals!!</li>
            <li> Love it!  Gives my face beautiful texture!</li>
            <li> The many glowing reviews speak volumes. I think it is partly due to Foxbrim&#x27;s superior customer service and request for a follow up. Here&#x27;s mine! I did a lot of research about how genuine argan oil is supposed to feel, smell and look and this is the real deal. I lovvvve, love the way it instantly plumps up my skin-- it is the richest oil I have ever used. I use 4 drops of jojoba oil on my face for daily use, and will add 1-2 drops of argan for especially dry days. I use it on my under-eye area and the sensitive parts of my face. I take skin care really seriously partly because I am always trying to keep acne away! Moisture is the most important thing I have found the keeps my skin happy and mostly acne-free. This is excellent argan oil at a great price. I say go for it!</li>
            <li> This oil moisturizes skin and hair and absorbs without leaving and oily residue. I thought it smelled unpleasant, but it quickly took on that nutty aroma that you expect from argan oil once I started rubbing it in.  Discounted sample provided for review.</li>
            <li> I just love this oil and love that it&#x27;s truly clean (organic)!</li>
            <li> Fast shipping great product.... Will definitely buy again.</li>
            <li> Been using this on my hair is it&#x27;s wonderful. Makes my hair shinny, soft, and smooth. Sometimes I&#x27;m too busy (3 toddlers) and skip using conditioner step, but later uses this and it&#x27;s doesn&#x27;t matter if I skip using conditioner.</li>
            <li> Fantastic product; I love it! I also received excellent tips from the seller, as well. I am very pleased! Thank you so much!</li>
            <li> I was looking for a lower cost alternative to Josie Maran (which I like), and this seems to be a great dupe for that.  It&#x27;s not first cold pressed, but it&#x27;s organic, and seems to be an excellent quality. I use it mixed with jojoba oil on my legs after shaving, on my dry aging neck in the winter, and mixed with some tea trea oil in my hair (still not as good as Wen hair oil$, but infinitely cheaper).</li>
            <li> it comes in a 60ml glass bottle,carefully packed with bubble wrap,so it reached me safely...:) it smells a bit different though,but i am ok with the smell.  first i started using this on my nails..as my hands are more dry..i apply few drops of argan oil on my hands and massage gently,it absorbs very quickly into my skin leaving my hands soft and smooth,it works best as a cuticle oil. too..gently massage few drops of oil around the cuticles and nails..ou will definitely love the glow !! I have oily hair..so after washing my hair with shampoo and conditioner,before blow drying i apply few drop on my hair concentrating more on rots,it leaves my hair smooth and silky,and works goo as a heat protectant  which is always a bonus .as i said earlier i have very sensitive skin,i was scared to apply on my skin for the first few days..but after few times of usage on my nails and hair, i have tried on my face .. before going to bed i applied few drops on my face and massaged ,it is so moisturising and good,i love my skin when i wake up in the morning i was provided a sample for review..my opinions are honest though</li>
            <li> Looooove this oil! It is super cheap compared to other oils I&#x27;ve looked at. All-natural and leaves my skin soft and smooth. I was having dry patches on my face and this cleared those right up! Will be repurchasing.</li>
            <li> I have been using Argan oil to treat rosacea and pimples and dry skin for quite a while. I also use it as a makeup primer. Foxbrim Argan oil is by far the most effective in all those categories. I have used it for about a week and I don&#x27;t notice a smell like I do with other brands. Now I&#x27;m using it to control fly aways and have discovered it is a pretty decent hair moisturizer. My hair takes on a subtle sheen when I apply it by rubbing a few drops together with my hands and then working it through to the ends.&lt;br /&gt;My face is clear! It really helps with many skin and hair issues. I used to have oily skin and Argan oil has helped to clear redness,lesions and control the oil. This brand is a good one. I do recommend it.</li>
            <li> I use it under the face cream day and night. Helps for very dry skin, but not by itself.</li>
            <li> I was using a more expensive product that has a model&#x27;s name attached to it but found that this is just as good!  Love it!</li>
            <li> So far so good.  I am using this product on my hair and I do notice that my hair is not as dry and very moisturized.</li>
            <li> Used it for dry scalp and hair oils moisturizer.</li>
            <li> I really like this product. It came on time, was well packaged, and everything that I expected.</li>
            <li> very happy with this purchase. i was using josie maran brand argan oil and made the switch to foxbrim - seems to be exactly the same and much cheaper.</li>
            <li> like how my hair feels.</li>
            <li> Amazing customer service. Will be a customer for years to come. I&#x27;m very happy.</li>
            <li> Nice product and quick delivery. I love this stuff!  I like to mix it in my moisturizer. It works really well.</li>
            <li> Love this oil so much! My hair is so shiny and silky and hydrated! I have curly hair that is on the dry side and this product really helps it&#x27;s shine and frizziness.</li>
            <li> Really like the faint scent this argon oil has. I have been using it to smooth my hair with nice results. I also like using it on my cuticles, leaves the skin smooth but does not feel too oily.</li>
            <li> Wonderful product.  I had never used Argan oil before, and received a sample with a purchase of shampoo.  I immediately knew this oil would be a great addition for me.  The product was shipped quickly and I received it within a couple of days.  Now I use it everyday, morning and evening.</li>
            <li> Foxbrim has provided another quality organic and pure product! This argan oil works great for hair, skin, and nails. My nails and cuticles are much healthier since I started using this oil as a part of my night time regimen. I put a couple of drops on my hands, massage them together, and then run my hands through my hair, and my split ends have definitely improved as a result of this routine. I made a &#x27;spritz&#x27; for my mother to try, using a spray bottle with distilled water with a couple of drops of Argan oil, and I&#x27;m sure it will work wonders for her frizzy hair. I love the smell, but it is a bit &#x27;earthy&#x27;, which may not be loved by everyone. For anyone wanting and needing organic and pure oils, the smell will not offend you, and you will probably love the slight aroma it has.</li>
            <li> Love it!!  Will reorder again!!</li>
            <li> i am using it as carry oil for my essential oil massage.  goes on very sooth.</li>
            <li> I love this product! I&#x27;ve noticed a difference in my hair and skin right away. I&#x27;ve never had such smooth hair or body</li>
            <li> Love this for my hair! Dries naturally with healthy shine! ( blonde with processed hair) just a drop while wet keeps the Grizzlies at bay!!!! Also use this on my face as a moisturizer!! Doesn&#x27;t cause me to break out;)</li>
            <li> use this each night...product claims are real and reproducible...</li>
            <li> I got this product for one dollar to review. This did not affect my review in anyway. This was a very nice Argun oil it made my hair feel very soft.</li>
            <li> I love, love, love Argan oil (I&#x27;m s bit obsessed). That being said, this product is my new obsession!</li>
            <li> This is GREAT it takes care of many problems.my husband&#x27;s cracked hands. I use it for my feet,my hands . I even shared this with a friend and she loved it,so I ordered a second one for her birthday..I love the fact that when you put it in your hands it feels warm and then you can apply it.</li>
            <li> I use this on my son&#x27;s hair.  He has crazy curly hair and this tames it and makes it soft.  You only need a few drops.  It doesn&#x27;t have a smell.</li>
            <li> I love foxbrim, their customer service is great, I have always gotten quick replies when I contacted them for recommendations for my skin issues.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have used this Argan oil for many different things. A friend passed along a coupon for this oil recommending I try it out, and I am very glad I did.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hair: I use this as a leave in, and I use only 2-3 drops through my whole hair, which is long, while it is damp but not soaking and not dry. This is enough to make it shiny and soft and great to use prior to blow drying to using the flat iron. It leaves my hair silky smooth. I put the drops into my palm, rub them around together, and then just run my hands all throughout my hair. It does not leave my hair greasy just soft and silky. That is all you want to use if you are leaving it in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nails: Oh best thing for cuticles, my cuticles love me, and especially with the weather changes I just love using this on my cuticles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As a carrier oil: I use tihs as a carrier oil for my essential oils and it makes a lovely carrier oil which I put into roller balls. It is one of my favorite carrier oils because it absorbs so well and it nice on the face and doesn&#x27;t cause break outs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oh and this is  100% Pure USDA Organic Argan Oil&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Feel free to check out my other reviews as I am getting around to reviewing all my essential oils (which is a lot). You also will likely find the reviews for other products I use with my essential oils such as rollerballs, carrier oils, inhalers, carrying cases, diffiusers, etc. I didn&#x27;t buy all through amazon, some were purchased from the sellers website, so I may not show up as a verified reviewer on some, but I am only reviewing products I own and have tried.</li>
            <li> Love this product!  After a few days, my skin is no longer flaky and my makeup goes on much more smoothly.  Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> Have only used it on my hair and it worked great!</li>
            <li> I am pleased with this purchase .... great price and product. It is just as effective as an overpriced brand offered by a TV sales channel</li>
            <li> This product is 100% pure satisfaction. I am a PhD organic chemist and I love the sense of pure organic oils. When it touches the skin you know it is a product you&#x27;ve never experienced before. It is supple, clear, clean, and it has a faint aromatic fragrance. Like the fragrance, the flavor is so faint with an after sweetness that makes Argan oil divine to taste. These contents: Argan oil contains tocopherols (vitamin E), phenols, carotenes, squalene, and fatty acids, (80% unsaturated fatty acids)[5] The main natural phenols in argan oil are caffeic acid, oleuropein, vanillic acid, tyrosol, catechol, resorcinol, (−)-epicatechin and (+)-catechin are rich in nutrients and flavor rich constituents. I hope the use of this product will become more common in this country. The price is prohibitive for most of us to use it as one of the oils in the kitchen.</li>
            <li> Great company to buy from. Quality product.</li>
            <li> I use this oil in my OCM and I love it! The price is right and it arrives quickly.</li>
            <li> After receiving another brand of Argan oil that smelled rancid, I took a chance and ordered a different brand... WOW what a difference!  I have been using the oil morning and night since I received it. It has changed the skin on my face. I used to be very oily with some weird dry patches. The dry patches are GONE and it has helped control the amount of oil my skin produces. I had no breaking out or anything at the beginning. I would recommend this oil to everyone! 20+</li>
            <li> I love this stuff. Feels good anywhere. Great price. Organic too.</li>
            <li> Argan oil works great to moisturze skin. A little goes a very long way. Just recently head of the brand Foxbrim. I love that ts all natural. I will defanately buy more, great overall experience!</li>
            <li> I love Argan oil it is really good and to have it organic is the best part, I received this complimentary and in exchange I agreed to give my honest opinion about the product I really love how it conditions the hair leaving it very soft and manageable its also great as a moisturizer without all the bad chemicals the smell is light now strong so I love this</li>
            <li> Just as advertised.  Nothing to go wrong here!</li>
            <li> Love it for my hair and for my nails. Not much else I can say except it&#x27;s a product I use every day and I really cannot go without it.</li>
            <li> I love this oil, I&#x27;m using it as a face moisturizer.</li>
            <li> Great size bottle for the price!</li>
            <li> Have been using this for a week now and I love it! I can tell a noticeable difference in the softness of my hair (applying a couple drops after shower to damp ends) and returned moisture to feet  (a couple drops rubbed into feet @ bedtime then sleeping with socks on.)</li>
            <li> Many people rave about Argan oil, and so I had been wanting to try it for some time. I have sensitive skin with eczema, and I was hoping this would be helpful in alleviating the redness. However, it just didn&#x27;t work out too well for my skin. I broke out in an itchy rash on my face. I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s possible to have an allergy to Argan oil, but something about it reacted with my skin. I also found my skin to be a bit greasy after using it. This is not to say that it isn&#x27;t a great quality product for many people, though, but my skin has a tendency towards sensitive reactions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the bright side, this Argan oil worked great on my cuticles.</li>
            <li> Just what I was looking for, works great on my skin. Great seller, fast ship.</li>
            <li> It was expired when I got it.</li>
            <li> Love love love this Argan oil. have used it on my hair, lips and dry skin, it feels great, and the smallest amount, just a couple drops is all thats needed. The glass dropper is great for getting just the desired amount. Would recommend this product to anyone. Has so many uses and works amazing</li>
            <li> It is exactly what it says it is. Pure and good product. It comes witha  dropper so you can control how much you use. I use it for my skin.</li>
            <li> great product, just starred to discover all the uses for it, but 1 amazing thing the maker sent me an emailing telling me all about the product and how to use always info to contact them with questions. thought that war awesome</li>
            <li> I LOVE IT! I never used oil before and this was my 1st one experimenting with. Not even 3 weeks and its halfway gone! I have very dry skin on my ankles, elbows and heels. I used this and after the first few days I could see a big difference. I even use this on my hair when I can not style it the right way and it helps me tame my fly a ways. This is something I do recommend to all with hair and skin problems..</li>
            <li> Great quality and great cost performance, I just love it.  This is the second bottle after months of usage of the first one. I use 6 drops after moisuturizer on my face at night. Then I see supple skin with natural glow next morning. The oil does not leave any gleasiness since the oil sinks in quickly. I also love to put 3 drops of the oil on my clean, dry hair. This small portion does an amazing magic. Usually next day, my hair feels soft, shiny, and easy to handle. Will buy again after the second bottle is finished.</li>
            <li> I am using it on my grandson&#x27;s hair as well as my own. It really helps condition his dry course hair.</li>
            <li> I guess it&#x27;s good.  I have no problem with it.</li>
            <li> This is an outstanding oil. I use it every morning and its perfect. I love how it smells and feels. Great purchase. Thanks.</li>
            <li> The smell it  stinks, so not sure if it works, others I have tried had no smell</li>
            <li> I really like this oil. I usually used coconut oil since I started wearing my hair natural (I always have but I used to flat iron my hair) I started using Argan oil because all the natural hair yourubers loved to use it in their homemade conditioners etc. so I thought I&#x27;d give it a try. I like that this comes with the built in dropper it is super easy cause other oil I used didn&#x27;t have this and it got really messy. The oil keeps my hair moisturized and shiny. It has a nice smell too. Great product. I received this free to review.</li>
            <li> Great price, fast delivery. Pure Argan oil soaks into face, skin and nails.</li>
            <li> This bottle is 100% argan oil, unrefined, virgin, and cold pressed. Thats everything i look for in an oil like argan. Its the healthiest way to apply an oil to your face. I use argan oil on my face and hair and its such a great way to hydrate your skin and keep it looking healthy, bring back that healthy glow we all want. Foxbrim staff are so helpful and even provide more insight and instructions on how to use their products and the benefits they bring. I really love this company and their high quality products. These are completely my honest opinions for trying this product, if you have questions please feel free to ask me any.</li>
            <li> I love how this oil makes my face feel.</li>
            <li> A friend recommended argon oil for me to use in my hair to keep it from locking up and remove frizzy ends. I searched out amazon and found Foxbrim to be the least expensive product while still being organic, cold pressed, and 100% pure. Shared link with friend and they were jealous on how cheap, half the cost they paid, for similar product. Product comes with an eye dropper, but I found putting a spray bottle top from one of my travel bottles fit great and delivered the product better for my hair. Use sparingly it goes a long ways. I have also used on my face and feels great.  Update - This Oil is just great. Have purchased multiple bottles for friends and family.</li>
            <li> For some reason, doesn&#x27;t work for my nails or hands. Still dry despite applying every night for 2 weeks</li>
            <li> I use this oil for de-frizzing and conditioning fine, fragile hair-- it works amazingly well.  Unlike other products it doesn&#x27;t weigh my hair down or make it look greasy in any way . Follow the valuable directions of another reviewer and fill a small spray bottle half way with water, then add a dropper full of oil.  Shake thoroughly and spray on wet hair--experiment with the amount needed for your hair.  This wonderful product has eliminated my need for any other conditioners, which worked poorly as well as weighing my hair down.</li>
            <li> I use this oil on my hair. As the owner of very coarse, curly hair I am always on the lookout for styling solutions that are pure. This stuff is wonderful! Just enough weight to keep my hair under control. Bonus points for the added shine.</li>
            <li> This is a great product for a great value!</li>
            <li> Love this product. I have completely stopped using cream moisturizer and only use oil. Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I try not to slather it everywhere, but the luxurious feel is wonderful! Thank you!!!</li>
            <li> Love this product! My hair is thick and frizzes easily. This oil not only keeps it smooth looking, it makes my hair so soft! It smells nice too. Not too girly, so my son lets me put it on his curly mop too </li>
            <li> My nails were very brittle and my hands were very dry a few drops about every other day keeps may nails shiny and my hands moisturized without feeling greasy.  I also put on drop on my lips each morning to keep them soft and moisturized.  Two drops rubbed on the palms of my hands and applied to the ends of my hair after straightening helps them stay moisturized and smooth</li>
            <li> I have been very happy with my purchases from Foxbrim.Argan Oil is not my first purchase and will not be my last.  Delivery is much faster then I thought.  Great products and fast delivery.  What more could you ask for?</li>
            <li> This argan oil is amazing. I put it directly on my skin and my skin feels wonderful. I used on my hair and it made it super soft and manageable.&lt;br /&gt; I am very happy with this product and will order it again</li>
            <li> great on my hands and nails!!!</li>
            <li> I really love this.. Great on skin and nails...</li>
            <li> Love this product  used it on a surgical scar</li>
            <li> Used on hair and nails loved the results...</li>
            <li> Thank you for the fantastic product and the fast shipping.</li>
            <li> It does have multiple uses and absorbs beautifully.  I am impressed!</li>
            <li> I noticed my daughter&#x27;s hair was looking absolutely beautiful for the past few months so I asked her what she was using.  She told me about argan oil so I decided to try it.  She has very long hair while mine is much shorter so she warned me about being tempted to use too much. and to use it on the ends of my hair.  I use about 3 drops, rub it into my hands and then into my hair.  I am amazed and the difference it has made in my hair.  I absolutely love this product.</li>
            <li> I am enjoying this product.  I use a few drops as a facial mousturizer, and in the ends of my hair before blow drying.  I am trying to grow it out, so keeping that length, which is the oldest part of all my hair, healthy and moisturized is a big part of my hair care routine.  The dropper is a nice way of regulating the dispensing of the product.  Two thumbs up!</li>
            <li> This is a very high quality oil.  The only reason it doesn&#x27;t get a 5 star from me is that Argan Oil itself is not complete for my aging, dry, skin&#x27;s needs.  My husband uses it on his bald head and face and there is a noticeable improvement to his skin within a week. The company seems great and I will buy from them again.</li>
            <li> This brand of argan oil exceeded my expectations and I would highly recommend this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Before purchasing Foxbrim, I bought a a more high profile brand of argan oil that tends to go for $48 for 1.7oz. With Foxbrim you get 2oz. for a much, much lower price. Additionally, Foxbrim&#x27;s oil is certified organic, is imported from Morocco and bottled in the USA, and is cruelty free, just like the other brand&#x27;s oil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In comparison to the other brand, Foxbrim&#x27;s oil is exactly the same. The color is a very faint yellow, the normal color of argan oil. Additionally, the smell is on point--almost none, perhaps a very faint nutty smell. I love that there is almost no smell to the oil, as I don&#x27;t have to worry about bothering others when I use this product, unlike most lotions and hair products. The texture is great--it  works well and absorbs into skin and hair, leaving a non-greasy feeling within a few minutes. I use argan oil on the ends of my hair everyday, which has eliminated the need for many of my hair products.&lt;br /&gt;Finally there is only ONE ingredient in the Foxbrim oil-- Argania Spinosa (Organic Argan Oil) Kernel Oil. Like any reputable brand of argan oil, this is the only ingredient you should find in your bottle. If you have other ingredients in your argan oil, then you really aren&#x27;t getting what you pay for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After comparing the two argan oil brands, I have come to the consensus that I will be purchasing Foxbrim from now on, rather than the other trendy brand I was purchasing. The oil is exactly the same, yields the same results, and costs much, much less. Additionally, Foxbrim is cruelty free and organic, so you can feel good about buying this oil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am including some pictures of the bottle in my review.</li>
            <li> Better than Josie Marin brand at a fraction of the cost!</li>
            <li> 2/22/2015 - just a quick note. I went to South America on vacation and I were a flat to one of the tours that gave me a nasty blister with exposed raw skin on the left foot. Guess what? I put the oil on it and in 2 days it was practically healed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This has been a great surprise for me and here&#x27;s why:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1) Skin - I use some expensive products that work very well on my skin. I went from Ester Lauder to this product and I have to say the oil is doing just as well as the 85 dollars little jar - I cannot tell the difference. A warning: you need to wash your hands after you use it. If you rub it on your eyes it will burn like hell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2) Hair - I have long, colored, highlighted hair. I followed the instructions and massaged the oil all over my hair and washed it. My hair is very difficult to style. It&#x27;s curly, frizzy in some spots and if I don&#x27;t spend almost 1 hr styling every time I wash, I look like a chia pet. I don&#x27;t remember ever using a product that made it all so much easier. This is a picture taken at a salon. The oil was not used that day but it gives you an idea of my hair type.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3) Sunburn - It&#x27;s winter and I&#x27;m getting ready for Spring and Summer by going to a tanning salon. The first tanning session burned the belly are a little. A rub the oil on the area and the very next day the red was gone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4) Lips - I read that argan oil can be used as lip balm. I did not work for me. I tried and I think it actually dried my lips a little.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product is a must have. It&#x27;s worth every penny.</li>
            <li> Very good on hair and face.</li>
            <li> I love this oil! I have used this product for only about 1 week and I am a fan. This oil is very light, absorbs quickly, not greasy and makes my skin and hair feel really soft. I would definitely buy this oil again and I think that it is worth a try.</li>
            <li> I use this oil on my hair. I have dyed my hair a lot and it has become like straw. I was about to cut it off. Then I started applying this oil and it is replenishing my hair. It no longer feels like straw!</li>
            <li> Argan oil is my new &amp;#34;go to&amp;#34; oil for absolutely everything these days!!!! I use it for my hair,which is dry from coloring it,AND I use it all over my body for overall dryness.ESPECIALLY my feet!!! I no longer have yucky dry peeling feet,yay!!</li>
            <li> Love this stuff. Makes skin feel soft and healthy. A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> Works great on my hair. Just a little on my ends and it repairs frizz and split ends</li>
            <li> I am going to use this in soapmaking!</li>
            <li> Love this product! I use it on my hair and my daughter and my husband uses it on their faces for skin condition and it helps both of the. So many good uses!</li>
            <li> Wonderful! Doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin! Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> using it everyday............</li>
            <li> Argan oil has become a really popular product, so I wanted to try it out. I’m a big believer in science, follow reddit’s r/SCA nad r/Asianbeauty and read science articles: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3723062/ is the most convincing. Essentially, argan oil is good for you via ingestion. At the same time, it’s been proven to have anti-inflammation (reduce redness), anti-aging, and inhibit melanin synthesis (prevents uneven complexion). So I’ve been very interested in it. It’s also non-comedogenic (won’t clog your pores). So this’ll be great as an oil cleanser. I also personally use it for my hair to hinder frizzness and give it a health shine. This is a great (and cheap) argan oil (organic, cold-pressed, in an amber bottle). Josie Maran, the most famous brand, charges $50 for 50ml!!! By comparison, this is currently $16 for 60ml. Save your money, this is the same thing at a wat cheaper price. Totally recommend!&lt;br /&gt;*Honest review for discounted product*</li>
            <li> I use Argan oil on face, body. hair and feet.</li>
            <li> Using this for my face and I love how it feels.Such lightweight moisturizer,my skin feels soft and hydrated,never oily.</li>
            <li> Spectacular, its a very good product!</li>
            <li> Just used the oil once before hair wash ... It&#x27;s good</li>
            <li> I love it and works wonders for my family hair. I mix this with coconut oil to put in my hair and it really help it to grow</li>
            <li> Exactly as described.</li>
            <li> I have only been using this product for about three weeks.  But so far, I have been very happy with it.</li>
            <li> I have never written a review until now, but this product absolutely deserves 5 stars! I was excited to get it based off of the reviews I read prior to ordering it, but I never expected it to be this great. I can truly say I have never had a glow to my skin like I do now that I have been using this product! I actually wish I would have taken a &amp;#34;before&amp;#34; picture so I could show the comparison from before and after using the product, but I didn&#x27;t even think it would be this drastic. I HIGHLY reccommend this product to anyone wanting to improve their skin. I honestly don&#x27;t want to use anything else because this has been so great, and it is also great to put a little in your hair after you shower!</li>
            <li> I bought this for my daughter who has think, wavy hair.  She has been happy with the frizz control by adding just a little to her hair.  A good product.</li>
            <li> This is the first time I have purchased Argan Oil.  The seller sent me an email before the product arrived speaking about the different uses for the oil.  So far I have used it in my hair while wet and then let air dry.  My hair is so soft once dry.  I have also used it as a leave in conditioner and it gives my hair a nice shine without being oily.  I love that it is 100% pure but still bottled in the US.  I wish I had found this oil a long time ago.  It would have saved me tons of money on moisturizers and hair product.  I am learning that natural and simple can sometimes be the best.</li>
            <li> Argan oil is a &amp;#34;wonder&amp;#34; oil. I use it for my skin, hair, nails.&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;-Moisturizes skin, hair, and nails&lt;br /&gt;-Easy drop applicator&lt;br /&gt;-Trustworthy Brand&lt;br /&gt;-Mix it with some other base substance for improved results&lt;br /&gt;-Minimal smell&lt;br /&gt;-Does not leave oily skin afterwards&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;-Sometimes need a lot of drops to properly cover large spaces (skin and hair)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Conclusion:&lt;br /&gt;Argan oil is a great addition to have moisturized skin and can complement lotions and other skin moisturizers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tips:&lt;br /&gt;-Put a nice amount of drops into your bath and you&#x27;ll come out with some great feeling skin!</li>
            <li> While I&#x27;m use to using Josie Maran&#x27;s argan oil I thought I&#x27;d give this company&#x27;s argan oil a try. I chose this argan oil because of the great price and it&#x27;s 100% pure. Now granted I haven&#x27;t been using this product for very long I did notice a nice luster to my hair. I like to add some to my ends for protection and tiny bit to my scalp. The owner told me to try adding this product to freshly washed hair too so I&#x27;m going to definitely try that and see if it helps. There is a nutty smell to this product just as it is stated on the site. So if you are looking for a good alternative to Josie&#x27;s argan oil this is a good one!</li>
            <li> Great stuff. Nor greasy!</li>
            <li> Aragan was recommended to me by a friend so I decided to try some.  So far I am thrilled with this product and I don&#x27;t feel I would ever buy any other brand but Foxbrim. I like the fact that it is organic and cold pressed.   It is light and it absorbs fast into my skin.  I use it on my face and neck areas.  I highly recommended this product and this seller.  Don&#x27;t hesitate to buy this product.</li>
            <li> Very nice quality oil. Argan Oil has so many great uses, I use Argan oil as a moisturizer and eye make up remover. It doesn&#x27;t leave a greasy after feel and it makes my skin glow. It&#x27;s also great for your hair, I have naturally curly hair and hair products generally leave my hair dry and damaged. I like to put Argan oil on the ends of my hair to help against breakage. It also leaves my curls feeling soft and bouncy. I&#x27;ve tried many different brands of Argan oil this this brand is just as good as the others. Argan oil has kind of a weird smell so if that&#x27;s an issue you can do what I do and add a couple drops of lavender essential oils to the bottle and it will mask the smell. Overall this product is very good for the price. I purchased this product during a promotion and the views I have expressed are my own.</li>
            <li> Don even feel like there nothing in my hair it feel&#x27;s good..</li>
            <li> Leaves my hair soft as ever and doesn&#x27;t have a bad smell. Love this</li>
            <li> I used this on my hair and skin and noticed an immediate difference....so soft!! Loving this stuff!#</li>
            <li> I love this stuff!  My skin is so soft, and I wish I had found it sooner.</li>
            <li> Its very heavy oil.  Way to heavy for a daily hair moisturizer.  For a pre poo I use coconut oil.  I was using it on my face. It made my face feel nice but I think I will use it during the winter. A bit oily for the summer.</li>
            <li> This is amazing for wrinkles. Smooths very well. Noticeable right away.</li>
            <li> So impressed with this 100% Argan Oil and the price.  I spent much more on &amp;#34;Designer&amp;#34; argan oil from QVC and was so disappointed in when I looked at the ingredients.  It has a very pleasant scent and light texture.  Very helpful for dry winter skin on face and hands.</li>
            <li> Keeps my scalp moisturized and the dandruff has dissipated</li>
            <li> I love this stuff! I can&#x27;t believe that I went all these years without using it. I now use it on my face, hands, lips, hair and anywhere else that need moisture.</li>
            <li> I can tell this is pure because it comes in a dark colored glass bottle rather than plastic. Great for skin and hair!</li>
            <li> I decided to try this oil for a moisturizer. I usually use meadowfoam oil, especially because it has a uv protection to it. I really like the feel of the argan oil though. My face definitely was moisturized, and it absorbed very well and didn&#x27;t leave an oily feeling or look. I like that it comes in a glass bottle with an eyedrop top. I can easily just add the essential oils I want right to the bottle and then use as a moisturizer.</li>
            <li> I bought this product to alleviate a dry scalp  (no dandruff) and vertical splitting nails.  I have used it several times and it helped the itching and I am watching the nails.  It goes on easy and it doesn&#x27;t take much.  The scent is mellow.  I have used other brands of Argan Oil for my hair and didn&#x27;t see any results.  I believe this is a fine product.  I would purchase it again and would recommend it to others.</li>
            <li> I love using this after my shower.It makes my hair so soft and shiny.</li>
            <li> Love the quality and not greasy</li>
            <li> This is a rich oil that has met my expectations.  Doesnt take a lot but gives excellentresults.</li>
            <li> Use this as a hair oil and leaves my hair so shiney and dries faster</li>
            <li> not as good as it was made out to be. Disappointed in it.</li>
            <li> Very good! Products works just like i need it to! I will buy again</li>
            <li> Very good product for any skin types!</li>
            <li> I used this as a pre-wash deep conditioning treatment and my has never felt or looked better! I love this product!</li>
            <li> Like this argan oil, makes my hair feel so soft</li>
            <li> Perfect! I have using on my face as night cream . My skin feel soft . I love it 😀 you can use it on your hair , skin . Excellent product!!</li>
            <li> My husband uses it on his beard. I love it and use it for lots of things!</li>
            <li> Friend in the beauty field told me she uses  Argan Oil when putting on BB Cream. Read about product. Decided to try on my processed hair.  Hair feels softer. I also mix a few drops in with hand lotion at night.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product on my hair and face.  I have noticed a difference, I no longer wear powder as I feel I don&#x27;t need it now. My hair is softer and healthier.  I&#x27;ve been rubbing a bit into my daughters hair, just the ends and love the results.</li>
            <li> my skin loves it, I use it as a face moisturizer twice a day, sometimes more, just love it&lt;br /&gt;Thanks</li>
            <li> this is my 2nd bottle of argan oil ( 1st was a different brand) and i&#x27;m really happy with the results i use it all over my body and hair when i wash it. It smooths down the frizzies and make hair soft, i only use a little or it makes it a little greasy, its great for rough feet and makes my skin softer, good for chapped lips too. This doesn&#x27;t have a bad smell like some others have complained about other brands. The company sent an email to see if i was happy with product, thats nice they care about their customers. would buy again</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t had the chance to use it much, but I am sure I will be happy with it.</li>
            <li> I really like this brand. It is clear, and the scent is light. I&#x27;m confident it is pure and I love the way it goes into my skin making it feel so good. I&#x27;m happy I chose this brand. It comes in a nice bottle with a glass dropper. The package arrived quickly and trouble free. I&#x27;m delighted and wholeheartedly recommend this oil.Thanks for making a great product and for the sale!!</li>
            <li> Great product to use alone, or as a carrier oil for essential oils.</li>
            <li> Just started using this product. I&#x27;m very happy with it&#x27;s quality.</li>
            <li> Love love love!! Smooth , silky texture. Great quality product!</li>
            <li> Fantastic quality! Lovely feel on the skin and generous size! Would buy again!</li>
            <li> Fast shipping and love this product!</li>
            <li> I have been applying 3-4 drops of oil to my hair weekly twice and I started noticing a change almost immediately. My hair is much more manageable. Amazing !!</li>
            <li> This is a great product. It works exactly how I wanted it to. The eye dropper in the bottle assists in using it sparingly.</li>
            <li> Have had great results with this oil!  It&#x27;s very light and doesn&#x27;t leave my hair or skin feeling overly greasy.  I&#x27;ve primarily used it on my beard and mustache, and it&#x27;s definitely helped to soften things up a bit and has essentially eliminated the dreaded beard dandruff.</li>
            <li> I recently color treated my hair for the first time ever and it really dried it out.  I have been looking for something to bring back the shine and softness that hair had before it dyed it.  A coworker suggest Argan Oil and when given the opportunity to try this out I jumped on it.  I add this to my hair after I shampoo and I have really noticed a difference on how smooth and manageable my hair is afterwards.  It has now become part of my daily routine.</li>
            <li> Love it......a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> Good price for this item, it moisturizes my coarse/kinky hair all day. Has a nutty/salty smell but not too strong</li>
            <li> Very nice product.reasonably priced. Excellent moisturizer which doesn&#x27;t clog pores or feel greasy.  I have gotten compliments on my skin since using it.</li>
            <li> I was expecting a miracle but not!! Just another oil</li>
            <li> Wonderful product, I use it mainly for my hair and it makes my hair looks shiny without looking greasy.</li>
            <li> I have been reading a lot of reviews about Argan oil and it sure stands up to it name! My hair grows back faster and healthier than ever!</li>
            <li> I love it. I got a high discount coupon to buy it. It is organic. I like organic staff. It makes me feel safe. I use it on my hair. I can feel my hair is smooth than before. i also use a little bid on my hand. my hand skin is more smooth.</li>
            <li> I am using this mostly on my hair and it is loving the attention!</li>
            <li> This is the stuff you want, you guys. When I got it I accidentally put too much on the first day but just left it. The next day my dry hair was so much better!  It&#x27;s wonderful!  Easy does it, though. I think I&#x27;ll have this bottle for a long time.</li>
            <li> I started using this oil because my hair was thinning in the top from using coloring and perms in my hair over many years.  I stopped every thing that was not natural, and I was told about this oil.  I started using it and within 2 months time my hair had grown in the thinning spots and the length was miraculous.  I use this on wet hair or dry hair.  This is the best oil I&#x27;ve ever used for frizz and conditioning and dryness.  I actually use this oil all over my body, it&#x27;s an excellent oil!!</li>
            <li> I live in the desert and dry hair is a constant problem along with dry skin. This product helps keep my hair manageable and adds shine without making it oiley. I always keep it next to my comb and brush.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff leaves my skin and hair so soft!!!&lt;br /&gt;Can&#x27;t say enough about it I love it!!</li>
            <li> I love Argan Oil for my hair. It is Great.</li>
            <li> I use this is as a hair moisturizer and I absolutely love the feel of my hair after a week or so of using it. Makes my hair shine and really soft. Would highly recommend this for others looking for a new and good argan oil in their hair care products!!</li>
            <li> I love this stuff! I&#x27;ve stopped using moisturizer after cleansing my face, and now I use this instead. I just squeeze a drop or two onto my palms, rub them together and then rub the oil all over my face. It may feel a little greasy at first but as long as you don&#x27;t use too much it will absorb quickly and not leave a shine. It really helps regulate your natural oil production and helps control acne if you have oily or acne prone skin. If you have combination skin it should also help balance it out. If you have dry skin I think this product will be a big help as well. It doesn&#x27;t have a strong odor in my opinion. It can also be used as a oil treatment for your hair, alone or added to other hair products. Some people like to add it to their facial moisturizer too, but I find this product works best by itself. Sometimes I&#x27;ll use it as a volumizer or texturizer for my hair. If my locks look a little limp, I&#x27;ll put a drop or two in my palms and rub them together before rubbing my hands through my hair and scrunching the oil through. It gives it a nice temporary boost of volume and also the added bonus of hydrating my hair at the same time. I just wash it out the next day because it will weigh your hair down after a while of if you use too much. In my opinion this is a very versatile product that you could get a lot of use out of. I will never go back to using a moisturizer on my face, Argan oil helps minimize the look of wrinkles and makes my skin look and feel refreshed. Try it, they have a money back guarantee if you don&#x27;t like it!</li>
            <li> If this is 100 % pure Argan oil, then why the hell is kernel oil one of the ingredients? I am so sick and tired of these lies ugh will definitely return</li>
            <li> I love this Organic Argan Oil. Its smell good and relaxing. I use it in the humidifier, laundry detergents, and add it to my hair conditioner and moisturizer. It makes my hair and skin smooth and soft. Love it. Will recommend to friend and family.</li>
            <li> I love that this oil is very light. It has a slightly nutty smell that dissipates after a few seconds which I actually like a lot. Very nice product for the price.</li>
            <li> Awesometacular.. I love it. I use it and I use the oil for my dog because her skin gets dry.</li>
            <li> Love using this oil as a hair treatment. Improved my acne, and moisturized my dry skin</li>
            <li> Been using it as moisturizer on my face and love it!</li>
            <li> My hair feels so amazing! I have been using coconut oil for years. I decided to try this after seeing several girls I follow on YouTube using it and raving about it. Yup! I&#x27;m hooked! Doesn&#x27;t rinse out quite as well as the coconut oil, I had to  lather and rinse twice, not a huge deal though, totally worth the extra 3 minutes in the shower.</li>
            <li> I think there must be better options out there. Aegean oil is smelly! It worked fine. No impressive results after 3 months use.</li>
            <li> Many reviews raved about this product. Wasn&#x27;t impressed. It&#x27;s supposed to be all natural but it made me break out. Plus I tried a little in my hair and it made it super oily!</li>
            <li> Good stuff&lt;br /&gt;I use it on my hair and it makes it silky smooth&lt;br /&gt;Only complaint is where the inarticulate day to use 3 drops, I need to use 3 dropper-fulls (like 15 drops)&lt;br /&gt;It also works really nice on your skin, and after our absorbs it isn&#x27;t greasy or oily&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Would&#x27;ve been nice if I only had to use 3 drops, but it comes as described and a little does go a long way. Good product overall</li>
            <li> I have tried a few kinds of Argan Oil in the past and I love some and hate some.  I must say that I can add Foxbrim to the list of Argan Oils that I love.  The biggest reason is it doesn&#x27;t feel like vegetable oil, which I&#x27;m convinced some other companies have stuck in their bottles.  It is not oily feeling when it is on my skin.  It absorbs instantly and just leaves my dry skin feeling soft and smooth.  Another reason is it has no scent.  I use it mostly on my hair so I don&#x27;t want it to have a scent anyways.  I can use it on my wet or dry hair and it tames my frizz.  My hair is silky smooth, soft, and has no fly-aways.</li>
            <li> I really love it it make my hair soft, and my face I had spots that didn&#x27;t want to go but they are fading. I would recommend it and will buy more.</li>
            <li> This is really a wonderful product. Both my wife and myself suffer from dry hair and skin. We&#x27;ve tried all kinds of remedies in the past, without much success. Aargan oil has done wonders for us. We couldn&#x27;t recommend it more highly</li>
            <li> I can honestly say that I was surprised by the many benefits that this Argan oil provided. I have had problems with dry, itchy scalp for awhile, and after using this product as part of my routine, it has gotten so much better! Even though it can be a little pricey, in my opinion it is worth it. This oil is saving my hair, and I will definitely continue using it even after I finish off my first bottle, because I have used many supposedly professional products without obtaining similar results. I would definitely recommend that you purchase this product if you are looking for something to help you hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here are some of my observations after using this product.&lt;br /&gt;- It is odorless&lt;br /&gt;- The oil is thinner than other oils that I have used&lt;br /&gt;- It has helped my itchy scalp a ton! I mixed it with olive oil, but I believe that it is the Argan oil that is making the difference, because I had used the olive oil with coconut oil before without great results.&lt;br /&gt;- I have been using it as a hand moisturizer as well, because I have had some problems with eczema, and it helped quite a bit, even though it still isn&#x27;t cured.</li>
            <li> Not pure and diluted. Or perhaps, not even argan oil and just plain corn oil. I got rashes from putting this on my face.</li>
            <li> Love love love love. Makes me obsessed with touching my skin after using it lol.</li>
            <li> This is great. Most argan oils I’ve used are pretty much scentless and while this one says there is no scent, I do detect a sort of citrusy smell. It works well on the hair, skin, and nails. My favorite way to use argan oil is as a face moisturizer. Just a few drops leaves my skin with a dewy, gorgeous glow. It is also great for basically any weird skin issues. If my skin is particularly dry, I use this. Acne-fied? Use this. Oily? Use this. After just one time using this (with no moisturizer or makeup over it), I can see a difference. It’s really just great for everything though. It’s also good for both men and women, so share away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And this is a big bottle with a dropper, which are my favorite. I desperately needed a good argan oil right now and this fits the bill. It also has nice, subtle packaging that I really like.</li>
            <li> I am a new customer to your product and am very pleased with your product.  The delivery was quick and no damage to the goods.  I appreciate your advising the many ways to utilize your special oil, however, my main use is for face and neck.  I am 79 years old and still struggling with keeping my skin supple.  I realize that at my age it is not possible to erase all the years etched on my face for many years but I keep trying.  Keep up your good work.  S. . A. Little</li>
            <li> Great product! I used it for a week now, it feel so nice on my face.</li>
            <li> Great product - great transaction...VERY pleased</li>
            <li> Very good withmy skin, hands and hair... I love this product!!</li>
            <li> Great product - many uses!</li>
            <li> Love it! Works great for rough patches on skin.</li>
            <li> love the smell and good quality product</li>
            <li> I love this stuff.  It makes my face feel so smooth.  And my hair is much less frizzy with just a couple drops.  Highly recommend.  Arrived very quickly.</li>
            <li> great for your skin, rub it in and then run your fingers thru your hair...before shower use on hair and shampoo out...what a difference!! no more dry skin!</li>
            <li> ** I was given this produt as part of an advertorial.&lt;br /&gt;I decided to try it on my son&#x27;s eczema spots since it is a good moisturizer, but it also says it is good for reliving redness and reducing inflammation. We are at the tale end of the winter eczema season for my kids, so this is really nothing, but I thought it was the perfect small spot to test out to make sure that they didn&#x27;t feel anything because believe it or not there have been different eczema creams that sting my kids although the interesting thing is that what stings one is the best eczema cream for the other and vice versa. So, I was very excited to see that this was absorbed right away in to the skin of my son and cleared up that dryness. I plan to try this on my daughter as well and have my fingers crossed that she responds just as well and then I will no longer have to buy eczema creams and just use argan oil that I am already buying for myself. I will be trying it on my nails that split easily next.</li>
            <li> A very nice Argan Oil. Seller shipped very quickly. I will buy again.</li>
            <li> So nice for hair. It is a natural alternative to hair serums. Works so well</li>
            <li> Using as a beard balm and it absorbs quickly and definitely makes the hair much softer. Great product!</li>
            <li> Very light when applied, but leaves the skin soft and smooth.  Great for applying right before I shave.</li>
            <li> Wonderful for the hair!</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing! Makes my skin feel so moisturized! I love putting it in my hair as well.</li>
            <li> Lovely! I used it on my hair to make it strong and smooth.  It&#x27;s even thicker too!</li>
            <li> Great product. Exactly as described and expected.</li>
            <li> Received my oil very quickly and love it!  We have been using it in our hair as well as our skin and it moisturizes without leavinb an oily film!  My boyfriend has been applying it to his face to combat dryness and it is working as good, if not better, than anything else he has tried!  We also add a few drops into a palmful of lotion for body moisturizing and this leaves your skin feeling soft and silky all day!  GREAT product!</li>

            <li> I love the pure Argan Oil for my face as it does seem to soften the lines of time.  I am 72 years old and over the past few years more deep lines have developed but by using this oil every night and morning, the lines are softened.</li>
            <li> I have been using Argan Oil for a short time and my fine lines are fading. I&#x27;m hoping with time I will see more results.</li>
            <li> Smells amazing, great product.. worked great on my hair at an amazing price!</li>
            <li> This oil is awesome! It&#x27;s weightless, and leaves my skin feeling soft and non greasy. On my face I&#x27;ve been told my skin is glowing. I&#x27;ve already introduced it to a friend and she also got the same results. Can&#x27;t say more than OMG!! I love it in just a few short uses. I&#x27;ve used it on my hair too. It leaves my hair feeling soft and even gives my hair a bounce. I&#x27;m glad I found it! Happy face!!  :-)</li>
            <li> I received this for free in order to facilitate my review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Instead of using this on my hair like many people do, I have been using this on my nails and cuticles!  I really love how well it rubs in.  It has no scent.  A little bit goes a long way!  I just tap the dropper to my nail to get the perfect amount!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;THe bottle and dropper is glass.  For some reason I really love the glass dropper.  It feels more sturdy and kind of makes it feel fancier, if that makes sense.  lol&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall for how I have used it,I love it!</li>
            <li> For about a week and a half I have been applying this to my face after I shower and before bed, and sometimes to my hands and nails.  So far I really like how smooth it makes my skin feel.  Only three or four drops are needed.  It&#x27;s light, non-oily feeling, and thankfully nearly unscented.  Reading some of the other reviews and responses I have to wonder if the lack of a scent means that it is less than fresh, though... I hope not because I generally won&#x27;t use scented products on my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all I thus far have had no problems and I like the way it makes my face feel.</li>
            <li> Great price for such a treasured oil! Makes my skin look radiant :)</li>
            <li> I have never used Argan oil before as it has always seemed a bit pricey. When I saw Foxbrim on sale, I knew I had to try it. Upon first use I noticed that it does not have a smell, and it washes off of my hands unlike other oil products I use. I loved that! After a bit of use I noticed my hair is shiny and it breaks less. It is also easier to brush, which is awesome because I tend to have tangled hair. I have been using it on my face after washing it, and I am in love! I typically have dry, flaky skin but this product has really improved the overall condition of my skin. Seeing how well it worked on my face, I decided to add some drops of the oil to my body wash and lotion! I absolutely love this product and would recommend it to anyone.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s definitely worth the price,  works great and I really like the effect it has had with my feet . Have to say that they aren&#x27;t dry anymore.  Excellent Quality Product ☆ ★ ☆ ★ ☆ that&#x27;s a 5 Star rating.</li>
            <li> Love it! I use it on my hair and face. It gives a nice glowing look without the oily feel.</li>
            <li> Excellent for removing Sharpie marks on my skin placed during radiation therapy.Since this product contains no alcohol, it perfectly moisturizes  the skin without causing the skin to become dry &amp; fragile.</li>
            <li> A present that was delivered on time, nicely wrapped and much enjoyed.  Thank you!</li>
            <li> So far using on face and hair and it absorbs well. I think this bottle is going to last me a long while as i only use a few drops at a time.  The oil does have a herbaceous scent which i don&#x27;t mind and dissipates quickly.</li>
            <li> This is the first time we ordered it &amp; My Wife loves this product &amp; has become a regular user.  it arrived on time .</li>
            <li> Great in. Diy recipes</li>
            <li> Perfect Organic Argan Oil.  Can&#x27;t go wrong!</li>
            <li> Wonderfully moisturizing for any part of your body that is dry, flaky, irritated, wrinkled.  I use this Argan oil on my face -especially around my eyes and mouth where there are fine lines and wrinkles.  It is great for dry and flaky legs and feet.  Even rough and dry heels are no match for Argan oil.  I have put off trying Argan oil and wish now that I hadn&#x27;t.  The claims seemed too good to be true.  If you are putting off trying this product, you will be very grateful when you finally give it a try.  Even my nails are looking better with less chipping and cracking!  Do your epidermis a favor and give Argan oil the test - you will find so many wonderful uses for this superb NATURAL product!</li>
            <li> I really do love this argan oil it makes my hair shiny and healthy looking. It also seems to make my color stand out more.</li>
            <li> As advertised. Nice change from typical over the counter products. It has my recommendation.</li>
            <li> I love that I can use this product interchangeably for hair, face and hands. It smells great, and it doesn&#x27;t leave a greasy feel. Foxbrim Argan Oil absorbs better than other brands I&#x27;ve tried. I can put it on my hands without making everything I touch oily. I love it. Only warning: A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I am so impressed with not only how amazing this product truly is but also the fantastic customer service and quick shipping! I am an true awe. I opened the package and instantly tried a dab on my fingernails, dabbed a bit on the tip of my split ends and can already tell a difference after only hours. I will be buying this product again and again - Thank you so much Foxbrim !</li>
            <li> I mix this with my rosehip oil for a nighttime moisturizer and it has worked great! I also use it on my nails and end of my hair. This product has a million uses!</li>
            <li> Excellent moisturizer for hair and skin.</li>
            <li> Is only couple weeks that I purchased this product ; definitely I started to notice some improvement around my eyes. So far I&#x60;m very pleased . Thank you</li>
            <li> I used it as my cuticle oil. It was absorbed fast by skin. I can use it anytime without worrying that I may make my keyboard dirty.</li>
            <li> I love this argan oil! It works wonders for my hair .</li>
            <li> Superior quality argan oil. Can be used anywhere on the body, I personally use it as a scalp treatment &amp; overall hair conditioner. My hair was noticeably thinning, but after several months of rubbing it into my scalp, (focusing on the thinning parts,) once or twice a week..... I have actually had numerous complements on how healthy my hair is. I also mix this with tea tree oil, &amp; together it has definitely stimulated new growth all over. This product arrived in 2 days...</li>
            <li> Great product! Use it for my face, it feels light and once it dries isn&#x27;t oily.</li>
            <li> I have used another brand and this is comparable.  The scent is very minimal.  That&#x27;s just how pure argan oil smells.  It is not very greasy and absorbs well into the skin</li>
            <li> LOVE Argan oil - this is a great products for soft, silky, healthy hair! A little goes a long way. Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> **** I have to write more. This argan oil has made my hands and face so smooth and this is only after using for a couple of days. This is ABSOLUTELY wonderful. I love it and it only takes a few drops.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Received the products quickly and on time. The manufacturer followed up to make sure everything was okay. I highly recommend this product and the vendor.</li>
            <li> New Mexico is a very dry state. My hair was frizzy, dry and lot&#x27;s of dry ends. I tried different products on my hair over the years. I purchased Foxbrim 100% pure organic Argan Oil. I applied four drops and massaged it through my very dry hair. Because my hair was so dry I replied three more drops. I covered my hair with a shower cap for six hours. I couldn&#x27;t believe how soft and thick my hair felt. Once a week I repeat that same treatment. Love, Love this product!</li>
            <li> Seems to be of same quality as the expensive Josie Moran I have been using</li>
            <li> I have tested this product in in a variety of ways as suggested directions- revitalize skin, face, hair and nails.&lt;br /&gt; In the mornings, I applied it to the ends of my very dry hair to help smooth and add shine. I found it a little greasier than I like. Even having curly super dry bleach hair I need to wash my hair after 3 days because it looks un-groomed and feels very oily on the ends. Have to tell that washing hair is not easy task also. I have to lather my hair few more time than usual to wash out oil from my hair.&lt;br /&gt;I used the oil on my face in the evenings in place of my normal moisturizer. Just a couple drops helped my face feel moisturized but too oily. I do not mind to have my neck greasy at night but that oil doesn’t work at all for my morning routine.&lt;br /&gt;But after body scrub that 100% Pure Organic Argan Oil works miracle. My body skin has a few dry patches due to some skin conditions and oil help to moisturize it for couple days, especially elbows. Also, I like to use oil after shaving my legs. It gives not just softness but shine as well.&lt;br /&gt;Probably my favorite way to use this oil is as a hand moisturizer. I do use oil after every hands wash and it gives to my hands and nails cuticles additional moisture and softness. But need to remember about some greasiness so do not touch paper documents immediately.&lt;br /&gt;It’s a 100% Pure Organic Argan Oil and I am happy to know that I am applying to my skin natural stuff.&lt;br /&gt;I will highly recommend to all people with chemical allergy.</li>
            <li> This oil is light and goes on easily during my morning/evening facial routines.  It leaves my skin feeling soft and hydrated, not greasy.  Have also used a couple drops on shampooed hair, both towel dried and blown dry - hair is shinier, smoother, and more manageable either way.  A  couple drops per use is all that&#x27;s needed - a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> Great oil for a great value!</li>
            <li> I bleach my hair and this product is amazing!!! If your looking for that perfect product worth the money this is it!! Highly recommended</li>
            <li> Great product. Was unsure how it would do on my skin, as it is sensitive. I have both eczema and combination skin, prone to breakouts with new products. I have been using the argan oil (2 drops mixed with 1/2 my normal squeeze of face lotion) on my face for several weeks now and it has been great, no problems/reactions at all. I use it on my lips too; works great as lip balm. I have also used it mixed with my regular body moisturizer, and love it. Any Mamas out there with post--baby-delivery hemorrhoids (sorry, i know this may be yucky but have to share), this oil is very soothing for that area! Will definitely purchase this again.</li>
            <li> Leaves my hands feeling amazing.  Too early to tell if there&#x27;s an effect on my nails yet but definitely notice an increase in softness.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff makes my skin so soft and absorbs well</li>
            <li> I heat style my hair nearly every day.  This does wonders for those dry ends.  I rub a few drops on the ends with my fingertips before going to bed and in the morning my hair is silky soft without any signs of damage.  It also works great on dry patches of skin.</li>
            <li> No unpleasant smell as with other products purchased and returned. Very pleased with this purchase, will buy again!</li>
            <li> I have used Organic Argan Oil for to reduce frizz and dryness of my hair recently and its results were great but this time I wanted to heal my dry cuticles around my nails.“Foxbrim Organic Argan Oil” worked good and I like it since it absorbs very quickly, lasts long time, left my nails soft and most of all healed my dry cuticles.</li>
            <li> I have Amazon Prime and I ordered this product on July 7. It was shipped July 8 and received on July 9. The product came in bubble wrap and in a padded package, so it was very well protected. There is a plastic seal on the lid, so none of the oil leaked or spilled out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have had this product for about a week and I&#x27;ve used it almost daily on my face and hair. I have combination skin that is very sensitive and gets very oily. Applying this oil on my skin doesn&#x27;t feel as nice and easy as it does when I&#x27;m applying a creamy moisturizer, but it&#x27;s really nice knowing that it&#x27;s completely natural and there are no chemicals added. For the first several days, when I applied the oil under my makeup, my skin did it very oily compared to when I use my oil-free moisturizer, but it&#x27;s gotten better and there is less oil now. Maybe my skin had to get used to it? I do notice that my face is very soft and I have not had any breakouts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have very long hair that can be rather coarse, so I put about five drops into my hand, rub it into my other hand, and then apply it to the ends and bottom half of my outer layers toward the top of my head. My hair is so soft afterward! I love using this product for both my skin and my hair, but mostly for my hair. It&#x27;s very lightweight and doesn&#x27;t make my hair feel greasy afterward, like other products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product continues to impress me, as it gets better for me each day!</li>
            <li> I have very dry hair, after years of damaging it from hair dyes, to curling irons, and powders, perfumes etc. My hair needs help.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; So I tried this stuff. It said hair, nails, skin ... I figured. WHY NOT!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; First I tried just rubbing a few drops in my palm and smoothing it onto my hair. That left it feeling oily. Not really manageable to style after. BUT THEN, I found the magic way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; If you have a small spray bottle, you have the secret way. Fill that baby up about half way. The bottle comes with an eye dropper type thing, fill that baby up, then squeeze it into the bottle you just filled with water. After your shower, spritz your hair all over. Let it dry, or blow dry. I tried both, neither makes a difference. It works anyway.&lt;br /&gt; My frizz was at bay, and yes ... shiny! It looks healthier, I have been doing this daily for about 2 weeks now .... it seems stronger.&lt;br /&gt; I also had a problem with my hair shedding a lot ... I do not know if this stuff has anything to do with it, but It has been shedding less since starting to use this stuff in this way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I also use the same stuff on my face, I have a dry t-zone. Not really anymore, not to mention, mixed with the vitamin c serums I use, I am basically pimple free, which is really nice. Specially since I am a very insecure person.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I have only recently started using this on nails .... I rub it like you would a cuticle cream, I do not know if my nails are better, but I do know that the cuticle area looks less damaged. A lot less flecks of skin flaking, if you bite your nails, you know what I mean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; all in all, I love this stuff ... specially for what it has done for my hair alone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; One other thing I learned, if you mix it in your conditioner, without the spray, it works really really well too.</li>
            <li> Loved the product and have used it on my skin and hair. The results are dramatic!!! My skin is not a dry and my hair is shiny an healthy witHout appearing or feeling greasy. A little goes a long way with this product.</li>
            <li> AMAZING stuff! I have oily, acne-prone skin and I have tried moisturizing with A LOT of different oils (jojoba, olive, coconut, grape seed). I&#x27;ve been using this for about two weeks now and my skin has improved greatly! I have not gotten any new pimples since I began using this, as well as less sebum production.</li>
            <li> Very light for an oil, which makes it great for use as a beauty product (hair, skin).  Works well for me!</li>
            <li> My wife loves this stuff. She is very happy with it. She says her hair looks great since she began using this oil.</li>
            <li> I was a little hesitant but because it was so reasonable, I figured I would give it a try. I use it on my face to replace another more expensive oil, I also added a couple of drops to my shampoo, and also added to my body moisturizer. Definitely feel a difference immediately. I think I need to buy a much bigger bottle.</li>
            <li> This was my second time ordering this product. It is the very best thing I&#x27;ve ever used for facial care! I&#x27;ve spent thousands on various products over the years and Argan Oil beats them all. I was diagnosed 16 years ago with the auto-immune disease Rheumatoid Arthritis and it had taken a toll on my skin. I did a lot of research and found that Argan Oil was highly recommended. I noticed results very quickly and others have noticed the changes in my appearance also. What more could a girl ask for?!!!</li>
            <li> I bought the same size bottle of Argan oil from a different brand, but still from Amazon, probably about a year ago. I don&#x27;t see a whole lot difference except maybe this brand is a little more thinned out. Maybe not as thick of an oil as the last one was. But all in all, Argan oil has changed my hair, literally.&lt;br /&gt;I use to have dull, not really shiney or healthy looking hair. For about a year, I have been putting Argan oil, about 2  or 3 drops in my hair after I get out of the shower. Well not right after. I keep my hair in a towel for about 45 min. Then I put the oil on my palm, rub my hands together and put the oil on the ends of my hair. Whatever is left, I put my fingers through my hair. OMG, my hair has slowly changed. It is so silky, soft , shines and looks so much better. Nowadays, I can&#x27;t stop touching my hair or looking at it every time I pass a mirror. FYI:  I use AO on my face also with amazing results. Soft and glowy.</li>
            <li> Best oil for hair and face</li>
            <li> Just received product. To soon to tell if it has made a difference for me. Will post an accurate review in a few weeks.</li>
            <li> I am somewhat taken aback by the odor. I expected a fresh, nutty smell, but it rather smelled like a chicken coop. Granted that when I put a drop of the oil on top of the hand, I can&#x27;t smell the odor unless I actually put my hand to the nose. So it&#x27;s not overpowering, but nonetheless....  I remember my EX mother-in-law used to collect chicken droppings and put them into her flowers on her front porch as fertilizer. This smells like that. I don&#x27;t know whether to return this or not, is it supposed to smell like that? I&#x27;m thinking about dropping some lavender, mint, something to see if it helps. (UPDATE) Added three drops of NOW Essential Oils 100% Pure Peppermint (I bought at Amazon) and vigorously mixed, let set overnight, it&#x27;s much much better. Now am trying on skin. Careful with it, three drops is potent. Not sure how it will do on the skin.</li>
            <li> Works great on my hair and skin,  I don&#x27;&#x27;t find this product greasy like some argon oils, I just use a very minimal amount for maximum results.</li>
            <li> First time I&#x27;ve used argan oil and am really satisfied with it. My purchase was delivered as promised and it was correct. I really liked the tips this seller sent for other uses of argan oil. Very helpful, I&#x27;m sure I will be buying more.</li>
            <li> This is an excellent product for softening wrinkles and skin!</li>
            <li> I love this product. I do use it for face, lips, etc. A little goes a long way.&lt;br /&gt;What I don&#x27;t use on my face; I wipe on my hair for a nice shine.&lt;br /&gt;It does go on oily but don&#x27;t worry; it will absorb in a few minutes.&lt;br /&gt;I will order this again for sure!</li>
            <li> I wanted to give my honest opinion about this oil it absorbed quickly without any oily feeling into my skin I enjoy the way it makes my skin feels and when applied to my hair it gives it shine and softness without the heavy greasy look</li>
            <li> This is the best Argan oil that I have tried. It leaves my hair so soft and shiny. I m &#x27;ve it.</li>
            <li> It was a gift, but the recipient loved it.</li>
            <li> Does what it says it&#x27;s suppose to. Great oil!</li>
            <li> I love this oil! I use it on both my face and hair it&#x27;s amazing</li>
            <li> I have been trying to use more all natural products in my beauty routine. Argan Oil is entirely plant based and natural. It is safe and effective on all dry areas on your body including the face. It won’t clog your pores. You can use it on your skin, hair and nails as well. Pure Argan Oil is packed with Vitamin E, and essential Unsaturated Fatty Acids and more. Vitamin E makes your skin radiant, glowing and healthy. Unsaturated Fatty Acids keeps your skin and hair young and it naturally repairs damaged hair. Many people use it on their hair which will make it soft.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love using Foxbrim’s Pure Organic Argan Oil. I have used it on my eczema and it helps keep it moist and not so itchy, during the hotter months my skin tends to have more flare ups and this seems to help me. I have also used it in my hair, I love the way it makes my hair look and feel. This helped to cure the dry spots on my body.</li>
            <li> I’ve been looking for a natural product that won’t irritate my skin and this argan oil works great. I&#x27;ve been using it as a leave in conditioner for my hair at night. By morning, my hair is soft and completely manageable. Not oily and no frizz. Argan oil, which is simply the oil of the nut of the argan tree, is a lot like olive oil in many ways and the less high quality argan oils are more like olive oil than the higher quality ones. Where the differences are at between a good high quality argan and a lesser argan is in the very things that make argan superior to olive for the skin and hair. My skin and nails also love it. It&#x27;s known as Liquid Gold and it&#x27;s the best moisturizer for all hair types. I love it because it is 100% natural and absorbs right away in to your skin and hair. Another thing I like is that it&#x27;s EcoCert &amp; Organic Certified - no preservatives, chemicals or artificial fragrances used. When I use it my hair still feels clean and not oily or greasy at all. A drop on your face and neck will give that Hollywood Glow. I use it every day on my legs and arms. Every few days I do the whole body. Once a week I use it on my face after a facial and in my hair once a week to keep it sleek. For everyone else, it is a delight and highly recommended.&lt;br /&gt;I received one or more of the products mentioned above for free using Tomoson.com. Regardless, I only recommend products or services I use personally and believe will be good for my readers.</li>
            <li> I was given this argon oil as a gift, and I use it on my hair after each wash.  It brings life to my hair, allowing me to eliminate using hair spray.  My hair is no longer dry, fly-away, and lifeless.  Now it is wavy, shiny and more like it was 65 years ago, even though I color it now.  This oil is better than the &amp;#34;pearls&amp;#34; given to me by my hairdresser.  It&#x27;s lighter, and the dropper allows me to increase the amount when my hair gets longer.  It even makes my finger nails shiny.  Thanks for this product.  I love it.</li>
            <li> Shipping, Packaging and Labeling: This product was shipped in a timely manner. The packaging was undamaged, and the bottle itself wasn&#x27;t either. One of the things to look for when purchasing pure Argan Oil is a dark bottle. Be wary of oil sold in clear or plastic ones as both can allow sunlight to hit the oil, causing rapid deterioration. My favorite ways to use Argan oil is as a hair care routine, facial moisturizer, dry skin, and frizzy hair. I use this also on my elbows and heels and its just amazing. Foxbrim&#x27;s 100% Pure Argan Oil is so great on my skin and hair. My hair is really dry and frizzy and its helped so much. I can honestly say that I was surprised by the many benefits that this Argan oil provided. I have had problems with dry, itchy scalp for awhile, and after using this product as part of my routine, it has gotten so much better! This oil is saving my hair, and I will definitely continue using it even after I finish off my first bottle, because I have used many supposedly professional products without obtaining similar results. I would definitely recommend that you purchase this product if you are looking for something to help you hair. The product is odorless which is great for people who are scent sensitive. The oil is a lot thinner than most oils. Its helped a lot with my itchy scalp. Do you have a dry, flaky, itchy scalp? Use Pure Argan Oil as a treatment by massaging it into your scalp before bed and washing it out in the morning with your regular shampoo. Not only will you see healthy, shiny hair but you will be saying &amp;#34;bye bye&amp;#34; to itchiness. I especially love that this is a dropper bottle. It makes mixing the Argan Oil very easy,  particularly with shampoos, conditioners.</li>
            <li> Argan Oils seem to be the latest beauty craze so I was thrilled to finally try one myself. What most impressed me is how versatile this little bottle is. Nails, hair, skin, face---a few drops can be beneficial to just about every part of you!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recently bleached my hair, by myself, at home and it really did a number on my hair--my hair feels more coarse, damaged, and fragile as a result. Over the past couple weeks I have rubbed some Foxbrim oil into my palms and worked it through my hair after shampooing, really focusing on the damaged ends. I honestly think its doing something! My hair looks shinier and feels less damaged.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also use A LOT of retinol based products on my face (trying to minimize wrinkles and other calamities associated with aging!) and my skin often peels and flakes as a result (it&#x27;s not pretty). I have been using Foxbrim oil on my face as well and my flaking has become nearly nonexistent!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On your arms and legs it just moisturizes and leaves that nice healthy glow. I bet it works great on nails too but I&#x27;m not into letting my nails grow--I keep them very short and out of my way!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product is 100% pure and natural and lists 2 ingredients---not 20 ingredients that look like they&#x27;re out of a medical encyclopedia. The scent is very organic smelling, a bit sour, a bit nutty but quickly dissipates once absorbed. The most amazing thing to me was how it didn&#x27;t ever leave my hands greasy or oily after I applied it to my face and hair--my hands just felt soft and hydrated with zero stickiness or tackiness.</li>
            <li> As an African-American woman, my hair  is dry  and fragile. A few drops  leaves my hair soft and shiny. I  was using the very expensive WEN fig oil. I find this is just as effective- it is a little bit heavier, thicker  and a little goes a long way. I will definitively be back for more</li>
            <li> Great product and service</li>
            <li> I love this! My skin is no longer dry.And I even have a glow! Have been using it on my hair, and it is shinier and feels fuller. It is not greasy at all, which I feared it might be.</li>
            <li> I love pure organic Argan oil! It&#x27;s the BEST and I&#x27;ll always use it for my skin and hair!</li>
            <li> Awesome skin oil.  No greasy residue.</li>
            <li> Argan Oil is not called &amp;#34;liquid gold&amp;#34; just because of the soft golden color of the oil, it&#x27;s also because this all natural oil has so many hair &amp; skincare benefits.  This Argan Oil that Foxbrim sent me to test out for them is a really great choice if you are in the market for an Argan Oil!&lt;br /&gt;One of my favorite uses for Agan Oil is using it as a hair treatment on the ends of my hair right after I get out of the shower, it tames my frizzies and leaves my hair feeling soft &amp; silky.  Even though I have very oily skin I also like to use it on my face at night and in the morning I wake up with glowing, hydrated skin.  Since it has anti-inflammatory properties in the oil it also helps heal any skin issues, like blemishes and helps reduce any redness.  It also makes a perfect after shower/bath moisturizer.  I apply it all over my body while my skin is still a little damp and it just soaks into my skin and all I am left with is super soft, supple skin!&lt;br /&gt;There are a lot of Argan Oil&#x27;s out there right now and I have tried several of them, all at varied price ranges and this one from Foxbrim makes a great choice not only because it&#x27;s made with Certified Organic Argan Oil, NO additives parabens, silicones fillers or fragrances but because at $14.95 for 2 ounces it&#x27;s also at a really great price!</li>
            <li> I am in love with the natural properties or Argan Oil - and I&#x27;m in LOVE with this bottle by Foxbrim!  Unlike other oils I&#x27;ve tried in the past, this one is not greasy at all.  It&#x27;s 100% Pure and Organic making it a very lightweight oil.  I&#x27;ve used it as a base oil to mix with tea tree for a scalp treatment.  This time of year I get really dry hands, so I have been using it around my cuticles to prevent hangnails and not only is my fingers and hands soft - my nails seem to be growing out faster and stronger!</li>
            <li> The argan oil I ordered is amazing. I put it directly on my skin and it&#x27;s doing wonders. My face has never be softer and the lines in my face are softening up. I am very happy with this product and the service is great.  I will order it again.</li>
            <li> I love argan oil. I use it for my hair and my skin. It is absorbed quickly and it takes so few drops. Your hair will be healthier with regular use and your skin will love you for spreading the love.</li>
            <li> Love this, I used it with my shampoo and on my skin ,dries fast, Not oily, plus it&#x27;s extremely good for your hair and skin,  I&#x27;m always hearing good things about argan oil</li>
            <li> Great quality, although the item was smaller than i anticipated. But it came wrapped and protected safely. Doesn&#x27;t have a greasy feel to it which is best.</li>
            <li> Works great, I&#x27;m very happy with the product. Would purchase it again.</li>
            <li> I have Plantar Fasciitis and have had to tape my foot for 2 weeks then wear a F6 sock for 3 weeks.  That wreaked havoc on the skin on the bottom of my foot.  I used 3-5 drops on my foot every morning and in less than a week my foot was healed (no more peeling) and it was softer than it has been in years!  I am excited to try it on my face and hair!</li>
            <li> I use this argan oil for my nails and use a little extra to moisturize my hands. It leaves my cuticles and nails looking healthy and my hands soft and smooth. I love getting the compliment of soft hands! It&#x27;s a great, high quality oil</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried a few brands of Argan Oil recently because they have become very popular for skin care.  When I was first introduced to Argan Oil it was a hair care product that I used to for dry scalp.  I have been using this particular bottle of Argan Oil on my skin.  Although it&#x27;s summer my hands dry out very badly from washing dishes or washing them when they are dirty.  I haven&#x27;t been having much luck with lotions so I decided to start using this product on my hands after washing dishes.  Within a week I could see the difference in how my skin was after I was finished washing dishes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hands didn&#x27;t dry out as easily and they started to feel softer compared to when I would just use lotion or nothing at all.  My hands have started looking more youthful and there are less wrinkles on them.  I have even notice that my nails are stronger than they were in the past and they don&#x27;t break as easily.  There are lots of products on the market that claim to be 100% Organic and they don&#x27;t come close to Forbrim&#x27;s Argan Oil.  This product would be great for making your own natural skin care products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s not just for skin though.  You can use the oil in your hair, on your face, all over.  I think winter weather won&#x27;t be a problem for my skin this year because I plan on using this product to combat dry skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was provided a sample for review from Foxbrim.</li>
            <li> Loved this! A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> great product and excellent customer service</li>
            <li> Great product! Was great for my damaged colored hair. Also works great as a lip moisturizer and a nail strengthener.</li>
            <li> Just recieved my Argan oil and it has a very light scent but not over bearing. So far I have only used it on my face and my skin absorbed it very well. I plan to use it on my body at night and after washing my face. Not too much needed. Great buy! Definitely recommend adding it to the skin regimen!</li>
            <li> All of a sudden I had old hair; dry, dull and no movement.  Applying this product on my damp hair for the first time I could feel the velvety texture return and reminded me of a very excellent hot oil treatment except it took no time!!  Hair instantly shiny, smooth and just like before.  I do not review but oh my I must say thank you!!!</li>
            <li> Great product and super fast delivery . i will buy again . Thank you.</li>
            <li> I had been using olive oil under my night cream.  Since trying Argan oil, I will not bother with greasy olive oil again.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a cheaper alternative to the Josie Maran line which is about $50 for the same amount. I haven&#x27;t used the Josie Maran line, but I really like this product. It&#x27;s not oily at all, once you put it on. It absorbs really quickly. I have extremely oily skin, and it didn&#x27;t make it any oilier. I don&#x27;t know yet, if it&#x27;s helped decrease my natural oil production. My skin has been really clear too. I&#x27;m usually very acne prone. I use 3 drops in the AM and before I go to bed.    Some users have mentioned the odor being rancid, but I don&#x27;t mind it. It has a smell, but it doesn&#x27;t smell at all rancid to me. It dissipates very quickly.</li>
            <li> Received this product to review and sample! Only have had for a few days now however I do like it! This company has amazing products! Love them all!</li>
            <li> I was very happy with this product. Made my hair very soft/shiny where before it was brittle/frizzy. Use it on my face also, absorbs without leaving a film.</li>
            <li> Great product&lt;br /&gt;Even greater customer service.</li>
            <li> Love this product I got for review</li>
            <li> Great product...no complain</li>
            <li> From having dull lifeless hair, to frizzy, to dry with no shine at all since I decided to get myself a semi perm, yeah I didn&#x27;t like how my hair turned out. Thanks to Foxbrim 100% pure organic argan oil my hair came back to life. Since I started applying Foxbrim every morning on my damp hair once it dried up I applied just a drop more and my hair looked super shinny, with my curl texture and it smelled really nice. See, oils such as Foxbrim I definitely trust for my hair. I was not expecting for Foxbrim to resurrect my hair. Thanks</li>
            <li> This product is wonderful for your cuticles and nails. I keep it buy my bedside and apply it each night before bed.  I&#x27;ve also used it on dry areas on my body (such as my heels) and have seen great improvements! I highly recommend this product! A little bit goes a long way and it will last you quite some time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The fact that it is so versatile is great! I will be trying it out for glowing skin next!</li>
            <li> Overpriced low quality argan oil. It works but not the best. And the bottle is really tiny.</li>
            <li> I tried this on my hair and found it to be very annoying to style. It would not contour or stay. It flattens my hair and creates a sticky mess. Maybe better for skin...</li>
            <li> I used this oil to mix with Shea butter and carrot seed oil  to make a moisturizer for my face and it is so rich and feels so good.  i also use the Argan oil alone for my hair and nails.  I was in a dept store the other day and a label caught my eye of some night cream and so i picked it up and it was Argan Oil but the jar of cream was $68.00!!  So why would anyone buy that???? This is so much more affordable and is organic and good quality!!!</li>
            <li> Foxbrim Argan Oil really does do wonders for your hair. I have been using Argan Oil in my hair for a few weekss now and love the way it feels. It can leave your hair so soft and shiny. It tames my frizzes and makes my dry hair look healthy and beautiful. I don’t know about any of you, but my hair is one thing that I do have going for me and I need to try and keep it as beautiful as I can for as long as I can.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have really frizzy hair or even just dry hair like I do, this will work wonders on your hair. I apply it after I towel dry and just pat it all over my hair. It will make your hair shine and it tames the frizzies.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Works wonders on your nails and hands also. I have super dry skin and love using Argan Oil on the elbows, heels and my hands where my skin is really rough. Try using it right after a shower/bath so that you really lock in the moisture. You will see how silky smooth your skin will get. Works great on your face also as a moisturizer instead of your regular cream one if you have really dry skin there, too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received one or more of the products mentioned above for free using Tomoson.  Regardless, I only recommend products or services I use personally and believe will be good for my readers.</li>
            <li> This product has been an awesome treat for my poor old and dried up skin.....and it thanks you so much!!</li>
            <li> As I tested this product, I used it in a variety of ways. In the mornings, I applied it to the ends of my damp hair to help smooth and add shine. I found it a little more difficult to work into my hair compared with other oils I&#x27;ve used, but adding a bit of water helps.  I used the oil on my face in the evenings in place of my normal moisturizer. A little goes a long way in this regard. Just a couple drops helped my face feel moisturized but too oily. Probably my favorite way to use this was as a cuticle oil/light hand moisturizer. It seemed like a fairly nourishing but light oil for this purpose. This product has a lightly nutty smell that is virtually undetectable. I only noticed it when applying the oil to my face, but I really didn&#x27;t smell anything when using it in my hair.</li>
            <li> fantastic stuff really works good on my hair excellent moisturizer.</li>
            <li> With this colder weather I was having trouble with my hair and skin being dry and frizzy. This oil is great for air drying - which leaves my hair soft and manageable. There are so many uses for this product - I will definitely order again. The product was easy to order and hassle free shipping. I received this in the mail within two days of placing my order. Great overall experience. I will definitely let my friends know about Foxbrim Argan Oil.</li>
            <li> If you have sensitive skin like me, and are looking for a great pre-shave oil, then look no further than the  Pure Argan Oil by Foxbrim.  Not only is it my go-to pre-shave, but it also doubles as a great moisturizer that gives the skin a great feel and helps eliminate dryness and oiliness.  It&#x27;s very affordable, and to top it off, it&#x27;s all natural! Will definitely recommend this to all my friends and family.</li>
            <li> I constantly have dry skin during the winter and hate lotions that leave my hands oily. This Argan Oil was easy to apply and helped relieve my dry skin right away. My skin felt soft and smooth - another plus is that the Argan Oil soaked in immediately and wasn&#x27;t oily at all. I also really like that it&#x27;s fragrance free. Great product!</li>
            <li> started to need a moisturizer to put on in the cold weather.  this was recommended by a friend and it works perfectly. Foxbrim calledl to ensure that the product arrived on time and if it met desired expectations.  I will use this product again.</li>
            <li> Definitely love this stuff. I’ve been looking for a natural product that won’t irritate my skin and this argan oil works great. I’ve been using it as a leave in conditioner for my hair at night. By morning, my hair is soft and completely manageable. Not oily and no frizz.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use the dropper and only a few drops is all I need. The size is actually really convenient so I can travel with it (under 3oz) and not worry about having to carry any extra stuff. I really like this stuff. I hadn’t heard of the Foxbrim brand before but I’ll definitely be being more when I need it.</li>
            <li> I recently started using Foxbrim 100% Pure Organic Argan Oil and I have to say it did not disappoint. It comes in a 2oz bottle which might not seem like a lot, but trust me a little goes a very long way. Every morning after I wash my face I add two drops of the argan oil in between my hands and rub it together and pat my face with it. The oil quickly absorbs into my skin without leaving a greasy residue and then I just put my sunscreen and makeup over it. I&#x27;ve noticed that my skin is not as dry and looks a lot firmer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also use it on my hair after I take a shower. On towel dried hair, I add about five drops of argan oil and finger comb it throughout my hair and let my hair dry naturally. I&#x27;ve noticed that my hair is less frizzy and dry and looks a whole lot healthier.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I truly recommend this product and really love how my skin and hair looks and feels. I can&#x27;t wait to see how much better my hair and skin will look after I am finished using the bottle.</li>
            <li> This is a great product--I bought it for my hair, but like it even better for my face!  It doesn&#x27;t make you break out and truly works like &amp;#34;No Reason to Hide&amp;#34; which is $68.  This is a total steal.  And I know I sound like a sales rep, but I&#x27;m not.  I&#x27;ll sure take the commission though... ;)</li>
            <li> The product is really good, it&#x27;s a light oil that isn&#x27;t too heavy and keeps your skin moisturized. My only dislike was that I bought this as a gift for someone, but the label on the bottle was crinkled, like the person sticking it on was in a rush and did not care enough to straighten it out. -1 star for presentation, especially since it was a gift.</li>
            <li> Great Product. I will definitely order again!</li>
            <li> It is the best, leaves the skin soft.  I like it!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you so much!!</li>
            <li> I love Argan oil, anywhere i see it i must buy it, its also in its purest form, goes on the skin and hair smooth, leaving the skin smooth like a babies butt, when used int he hair it prevent my hair from looking dry and brittle.</li>
            <li> Great! Just what I needed, and at a great price also. I use it every night before bed and it my skin feels soft when I wake up.</li>
            <li> Great value, love how it makes my hair soft and smoothed out the frizz!</li>
            <li> This is a very pure product that will work well in my homemade shampoos. No leakage during shipping! Very happy with the quality.</li>
            <li> Got this oil to try because my skin is so dry from winter..Love how it feels on the face and hair..really and improvement on both will order again..</li>
            <li> I have used this as a leave in condtinor as my hair is always so dry and dead and what a difference my hair actually looks normal again .</li>
            <li> It really is a lovely brand - it&#x27;s light, smooth and there is no smell.  I usually purchase a much more expensive brand from Sephora, but after a bit of research and reading the reviews I&#x27;m really glad I gave this brand a try - I think I will continue to use it.</li>
            <li> Great oil. Scent is not too strong either. Will order again.</li>
            <li> I ordered this product at a reduced rate as part of group to test this product and write a review.  I love this product.  It is light and does an outstanding job of moisturizing.  I use it every day on my hair.  I keeps my hair moisturizer without feeling greasy.  I also use it on my cuticles and skin with outstanding results.</li>
            <li> I love Argan oil, and this is really good! I use it every day</li>
            <li> My new favorite and ONLY facial moisturizer that I will use.  Using with peptide complex from the same company and my skin is noticably improving. :)</li>
            <li> Great, pure argan oil. This stuff works wonders on skin, hair and nails but I was really happy to see a product that was also not tested on animals, came in a recyclable bottle and has several eco certifications. This argan oil is the responsible way to go.</li>
            <li> High quality feel! Just a couple drops goes a long way! This is perfect for giving your hair the smoothness it seeks!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s left my skim feeling great, and it smells good too!</li>
            <li> Love this for my hair!</li>
            <li> I love this 100%!pure argon oil.  I use it for so many things such as moisturizer my skin, cuticles, and hair.  It is not greasy and is absorbed quickly into the skin.  I love that it is organic and free from parabens and other harmful chemicals.  The company also has a guarantee of you are not satisfied with their product.</li>
            <li> Makes your hair very soft and touchable! Don&#x27;t overuse and it will work amazing! I add a couple drips to my hand with my hair conditioner and rub it in.</li>
            <li> Love this Argan Oil. It really helps my super dry hair and skin.</li>
            <li> I run this thru my hair after every wash, it helps keep my hair from being frizzy while also not making it oily, better then some expensive hair care products I have used before</li>
            <li> I like using the Foxbrim&#x27;s Argan Oil to moisturize my hair. My hair is thin and dull. Well with the Argan Oil it has come back to life quite a bit. I have Alopecia Areata so while the Argan Oil does not help with my hair thinness it does give it that moisture and a little bit of fullness to it. It does not weigh down my hair, as the Foxbrim Argan Oil is almost weightless, it also does not have a harsh or bad head-turning/stomach-turning smell. It is a very light nutty smell, but again it is hair to notice. I use Foxbrim Argan Oil for other things as well, like skin moistener and helping my nails. But for right now until I can write more and have a bit more time for results I am leaving my review off here. My overall review is a 4 out of 5 and is recommended by me for anyone who wants a healthy way and non-chemical way to moisturize their Hair, Body and Skin.</li>
            <li> I like this argan oil! It works great on my hands and arms and I add it to other products I use.The second bottle I ordered came to me broken and empty and Amazon quickly refunded me for that. Great service! I will order this again!</li>
            <li> what an amazing product, i love it</li>
            <li> too little product too much money  will try to find wholesale</li>
            <li> Wow, this oil is wonderful.  Makes my skin few all dewy and soft.  Only been using it for four days and already I can see a difference in the tone of my skin.  Thank you so much.</li>
            <li> Very good because it takes only a few drops for your face and neck and moisturizes nicely, not greasy.</li>
            <li> First, I would like to thank Argan Oil Co for try their Argan Oil. The oil is really amazing, After using for seven days I noticed difference on my skin. My skin became mu clearer and brighter. Even the black heads were going away. My co-worker noticed the difference in my skin clearances. Regarding using the product for the hair, I did not noticed difference in hair growth, but what I realize that my hair became software, and fall less. Prephaps if I continue using for longer period of time I will see a result in hair growth. Overall, I love the product and I purchased second bottle.</li>
            <li> I received the FoxBrim Argan Oil fee and for review.  I have used Fox Brim products before and have been very satisfied.  I have also used Argan oil products before, s I was very curious as to how this would compare.  The oil came in a 2 fl.oz. dropper bottle and stated on the front it was 100% Argan Oil.  It is light n color and the dropper makes it easy to control the amount administered.  It does no have much of a scent which can be a plus, so you can wear whatever fragrance you like otherwise.  Since I have used argan oil before, I decided to try something different with this version.  The heels of my feet are cracked beyond belief.  So, I thought, why not give the Argan oil a try.  I rubbed a thin layer on my feet before bed, paying particular attention to the bottoms.  I then out on a pair of socks and kept them on overnight.  Within days, my dry cracked heels softened and my skin became much smoother.  I also did not have to put up with the pain of the cracks.  I know there are so many uses for this oil, but if this I the one thing I use it form then I am totally satisfied.</li>
            <li> Great product for nails, hair and skin!!!!  Got it for nails and used several times a day the first few weeks.  They were peeling back in thin layers.  This oil stopped the peeling and my nails are now healthy and moisturized feeling!  I use it on them everyday.  It&#x27;s also GREAT for HAIR and dry skin!  A tiny bit on hands rubbed into hair makes it SHINE.  Great for slit ends.  Makes hair look healthy.  I&#x27;ve bought 2 bottles of this so far.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve heard you can use this oil on your skin, but I&#x27;ve only used it on my hair. It smells great and makes my hair shine. I&#x27;m preparing to purchase 1 or 2 more bottles because this one suddenly disappeared when my daughter visited. (I apologize if I misplaced it, but if I misplaced it, it&#x27;s just that I forgot where I hid it before my daughter visited!)</li>
            <li> ...but I wouldn&#x27;t put this on my face.  Even if there was residue on my hands from an hour ago, still wouldn&#x27;t touch my face with it.  Also, when I put it in my hair (after diluting and rubbing on my hands) it was very shiny, but also seemed stiff?  Smells a little odd but when I add a couple drops to whatever lotion I&#x27;m using it doesn&#x27;t bother me.&lt;br /&gt;Is it supposed to be so thick and goopy?&lt;br /&gt;I expected something much thinner than this, and when used by itself it doesn&#x27;t spread well.&lt;br /&gt;Is there some sort of trick to using this that I don&#x27;t know about?</li>
            <li> This is a really nice product.  It is very moisturizing yet light in texture.</li>
            <li> The shipment was really fast! The bottle is good quality and I hope the product is good as well :)</li>
            <li> I love this product, best quality,, best price, ...wouldn&#x27;t buy any other one!! Was going t try Josie Marin but why, same thing for half the price.., So glad I found this on Amazon..bought 3 bottles...Love use twice a day  on face and on ends of hair!!</li>
            <li> I am traveling and realized I left my Josie Maran Argan Oil at home.  So, at our first long stop, I ordered this, as it specifically states it is for hair, skin, and nails.  I have been using it for almost a week, and my dry cuticles are almost healed.  However, and it is a huge &amp;#34;however,&amp;#34; my nails are so soft, they are peeling away.  I will be leaving thus behind, as our friends might use it on their dog&#x27;s coat if the vet says it is OK.  This us the second Argan oil product I have tried for my nails, both touting their purity, and not softened my nails.  Josie Maran&#x27;s Pure Argan Oil is somehow different, as my nails are wonderfully strong when I use it every night-- and my cuticles are gone!</li>
            <li> It is so odd that the very areas I used to have problems with being oily are now tending towards being dry and flaky.  This oil is great.  Does not just sit on top of your skin and do nothing, it actually soaks right in, smells and feels good and I know it is working.  Those dry patches are so much better when I use this following a shower or facial wash.  For years a good moisturizer was fine, now I need something stronger and more effective.  The dry patches would not even go away with exfoliation.  Works well on my nails too, which is why I bought it in the first place.</li>
            <li> doesn&#x27;t do as advertised for me, and there is a slight funky small</li>
            <li> I was selected to try Foxbrim’s 100% Argan Oil (via Tomoson.com). Argan oil is easily one of my favorite products (along with Rosehip oil, which I’ll soon be reviewing).&lt;br /&gt;Argan oil is nature’s answer to all of the problems I mentioned, and more. I’ve reviewed Foxbrim products on my blog before, and I’ve loved them all. Their argan oil is no different. It’s all-natural, and isn’t mixed with other kinds of oils to dilute the natural effect, as many oils are. This is full and complete argan oil, in all its wonderful glory.&lt;br /&gt;To combat dry skin, add a bit of Argan oil to your favorite lotion.  A small bit goes a long way, so only use a few drops. Your skin will thank you. Rub a couple drops in your palms and massage into that static-ridden hair to calm the Medusa-locks. Massage into the split skin. Put a couple drops into your favorite shampoo or conditioner for added shine. The list goes on and on. This product is simply fabulous.&lt;br /&gt;Foxbrim is a great company and has wonderful customer service. Their products (at least every one I’ve tried so far) are high in quality.&lt;br /&gt;I rate this product five very shiny, golden stars.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s OK but certainly not a miracle worker. Olive oil works just as well.</li>
            <li> This is an amazing product.  I have purchased many products for my face and hair and not only is this the only product that I can use for both, it out performs even the most $$$ high dollar Dermatologist prescribed products that I have used.  I tend to breakout and this is the first product that I have ever used that did not cause even the smallest breakout.  I have been using it for nearly a month and my skin is softer, feels great, and no breakouts!! I also use it to moisturizer my formerly dry and frizzy hair and it improved it after the first use!  I cannot say enough great things about this product.</li>
            <li> So far so good a little change in my hair.</li>
            <li> I use this product on both my skin and hair. It works great.</li>
            <li> Not so sure about this. The propedoct smells a bit &amp;#34;rancid&amp;#34;. Or maybe thats how 100% pure argan oil smells...Not sure but I wouldn&#x27;t purchase this again.</li>
            <li> It smells as argan oil should smell, I think it is definetly pure, since I have bought some that as not as pure, this one is.  Will buy it again when I finish this bottle.</li>
            <li> Love this product and Aria Starr Beauty (I&#x27;ve personally received excellent customer service from this seller)! Would highly recommend- Just used it on a sunburn on my forehead and cleared it up in 1 day, no peeling! I use this product on my hair, cuticles, etc. and currently have 2 bottles. As an Esthetician (I should&#x27;ve known better then to allow a sunburn- honest mistake), I stand behind this wonderful product!!</li>
            <li> I have used it a few times and it is very nice oil. It has a very light almondy type scent that dissapears quickly. A very tiny bit of oil is all you need for your face.  I have trouble with my thumbs cracking in winter from being in water too much so I have been using it on my hands over night. It works better than anything esle I have tried. I have not tried it on my hair as I have thin hair and think it would be too oily.&lt;br /&gt;The shipping was quick and I have no complaints. Seems to be the genuine thing and I am happy with this purchase.</li>
            <li> I was introduced to pure Argan Oil during a &#x27;spa package&#x27; on a cruise. When she poured  Argan oil on my head and face, I almost hyperventilated!  Afterwards, I couldn&#x27;t believe how soft (not oily) my face was, and fine lines diminished.  I was so impressed I purchased a bottle from the spa. When it ran out (over a year later) I purchased from Amazon.  I use it each morning and night before bed.  It&#x27;s no exaggeration that my crow&#x27;s feet have diminished greatly over the past year.  It truly is liquid gold.</li>
            <li> I have very dry skin and I love to wash my face, tone and put a thin layer on my face before bed. I tried it on my hair but I think I put a little too much, but it&#x27;s 100% pure and you can&#x27;t get better than that! I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> Excellent quality oil</li>
            <li> Great Pure product. I love how it feels on my hair and skin..</li>
            <li> I love this product.  I use it on my face, my hair and on my cuticles.  A little goes a long way.  I will definately purchase this product again.</li>
            <li> While I like the organic argan oil, I very much dislike being harrassed to do a review which is what Troy at Foxbrim did.</li>
            <li> I really love this argan oil.  My skin looks so much better.  The previous argan oil I bought from another brand cannot compare.  My skin is more hydrated and even my skin tone looks better!</li>
            <li> Worked wonders on my childrens&#x27; hair.</li>
            <li> Have only been using it for a little over a week but I am happy with this product so far.</li>
            <li> So far we&#x27;ve been using this on my daughter&#x27;s long, curly hair. It has hardly any &amp;#34;smell&amp;#34; which is great, compared to using coconut oil. It hydrates well, and has given her curls some life again.</li>
            <li> I have really enjoyed this product. I use it on my face and hair. My husband uses it on a scalp he says it has help with the dryness.&lt;br /&gt;We will defiantly  order again.</li>
            <li> This oil is wonderful! I am using it for my hair and for my personal skin care products and the texture is lovely. I can tell that the quality is amazing (no stickiness of fillers)!  I got my item promptly and in perfect packaging.  I really enjoyed working with the company and I will definitely use them again in the future.</li>
            <li> Love this oil! I add it to my foundation too for a creamy look.</li>
            <li> Great oil, I love it!</li>
            <li> Did nothing to me... I have been using for over 2 weeks, skin still the same, makes hair super greasy .&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t see nothing WOWWWWW on this item, like the reviews says.&lt;br /&gt;BAD BAD- plus this is my second review ( Seller Deleted my first one)  Cmon... We must say the truth!!! Does amazon knows you have been deleting bad feeds left from buyers??? I bet they wont allow this.&lt;br /&gt;Keep this one! People must to know other opinions!&lt;br /&gt;Thanks</li>
            <li> This is my first time using the Argan Oil for my face. I use it regularly on my hair. I am using it especially at night and loving the results! Loving this purchase!!!</li>
            <li> Great product.  I&#x27;ve been using Argan oil for a few years and this is the nicest brand I&#x27;ve found.  I tried other brands and was actually shipped rancid oil, which was nasty.</li>
            <li> Works great and does not contain smelly additives. Really repaired my skin fast, and made my facial hair look nice! Give it a try! Also the seller is great with follow up and very responsive which I really appreciated :)</li>
            <li> I use it on my face before bed. However, I avoid my mouth, chine, and hairline as it will cause breakouts if you have naturally oily skin.</li>
            <li> I was looking for first cold press, but for the price this was really good.</li>
            <li> I like the oil so far. I mixed it with other natural oils for my daughter&#x27;s hair.</li>
            <li> I was surprised to find a product that actually met it&#x27;s claims. So often companies make promises about their products that simply are NOT true. This is the real deal. I&#x27;m a hairdresser and I love this for my hair and my clients hair. A few drops on wet hair and your blow dry will be salon beautiful. I use it on my face and feet after my bath too. It&#x27;s awesome !!!!!</li>
            <li> I bought this for my mother so this review is based purely off of her experiences with it. My mother has been buying countless products over the years to combat her insanely dried out hair due to years and years of chemically dying it. Nothing seemed to work and she had been looking for a solution for well over 15 years. I read about Argan oil and purchased a bottle for her and after the first use or two you could see a definitive difference. I think it&#x27;s safe to say that when she uses this bottle she will be ordering more.</li>
            <li> Great stuff! There are no miracle potions. But if you want to see what Argan oil can do for you this Foxbrim bottle is a good way to go.</li>
            <li> Great!  Texture, smell everything is what I hoped it would be.  Have used others that have been much more expensive, and believe me, this is just as good.  I use it for my face and hair.  Will buy again.</li>
            <li> Great product great price, excellent service.  Argon Oil for hair is amazing.  Just a few drops on freshly washed hair makes it shine and feel wonderful when dry.  For skin also A+ especially if you are seeking non-chemical skin products.</li>
            <li> My mistake.....instead of going back to see which Argan Oil I purchased previously, I ordered TWO bottles of this stuff (what was I thinking???)  I did put some in a spray bottle with water and didn&#x27;t notice anything negative.  But just before I left, I put a few drops in my hand and the smell hit me :-(  It smells absolutely rancid!!  The smell did seem to go away pretty fast.  Is that the &amp;#34;earthy/grassy/nutty scent&amp;#34; that&#x27;s referred to in other reviews?  Maybe so....just smells rancid to me.  And this is a much heavier oil than the first one I used...more the weight of cooking oil.  I definitely won&#x27;t be putting this on my face.  If I do decide that the smell is gone that quickly, it should work fine for my dry feet/heels.  But TODAY I&#x27;m ordering the one I should have ordered in the first place.  My bad!</li>
            <li> My skin feels smooth and moisturized.  I also use this product on my hair.  No more flakes and my hair feels smooth and shiny.</li>
            <li> I am reserving the fifth star because I have only been using this a few days. I bought this product primarily for my face. I have been using it once a day and I do like it. I am 51 (almost 52, where did the time go?)so I am not expecting any miracles but so far I can say that it is not greasy and I like the way it feels. I really like the way my make up (bareminerals powder) goes on over it. Today I threw some (4-5 drops) into my conditioner (dove) after shampooing my hair (also dove) left it in for about 10 minutes or so (had a nice soak in the tub) while I waited to let it seep in. I dried my hair as I usually do and LOVED the texture and the shine. I have pretty nice hair to begin with and this took it to a whole new level (just as rich, shiny and full of body as when I was in my twenties). If I was evaluating alone on the hair I would definitely give it a 5. BTW, I have Puerto Rican, curly, frizzy, dry hair which has always blown out well. I am looking forward to seeing what this will do for my curls when I decide to go \\&quot;ua naturale\\&quot;. I am using it also on my cuticles and dry heels. I&#x27;ll come back at a later date and give you the \\&quot;skinny\\&quot; on how that goes along with my mug!</li>
            <li> The fact that this Argan Oil sold by Foxbrim is organic gets a plus in my book. I’ve never tried argan oil before, so I didn’t know how my skin would react to it. According to the directions, you can dispense up to 3 drops unto the palms of your hands. To start with, I only used 2 drops on the first day I tested this out. After not getting any adverse effects, I went on to use 3 drops and rubbed it all over my hands. Surprisingly, this product is not too bad. It worked instantly and my skin absorbed it without problems. I was worried that I’d get that “oily” residue, but that wasn’t the case. It disappeared not too soon after being applied, but I was able to see the results. It was a good moisturizer, I must say. There was no strong odor or anything like that, so I was relieved. According to the label, you can also use the Foxbrim Certified Organic Pure Argan Oil on your hair, face, and nails. At this time, I’ll reserve this 60cc bottle for my dry hands, which desperately needs a solution. I’ll consider the other uses a BONUS!</li>
            <li> This oil is outstanding. My hair looks much better. It helps it look in its ultimate form and the bottle will last very long for my short hair. Totally recommend.</li>
            <li> Excellent. I was looking for a moisturizer for my face during the winter since my other moisturizer stopped working (coconut oil and jojoba oil). Now I mix 6 drops with a little coconut oil and put it on before I go to bed as well as 6 drops mixed in with my morning lotion! It has made my face softer than it ever has been in the past without causing any sign of a breakout. It does have a slight warm scent but it goes away in a couple minutes. Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> It is absolutely th best. I am very pleased with the great shine, softness and the ends are not breaking anymore.  I just love it.</li>
            <li> LOVE!! As a cosmetologist, I use daily!!</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t use long enough to rate but so far so good.</li>
            <li> I love the way, it made my hair feel.l would buy it again. And the sweet smell! So refreshing .Yep! I would buy a gain. MJ.</li>
            <li> Smooth, light and amazingly effective. I have sensitive, fairly dry skin on my face. I am outside a lot and need moisturizing that is effective but not heavy. This Argan oil is perfect. It is non- irritating, and absorbs instantly.</li>
            <li> I use this argan oil for face, neck, and hands. I apply it on my face and neck every night. My skin likes it, and I do not want to use my regular night cream anymore.</li>
            <li> I tried it but didn&#x27;t like it. I guess it is okay if you have really dry skin and want the extra layer of oil always on your face. But if your skin is like mine, I can&#x27;t stand oily face or any product that does not absorb.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other argan oil brand that I tried before absorbs very well.</li>
            <li> This one smells horrible. I was so disappointed when I opened the bottle.  I am apprehension to buy another bottle on Amazon. The last bottle of Argan Oil  I purchased from Radha, smelled the same. .Rancid. They probably get it from the same distributor.  I need an Argan Oil that doesn&#x27;t make me nauseous or break me out. My seemingly impossible quest continues. Any thoughts? ?</li>
            <li> Love this product,my hair feels so soft and smooth. I like that my split ends are starting to go away and my hair is growing out since I&#x27;ve been using this every day. Definitely a great buy!</li>
            <li> I love argan oil. I use a few drops on my face after a shower, a few drops rubbed into the ends of my hair (I have thick fine hair, my friend said it makes thinner hair a bit greasy so only use 1 drop if you have thinner hair) and I also use it in my lotion bars. It hydrates very well, it also rubs in easily but does leave a slight film. It doesn&#x27;t trigger my eczema which was huge to me since I tend to be a bit sensitive. I find it very moisturizing and use it every day after washing my face before going to bed. Excellent product, I will be purchasing it again after running out. Each bottle lasts me about 9 months.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only been using it for 2 weeks but it seems to be helping with my acne since I am having fewer breakouts.  I like how it does not make my skin oily!  I will keep using it, but I think it will take a couple months to see the real effects.</li>
            <li> My wife has tried the oil and has really liked it.  She has used it in her hair as a leave in conditioner and it has helped with the frizziness and dryness she was experiencing.  She is continuing using it every day to help treat her hair so it isn&#x27;t damaged from all she does to it.</li>
            <li> I have been using product for about 3 weeks. It absorbs quickly and leaves my skin soft.  I don&#x27;t use it on my hair so I cannot speak to that application.  I have used more expensive argan oils in the past and think that this oil from Foxbrim compares equally to those.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for a few weeks. I have some sun damage on my neck/chest area &amp; noticed huge improvements. I have also been rubbing the oil on a scar that is on my arm and it is slowly fading. I have replaced my face moisturizer with this as well. I will be purchasing more.</li>
            <li> I love this product! I use it in my hair and it&#x27;s been looking very healthy and shiny; a lot less frizzy too. I also use it on my face at night in place of moisturizer.</li>
            <li> The high rating for this product fancied me to buy this, but frankly after couple of months regular usage , i should say that its not worth all the praises and standing ovation. Frankly its light and does give a smooth touch to your skin but it can give your acne breaks maybe for me or some like skin textured people like me.&lt;br /&gt;I used them regularly on face and lips , the results being just above average and for the price i paid , i am sure to expect more than this. I had tried at times on my hair mixing with other oils and cant ascertain on its effect on hair at this moment, but i never felt that strong smell of agran in the oil.It just felt like any other oil to moisturize the skin.&lt;br /&gt;Honestly i would go for Extra virgin coconut oil which is very light, get absorbed quickly and gives you a feeling of being moisturized while not giving any greasy experiences. It doesn&#x27;t even stimulate acne outburst and treats your skin fairly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So my verdict will be that the oil is good( not excellent) if you are not prone to acne and don&#x27;t expect wonders on your skin in a very near future.</li>
            <li> I have an itchy rash that&#x27;s being less on a nuissance to my face with this oil. Thank you for letting me try it for free,</li>
            <li> When it arrived, it was leaking(I was unhappy about this) . After I tried it.  put some oil on my knee and skin. I feel happy again!!  Since it&#x27;s a natural, good touching and easy to spread oil. It makes me feel comfy.BTW, I am a oil lover, I bought lots of oil every year from amazon. The quality is very good!</li>
            <li> Great oil...you can use all over for hair, nails, face, dry skin....whatever!</li>
            <li> This is some amazing stuff.</li>
            <li> Dropper could work better but other than that, I love it.</li>
            <li> Wow I just don&#x27;t know where to start! Everything about this 100% PURE ORGANIC ARGAN OIL is Amazing!!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  First, the bottle is devine. I was enticed by the glass dropper! Omg how great is that! I hate those crappy  plastic droppers. Now I can reuse the bottle for my cooking!&lt;br /&gt;  Second, it lists how exactly to use the oil for your skin, hair, face and nails! Awesome so you don&#x27;t have to just guess.&lt;br /&gt;  Third, It&#x27;s not tested on animals &amp; is eco friendly!&lt;br /&gt;  Fourth but definitely not last, It has transformed every part of my body. My hair is less frizzy, soft and easier to work with, my nails are growing fast and not braking, my skin isnt dry anymore, especially on my face and it has soothed and helped my stretch marks from having my baby boy recently.&lt;br /&gt;  Foxbrim, I wanna thank you so much for your amazing products. You are so thoughtful when making your products and packaging for them. Thank you thank you thank you! ♡♡♡♡&lt;br /&gt;♡♡♡♡♡♡♡♡♡♡♡♡♡♡♡♡♡♡♡♡♡♡</li>
            <li> Fast absorbing, and makes hands really soft. I tried over 5 different kinds of intense lotion, but I think it has to be oil. I&#x27;m going to try mixing a few drops into my zims crack creme lotion as well! I have really dry skin where I have to wear lotion gloves over the winter to keep them from cracking. Overall, for the quality and quantity, the price is awesome!</li>
            <li> Love this stuff! I wasn&#x27;t sure about A.O. but heard so much about it and read reviews of this company and they were quite positive so I decided to take plunge. Glad I did! I love it so much! I have been using grapeseed oil for over a year now and like it but feel that the argan oil is a bit more effective in keeping skin hydrated and plumped without being greasy at all. Let me tell you, I am in my mid 30&#x27;s (closer to 40 now) and have always had oily skin with mild break-outs. I now have barely any break-outs, my skin is more combo/oily due to aging and this is not greasy or make me break-out at all! All I feel is smooth, plump and hydrated in morning after I have used 4-5 drops and rubbed into face/neck, in morning I wash my face and then with my SPF lotion add 2-3 drops to mix in for added benefit. It does have a slight odor but it is not off-putting and goes away after it is in skin. I kept reading about Josie Maran brand and I&#x27;m sure it is good but soooo expensive. This was a moderately priced option and seemed to have all the important things the high priced ones do- exact same ingredient list of only pure argan oil, organic, cold pressed, and no synthetics in process or ingredient. Try, Try, Try- you will love the results. This is not a miracle worker for reversing aging (although I am sure it helps) but merely takes what you have to give you more glow, smoothness, firmness and hydration we all crave. I feel like this is a perfect tool to have for aging gracefully and giving that look of \\&quot;she has a secret weapon\\&quot; no one knows about that makes her radiant!</li>
            <li> I received my product today. It was delivered way ahead of schedule and in perfect condition. I had already received an email describing some helpful hints about its benefits. The scent is so soft that it is almost imperseptible. I like the way it feels on my hands and arms. I rubbed it into my cuticles with only 1 drop on the first nail which was enough to rub onto all five fingers of that hand. Thank you, Foxbrim, for the quick follow up to be sure I understood the quality of this fabulous oil and the many ways I can use it. I had no idea what a fine product I was purchasing.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s good but the bottle should be bigger.</li>
            <li> Really nice organ oil formula - use it every day - skin looks and feels smoother. I only wish it had an SPF in it which I will shop for next time, but this is a great argan oil!</li>
            <li> Service and delivery was excellent.  The product is good.  I have no complaints.  I have had experience with an Argon oil that is a bit thicker but much more costly.  So far, I have no problems with this oil.&lt;br /&gt;I would give it 5 stars if it was thicker.  So, instead of 2 drops of oil to cover my face as a moisturizer, it takes me about 3-5 drops.  But, for the price, it&#x27;s equitable and I&#x27;m a happy customer.</li>
            <li> I have used Argan Oil products forever on my hair.  After receiving the Foxbrim 100% Argan Oil I was made aware that this product had so many other uses besides the hair.  So you may be asking, what can I use Foxbrim 100% Pure Argan Oil for? Well.....these things:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On your lips.  Yep, this stuff is AMAZING for your lips!  I put a small amount on once in the morning and once at night, and my lips have never been softer.  Here in my neck of the woods, temperatures can go from 70 degrees to 30 degrees and back up to 70 in a flash which is murder on your lips.  This stuff.....total miracle worker.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On your hands.  My hands are constantly dry and cracked because I am always washing them.  Foxbrim 100% Argan Oil has been a total life saver since I began using the product.  My hands are so smooth and soft now.  It is also good for your cuticles.  I have also been applying the product specifically to my cuticles day and night, and they are well on their way to looking more healthy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On your feet. I started putting this product on the bottom of my feet at night.  They feel smoother after a couple of days!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And finally....hair.  As I mentioned earlier, I have been using other Argon Oil products on my hair that I picked up at my local store and have been satisfied with the results.  My hair is naturally curly and thick and gets frizzy with even a small amount of humidity.  With the Foxbrim product, I have been putting it in my hair before bedtime, letting it soak in overnight.  After showering the next morning and before blow drying, I apply a few drops of the oil mixed in with my straightener product.  This product performs about the same if not a bit better than my other product in regards to making my hair softer and keeping the frizzes under control.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The company also stated that this product could be used as a Face Moisturizer, but with my already acne prone skin, I did not test it on my face.  I do believe though if you have really dry skin on your face, this stuff would work wonders!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are a guy, the company also states that this makes a great pre-shave oil.  Added to your favorite shaving cream &amp;#34;gets those whiskers primed and ready to go!&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I am extremely impressed with this product.  It has so many uses and really is a great value! A little goes a long way with the product and will last me a bit longer than previous products.  Would I purchase this product again?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Absolutely!ave really dry skin on your face, this stuff would work wonders!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are a guy, the company also states that this makes a great pre-shave oil.

            <li> Excellent!  A few drops is all that is needed.</li>
            <li> I have been using this oil on my face without any breakouts and recently someone I had not seen in a while told me I look younger than ever. I am 64 and have tried all kinds of expensive face creams. I also use it on my neck and chest area. I never thought of using oil on my face until I watched a video from a estheticen(sp?).</li>
            <li> My hair is just constantly pummeled with humidity. It&#x27;s awful.&lt;br /&gt;Using the Argan Oil, I can finally get it manageable while working outside. I even get compliments!&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s smooth and refined even as I&#x27;m sweating and cursing at the heat and/or rain. It&#x27;s definitely a game-changer.</li>
            <li> Another beauty find brought to you by Foxbrim. In the world of moisturizing comes an oil derived from the Argan tree&#x27;s nut. The un-roasted kernels provide an oil that is rich in nutrients and helps skin hold moisturize, plus improves it&#x27;s appearance and texture.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Benefits:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Rich in Vitamin E&lt;br /&gt;Rich in Essential Fatty Acids&lt;br /&gt;Deep Hydration&lt;br /&gt;Nourishing&lt;br /&gt;Easily Absorbed into Skin&lt;br /&gt;Repairs and Replenishes your skin&#x27;s moisture allowing fine lines/wrinkles to diminish&lt;br /&gt;Safe for all skin types from sensitive skin to even acne prone skin&lt;br /&gt;What you don&#x27;t Get:&lt;br /&gt;Foxbrim&#x27;s Argan oil is 100% certified Organic and derived from Morocco to ensure the best quality and highest grade. The product&#x27;s purity makes it perfect for beauty applications from skin to even your hair. Free of Parabens, Phthalates, or Sulfates.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Retail Price Point: $13.95 for a 2 ounce bottle on Amazon (100% Money Back Guarantee if not satisfied.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Use:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Simple to use and like any other beauty oil, a little goes a long way, Just a few drops can be applied to the skin&#x27;s surface and you want a nice thin layer, which will absorb quickly and leave your skin feeling hydrated. I like to first rub the oil in my hands and then gently press against my face to ensure a light but even application. You can use your finger tips to get to the areas around your eyes by using a soft patting motion. I also used it as a base for a lip exfoliatant by adding sugar and just using my lips (slight pressure) to rub the mixture for about 30 seconds. You then rinse and you are left with smooth lips that look healthy and fresh, but not left dry due to the gentle exfoliation you get from the sugar and the moisture from the Argan oil.Use:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What to Expect:&lt;br /&gt;Over time and especially if you address the problem areas, like around your eyes, fine lines, wrinkles, you will see an improvement with texture. I did a 4-week trial and did see a reduction in fine lines, to some even smoothing out and barely noticeable. Winter tends to be harsh on my skin, but Foxbrim&#x27;s Argan oil kept my skin looking dewy and fresh. You get a nice natural glow and I experienced zero blemishes and/or clogged pores from the product. I started also using it in my hair, before blow drying and I love how soft it leaves my hair. No oily residue that appears on clothes but my hair looks great and I get less frizz or static.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was very satisfied with the product and will be adding it to my oil regimens and I like using Foxbrim&#x27;s Argan oil combined with my Coconut oil.  The benefits and being that the product is Organic is big plus when it comes to other brands.  Foxbrim&#x27;s Argan oil also comes in a glass bottle with a dropper that easily measures out what you need with zero waste!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received the above product(s) free of charge from Foxbrim.

            <li> The oil appeared cloudy and had a faint scent of burning rubber which I thought might be from the rubber dropper. Once I rubbed some oil in my hands the smell became very strong and I nearly gagged. The oil is either tainted, rancid or both and I&#x27;m sending it back for a refund.</li>
            <li> First of all, I had no other brand to compare it to, but it really is an amazing product.&lt;br /&gt;We tried it on Elijah&#x27;s excema and there was a definite softening of the skin.&lt;br /&gt;I used it in place of my existing face moisturizer and had excellent results. Don&#x27;t picture putting olive oil on your skin. Argan Oil goes on very &amp;#34;clean&amp;#34; feeling, leaving your skin very refreshed.&lt;br /&gt;I am not disciplined enough to put it on my dry feet daily, but wish I would!&lt;br /&gt;My favorite use was on the hair! I only had to use a few drops when brushing out Hadassah&#x27;s tangles. It was great on my own hair after blow drying. It took care of my frizzy fly aways!&lt;br /&gt;I also enjoyed the sweet slightly nutty aroma.&lt;br /&gt;The only downfall I experienced was the dropper container. Not my favorite. Wish I could use it out of a pump, but that was just because I was using it all the time. The kids did not always put it away correctly either... but that is expected. It won&#x27;t keep me from purchasing it in the future though! http://buckoutfamily.blogspot.com/2014/12/foxbrims-100-pure-organic-argan-oil.html</li>
            <li> It leaves a bit of a greasy film on your face...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I read that Argon Oil didn&#x27;t do this, so I was a little disappointed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not sure if it was the brand or not.</li>
            <li> Very good. I have used this for a long time and I really like it.</li>
            <li> I bought this product because I was told that pure argan oil was the best thing for my hair. Reviews of the oil said it would not leave hair greasy and would increase shine and manageability. This has not been my experience with this product. I have waist length, fairly straight hair and a pea sized amount leaves my hair clumpy and sticky. The bottle itself dispenses the oil with a dropper which is extremely inconvenient as the oil is so watery that it is impossible to screw the dropper back on and close the bottle without the oil dripping off of your hand. The smell does dissipate and is not unpleasant but I am very disappointed with the oil itself. I am going to buy the Sedu oil instead going forward.</li>
            <li> Lovely 100% Pure Argan Oil.  I love  it - use it in my bath, on body, face and hair.  Absorbs quickly and does not clog pores.</li>
            <li> it smells a little like super 8 oil which isn&#x27;t bad and the labels different than the one you advertised. but other than that it&#x27;s a great product thank you.</li>
            <li> I Love this product. It was my first time buying it. And I&#x27;ve used it on my nails, face and hair so far and like all the results. 3 drops goes a long way. :)</li>
            <li> I love Argan oil!! So many different uses!! Its good for almost everything!!</li>
            <li> I use a lot of argan oil for skin and hair. This oil is great and a great amount to use liberally.</li>
            <li> Great product I&#x27;m very satisfied!</li>
            <li> This oil have many uses, I use it for shaving; my shavings using this oil are much, much smoother than with regular shaving foam.&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended</li>
            <li> I have heard many good things about Aragan oil and iam happy to add this light low to now fragrance oil to my beauty box. I can see  much added shine to my hair.</li>
            <li> It is the same as the others from what I have experienced.  Get more than a few drops and you will be shampooing again.</li>
            <li> GOOD QUALITY OIL - NICE DROPPER BOTTLE</li>
            <li> I have tried quite a few kinds of Argan Oil in the past.  I like Foxbrim because it smells fresher than any other kind I&#x27;ve used and after being on my skin for a while there is no greasy feel. I have only been using Foxbrim for a short while, but I intend to re-order this brand - thank you for finding a quality product for me.</li>
            <li> With my 1st time order of the product I got this ORANGE Argan oil bottle. I didn&#x27;t like the smell. But it actually worked on my skin in the severe winter time. So I can give it a &amp;#34;5 star&amp;#34; happily. After 2 months, I ordered for another bottle and I got this GREEN covered bottle as shown in picture. After using I could clearly feel the difference between the two. The 1st bottle had a very strong smell (even though i didnt like it) but I liked the fact that it was original. And now I am so confused as the new  bottle has very light scent...The 2nd one doesn&#x27;t work (even in this spring) as great as the 1st one did in winter.&lt;br /&gt;I just want the seller to explain me which one of them is actually 100% pure??????</li>
            <li> Quality oil. Moisturizes well. Comes with a helpful dropper to control quantity used.</li>
            <li> Good product, works as described, highly recommend.</li>
            <li> This is my first time using an argan oil product so I have nothing to compare it to. It applies pretty smoothly and doesn&#x27;t leave a greasy film on my skin. It did have a bit of a smell to it, but I can deal with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;** received for review and inspection purposes **</li>
            <li> I bought this for my wife to treat some dry skin on her face.  The product has worked flawlessly, and helped bring a glow back to some trouble spots.  In addition, I have found that it really works well on my fingers.  Applying some to my cuticle and nail has eliminated hang nails, and strengthened the overall nail.  There seems to be a ton of ways to use this oil, of which the  bottle lists a few.  I look forward to testing some of the other applications.  Overall, I would highly recommend this product as a treatment for skin and nails!</li>
            <li> Really like this product!</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this oil!  I use a tiny bit on my face and rub some into my hair just after a shower, makes it really shine.  And my face feels so soft.  Received the order very quickly and well packaged.  Thanks!  Will definitely buy again.</li>
            <li> I LOVE THIS ITEM YES!!!!! I use this item almost everyday. Ok 1st I have to say I have dandruff and this oil has really helped so much. I now use after every wash to help moisturize my scalp and hair. I also use on face, hand, feet and nails. Thanks I have the amazing chance to try for free from tomoson.</li>
            <li> Love it...use it for wrinkles, neck, as body lotion or hair treatment....</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this argan oil.  It is pure and quite inexpensive.  Gotta love all these deals on Amazon.</li>
            <li> ABSORBS QUICKLY, SOFT SKIN, THANK YOU</li>
            <li> Love it so much, bought my mom a bottle too.  Will purchase again.</li>
            <li> Great results with my itchy scalp and dry fingernails. Problems with hangnails has ended. Thanks</li>
            <li> 52 years old with very dry skin in a cold, Chicago winter.... this, along with the Vitamin C &amp; E Hyaluronic Acid is the best product I&#x27;ve ever used for my skin!!!</li>
            <li> Good product, has no smell, very silky on the skin and absorbs well.  This is my first experience with this product and I foresee a reorder in the coming months.  Good seller, very attentive, reaches out to their customers.</li>
            <li> I have only used it a few times since I haven&#x27;t had it very long but so far so good. One of the best things about it is that it doesn&#x27;t leave a thick residue on my hands and my hair is much more manageable after using only a few drops.</li>
            <li> I just put a couple of drops on my hand, then rub it on the ends of my hair and bye bye frizzy hair, love it !</li>
            <li> So far so good. The smell is a little off but nothing a little peppermint oil or other fragrance can&#x27;t fix</li>
            <li> Great product. i truly love it</li>
            <li> Smooth and wonderful. This argon oil is perfect to put on my face after showers.  Love the feel and the results!</li>
            <li> Shipping was fast but the product is very greasy even using a tiny bit</li>
            <li> Pros:  This is my new staple product. I absolutely love multifunctional products. I am a 28 year old African/Irish American with extremely dry skin and hair  (4A).  I used it at night for my skin and wake up with amazing results. My skin is no longer dry and itchy. A little goes a long way. It works great for the hair also. I have chemically damaged hair and in the process of transitioning. This works wonders with adding moisture and defining my curls. Great company. I received my order within two days. That dark bottle is great for preserving the natural oil. I highly recommend this Argan Oil. Cons: None.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff, I have curly hair and sometime it gets to looking a little dry i just run some of this on my tips and BAM! shiney and awesome!!</li>
            <li> I really like this Argan oil! I have used a lot of others in the past and they always seem to be a little too heavy, but this one is perfect! It&#x27;s very light and adds a good deal of shine to my natural curly hair, that is normally very dry. I also use it on my face and other dry parts of my skin as needed. I really like that it doesn&#x27;t weigh my hair down or make my face feel greasy (like the others I have used) and it&#x27;s reasonably priced. :) I will definitely buy it again and continue to use it on a routine basis.</li>
            <li> I got this for my wife and she is very please with it. She tells me all the time to order more. It&#x27;s exactly what she wanted.</li>
            <li> I love it, my skin feels better at last. I recommend it!</li>
            <li> I tried it on my face and it shows. It is not so dramatic, but my eyes look more rested and less wrinkled and most important, it did not cause any acne. I also tried it on my hair twice, but that&#x27;s not enough to give a result I guess.</li>
            <li> I like it I use it everyday.</li>
            <li> The Argan oil arrived well packaged, sealed and in great condition.  We purchased the Organic oil in a promotion for testing and review.  As I&#x27;ve aged, my hair continues to lose it&#x27;s youthful luster, and looks dry and dull.  I use Argan oil on my damp hair, after washing, and style as usual.  My hair looks much healthier and has a beautiful shine.  I also love that this brand is Organic</li>
            <li> One of my favorite oils! I have naturally curly hair and I use this once a week and it helps control my frizz. It also helps control manageability and tangles. I use this on my skin and nails also. I have noticed a dramatic increase in the growth rate of my nails and hair also. Smells really good, but not over powering. I am so glad I have two of these.</li>
            <li> Love argan oil for my hair  excited to try it on skin!!</li>
            <li> I really like to use natural oils to help condition both mine and my daughter&#x27;s hair so I was interested in trying this product free* to review. Everyone does it a little differently but the way we use it is to rub a liberal amount into our hair the night before we plan on shampooing and pop on a scarf and sleep on it to really give it time to absorb. Then the next morning when we get up we shampoo and condition our hair. We found this helps our hair stay in good health without being weighed down to much by heavy conditioners, leave in treatments, etc. I actually alternate this treatment on my hair by swapping it out with a tea tree oil to help combat itchy scalp and dandruff too. I&#x27;ll do one week with this, one week with that. My daughter I just use this once a week as she doesn&#x27;t have the scalp issues I have yet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I found this oil was comparable to other oils I have used. It has an earthy scent to it and has a similar, color and feel as some other Argan oils that I have tried. It came in a dark brown with a glass dropper attached to the cap to help you dispense the product. I like the idea that this is organic, I don&#x27;t specifically search out products that are, but I feel better when I am using products that are.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve read that this oil is really good for the skin and cuticles too, but I haven&#x27;t tried it directly on my skin yet as I am currently working on using up some other products first. I am definitely going to start trying it on my cuticles!  It does work really well in both mine and my daughter&#x27;s hair though. Our hair is looking shiny, healthy, moisturized and not dirty or weighed down. I would buy it again. After using this a couple times I actually had a co-worker ask me how come my hair was always so shiny!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*Regardless of the item being free this is my 100% honest opinion.</li>
            <li> I live in AZ. My face and hair was  always very dry. I tried this argan oil thinking it might be too oily. No so! It absorbs into my skin and hair making it look soft and moisturized. I love this product!</li>
            <li> for some reason it smells rancid. :-( I have bought from another company before and it smelled good. Normal. This smelled perhaps old.</li>
            <li> Fantastic! Makes my skin smooth and my hair shiny. I love using it on my cuticles.</li>
            <li> Great for my hands and nails!!!</li>
            <li> I rarely write reviews but this stuff is amazing for your skin!</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe people spend $50 or more on argan oil from other companies when this foxbrim argan is the exact same quality if not better. I&#x27;ve had really dry, red, and sensitive skin around my eyes that no moisturizer has ever been able to correct but a few weeks of applying this argan oil around my eyes and my skin is now functioning normally. not red or dry and I&#x27;ve noticed the dark circles under my eyes have lightened. I have also began using the oil cleaning method in a double cleaning routine. so oil cleanse first followed by regular cleanser. I use a mixture of this argan and jojoba and my skin is loving it - it&#x27;s capable of dissolving all kinds of dirt and oil from your skin and washing it down the drain.</li>
            <li> I love it! My best organic for my hair!</li>
            <li> Wife loves it and will buy more</li>
            <li> I used this, jojoba, and essential oils to make a beard oil for my manly husband. He likes that his beard is soft without being greasy and his skin is more moisturized. I have some face and hair plans for the near future for myself.</li>
            <li> Smoother and Shinier hair! So much better than greasy, unpleasant smelled coconut oil (UH!)</li>
            <li> This Argon oil is amazing. I can tell a big difference when I use it on my hair. It reduces frizz, cuts down on blow dry time, and adds lots of shine. And unlike some smoothing serums I&#x27;ve tried, it doesn&#x27;t reduce volume or make the hair look oily at all. As a cosmetologist, I use this on my clients all the time. It is an all around great buy.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried different oils for my skin and this argan oil is the best of the lot. It leaves my face very soft and hydrated. I am sold on it!</li>
            <li> Great for skin, hair,nails etc.. I have become a big fan of argan oil I love how soft it makes your hair feel and it&#x27;s great for your nails too...</li>
            <li> I use this 100% pure argan oil on my face and in my hair. It works wonderfully on my super dry skin and hair. It is so smooth and feels good going on.</li>
            <li> Works great for very dry skin. Would recommend highly and the price here is much better than other places I have seen it for sale.</li>
            <li> Fox Brim has an extensive line of beauty products to which they have given me the product complimentary for my 100% honest opinion in regards to how it works for me.  This company never lets me down with their products.  Fox Brim uses organic ingredients and their products come with a 100% satisfaction guarantee.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This time I was asked evaluate their organic argan oil.  Argan oil can be used in so many different ways.  Exfoliating, softening, leave in hair conditioning, repairs cuticles, add it to you facial toner for added moisture for your skin.  It&#x27;s endless.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I feel like my hands look at least 10 years older than my actually age.  I&#x27;ve tried all kinds of different hand lotions to no avail.  So my favorite way to use Fox Brim&#x27;s Organic Argan Oil is as a softener and moisturizer.  I put it on my heels, hands, nails and cuticles.  It really does work wonders.  I have especially noticed how much younger my hands are looking since I started using the oil.  Being that Argan Oil is an oil a little bit goes a long way so keep this in mind as you are using the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would defiantly recommend Fox Brim&#x27;s  100% Organic Argan Oil to my friends and family.  Great Company and Product!</li>
            <li> Wonderful moisturizer, NOT greasy or have any lingering stickiness.  I put it on my grandson last night, who has eczema, he has not been itchy at all today.  This is a first time product for me and I love it.  I would buy it again.</li>
            <li> Great quality and price, very excellent description of product and it was so nice to get a follow up email to make sure I enjoyed it, or if there was any issues. I&#x27;ve used it on my hair and very happy with results. Other more expensive hair oils have lots of other ingredients including a lot of chemicals. I try to use all natural as much as possible. I also bought the jojoba oil from this company and I may mix the two for use in my hair.</li>
            <li> Great product! I have been using this for months and I can not go a day without it! It works great to soften the hairs before I shave and has done wonders for my fine lines. I even enjoy it in my hair, a little goes a long way</li>
            <li> Great product and fast delivery.</li>
            <li> Pleasantly surprised to learn it really was non-greasy, unlike Josie Maran&#x27;s generally revolting version of argan oil (If Josie Maran was your first argan oil, give argan oil another chance!). The smell doesn&#x27;t particularly stand out for me, but it is indeed nutty and quite nice! My combination skin feels soft after use; my heavily-dyed hair is still in the works for noticeable repair, but it&#x27;s been providing a lasting boost to help the frizz! There&#x27;s a lot of product in the container as well—it&#x27;s a happy purchase!</li>
            <li> love how soft it make my skin!</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product! I use it for everything, but primarily as a moisturizer. I use it in the morning after washing my face, and it has really helped my skin stay hydrated and as a result stay clear. It&#x27;s also amazing for split ends, cracked cuticles, dry skin on your hands, knees, ankles, sole of your feet, etc. It absorbs quickly, so your skin won&#x27;t feel greasy. And a little goes a long way! I use 4 drops every morning for my face, hands, and split ends. Basically addicted to this product. If you&#x27;re thinking of buying, don&#x27;t hesitate!!!</li>
            <li> I liked it&lt;br /&gt;But it has bad smell a little bit</li>
            <li> I received this Argan Oil and I love it. I originally bought it for my hair because it has been so dry and the Argan Oil has made my scalp not so dry and my hair soft. I read the insert and started using it on my nails also.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would buy it again!</li>
            <li> This argan oil is amazing! I&#x27;ve tried several different kinds but this one from Foxbrim is my favorite so far. This had no scent and made my hair feel nice. I put a couple of drops in my hands then rub it on the ends. The oil makes my hair super soft and tames my hair on humid days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have received this product at a promotional price for product review purposes. All opinions are my own and reflect my honest and unbiased opinion.</li>
            <li> Excellent product! Love the improvement it&#x27;s made on my skin in less than a week. Will definitely be keeping this in my skin care routine.</li>
            <li> I use the Argon oil on my face and neck. It absorbs very nicely and is not perfumey. I would recommed it.</li>
            <li> I purchased this for my hair and it works great.  Little did I know that there are other uses for the oil such as for the face.  For me this did not work as I developed an irritation on the skin at the outer edge of my eyes.  Just a note of caution.</li>
            <li> Smells very bad and oily on skin. Not sure why this products rating is so high. I don&#x27;t get it</li>
            <li> When I read my previous face moisturizer ingredients list, I cringed.  Maybe all those long words weren&#x27;t so bad, but they didn&#x27;t look safe to me.  This product only has one word, and it works amazingly well on my 50+  face.  This is the only moisturizer I&#x27;ve been using for about 6 months now.  It is a little oily when I first apply it, but about 10 minutes later, most of it is absorbed and I just rub the rest in.  I&#x27;m finding myself using it throughout the day on my hands and lips.  The scent is a little like nuts at first, but then dissipates to no scent at all.  It&#x27;s a wonderful product, and I&#x27;m happy it works well for me.</li>
            <li> This product sink and moisturize my dried skin very fast and is very effective for my skin. This is a product that I will always use it for my skin.</li>
            <li> I received my product and I was very happy, I used it once and I am happy with it, my hair feels great with just that one use. I definitely will get it again.</li>
            <li> Foxbrim Argan Oil really does do wonders for your hair. I have been using Argan Oil in my hair for a few years now and love the way it feels. It can leave your hair so soft and shiny. It tames my frizzes and makes my dry hair look healthy and beautiful. I don&#x27;t know about any of you, but my hair is one thing that I do have going for me and I need to try and keep it as beautiful as I can for as long as I can.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have really frizzy hair or even just dry hair like I do, this will work wonders on your hair. I apply it after I blow dry and just pat it all over my hair. It will make your hair shine and it tames the frizzies.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Works wonders on your nails and hands also. I have super dry skin and love using Argan Oil on the elbows, heels and my hands where my skin is really rough. Try using it right after a shower/bath so that you really lock in the moisture. You will see how silky smooth your skin will get. Works great on your face also as a moisturizer instead of your regular cream one if you have really dry skin there, too.</li>
            <li> I have heard so much about Argan Oil. It is talked about every where, mostly for our face and hair. I recently purchased a shampoo and conditioner with Argan oil in it. It is showing up in so many products by many huge companies.  I have been using a two drops added to my nightly facial moisturizer and using the residual left on my fingers for my elbows. Then i use a couple drops for my feet (toes and heels).  This helps give me the extra moisture I need during the night. The dropper is easy to control what you need. There is no odor to deter you from using it. By adding Foxbrim&#x27;s 100% Pure Argan Oil to your products on your own you know that it is in there and you can add as much as you like to get the result you want. I was sent this for review, however this does not effect my thoughts and opinions</li>
            <li> Wonderful product. Smells good feels even better. My skin loves it.</li>
            <li> *Apologies in advance for the long review!*&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I normally use organic extra virgin coconut oil and Watts brand retinol + hyaluaronic acid on my face, but adding this argan oil to my regimen has totally boosted the results, and therefore, changed my skin. The results were almost immediate, seriously!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m still only 33 years old, but because I slather my face with these oils at night, I look better than I did when I was 23. My fine wrinkles are faded and gone, and my pores are shrinking- which I didn&#x27;t think could ever be possible for me. I have a super oily T-zone, and using a few drops of argan oil as a day moisturizer (and under makeup) has regulated my spastic sebum. The stubborn blackheads on my nose and forehead are GONE, which is a complete shocker. I&#x27;ve had crappy skin since childhood. I got my first zit in kindergarten! Using the argan in the day, and argan+organic virgin coconut oil at night may seem like a high maintence chore to keep up with, but it&#x27;s really not, and it&#x27;s beyond worth it. If doing so can change my once-haggard skin, it can work for anyone. :) Oh, and it also gives you stupidly gorgeous hair, and helps eliminate dandruff. This stuff rules. And if you&#x27;re on the fence because of cost, seriously, don&#x27;t worry. It&#x27;s a multi-purpose oil and a little goes a looong way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, real quick, I just wanted to add that this seller was incredibly courteous, and the quality/quantity/price of the product is excellent (believe me, I shopped around to a ridiculous extent- I paid around $13 for this bottle ); Foxbrim is now my go-to argan oil brand!</li>
            <li> Love, love, love this product. I have been using Argan oil for about a year. This is by far the best version of this product I have ever tried. My hair is silky,very curly and no split ends. I reside in Hawaii where we have high levels of humidity and I work out outside daily. I need a product like this for my thick often frizzy hair. I have received many compliments on my hair. The change in my hair consistency showed up immediately after applying this version of the product. I will purchase from you from now on. Thanks for prompt shipping and delivery. Excellent and reliable customer service.</li>
            <li> I have been hearing so much about Argan  oil and wanted to try it. It is an excellent product. I will definitely buy it again at this great price.</li>
            <li> Non-greasy and wonderful for applying at night for face and neck.</li>
            <li> This oil is great. It absorbs into the skin, isn&#x27;t greasy or heavy. I love it on my hair and skin. I flat iron my hair and a few drops keep it looking straighter longer.</li>
            <li> Great product. It&#x27;s taming my split ends and making my hair shiny and soft. Thanks for a natural product that works as advertised.&lt;br /&gt;-Phyllis</li>
            <li> Fast delivery. This product is very thick oil so I use it on my rough spots (elbows, feet heels, etc)  versus on my hair. I&#x27;m sure it does wonders for hair but it may need to be warmed up ???  Either way it seems like good authentic argon oil n can be used for multiple reasons.&lt;br /&gt;It won&#x27;t go to waste.</li>
            <li> I had been hearing about the virtues of Argan oil for some time and was pleased to find that it really does work!  Leaves both hair and skin moisturized and silky soft.  This truly is a premium product at a great price through Amazon!</li>
            <li> If you haven&#x27;t tried Argan Oil for your hair yet then you need to purchase this product and try it out. Definitely helped with the frizzy hair.&lt;br /&gt;My daughter loves it. Makes hair easy to manage and it&#x27;s really a significant different.</li>
            <li> I love my argon oil. I will definitely order this product again.</li>
            <li> This product smells awful! Had to return. There is no way anyone would want to wear this on their hair or body.</li>
            <li> This is my fourth purchase of Foxbrim Argan Oil.  Aside from the nutty smell, which quickly goes away, this product is fantastic.  I use it on my face daily as a moisturizer.  I have very sensitive skin and was wary about trying it, but my skin has never been so soft and smooth and no breakouts which I thought would happen by putting oil on my face.  I will definitely purchase again.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t usually write reviews but I wanted to with this organ oil. I really have rarely had anything that has worked this well. I have really dry cuticles and with just one day of use they are close to being perfect. Wow!&lt;br /&gt;I used it on my dry heals and the cracks are almost gone. I think this might be a perfect product. And no, I was not paid or compensated for this review.</li>
            <li> Love it on my face and hair.</li>
            <li> This Argan oil is excellent quality. It leaves my skin so soft and smooth, and doesn&#x27;t clog my pores.</li>
            <li> Thank you! Love this gem!  We use it everyday!</li>
            <li> This was extremely  cloudy and lumpy. Will not be purchasing  again. I&#x27;m scared to order anything  else. Where is the quality  control?</li>
            <li> I love this product, I use it on my hair, and body yes even my face!! I have very dry skin and even break outs on my face I couldn&#x27;t get to clear up so I bought this Argan oil and what a difference so I have purchased more lol you want 100% Argan oil get this one it&#x27;s amazing.</li>
            <li> LOVE this stuff! Soaks right into skin and leaves you so soft!</li>
            <li> Great stuff. I like the dropper. Just a few drops is all you need.</li>
            <li> This product is amazing!  It has actually caused a fairly large sun-damage dark spot to almost disappear from my face in the past few weeks since I&#x27;ve started using it.  I&#x27;ve also been putting it on a large mole that I&#x27;ve had all my life along my jaw line.  Its become rather large in the past few years.  It seems to be shrinking now since I&#x27;ve been applying this Argan oil on it twice a day.  I&#x27;m very excited about it.  I&#x27;m also very happy to have a simple organic product to use on my face rather than the chemicals that I&#x27;ve used for most of my life.</li>
            <li> http://manicpixiedreammama.com/free-stuff-i-get-sent-foxbrim-certified-organic-argan-oil/</li>
            <li> Godsend! I use it as a leave-in conditionner. I leaves my hair smooth and fresh. Highly recommended. Will buy again.</li>
            <li> I use this for my hair and skin... My hair and skin looks and feels healthy</li>
            <li> Who doesn&#x27;t love Argan Oil. Its like the best stuff on the planet and works great for everything. This one being pure and nothing else added to it, gives off a fresh smell. I use this in my conditioner, just a few drops or so added, mixed up and added. Helps for thick, long curly hair people. I even add some into my deep conditioning as well, and makes my hair so soft, shiny, and feeling so good, you just can&#x27;t stop touching the hair awesome.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my Hair and it works really well to moisturize my hair, which is very very long. I read that it is also a good moisturizer for your face, well it is! I am of a certain age where those fine lines have started being just plain old wrinkles, lol but this Argan smoothed them a little with daily use. and it does not make your hair or skin feel greasy!  It totally absorbs into your hair and leaves it soft and shiney. Remember, a little goes a long way so this bottle will last a long time.</li>
            <li> Another great product!! Has my hair soft and manageable. Also great for my skin.</li>
            <li> Love this, awesome price, I will buy from this person in the future. Thank you so much</li>
            <li> So far it&#x27;s been a couple of weeks and my  face feels great! I recommend this product!</li>
            <li> I have very dry aging skin and this was marvelous. It is the best product combined with vitamin C I have used</li>
            <li> I was recently shopping in the mall, and came across a stand of Predire Paris Moroccan Argan oil body scrub and facial mask. I instantly fell in love. I have suffered from Acne since the age of 15, and have pigmentation scars, and a very uneven skin tone. I am red headed and have many freckles...lol. This stuff was amazing, but very expensive. The main ingredient was Argan Oil. Just within one application, i could tell the difference and it wowed me! I have never had such soft and glowing skin in all my life. I gave all my 4 children, and even my mother and husband facials and foot massages with this oil, and they were blown away. I decided then, that i would just save ALOT of money, and order straight Argan Oil from a retailer. That&#x27;s when i came across Foxbrim. I ordered this item late in the evening on Feb. 20, 2015. It arrived in my mailbox on Feb. 23, 2015. So, very FAST shipping, which i LOVED! I&#x27;d rather pay more for a product, and receive it  in a timely manner, than get it cheaper, and wait months for it to arrive. I was pleasantly surprised. I immediately washed my face with my daily products, and then put only 2-3 drops of this oil in my palm and placed in on my face! Talk about a feeling of silk skin!!!!! This stuff feels and smells like the real deal. It is truly AMAZING! I love the fact that i didn&#x27;t have to spend too much money, and it works just as wonderful as the most expensive brands. I will definatly be buying this, and keeping this oil in stock in my home. It not only works for me, but my whole family. My mother is addicted to this oil, and i will keep her in stock as well! YOU SHOULD INVEST IN THIS ITEM. YOU WILL NOT BE DISAPPOINTED...I PROMISE! It is great for your skin, hands, body, face, and even your hair. This little bottle is some powerful stuff! Don&#x27;t wait any longer...this oil will change your life!</li>
            <li> I recommend this product without reservation or hesitation.  It has the right consistency and a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> love love love this oil ...&lt;br /&gt;So many uses...</li>
            <li> Argan oils is so great for  hair. I think everyone should use it, It really makes your hair look so much better.</li>
            <li> LOVE this oil. I&#x27;ve used tons of expensive name brand oils and this is better than any of them. It&#x27;s such a great value and is in a huge bottle. I use it for my face, skin, and hair. I also love how the ingredients are all organic! And I just have to say how great this company is-- I had an issue and they were SOOO prompt to respond right away and took care of everything--- amazing customer service, great product!! DEFINITELY purchase!</li>
            <li> Good stuff. Definitely just as good as the Josie maran Argan oil I used when I first discovered the wonder of argan! One of the better brands on Amazon selling the argan oil.</li>
            <li> I actually purchased several items for my Granddaughter&#x27;s 4th of July Birthday.  She lives on the West coast, and we don&#x27;t see her too often.  She became a Vegan when she was only 15, so I try getting her some of her favorite items.  Argan happens to be one of her very favorites.....she truly loves it.  I may try a bottle of it in the near future to see how much I might like it, too.  I hope it&#x27;s ok that I gave it 5 stars in her place, because that&#x27;s what she would have done!!  Your products are quite impressive, even though my eating habits are much different from hers.  (Of course I&#x27;m referring to the food products purchased for her).&lt;br /&gt;Sincerely,&lt;br /&gt;Margie C.</li>
            <li> I shaved and bleached my hair a while back and this is like the only thing saving it right now!</li>
            <li> I love the fact that it does not have an oily sticky feeling. I have very dry skin and  I found that I had to use much more than the recommended few drops for it to be effective. I am also trying it on my hair, my thoughts are that its no more effective than other oil treatments I have tried.</li>
            <li> My hair was quite damaged when I had my dark hair colored a few shades lighter. Especially, the ends are very dry with a lot of split ends. I have applied the argan oil to the ends and it gave my hair instant shine. The texture did not look oily or sticky at all. It does not have any odor either. I plan to use this product to undo the damage in my hair, but the product can be used on the skin or nails per the instructions on the bottle. The company followed up with an email and provided instructions. Nowadays almost every hair product claims to include Argan oil but it is not known how much this amount is. This oil is a concentrated formula and natural. Also, when I read the ingredient list, I saw that there was no alcohol in it.  Note: The product is provided by the company for testing purposes.</li>
            <li> Works really well when mixed with Frankensense, Lavender and Peppermint  for stress and headaches.</li>
            <li> I am a big fan of argan oil. I use it on my hair and face daily. I have Caucasian, thin, wavy hair and this is the best heat protectant when I dry and curl/straighten it. It&#x27;s also great during winter in the Midwest for chapped skin. Foxbrim has great customer service. If you have any questions, they try to satisfy you very quickly.</li>
            <li> I have received this product completely free to try from Tomoson and opinions are 100 percent my own. I like how they have really nice quality oil for your hair (mostly). It just smells slightly weird, but i love it. It makes my hair shiny and keeps it like that.</li>
            <li> I bought the oil to use as a facial oil.  My mid-60&#x27;s skin really needed some pick-up.  I had blotches and puffiness, being very susceptible to the summer sun and heat.  In three weeks, this product, with a semi-healthy diet, has made a difference to me.  My skin is more even toned and the pores seem to be getting smaller.  Just a few drops is all I need and it absorbs very quickly.  I am very pleased with this product.</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing  for hair! I drop a few drops in my conditioner  and it makes a big difference.  I don&#x27;t apply it straight onto dry or damp hair because I&#x27;m afraid it might make it too heavy, but that being said, if you have time to spare you can probably  use this as a sort of mask.</li>
            <li> This is one of the best argan oil i have tried so far and moreover love the cheaper version in a big bottle! Love that it comes with a dropper which is easy to use and cute as well. As you an see it has no color on it, looks like pure argan oil! I love that it has no scent. Feels so light-weighted and very supple. It absorbed fast on the skin and not greasy at all. I use argan oil on my face during winter and for summer it&#x27;s best to apply on my dry cuticle and hair. I added this oil on my regular hair mask for extra shine and boost.&lt;br /&gt;No matter what your skin/hair type is- I highly recommend this argan oil.It&#x27;s affordable and do wonderful job for hair/skin/nails! ♥</li>
            <li> This product works great.  I was using Jose Maran Argan oil which is also cold pressed but very very expensive.  Foxbrim Aryan oil works better and the price is good for me.  I will continue buying Foxbrim as long as the prices stay the same.  This product goes a long way.  You only need a little bit.</li>
            <li> I have problems with fragrance and so far this has been great for me. Tames the frizz and doesn&#x27;t make me sick. Will buy again</li>
            <li> I love the product. It works very well on my skin and hair without a greasy residue. Try this product and you will love it too.</li>
            <li> Great product and follow up from seller is exceptional!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very impressed with the product. It is pretty much the only moisturizing product I use on my face now.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff! It makes my skin so soft!</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product. I actually brought this item for my hair and I already see amazing results. Lightweight, non-greasy and odor free.</li>
            <li> worked very well made my skin feel soft and helped my nails grow</li>
            <li> My wife loves this stuff!  She uses it on her dry skin to keep from scratching.  it keeps her legs smooth and happy.  She likes the fact that she can just put a few drops on her legs and it works for her whole leg, so the dropper is an awesome tool with this product.  Knowing how much it takes, this bottle will last for a long time!</li>
            <li> It did the job.  #freesample</li>
            <li> I have been using the Argan oil on my face for about a month now. It is an awesome moisturizing agent even if used in conjunction with other facial or body lotions</li>
            <li> I love this argan oil. I use it for so many things. Its amazing for hydrating your skin. It is great in your hair and for your skin. You can save a ton of money purchasing this because it replaces multiple products in your home saving you space time and money! I love how it makes my skin feel. It is also a great anti ageing serum! I would recommend this product to anyone! It shipped quick and is organic too~</li>
            <li> Pure formula and easy to use because of the dropper. I love it&#x27;s smoothing effect on my hair!</li>
            <li> i love how soft and healthy it leaves my hair. its awesome.</li>
            <li> This product is great but I would only recommend 1 drop instead of the 3. Otherwise your hair will be super greasy the next day.</li>
            <li> So excited to use this product!  I have already seen a difference in my skin. It is much softer.</li>
            <li> Argan Oil is a fantastic product when used for the right purpose. No miracles to expect, but to improve hair and skin. I&#x27;ve used it all my life and know that as a beauty product, a 100% pure oil, improves and maintains the beauty of skin and hair. I apply 3 drops to my short hair when still dump, I do not rub the scalp, just the hair to prevent the frizz. In summer my head sweats copiously and I look as if I&#x27;ve seen a bad vision, my hair jumps all directions and looks messy. While the oil penetrates the hair, I put four/five drops on the palm of my hand and slowly, with my other hand, massage my face and neck, when the oil has almost penetrating the skin, if I desire to apply make up, I do it. To finish, I blow dry my hair, if I choose to do so; the whole day, my hair and face look terrific; coworkers have noticed and complimented on my make up, but it is not the make up, but the way the make up shows over the face rubbed with Argan oil. At night time, after washing my face, I rub again, a couple of drops of oil so it penetrates the skin throughout the night. I&#x27;m preparing to buy another bottle, for it is more cost effective, both monetarily and healthy wise, to  use Argan oil instead of any other type of facial or hair care product.</li>
            <li> I use this product for my cuticles and to moisturize my face. I like the product and absolutely zero complaints about it.</li>
            <li> makes my hair so soft and frizz free and I only have to use 5 drops on my damp hair and that&#x27;s it I don&#x27;t even have to condition its amazing</li>
            <li> My skin looks better than it has in years! I love this stuff, it&#x27;s awesome!!!!!</li>
            <li> Excellent product. I love that this Argan Oil is unrefined, cold-pressed virgin oil. And it&#x27;s organic.</li>
            <li> Great for the hair, just a few drops is enough to make shine and smooth.It works great for my dry hair. Its pure organic.</li>
            <li> Wonderful Argan Oil in a beautiful bottle! I use this on my face and my hands - it absorbs well and my skin doesn&#x27;t feel greasy!</li>
            <li> Works wonders on my daughters dandruff, use once a week and her scalp is clear.  I rec this in exc for my own personal review</li>
            <li> Thank you. I have the disease of psoriasis. I buy argan oil because it was recommended. I have had no result. I wonder if they know of any product for that disease. Thanks again.</li>
            <li> I bought this product for my teenage daughter who has very thick and very long hair.  Her otherwise healthy hair has been damaged by the various bleaching and colors she has been experimenting with,  The ends of her hair were really looking terrible so we thought this might help.  Sure enough, it&#x27;s as if it brings dead looking hair back to life!  Thanks!</li>
            <li> I really like that this is cold pressed! That&#x27;s hard to find! It&#x27;s not greasy absorbs quickly.</li>
            <li> I use it on my straight hair for &amp;#34;flyways&amp;#34; and it works great to smooth it out. Also, I use it on mine and my child&#x27;s dry skin. It is non-irritating and works well. I will buy more when this bottle is gone. Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> THIS STUFF IS FANTASTIC!!  I PUT IT ON MY DRY FEET AND IT REALLY DOES THE TRICK.  I ALSO USE A LITTLE IN MY HAIR.  HIGHLY RECOMMEND.</li>
            <li> Foxbrim Argan Oil - I had heard a lot about argan oil and wanted to try it out - specifically for hair.  I have fine hair but do clor it so I need to use conditioners to keep it healthy as well as get a brush through it after shampooing.  I like that you can use this pre as well as post shampoo and it does not weigh the hair down or make it look oily. The scent is nice too I dont like oils that smell too earthy so this is a good oil for me.</li>
            <li> Very pleased with initial use of Argan products.  Noticeable improvements on condition of processed long hair, specifically regarding split ends.  Pleased with skin softness, jury is still out on skin improvements due to short time in use.</li>
            <li> use this every day for face and often on hair</li>
            <li> I used this product in my shampoo. I added about 3 to 5 drops in my hand and added my shampoo. I could tell a difference in my hair right away. After blow drying my hair I immediately noticed how soft and shiny my hair was. There was no oily residue. I will definitely continue to add a few drops every time I shampoo. Argan Oil is also great for your cuticles.</li>
            <li> I really like this argan oil and the best part is it&#x27;s 100% organic. It&#x27;s fragrance and preservative free as well and that is another great then about this product. The bottle is a good size product and will last me awhile. I have been using it for over a week now and have noticed it has made the skin on my arms softer and my hair so smooth. My hair really needed the extra boost and this product has helped it a lot. It doesn&#x27;t leave my hair oily or greasy looking after applying and when my hair has dried. I have thick hair and it tends to tangle a lot but, since using this oil it leaves a soft feeling and I can run my fingers through my hair easier. It has now become one of my weekly routines to add in with my shampoos. I also use it often on my skin for that smooth feeling! It&#x27;s a must try and see for yourself the smooth, soft feeling of this great oil.</li>
            <li> Best Argon Oil I&#x27;ve ever purchased.  The price was very good compared to the other sellers on amazon or in stores.  I use it everywhere on my skin, really helped my husband&#x27;s extra dry skin from diabetes.  If you have dry hair, a tiny bit of the oil helps it look moisture.  I will recommend it.</li>
            <li> I have never had anything make my hair feel so soft. The last time I had my hair colored my stylist put some in with the color. For the first time ever my hair was soft and not corse after coloring.</li>
            <li> Has a bit of unpleasant smell which goes away after putting on skin</li>
            <li> I bought this on sale, and for the price (under $15) it is an excellent buy.  I do not like it as well as the more expensive one that I bought before because it seems to make my hair more oily in appearance than the other brand (I&#x27;ve also left a review for that one if you want to know what brand it was) although this one smells exactly the same, and I am sure it is also 100% organic Argan oil just like the first one I purchased.  I am using this on my extremely dry skin on my legs and rough spots on my face.  It works very nicely for that purpose.  I will save the other brand for when I want to add a shine to my long hair when it is dry.  I think it would work very well as an additive to your hair color, developer, or bleaching product to prevent damage.  This product is definitely a quality product for any purpose other than if you want to use it on very fine hair when it is dry, not wet.  I recommend it, especially at this on sale price.  You just can&#x27;t go wrong here.</li>
            <li> I love this product! It only takes a couple of drops to smooth my hair! Not too heavy.  I&#x27;m transitioning to natural products. So, I was a little apprehensive about oil.  I have no regrets!</li>
            <li> So I heard a lot about Argan oil and thought lemme give it a try. I have a lot of acne scarring and thought it would take a miracle to lighten them...and believe me even if they got a bit lighter I would be happy. I started using this about a week ago and I wasn&#x27;t convinced cause for some reason I thought I was going to wake up with great skin...which I did but my scars were still there...after a week now my scars are really getting lighter...so what I&#x27;m trying to say is stay with it...it really works... Just have patience and use twice a day like it says. Great product!</li>
            <li> Great Argan oil.  Hollywood&#x27;s new  &amp;#34;must have&amp;#34; item.</li>
            <li> I discovered Argan Oil earlier this year and have been using it for a variety of purposes: moisturizing hands, moisturizing face, and as a hair treatment. My favorite was to use it is to moisturize my hands. The oil goes on light, absorbs quickly and moisturized for several hours. I wash dishes by hand several times a day and my skin is also very dry from the cold, dry winter air. This Argan Oil immediately moisturizes my hands. It is very important to me that my hand moisturizer absorb quickly. I don&#x27;t like it when I have to wait 15-20 minutes and cannot touch anything. This oil absorbs quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this organic Argan Oil and would purchase it myself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Disclosure: I received a complimentary product to facilitate my review. No other compensation was received. All opinions are honest and my own.</li>
            <li> Good product! I would recommend this to my friends. Thanks</li>
            <li> Good stuff!  Just as described</li>
            <li> Definitely makes hair softer.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t think anything could top Josie Maran&#x27;s argon oil but I think I like this one better.  Very good value!</li>
            <li> Wow, I have only tried a few oils before (jojoba and olive), but this one definitely beats all of them. This is the first argan oil I&#x27;ve tried and I have been using it in different ways. First, I tried applying a couple of drops directly to my face at night. It works well and when I wake up in the morning, my skin tone looks more even and my skin looks well moisturized and radiant. I tried mixing it with a bit of aloe vera gel which instantly creates a light weight moisturizer and I prefer that for the day time. I also have another oil-free facial moisturizer which had too many exfoliating ingredients in it (AHA + BHA etc) so I mix some argan oil into it and now I have a perfect night time cream to use. It is just great as it is or mixing it with other products to get the exact right amount of moisturization. I have combination skin, with occasional break outs and large pores. This oil has not aggravated my skin or block pores. In fact, it seems to loosen sebum over time so that they come out more easily with extraction.</li>
            <li> The product was smaller than expected. Does not meet expectations for use on hair</li>
            <li> Seriously I can not beleive I lived without this for so long.</li>
            <li> I use it everyday. I like it.</li>
            <li> The quality of this argan oil is great. I like that it is organic. I regularly use argan oil on my skin and I have noticed great difference in my skin texture .It  is pretty cold where i live and I was looking for something that would constantly moisturize and keep my skin that way for long without too much greasy feeling . I like that it is not super greasy or messy. this organic argan oil has made my skin so much better . I have used the oil in my body scrubs and have enjoyed the result to fullest.&lt;br /&gt;I am so happy that I got chance to try it for free . I am now a regular user of argan oil.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Josie Maran Argan oil but it is very pricey. This oil works great and offers similar results. There is a light earthy,sweet smell that dissipates quickly. Excellent value for the cost.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this argon oil on my face for about a week now and I&#x27;ve already noticed skin tone improvement and a softer texture. Great stuff</li>
            <li> This smells so foul. I even added several drops of lavender oil to try to mask the smell, didn&#x27;t work. Had to toss the bottle. Not sure if it had gone bad or if Argan oil just smells totally nasty. Never again.</li>
