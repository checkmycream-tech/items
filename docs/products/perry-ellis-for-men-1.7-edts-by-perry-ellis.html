            <li>I love the scent and am always asked what it is.</li>
            <li>so I guess its better than nothing....</li>
            <li>Perry Ellis and the original scent is AMAZING (as well as being a fabulous value!)</li>
            <li>More importantly, women find it rather appealing.</li>
            <li>This is not made by Parlux and smells nothing like the Perry Ellis original.</li>
            <li>At this price, it&#x27;s definitely worth it!</li>
            <li>Very masculine scent, kind of like Aramis or Boss.</li>

            <li>They all have that same distinct smell.</li>
            <li>New gimicky fragrances come and go, this one stands its ground.  </li>

            <li> Back in the 80&#x27;s this cologne had a distinctive scent that one would either love or hate.  </li>
            <li> IT IS 360 OR ANY OF THE OTHER SCENTS PERRY</li>
            <li> and I can firmly attest</li>

    <ol>
            <li> This smells nothing like the Perry Ellis I have worn for years that was made by Parlux. This is not made by Parlux and smells nothing like the Perry Ellis original. Furthermore Amazon will not accept returns for this item. So be prepared to be disappointed!</li>
            <li> I have been using this cologne since the mid 1980&#x27;s and I can firmly attest, it&#x27;s a classic! New gimicky fragrances come and go, this one stands its ground.  The scent is fresh, clean and lasting. More importantly, women find it rather appealing. I have been on the search for this cologne for years and finally I found it. At this price, it&#x27;s definitely worth it!</li>
            <li> I LOVE anything Perry Ellis and the original scent is AMAZING (as well as being a fabulous value!) If you like Perry Ellis, you&#x27;ll love this product.</li>
            <li> I use this cologne once in a while as an alternative to my America by Perry Ellis cologne.  It has a pleasant fragrance and is well worth the price.  I would purchase this again.</li>
            <li> Bottle came with bad pump or spray button. So fragrance will not come out...Great right? Wrong...&lt;br /&gt;Fragrance is off the market...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;and no returns  For safety reasons, items that are classified as hazardous materials or use flammable liquids or gases cannot be returned to Amazon.com.

            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product since 1975 I think. I wear it only for myself and I&#x27;ve always recieved compliments. Smooth, hidden, light sweet and dusky.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been wearing this cologne for many years now. I love the scent and am always asked what it is. The ladies seem to like it as well. Generous size for the price.</li>
            <li> My favorite of all time and a great price to boot.</li>
            <li> this stuff is getting too rare to find and more expensive.</li>
            <li> Back in the 80&#x27;s this cologne had a distinctive scent that one would either love or hate.  I was one of the ones who loved it..  Looking at this on amazon brought back feelings of nostalgia.  After ordering it, I was very disappointed that the packaging may be the same as the old one, but the scent is very different.  I gave it three stars cause my wife likes it so I guess its better than nothing....</li>
            <li> Somethings are so good they should never go away. This is one fragrance that should last 100 years.</li>
            <li> This was purchased as a Christmas gift for my father. He has been using this cologne for decades! This is always the right gift because it&#x27;s no longer in production and is becoming increasingly more difficult to obtain. His only comment is that he wishes there was a much larger volume available.</li>
            <li> I was very disappointed when the item arrived - the packaging was not sealed and the sprayer did not work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It was useless - threw it away!</li>
            <li> Been wearing Perry Ellis for years. Wife loves the smell. Great product.</li>
            <li> Been wearing it for years!</li>
            <li> Long lasting and strong.</li>
            <li> I have been using Perry Ellis original for a long, long time. I still get compliments when I enter a room. The price is good at times but you would think that it would be a bit cheaper since its been around for so long. Nevertheless, I&#x27;ll keep buying it.</li>
            <li> Very masculine scent, kind of like Aramis or Boss. I&#x27;m told it&#x27;s being discontinued. I hope Perry Ellis will reconsider.</li>
            <li> PERRY ELLIS &#x3D; QUALITY-WEATHER IT IS 360 OR ANY OF THE OTHER SCENTS PERRY IS KNOWN 4 ITS ALL GOOD AND AGAIN @ A VERY GOOD PRICE-AND AGAIN FREE SHIPPING WITH PRIME MEMBERSHIP</li>
