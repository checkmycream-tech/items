            <li> Don&#x27;t expect a wig that&#x27;s going to last you a long time if you&#x27;re using it for every day</li>
            <li> This wig is about what I expected for such an inexpensive piece.</li>
            <li> construction of this wig is not a wefted type, but a netting type (black synthetic net).</li>
            <li> love this seller but this wig was horrible looked like a bowl cut with straight across bangs</li>
            <li> colour is as pictured, a dark auburn red/brown.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> so I just passed it on to my little cousins to play in</li>
            <li> ,it&#x27;s just not worth anything under 2 bucks!</li>
            <li> The cap is a little on the small side.</li>
            <li> Ugly, poorly made by children, uneven, thin on left side, thick with odd bulgy bump on the right side.</li>
            <li> I would not compare it in quality to a more expensive wig, but it&#x27;s not a cheap and nasty costume wig either.</li>
            <li> And it&#x27;s ridiculously shiny.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t cover the back of my head and was very thin unfortunately.</li>
            <li> Yes I am wearing it everyday and nobody recognized it as fake hair</li>
            <li> I was disappointed that it not as long as pictured.  </li>
            <li> Do not wast your time with this chappy ugly wig.</li>

            <li> I was expecting the color &amp;#34;Wine Red&amp;#34;. However I received a brown wig. In bright day light you can see the reddish under tones.  The wig is much shorter than it looks and the curl is much tighter. The cap is a little on the small side. It doesn&#x27;t have combs to hold it in place. The hair fiber was a little better than expected. It&#x27; not shiny or super straight. It&#x27;s definitely costume quality hair. It&#x27;s a bit wiggy at top. I was disappointed that it not as long as pictured.  If your okay with a very short bob wig with a slight &amp;#34;yaki&amp;#34; texture this is the perfect wig for you. It was a waist for me</li>
            <li> Perfect for cosplay, very sturdy</li>
            <li> Ugly, poorly made by children, uneven, thin on left side, thick with odd bulgy bump on the right side. Do not wast your time with this chappy ugly wig.</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t had a wig in decades. I bought this just incase I needed to go somewhere in an emergency but I would imagine you could use this daily. My wig was the color &amp; style that was advertised.</li>
            <li> Loved it! Looked so real. The color was very bright but fit well and the hair was smooth and felt very real.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t cover the back of my head and was very thin unfortunately. Just didn&#x27;t fit my face structure so I just passed it on to my little cousins to play in</li>
            <li> Great wig, very versatile, perfect for cosplay. I used it for April O&#x27;Neil cosplay (Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles) and it was perfect. Love it!</li>
            <li> love this seller but this wig was horrible looked like a bowl cut with straight across bangs and it was far from wine colored</li>
            <li> I am pleased about the color of the wigs that i received today. i will reorder the same color again because it is very beautiful and the length is just perfect for me. I will happy with my order. The price is good, shipment took alittle long however, it can from China directly. I am sold!</li>
            <li> Yes I am wearing it everyday and nobody recognized it as fake hair&lt;br /&gt;I bought other 3 wigs, and this one is easy to put on. Everybody says the Bob style suits me well and the color is so cool</li>
            <li> Just received it today. Never thought it would come this fast. I look amazing!</li>
            <li> when i ordered this wig i was at scared!!i was thinking it would be super fake.an wow,its such a great buy!!!I love it,and im ordering an extra one just in case ;)Love it!!</li>
            <li> Well, it doesn&#x27;t look like the photos. And it&#x27;s ridiculously shiny. Aaaaaand the bangs are really thick, so I had to thin them, but it took so much thinning that it ended up looking goofy. I dunno.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In general, this wig sucked, but it was cheap, so I kept it to play with. Don&#x27;t buy it if you&#x27;re looking to actually have something to wear day to day.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t want to give this wig any stars but it didn&#x27;t allow me to do so ,it looks nothing like the photo shown u get what u paid for ,it&#x27;s just not worth anything under 2 bucks!</li>
            <li> I am a blonde with short hair, and always liked the idea of being a redhead, but don&#x27;t care for dyeing the ratty hair I have, and this darling hairpiece was perfect for me!  I was surprised at solid strength of the wig cap and how well it fits the scalp.  The hair itself has an amazingly soft texture.  I recommend this for anyone who would like to have beautiful dark red hair.  The customer service people at Cool2day are really sweet as well, and they follow up quickly on your order just to make certain you are happy.  Don&#x27;t let me forget to mention the outstanding price!  I plan to purchase again another style wig from them soon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My best,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sharon</li>
            <li> This wig is about what I expected for such an inexpensive piece. The synthetic hair quality was above expectations, though this wig does shed. A lot. All wigs shed, of course, but this one comes out in locks, a lot more than a more expensive wig would. Don&#x27;t expect a wig that&#x27;s going to last you a long time if you&#x27;re using it for every day wear.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The construction of this wig is not a wefted type, but a netting type (black synthetic net). It has adjustable straps at the nape, and fits quite well. It&#x27;s also comfortable. It has a small patch of skin top at the centre part. When you buy a wig with bangs you should expect to have to cut the bangs yourself, or get a stylist to do it for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The colour is as pictured, a dark auburn red/brown.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, I&#x27;m pretty pleased with it for the price. I would not compare it in quality to a more expensive wig, but it&#x27;s not a cheap and nasty costume wig either.</li>
            <li> I had to trim the bangs to fit my head, but other than that, it did what it said it would do and I looked cute too.</li>
