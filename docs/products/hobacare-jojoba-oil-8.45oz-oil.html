            <li>It has a nice smell too.</li>
            <li>I really liked the jojoba oil, I use it on my face, body and hair.</li>
            <li>3 or 4 drops with a bit of water and it spreads a nice film over the shave area that I then apply soap or shave cream to</li>
            <li>Great for waxed wood floors - shines them right up!</li>

            <li>Nice under oil with a cream on top does wonders.</li>

            <li>I have no problem paying more for a quality product and this fits the bill.</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>Buy it and enjoy!</li>
            <li>but I am glad I bought it.</li>
            <li>I love the packaging too.</li>
            <li>, Also, I love that I don&#x27;t have to buy two or three separate products for their hair and skin.</li>
            <li>As for me and my &amp;#34;youngins&amp;#34;, we think it&#x27;s a fabulous multi-purpose product!</li>
            <li>Smooth glide!</li>
            <li>Yesterday, I went to the dermatologist, and he even said that my scalp looks soooooooooooooo much better.  </li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s pesticide free!</li>
            <li>I use this only on my face  and people tell me I have the most beautiful skin - no foundation required!</li>
            <li>I DOES sink in better.  </li>
            <li>It is my favorite oil.</li>
            <li>and I love it.</li>
            <li>Could have been packaged better, either a seal on the opening of the bottle or a seal on the bottle cover as about 1 tsp of oil spilled out.</li>
            <li>Love this stuff.  </li>
            <li>When my scalp is injured or itchy I rub some into the scalp and let it do its magic overnight.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve thouroughly enjoyed using this oil, for both self-care and clients.</li>
            <li>Love this oil.  </li>
            <li>I love Jojoba Care Jojoba Oil.</li>
            <li>I LOVE this</li>
            <li>This is my favorite product to use on my skin after I shower.</li>
            <li>Plus it&#x27;s safe to use on my acne prone face which is always a plus.</li>
            <li>Love it</li>
            <li>Pretty good.  </li>
            <li>At first I thought it was good</li>
            <li>There are a lot of jojoba oils out there that are prohibitively expensive, but this one is an excellent quality jojoba oil at a very good price.  </li>
            <li>It also works wonderfully as an after bath body oil and to condition dry, cracked heels.  </li>
            <li>It may look or feel rich but rinses away smoothly with warm water.</li>
            <li>Had I tried the Now Foods diluted brand first, I would have thought that&#x27;s how jojoba oil is supposed to be and would have turned away from the most amazing oil ever.</li>
            <li>Good, order came fast.</li>
            <li>I am a strong believer in the benefits of jojoba oil for skin and hair.  </li>
            <li>If your looking this oil up for hair purposes, I strongly suggest you go ahead and buy it.</li>
            <li>to my surprise when i opened this one it smelt strong and like barbecue sauce again.</li>
            <li>Great stuff, I can&#x27;t recommend it highly enough!  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s really nice, really gentle and does the job.</li>
            <li>Great facially, legs, hands.  </li>
            <li>Just as described Jojoba oil is fantastic.  </li>
            <li>I use mine in lotion bars, &amp; it&#x27;s fabulous.</li>
            <li>smooth as silk skin with this</li>
            <li>Effective, versatile, gentle.</li>
            <li>this oil is so smooth.</li>
            <li>I would Recommend this product to anyone looking for a good option for natural jojoba oil.</li>
            <li>The size was very economical for the price</li>
            <li>It works great for the dry skin patches from the winter winds.  </li>
            <li>This is great stuff for taking off makeup and applying to dry patches on face.</li>
            <li>It is a very light weight oil that mimics the skins very closely.</li>
            <li>but you know what they say about buying cheap, right?</li>
            <li>I like the way Hobacare absorbs into my skin quickly (as opposed to shea butter).</li>
            <li>It came quickly after ordering.</li>
            <li>so I can dress quickly.</li>
            <li>The scent of this oil is very light and slightly nutty, so you could easily add your favorite scented oils to make it smell</li>
            <li>Good product for dry skin, after your shower.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a waxy oil which is absorbed into your skin quickly, leaving a waxy moisturized feel to your skin.  </li>
            <li>I use it in my hair everyday and my hair looks and feels great now.</li>
            <li>It makes my skin feel amazing, and even though its oil, it doesn&#x27;t leave your skin feeling gross.</li>
            <li>Not only is it great for an all natural body and face moisturizer, we&#x27;ve used it for a shaving oil, diaper rash remedy and prevention, lip balm...</li>
            <li>Love that it is organic and natural.</li>
            <li>Quickly absorbed.</li>
            <li>And it works so it&#x27;s worth every penny.</li>
            <li>Works well, although it is an oil, it is readily absorbed in to the skin</li>
            <li>I think it was a good price compared to the size of the product as well as compared to other vendors.</li>
            <li>but this bottle was going to be traveling with us right away.</li>
            <li>100% jojoba oil, priced right.</li>
            <li>The oil doesn&#x27;t have much of a scent to it and it carries the essential oil scents nicely.  </li>
            <li>oil is great, but I&#x27;ve used several different brands of Jojoba oil and they are all comparable.</li>
            <li>No real smell of its own.</li>
            <li>Really works for softening your feet too!</li>
            <li>But mostly for my facial oil cleansing</li>
            <li>I use jojoba oil on my face and scalp/hair and it&#x27;s awesome but expensive.</li>
            <li>Well I received it and it&#x27;s a darker yellow and more oily</li>
            <li>My product arrived exactly as described.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended as a nice, natural, chemical free, way to enhance other lotions and sundry items.</li>
            <li>I originally bought this non-organic version from amazon, then noticed the seller sold the organic version on their site which is just a few dollars more.</li>
            <li>It also has pretty much replaced all hair products, eliminating chemicals.  </li>
            <li>Good massage oil, it warms easily, it is a bonus a little goes a long way.  </li>
            <li>I personally love several drops of lavender essential oil with just a drop or two of patchouli to give it a touch of mystery, or tea trea oil with just a drop or two of lavender for a very fresh, outdoorsy scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This is very high quality jojoba oil.</li>
            <li>I paid for a full new product, but, received a used less than 20% in the bottle of liquid content that i am not even sure</li>
            <li>This is a quality product, and is advertised for a reasonable price.</li>
            <li>It does very well on my face, keeps my skin balanced and not oily looking.</li>
            <li>No worries about harmful chemicals absorbing into my children&#x27;s skin.</li>
            <li>For sealing, it comes across like a much richer oil, but without all the stickiness of castor or the heaviness of shea.</li>
            <li>It also makes me wonder if the went to a thinner bottle how much plastic it could save.</li>
            <li>I have to imagine this bottle can&#x27;t be much lighter than glass.&lt;br</li>
            <li>which really concerned me.</li>
            <li>I really didn&#x27;t feel like the hassle of returning it, but I will not use this on my face.</li>
            <li>but I found out it is much cheaper here on Amazon</li>
            <li>It is very moisturizing.</li>
            <li>I have used other jojoba oils that are better quality.</li>
            <li>I blend it with other oils to use from the top of my head to the soles of my feet</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very light and seems to absorb into the skin without the typical oily film.  </li>
            <li>My husband uses it and thinks it&#x27;s ok, but prefers a more thick butter such as shea butter.</li>
            <li>I use it on my scalp and it helps me maintain healthy hair without weighing my hair down.</li>
            <li>It is a large enough bottle that I won&#x27;t use up right away.  </li>
            <li>It keeps my skin highly moisturized without being greasy.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this jojoba oil for scalp, moisturizing hair, and taming frizz.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>This oil absorbs completely into the nail and cuticles, hydrating both and leaving my cuticles soft, well conditioned and easy to push back.  </li>
            <li>I have dry skin (no eczema, just on the dry side) and this keeps my face nice and moisturizer.</li>
            <li>This product absorbs well, and leaves my skin looking and feeling very soft.</li>
            <li>It keeps my feet and heels looking and feeling very soft.</li>
            <li>OMG, my skin feels alive again!</li>
            <li>when i received this one after a few weeks it smelt really strong like barbecue sauce.</li>
            <li>So far it has been the best one I&#x27;ve used in my aromatherapy ceramic oil warmer; often the oils will heat up so much that an unpleasant burning smell will arise and this oil so far has prevented that when mixed with the essential</li>
            <li>May be a little too heavy for younger women, but coconut oil works great for my 32-yr-old daughter.</li>
            <li>Help clear blackheads and won&#x27;t clog pores.  </li>
            <li>So far only used straight on skin but plans are for use in creams and lotions and perhaps making CP soap.</li>
            <li>I use this Hobacare Jojoba Oil on my six year old daughter and three year old son&#x27;s hair, scalp, and body.</li>
            <li>Some oils cannot be placed directly onto your skin without irritation.  </li>
            <li>Leaves my hands and feet so soft.</li>
            <li>Really works for restoring damaged hair, especially coarse or African-American hair.</li>
            <li>It is lightweight, nearly odorless and it leaves hair truly moisturize.</li>
            <li>I love Jojoba oil and use it on my face at least twice a day.</li>
            <li>It is a big bottle and very well priced.</li>
            <li>I have also used it on my hair to tame the static and my hair has been silky and soft without being extra oily.  </li>
            <li>Either way, organic or non-organic, you can&#x27;t go wrong with the jojoba oil from this seller because it is hands down the best oil and the only oil I will use on me and my toddler head to toe.</li>
            <li>I use this to take off heavy eye makeup and lip makeup, and to clean cream/gel makeup off my brushes.</li>
            <li>Love that it&#x27;s not sticky and a little goes a long way!</li>
            <li>So just be advised this is more golden in color and a little thick.</li>
            <li>The top is not good.</li>
            <li>In the morning the scalp is back to normal.  </li>
            <li>Jojoba oil is the base of many traditional hair, scalp and face formulas because it closely resembles the body&#x27;s own oils.</li>
            <li>sinks in quickly, does not clog pores, hardly any scent, and very gentle.</li>
            <li>It is a very rigid plastic and not very squeeezable.</li>

            <li> I really liked the jojoba oil, I use it on my face, body and hair.</li>
            <li> 3 or 4 drops with a bit of water and it spreads a nice film over the shave area that I then apply soap or shave cream to</li>
            <li> Great for waxed wood floors - shines them right up!</li>
            <li> Jojoba oil is THE BEST I have found so far.  </li>
            <li> Nice under oil with a cream on top does wonders.</li>
            <li> Great quality product as shipped FAST!  </li>
            <li> I have no problem paying more for a quality product and this fits the bill.</li>
            <li> I love this product.</li>
            <li> Buy it and enjoy!</li>
            <li> but I am glad I bought it.</li>
            <li> I love the packaging too.</li>
            <li> , Also, I love that I don&#x27;t have to buy two or three separate products for their hair and skin.</li>
            <li> As for me and my &amp;#34;youngins&amp;#34;, we think it&#x27;s a fabulous multi-purpose product!</li>
            <li> Smooth glide!</li>
            <li> Yesterday, I went to the dermatologist, and he even said that my scalp looks soooooooooooooo much better.  </li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s pesticide free!</li>
            <li> I use this only on my face  and people tell me I have the most beautiful skin - no foundation required!</li>
            <li> I DOES sink in better.  </li>
            <li> It is my favorite oil.</li>
            <li> and I love it.</li>
            <li> Could have been packaged better, either a seal on the opening of the bottle or a seal on the bottle cover as about 1 tsp of oil spilled out.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff.  </li>
            <li> When my scalp is injured or itchy I rub some into the scalp and let it do its magic overnight.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve thouroughly enjoyed using this oil, for both self-care and clients.</li>
            <li> Love this oil.  </li>
            <li> I love Jojoba Care Jojoba Oil.</li>
            <li> I LOVE this</li>
            <li> This is my favorite product to use on my skin after I shower.</li>
            <li> Plus it&#x27;s safe to use on my acne prone face which is always a plus.</li>
            <li> Love it</li>
            <li> Pretty good.  </li>
            <li> At first I thought it was good</li>
            <li> There are a lot of jojoba oils out there that are prohibitively expensive, but this one is an excellent quality jojoba oil at a very good price.  </li>
            <li> It also works wonderfully as an after bath body oil and to condition dry, cracked heels.  </li>
            <li> It may look or feel rich but rinses away smoothly with warm water.</li>
            <li> Had I tried the Now Foods diluted brand first, I would have thought that&#x27;s how jojoba oil is supposed to be and would have turned away from the most amazing oil ever.</li>
            <li> Good, order came fast.</li>
            <li> I am a strong believer in the benefits of jojoba oil for skin and hair.  </li>
            <li> If your looking this oil up for hair purposes, I strongly suggest you go ahead and buy it.</li>
            <li> to my surprise when i opened this one it smelt strong and like barbecue sauce again.</li>
            <li> Great stuff, I can&#x27;t recommend it highly enough!  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really nice, really gentle and does the job.</li>
            <li> Great facially, legs, hands.  </li>
            <li> Just as described Jojoba oil is fantastic.  </li>
            <li> I use mine in lotion bars, &amp; it&#x27;s fabulous.</li>
            <li> smooth as silk skin with this</li>
            <li> Effective, versatile, gentle.</li>
            <li> this oil is so smooth.</li>
            <li> I would Recommend this product to anyone looking for a good option for natural jojoba oil.</li>
            <li> The size was very economical for the price</li>
            <li> It works great for the dry skin patches from the winter winds.  </li>
            <li> This is great stuff for taking off makeup and applying to dry patches on face.</li>
            <li> It is a very light weight oil that mimics the skins very closely.</li>
            <li> but you know what they say about buying cheap, right?</li>
            <li> I like the way Hobacare absorbs into my skin quickly (as opposed to shea butter).</li>
            <li> It came quickly after ordering.</li>
            <li> so I can dress quickly.</li>
            <li> The scent of this oil is very light and slightly nutty, so you could easily add your favorite scented oils to make it smell</li>
            <li> Good product for dry skin, after your shower.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a waxy oil which is absorbed into your skin quickly, leaving a waxy moisturized feel to your skin.  </li>
            <li> I use it in my hair everyday and my hair looks and feels great now.</li>
            <li> It makes my skin feel amazing, and even though its oil, it doesn&#x27;t leave your skin feeling gross.</li>
            <li> Not only is it great for an all natural body and face moisturizer, we&#x27;ve used it for a shaving oil, diaper rash remedy and prevention, lip balm...</li>
            <li> Love that it is organic and natural.</li>
            <li> Quickly absorbed.</li>
            <li> And it works so it&#x27;s worth every penny.</li>
            <li> Works well, although it is an oil, it is readily absorbed in to the skin</li>
            <li> I think it was a good price compared to the size of the product as well as compared to other vendors.</li>
            <li> but this bottle was going to be traveling with us right away.</li>
            <li> 100% jojoba oil, priced right.</li>
            <li> The oil doesn&#x27;t have much of a scent to it and it carries the essential oil scents nicely.  </li>
            <li> oil is great, but I&#x27;ve used several different brands of Jojoba oil and they are all comparable.</li>
            <li> No real smell of its own.</li>
            <li> Really works for softening your feet too!</li>
            <li> But mostly for my facial oil cleansing</li>
            <li> I use jojoba oil on my face and scalp/hair and it&#x27;s awesome but expensive.</li>
            <li> Well I received it and it&#x27;s a darker yellow and more oily</li>
            <li> My product arrived exactly as described.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended as a nice, natural, chemical free, way to enhance other lotions and sundry items.</li>
            <li> I originally bought this non-organic version from amazon, then noticed the seller sold the organic version on their site which is just a few dollars more.</li>
            <li> It also has pretty much replaced all hair products, eliminating chemicals.  </li>
            <li> Good massage oil, it warms easily, it is a bonus a little goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> I personally love several drops of lavender essential oil with just a drop or two of patchouli to give it a touch of mystery, or tea trea oil with just a drop or two of lavender for a very fresh, outdoorsy scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This is very high quality jojoba oil.</li>
            <li> I paid for a full new product, but, received a used less than 20% in the bottle of liquid content that i am not even sure</li>
            <li> This is a quality product, and is advertised for a reasonable price.</li>
            <li> It does very well on my face, keeps my skin balanced and not oily looking.</li>
            <li> No worries about harmful chemicals absorbing into my children&#x27;s skin.</li>
            <li> For sealing, it comes across like a much richer oil, but without all the stickiness of castor or the heaviness of shea.</li>
            <li> It also makes me wonder if the went to a thinner bottle how much plastic it could save.</li>
            <li> I have to imagine this bottle can&#x27;t be much lighter than glass.&lt;br</li>
            <li> which really concerned me.</li>
            <li> I really didn&#x27;t feel like the hassle of returning it, but I will not use this on my face.</li>
            <li> but I found out it is much cheaper here on Amazon</li>
            <li> It is very moisturizing.</li>
            <li> I have used other jojoba oils that are better quality.</li>
            <li> I blend it with other oils to use from the top of my head to the soles of my feet</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very light and seems to absorb into the skin without the typical oily film.  </li>
            <li> My husband uses it and thinks it&#x27;s ok, but prefers a more thick butter such as shea butter.</li>
            <li> I use it on my scalp and it helps me maintain healthy hair without weighing my hair down.</li>
            <li> It is a large enough bottle that I won&#x27;t use up right away.  </li>
            <li> It keeps my skin highly moisturized without being greasy.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this jojoba oil for scalp, moisturizing hair, and taming frizz.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> This oil absorbs completely into the nail and cuticles, hydrating both and leaving my cuticles soft, well conditioned and easy to push back.  </li>
            <li> I have dry skin (no eczema, just on the dry side) and this keeps my face nice and moisturizer.</li>
            <li> This product absorbs well, and leaves my skin looking and feeling very soft.</li>
            <li> It keeps my feet and heels looking and feeling very soft.</li>
            <li> OMG, my skin feels alive again!</li>
            <li> when i received this one after a few weeks it smelt really strong like barbecue sauce.</li>
            <li> So far it has been the best one I&#x27;ve used in my aromatherapy ceramic oil warmer; often the oils will heat up so much that an unpleasant burning smell will arise and this oil so far has prevented that when mixed with the essential</li>
            <li> May be a little too heavy for younger women, but coconut oil works great for my 32-yr-old daughter.</li>
            <li> Help clear blackheads and won&#x27;t clog pores.  </li>
            <li> So far only used straight on skin but plans are for use in creams and lotions and perhaps making CP soap.</li>
            <li> I use this Hobacare Jojoba Oil on my six year old daughter and three year old son&#x27;s hair, scalp, and body.</li>
            <li> Some oils cannot be placed directly onto your skin without irritation.  </li>
            <li> Leaves my hands and feet so soft.</li>
            <li> Really works for restoring damaged hair, especially coarse or African-American hair.</li>
            <li> It is lightweight, nearly odorless and it leaves hair truly moisturize.</li>
            <li> I love Jojoba oil and use it on my face at least twice a day.</li>
            <li> It is a big bottle and very well priced.</li>
            <li> I have also used it on my hair to tame the static and my hair has been silky and soft without being extra oily.  </li>
            <li> Either way, organic or non-organic, you can&#x27;t go wrong with the jojoba oil from this seller because it is hands down the best oil and the only oil I will use on me and my toddler head to toe.</li>
            <li> I use this to take off heavy eye makeup and lip makeup, and to clean cream/gel makeup off my brushes.</li>
            <li> Love that it&#x27;s not sticky and a little goes a long way!</li>
            <li> So just be advised this is more golden in color and a little thick.</li>
            <li> The top is not good.</li>
            <li> In the morning the scalp is back to normal.  </li>
            <li> Jojoba oil is the base of many traditional hair, scalp and face formulas because it closely resembles the body&#x27;s own oils.</li>
            <li> sinks in quickly, does not clog pores, hardly any scent, and very gentle.</li>
            <li> It is a very rigid plastic and not very squeeezable.</li>
            <li> , it mixes well with other massage oils or can be used directly on the face without breaking out the skin.</li>
            <li> I live in NV, and because our climate is so dry, I use a very small amount of this 100%  jojoba oil on my dry skin (legs and arms) and it works very well.</li>
            <li> I use it on my face, hands, nails, feet, body, and recently on my hair (curly dry hair).</li>
            <li> This is a thicker carrier oil That I use for massage, dry skin, and I do mix in essential oils.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s still jojoba oil, so if you use too much, it will feel greasy like every other oil does when too heavily applied.  </li>
            <li> The cover was taped locally, the bottle was almost empty.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve found  in a long time</li>
            <li> I use it for my stretched ears and it works wonders.</li>
            <li> I agree with the comment about the strange smell of this product.</li>
            <li> A couple drops goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin that is dry but tends to get excessively oily with moisturizers.</li>
            <li> I got this to add drops to my son&#x27;s bath water because his skin was always so dry and scaly.</li>
            <li> I Use it on my son&#x27;s eczema and my extremely dry skin.</li>
            <li> I use it for dry skin and aromatherapy oils....</li>
            <li> My hair is shinier, healthier, and I hardly loose any hair compared to before.  </li>
            <li> Jojoba oil was suggested to me by my doctor as a help for me very dry and itchy skin.</li>
            <li> Rather expensive and I am not sure how much better it is than Lubiderm or any other cream for dry skin.</li>
            <li> I would have thought they only sold that little,</li>
            <li> Also works to relieve dry or itchy skin and also helps with acne and other epidermal afflictions</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve still got well over half of this 8.45oz bottle of jojoba oil left to use for other purposes and to refill our bottles of &#x27;nail oil&#x27;.</li>
            <li> I really do not like plastic and would have purchased glass</li>
            <li> Also a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> Not a blend of other, cheaper ingredients.</li>
            <li> I mix it with other oils - olive, grapeseed and coconut oil.</li>
            <li> I add this oil to a group of other oils I use for scalp and body moisturizing.</li>
            <li> I bought this oil to use as a nail conditioner and also wound up using it as a hair tonic as well (only one small drop needed to rub between my hands and run through my hair after rinsing).  </li>
            <li> And I wouldn&#x27;t trust any other company than Hobacare.</li>
            <li> I was disappointed with the packaging as it had plastic wrap around the top of it</li>
            <li> Love it especially during these brutal winter months.  </li>
            <li> Even used it on chapped lips the other day.  </li>
            <li> Here&#x27;s their link for other uses;</li>
            <li> the way, I bought this oil, six 1oz glass bottles with screw on dropper tops, 3 small metal funnels and a 0.5oz bottle of essential tea tree oil for less than the price of one 4oz bottle of Bliss Kiss&#x27; &amp;#34;Pure Nail Oil&amp;#34; (on their site, since Amazon doesn&#x27;t carry the 4 oz bottle).  </li>
            <li> It might seem a little pricey but a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> but I think it&#x27;s is too expensive and did not show much effect on my skin.</li>
            <li> My only complaint with this product is the bottle.  </li>
            <li> I have much less dandruff.  </li>
            <li> Only a small amount of oil comes out of the bottle at a time, so you don&#x27;t waste any by accident!</li>
            <li> Hate is a very strong language which I rarely use, but, HATE, is what this product is to me.</li>
            <li> If i were you, RUN AND DONT WASTE YOU MONEY FROM THIS HOBACARE MESS.</li>
            <li> Also mix it with a little bit of lavender oil to use as a pre-shave treatment;  </li>
            <li> But I can tell that if you use it a few drops at a time, I&#x27;m talking 1-3, you can get away with using this on your face without looking like a greased baking pan.&lt;br</li>
            <li> so it gets messy at the cap.</li>
            <li> I like that it has a little spout so that you can get out just a small amount without it pouring everywhere.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve put together three of the small glass bottles of jojoba and tea tree oil for my Mom, my daughter and me</li>
            <li> After blowing out my hair, I use a very small amount as a leave-in oil (use very few drops because that&#x27;s all you will need), it makes my shiny, antifreeze, and manageable.</li>
            <li> Use a pointed-tip dye bottle to use Over time it help break up sebum plugs that can negatively impact hair</li>
            <li> FYI, I gave it 4 stars and not five, because I wish it were less expensive.</li>
            <li> HobaCare&#x27;s seems to be the highest quality and least expensive organic jojoba we&#x27;ve found.</li>
            <li> I use this for an all-over moisturizer and also as a base oil for other skin care products that I make.</li>
            <li> just wish it was not so expensive...</li>
            <li> Replaces some expensive products for me.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not as bad of a change as occurred with the now brand one (which really became awful smelling), but it is annoying and unnerving.</li>
            <li> i thought it had gone bad</li>
            <li> and it does not smell bad at all !</li>
            <li> I was really fearful when it came to this product because of the price</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Good product for dry skin, after your shower.</li>
            <li> I use this as an eye makeup remover, skin moisturizer and occasional shave lotion. This is a quality product, and is advertised for a reasonable price.</li>
            <li> Hate is a very strong language which I rarely use, but, HATE, is what this product is to me. I paid for a full new product, but, received a used less than 20% in the bottle of liquid content that i am not even sure is jojoba oil anymore. The cover was taped locally, the bottle was almost empty. I would have thought they only sold that little, if not that i noticed the box was soaked with the oil. I wont be buying this EVER again. If i were you, RUN AND DONT WASTE YOU MONEY FROM THIS HOBACARE MESS.</li>
            <li> This was just as they advertised! Not a blend of other, cheaper ingredients. I have no problem paying more for a quality product and this fits the bill. It applies smoothly and penetrates the skin wonderfully!</li>
            <li> Excellent product! I use it for my entire body and my hair! I also this product in my bath</li>
            <li> Have been buying from this company for almost 20 years.  Best jojoba I have found.</li>
            <li> I use unscented massage oils for a variety of purposes at home: facial massage, body massage, aromatherapy diffusers, etc. This is very high quality jojoba oil. So far it has been the best one I&#x27;ve used in my aromatherapy ceramic oil warmer; often the oils will heat up so much that an unpleasant burning smell will arise and this oil so far has prevented that when mixed with the essential oils.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In addition, it mixes well with other massage oils or can be used directly on the face without breaking out the skin. Jojoba oil is the base of many traditional hair, scalp and face formulas because it closely resembles the body&#x27;s own oils. It may look or feel rich but rinses away smoothly with warm water.</li>
            <li> Larger bottle than I&#x27;d realized - yay! Great product.</li>
            <li> I originally bought this non-organic version from amazon, then noticed the seller sold the organic version on their site which is just a few dollars more. Either way, organic or non-organic, you can&#x27;t go wrong with the jojoba oil from this seller because it is hands down the best oil and the only oil I will use on me and my toddler head to toe. I tried the Now Foods brand and it felt diluted, greasy, and didn&#x27;t provide any of the benefits that jojoba oil is supposed to. Fortunately I tried the best before the rest so was able to compare. Had I tried the Now Foods diluted brand first, I would have thought that&#x27;s how jojoba oil is supposed to be and would have turned away from the most amazing oil ever. I just wish amazon would sell the organic version of this oil.</li>
            <li> Great size bottle and an easy to use nozzle. I trust this brand of jojoba oil over others. I use it all over my body and my mom does now too.</li>
            <li> I love this product by this company! I have tried another brand, but it felt oily. HobaCare Jojoba oil feels like silk on my skin. I use it on my body instead of lotion and in my hair as a moisturizer.</li>
            <li> I love this product. I have very sensitive skin that is dry but tends to get excessively oily with moisturizers. This product absorbs well, and leaves my skin looking and feeling very soft. I use it every morning after I shower, all over. It does very well on my face, keeps my skin balanced and not oily looking. It keeps my feet and heels looking and feeling very soft. I also use it at night to remove my make-up and as a conditioner for my hair and scalp. Very good stuff.</li>
            <li> Great quality product as shipped FAST!  Ordered Monday morning and came tuesdy morning.  Great service!  Good for hair, skin and body.  Help clear blackheads and won&#x27;t clog pores.  I will buy again, but I will not have to for a while because it will last a while.</li>
            <li> Our family has been using HobaCare&#x27;s jojoba oil for years now. Not only is it great for an all natural body and face moisturizer, we&#x27;ve used it for a shaving oil, diaper rash remedy and prevention, lip balm... HobaCare&#x27;s seems to be the highest quality and least expensive organic jojoba we&#x27;ve found. Here are some additional uses you may not have though of [...] Buy it and enjoy!</li>
            <li> I was really fearful when it came to this product because of the price but I am glad I bought it. I mix it with other oils - olive, grapeseed and coconut oil. I love the packaging too. You can see that proper care was put into it to avoid spilling. Nice product. I will definitely buy this again.</li>
            <li> I use this Hobacare Jojoba Oil on my six year old daughter and three year old son&#x27;s hair, scalp, and body. Love that it is organic and natural. No worries about harmful chemicals absorbing into my children&#x27;s skin. My daughter says it feels warm when I massage it onto her skin after her bath, Also, I love that I don&#x27;t have to buy two or three separate products for their hair and skin. My husband uses it and thinks it&#x27;s ok, but prefers a more thick butter such as shea butter. I like the way Hobacare absorbs into my skin quickly (as opposed to shea butter). As for me and my &amp;#34;youngins&amp;#34;, we think it&#x27;s a fabulous multi-purpose product! FYI, I gave it 4 stars and not five, because I wish it were less expensive.</li>
            <li> Great product.  I purchase over and over again.  I use on my body and face.</li>
            <li> For people getting into essential oil use you need a carrier oil to help spread the essential oil.  Some oils cannot be placed directly onto your skin without irritation.  Jojobo oil is closer to the oils in your skin.</li>
            <li> Smells great. I add this oil to a group of other oils I use for scalp and body moisturizing. I think it was a good price compared to the size of the product as well as compared to other vendors. I would buy again.</li>
            <li> I use this jojoba oil on my face in the morning and before I go to bed. It keeps my skin highly moisturized without being greasy. It repairs and beautifies your skin, too! No smell at all. Love this stuff!</li>
            <li> I use this every night on my face  after I shower. I have dry skin (no eczema, just on the dry side) and this keeps my face nice and moisturizer. Lasts a WHILE too!</li>
            <li> This is the best carrier oil for hyaluronic acid I&#x27;ve found  in a long time</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product just for a few days since I got it, I must say this oil makes my skin feel very relieved and it does not smell bad at all !</li>
            <li> Just what I was looking for! Great quality.  Works wonders as a moisturizer for my skin.. works great as a primer under my foundation.  Will definitely purchase again</li>
            <li> I purchased this product in place of a similar product by another brand. The size was very economical for the price and I will definitely be purchasing from now on.</li>
            <li> Great stuff, I can&#x27;t recommend it highly enough!  There are a lot of jojoba oils out there that are prohibitively expensive, but this one is an excellent quality jojoba oil at a very good price.  I bought this oil to use as a nail conditioner and also wound up using it as a hair tonic as well (only one small drop needed to rub between my hands and run through my hair after rinsing).  This oil absorbs completely into the nail and cuticles, hydrating both and leaving my cuticles soft, well conditioned and easy to push back.  It also works wonderfully as an after bath body oil and to condition dry, cracked heels.  The scent of this oil is very light and slightly nutty, so you could easily add your favorite scented oils to make it smell however you want.  I personally love several drops of lavender essential oil with just a drop or two of patchouli to give it a touch of mystery, or tea trea oil with just a drop or two of lavender for a very fresh, outdoorsy scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;By the way, I bought this oil, six 1oz glass bottles with screw on dropper tops, 3 small metal funnels and a 0.5oz bottle of essential tea tree oil for less than the price of one 4oz bottle of Bliss Kiss&#x27; &amp;#34;Pure Nail Oil&amp;#34; (on their site, since Amazon doesn&#x27;t carry the 4 oz bottle).  I&#x27;ve put together three of the small glass bottles of jojoba and tea tree oil for my Mom, my daughter and me and I&#x27;ve still got well over half of this 8.45oz bottle of jojoba oil left to use for other purposes and to refill our bottles of &#x27;nail oil&#x27;.</li>
            <li> This stuff actually cleared some of my breakouts! If you have acne prone skin, you should try this out</li>
            <li> Since cancer and chemo the only thing I can put on my body from head to toe is jojoba oil.  I don&#x27;t break out!</li>
            <li> This is a very good product.  Works great with castile soap and distilled water for a body wash.  It has a nice smell too.</li>
            <li> So far only used straight on skin but plans are for use in creams and lotions and perhaps making CP soap. Very pleasant to apply. No real smell of its own. Plan to use as a carrier with essential oils also.</li>
            <li> Massage therapist must have. my clients love it! Smooth glide! not sticky!</li>
            <li> I use this to take off heavy eye makeup and lip makeup, and to clean cream/gel makeup off my brushes. It&#x27;s really nice, really gentle and does the job. I like that it has a little spout so that you can get out just a small amount without it pouring everywhere.</li>
            <li> I did lots of research and wanted jojoba oil. Hobacare Jojoba oil had great reviews and this brand was great for the price. I&#x27;ve been using it for a while and found great results. I use it on my face, hands, nails, feet, body, and recently on my hair (curly dry hair). I use it as a pretreatment oil on my hair before washing. After blowing out my hair, I use a very small amount as a leave-in oil (use very few drops because that&#x27;s all you will need), it makes my shiny, antifreeze, and manageable. Leaves my hands and feet so soft. Loooooove this jojoba oil!!!</li>
            <li> I suffer from ichthyosis, so I&#x27;m constantly looking for something to help my scalp.  I also have 3B curly hair, and I need to seal in moisture.  Jojoba oil is THE BEST I have found so far.  Yesterday, I went to the dermatologist, and he even said that my scalp looks soooooooooooooo much better.  I have much less dandruff.  It also has pretty much replaced all hair products, eliminating chemicals.  My hair is shinier, healthier, and I hardly loose any hair compared to before.  I highly recommend this jojoba oil for scalp, moisturizing hair, and taming frizz.  Oh yeah, and it&#x27;s helped my hair grow faster!</li>
            <li> I use this oil for my skin and nails and it is great!  No greasy residue and feels wonderful.  Really works for softening your feet too!</li>
            <li> Great product. It&#x27;s not organic but it&#x27;s pesticide free! Smells wonderful. Quickly absorbed. I used it to take off my eye make up and as a face and body moisturizer. I use this only on my face  and people tell me I have the most beautiful skin - no foundation required!</li>
            <li> It Softens, maintains moisture, naturally wonderful. Great facially, legs, hands.  Nice under oil with a cream on top does wonders.</li>
            <li> I used this as a massage oil but I think it&#x27;s is too expensive and did not show much effect on my skin. I have used other jojoba oils that are better quality.</li>
            <li> I can definitely feel the difference between this brand/type of jojoba and several of the others I have tried. I DOES sink in better.  Maybe it&#x27;s becasue it&#x27;s cold-pressed. It&#x27;s still jojoba oil, so if you use too much, it will feel greasy like every other oil does when too heavily applied.  But I can tell that if you use it a few drops at a time, I&#x27;m talking 1-3, you can get away with using this on your face without looking like a greased baking pan.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For you naturalists looking for a great sealer and scalp oil, this stuff is the bees knees. For sealing, it comes across like a much richer oil, but without all the stickiness of castor or the heaviness of shea. Use a pointed-tip dye bottle to use Over time it help break up sebum plugs that can negatively impact hair growth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I just wish it was not so expensive...but you know what they say about buying cheap, right?</li>
            <li> Just as described Jojoba oil is fantastic.  This was a good price for the size.  Will purchase again.</li>
            <li> Good massage oil, it warms easily, it is a bonus a little goes a long way.  It is my favorite oil.</li>
            <li> Really works for restoring damaged hair, especially coarse or African-American hair. My wife uses this all the time for herself.</li>
            <li> Rather expensive and I am not sure how much better it is than Lubiderm or any other cream for dry skin.</li>
            <li> I use this for an all-over moisturizer and also as a base oil for other skin care products that I make. I&#x27;ve found it to be great...sinks in quickly, does not clog pores, hardly any scent, and very gentle. Great product!</li>
            <li> Jojoba oil is soooooo heavenly feeling. I use mine in lotion bars, &amp; it&#x27;s fabulous. It came quickly after ordering.</li>
            <li> Amazing product. Great quality. I am a strong believer in the benefits of jojoba oil for skin and hair.  Also, an excellent carrier oil. And I wouldn&#x27;t trust any other company than Hobacare. Best jojoba out there!</li>
            <li> This is a thicker carrier oil That I use for massage, dry skin, and I do mix in essential oils.  I was disappointed with the packaging as it had plastic wrap around the top of it and it was in a bag.  It did leak into the bag.  The oil itself is great!  The oil doesn&#x27;t have much of a scent to it and it carries the essential oil scents nicely.  It works great for the dry skin patches from the winter winds.  It is a large enough bottle that I won&#x27;t use up right away.  I have been using it for a scar massage and it is definitely helping to &amp;#34;soften&amp;#34; the scar area.  I have also used it on my hair to tame the static and my hair has been silky and soft without being extra oily.  I would purchase this one again and I would suggest it to my friends.</li>
            <li> Great value.  I use it as a nighttime moisturizer and I love it.</li>
            <li> I got this to add drops to my son&#x27;s bath water because his skin was always so dry and scaly. Worked like a charm. I use it every night in the bath (and just use soap/shampoo maybe once a week) and his skin feels amazing now... and so does mine wince we co-bathe!! It might seem a little pricey but a little goes a long way. And it works so it&#x27;s worth every penny.</li>
            <li> Could have been packaged better, either a seal on the opening of the bottle or a seal on the bottle cover as about 1 tsp of oil spilled out. Since it wasn&#x27;t a lot, I was not too upset and thus only took off 1 star. In addition, doesn&#x27;t smell rancid etc</li>
            <li> I use the product for both skin and hair. Works well, although it is an oil, it is readily absorbed in to the skin so I can dress quickly.</li>
            <li> If your looking this oil up for hair purposes, I strongly suggest you go ahead and buy it. It is lightweight, nearly odorless and it leaves hair truly moisturize. No complaints on the seller, the item is fairly priced and was shipped on time.</li>
            <li> I use this to dilute essential oils and for my massage practice. Love that it&#x27;s not sticky and a little goes a long way!</li>
            <li> Safe, effective and luxurious moisturizing for moms and babies - great for baths, showers, after-bath, etc and lasts forever. I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Very nice oil.  Does not have any odor and seems to be working well</li>
            <li> Jojoba oil was suggested to me by my doctor as a help for me very dry and itchy skin. I like it because it works and because there is no &amp;#34;oily&amp;#34; feeling to it. It absorbs rapidly.</li>
            <li> This stuff is so great. I use it for my stretched ears and it works wonders. I always recommend this to my friends. Also works to relieve dry or itchy skin and also helps with acne and other epidermal afflictions</li>
            <li> I really liked the jojoba oil, I use it on my face, body and hair. I like that it has no smell. Will buy again</li>
            <li> This is great stuff for taking off makeup and applying to dry patches on face.</li>
            <li> Pretty good.  I Use it on my son&#x27;s eczema and my extremely dry skin. But mostly for my facial oil cleansing</li>
            <li> As described, on time</li>
            <li> Adds a good moisture barrier.</li>
            <li> I agree with the comment about the strange smell of this product. At first I thought it was good but later it changed. It&#x27;s not as bad of a change as occurred with the now brand one (which really became awful smelling), but it is annoying and unnerving.</li>
            <li> Very satisfied with this product. I blend it with other oils to use from the top of my head to the soles of my feet</li>
            <li> I love Jojoba oil and use it on my face at least twice a day. My only complaint with this product is the bottle.  It is a very rigid plastic and not very squeeezable. It also makes me wonder if the went to a thinner bottle how much plastic it could save. I really do not like plastic and would have purchased glass but this bottle was going to be traveling with us right away. I have to imagine this bottle can&#x27;t be much lighter than glass.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The oil is great, but I&#x27;ve used several different brands of Jojoba oil and they are all comparable.</li>
            <li> Great Product. Great Results. Fair Price. I would Recommend this product to anyone looking for a good option for natural jojoba oil.</li>
            <li> This Hobacare Joba Oil 8oz is a great product for ethinic hair. I use it on my scalp and it helps me maintain healthy hair without weighing my hair down.</li>
            <li> Great oil.  It&#x27;s a waxy oil which is absorbed into your skin quickly, leaving a waxy moisturized feel to your skin.  Love it especially during these brutal winter months.  A couple drops goes a long way.  I mix it with Shea Butter and Cocoa butter, OMG, my skin feels alive again!</li>
            <li> Great for waxed wood floors - shines them right up!</li>
            <li> I use this product with the castor oil as a moitsutizer.  It is great together!!</li>
            <li> Just got two of the 8 oz bottles.  His and hers.  Love this stuff.  When my scalp is injured or itchy I rub some into the scalp and let it do its magic overnight.  In the morning the scalp is back to normal.  Also mix it with a little bit of lavender oil to use as a pre-shave treatment;  3 or 4 drops with a bit of water and it spreads a nice film over the shave area that I then apply soap or shave cream to and I get the best shave.  It&#x27;s very light and seems to absorb into the skin without the typical oily film.  Highly recommended as a nice, natural, chemical free, way to enhance other lotions and sundry items. Even used it on chapped lips the other day.  Good stuff and at this price...you can&#x27;t beat it.  Here&#x27;s their link for other uses; [...]</li>
            <li> this product is good for everything. It is a big bottle and very well priced. I use it to remove makeup and as a face moisturizer. It even removes waterproof mascara and doesnt burn your eyes like all makeup removers. Also a little goes a long way. the one problem I discovered with it was the smell. i had different jojoba oils before that had no smell. when i received this one after a few weeks it smelt really strong like barbecue sauce. i thought it had gone bad so i got a refund and ordered the same one again. to my surprise when i opened this one it smelt strong and like barbecue sauce again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve thouroughly enjoyed using this oil, for both self-care and clients.</li>
            <li> smooth as silk skin with this</li>
            <li> Love this oil.  I&#x27;m hooked on jojoba from now on.</li>
            <li> 100% jojoba oil, priced right. What else can one ask for? I use it in my hair everyday and my hair looks and feels great now.</li>
            <li> I love Jojoba Care Jojoba Oil. It is a very light weight oil that mimics the skins very closely. It&#x27;s a great carrier oil and can used for making soaps and body oils. You can mix fragrance oils with it to create great delightful body oils and butters.</li>
            <li> Jojoba oil is awesome and I like how this bottle has a controlled dispenser.  Only a small amount of oil comes out of the bottle at a time, so you don&#x27;t waste any by accident!</li>
            <li> Good, order came fast. The top is not good. It doesn&#x27;t dispense well and leaks so it gets messy at the cap.</li>
            <li> Plan to never run out of this. Effective, versatile, gentle. Removes make-up and conditions skin. Replaces some expensive products for me. May be a little too heavy for younger women, but coconut oil works great for my 32-yr-old daughter. I LOVE this</li>
            <li> I use jojoba oil on my face and scalp/hair and it&#x27;s awesome but expensive. I bought this because the bottle is bigger, figure a bigger bottle for my hair. Well I received it and it&#x27;s a darker yellow and more oily which really concerned me. I really didn&#x27;t feel like the hassle of returning it, but I will not use this on my face. I will keep it for my hair and be sparing with the amount. So just be advised this is more golden in color and a little thick.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite product to use on my skin after I shower. It makes my skin feel amazing, and even though its oil, it doesn&#x27;t leave your skin feeling gross. Plus it&#x27;s safe to use on my acne prone face which is always a plus. I&#x27;ve been buying it for years at my local health food store but I found out it is much cheaper here on Amazon</li>
            <li> this oil is so smooth. I use it for dry skin and aromatherapy oils....Love it</li>
            <li> Great oil, I prefer to buy this rather than go to the store.</li>
            <li> I live in NV, and because our climate is so dry, I use a very small amount of this 100%  jojoba oil on my dry skin (legs and arms) and it works very well.</li>
            <li> My product arrived exactly as described. Packaging well suited...Love product!</li>
            <li> This oil has replaced my creme rinse, lotion and face cream.  It is very moisturizing.</li>
