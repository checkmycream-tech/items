            <li>Seriously the best hair dye I have ever bought.</li>
            <li>It also leaves my hair very soft and more manageable</li>
            <li>I have colored my hair for many years, both professionally and at home, and wish I had found this before.  </li>

            <li>I love the color Medium Beige Blonde from L&#x27;Oreal Paris Excellence.  </li>
            <li>It covers the gray, unfortunately not longer than 2 weeks, then gray pops out and need to touch up again.</li>
            <li>This is simply the BEST blonde haircolor for removing red tones and brassiness.</li>
            <li>More like a champagne blonde.  </li>
            <li>It gives a great, subtle color, with no brassiness at all.  </li>
            <li>This is the only kind that makes my hair soft after coloring because of the pre treatment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Kathy</li>
            <li>But I mix it with a lighter redish blonde for a perfect in-between subtle color.  </li>
            <li>I just color when I know I won&#x27;t be going anywhere important in the next couple days.  </li>
            <li>but when you hit the light its a pretty soft blonde color.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>As I have gotten older, I have tried to find a hair color close to my natural color that will  cover the gray.  </li>
            <li>but if your looking for a natural dirty blonde color this is perfect.</li>
            <li>I frequent.  </li>
            <li>It covers the gray well, and there is no green.  </li>
            <li>than it is naturally.</li>
            <li>It covers gray well and as the color lightens a bit in the sun or when it&#x27;s time to color again, my gray areas become soft highlights.  </li>
            <li>It is the closest to my natural color</li>
            <li>My wife has a hard time finding a hair color to match her natural color, whick is a very light brown to dark golden blonde.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t it 5 star because, it doesn&#x27;t really cover my grey fully.</li>
            <li>Of course you want to be in the same color family as your natural hair color to achieve a natural look.</li>
            <li>Not ashen, not golden.  </li>
            <li>My daughter and I both love this shade but it is almost impossible to find consistently on the shelves of our local stores.  </li>

            <li> My only complaint is that it is just a little dark (though still pretty) when I first color it, but within about 3 days it looks very natural.  </li>
            <li> I have trouble finding this particular color in  any  store..</li>
            <li> I am not a golden blonde and that color looks horrid with my skin tone, but all the ash blondes I tried made my hair have a greenish cast, especially under fluorescent lights.  </li>
            <li> Strange.</li>
            <li> I am dark blonde/light brown naturally and typically use salon colors 8 to 9 to cover gray.</li>
            <li> I have used it for a very long time but started having  trouble finding it in any of the stores  </li>
            <li> This is the only color I use~and it is so hard to find</li>
            <li> She wanted it a little lighter, but this didnt work.</li>
            <li> Its hard to describe</li>

            <li> This is a difficult color to find.</li>
            <li> It was darker than I thought it would be, but might have been because of my base color before using it.</li>
            <li> never changed her color at all, and the chemical smell was awful and it stayed on her hair even after she washed it..</li>

            <li> This is the only place I can find my color.  Even color all over and easy to apply.  Looks great and natural</li>
            <li> This is my favorite color until I couldn&#x27;t find it in the stores. I spotted it on Amazon and will be ordering it once a month from now on. This is the only kind that makes my hair soft after coloring because of the pre treatment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Kathy</li>
            <li> I love the color Medium Beige Blonde from L&#x27;Oreal Paris Excellence.  I have used it for a very long time but started having  trouble finding it in any of the stores  I frequent.  Amazon.com  is the only place I found it and was so happy for the on going delivery program.  I have one delivered every 2 months and I never have to go looking in a store again.</li>
            <li> Have been using ths product with great results for years.  Gives me the best gray coverage of any product I have tried.  Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> This is a natural shade of blonde that does not look cheap or fake. Of course you want to be in the same color family as your natural hair color to achieve a natural look. It covers the gray, unfortunately not longer than 2 weeks, then gray pops out and need to touch up again. This needs improving.</li>
            <li> I have colored my hair for many years, both professionally and at home, and wish I had found this before.  It gives a great, subtle color, with no brassiness at all.  The coverage is excellent including of greys.  Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> This is simply the BEST blonde haircolor for removing red tones and brassiness. The color looks a bit purple/pinkish when it&#x27;s on your head, but that&#x27;s not the result you get at all. The beautiful beige is 100% brass free... it&#x27;s like a champagne blonde, but deeper and richer. It&#x27;s a great summer color. Unfortunately it is getting difficult to find in stores, so I buy online. Recommended.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t find this product in this color locally.  What a relief to find it on-line at the sale price advertised by a local store!  (:</li>
            <li> As I have gotten older, I have tried to find a hair color close to my natural color that will  cover the gray.  I am not a golden blonde and that color looks horrid with my skin tone, but all the ash blondes I tried made my hair have a greenish cast, especially under fluorescent lights.  I finally discovered this beige blonde and have been pretty happy with it.  It covers the gray well, and there is no green.  I also like that it is not permanent so there isn&#x27;t the tell-tale line as it grows out, the color just gradually fades.  My only complaint is that it is just a little dark (though still pretty) when I first color it, but within about 3 days it looks very natural.  I just color when I know I won&#x27;t be going anywhere important in the next couple days.  It also leaves my hair very soft and more manageable than it is naturally.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m basing this rating in comparison to salon color. I am dark blonde/light brown naturally and typically use salon colors 8 to 9 to cover gray. I wanted something in a box to skip a month or two in between salon visits and this is the best box color I&#x27;ve found. It is more beige or neutral than others and did not pull orange. After 3 or 4 uses I was a bit gold but toner or corrective shampoo can help with that if you don&#x27;t want to be gold based.</li>
            <li> This item is priced similar to store price but it is nice to have the pack of 3 on hand to touch up whenever I have time.</li>
            <li> My daughter and I both love this shade but it is almost impossible to find consistently on the shelves of our local stores.  Being a Prime member allows for free 2 day shipping on anything I order, so this makes my purchase both a time and money saver.</li>
            <li> Great L&#x27;Oreal product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hard to find in stores in this color so I bought 5 on Amazon.  I love the color.  Not ashen, not golden.  More like a champagne blonde.  It covers gray well and as the color lightens a bit in the sun or when it&#x27;s time to color again, my gray areas become soft highlights.  Great effect.  I would recommend this to anyone looking for a warmer blonde color.</li>
            <li> My wife has a hard time finding a hair color to match her natural color, whick is a very light brown to dark golden blonde. She wanted it a little lighter, but this didnt work. never changed her color at all, and the chemical smell was awful and it stayed on her hair even after she washed it..</li>
            <li> I have trouble finding this particular color in  any  store..so  glad to  find it !</li>
            <li> This was a great purchase. This is a difficult color to find. This subscription is working well. Thank you.</li>
            <li> LOVE THIS COLOR GREAT PRODUCT</li>
            <li> I have used for many years color is Love!!!</li>
            <li> Love this color, it is so close to my natural color.  I use it to cover the gray and lighten a bit.  I too cannot find it in any stores in my area anymore.</li>
            <li> This is the only color I use~and it is so hard to find~This was my 3rd. order from Amazon~very pleased with the product and fast shipping~&lt;br /&gt;will be ordering again~~</li>
            <li> It was darker than I thought it would be, but might have been because of my base color before using it.</li>
            <li> Seriously the best hair dye I have ever bought. It is so dimensional with the darkish blonde but when you hit the light its a pretty soft blonde color. Its hard to describe but if your looking for a natural dirty blonde color this is perfect. It is the closest to my natural color I&#x27;ve ever come by and I absolutely love it.</li>
            <li> I love this product, it doesn&#x27;t damage my hair.  I didn&#x27;t it 5 star because, it doesn&#x27;t really cover my grey fully.</li>
            <li> But I mix it with a lighter redish blonde for a perfect in-between subtle color.  Suits me to a T</li>
            <li> This was the very last place I could find this hair color. Now I can&#x27;t find it anywhere. L&#x27;Oreal must have discontinued it. Strange. I mean, it&#x27;s just a hair color.</li>
            <li> I loved this haircolor and got a lot of compliments on it.  I&#x27;ll never understand why companies discontinue products that people love -- In this case L&#x27;Oreal Excellence 8BB Medium Beige haircolor.  It was selling for $7.95 a box in the stores.  Noticed Amazon now has has the last 10 priced at $15.52 a box!!</li>
            <li> Many compliments from my co-workers</li>
            <li> Great product got it here quickly also</li>
            <li> Read the description to make sure you receive what you really want.  I ordered the 10 minute hair color by Loreal and received this.</li>
