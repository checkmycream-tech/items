            <li>Nice way to avoid and fumes from your lighter!  </li>
            <li>/&gt;This is not the BEST hemp wick holder in the world, and not the most eye pleasing piece of glass with a cork, however it does the job!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>To me, it&#x27;s the best way to maximize the use of your hemp wick in a stylish way.</li>
            <li>This stuff is amazing and a good way to get away from inhaling all that butaine bleh</li>
            <li>The best is you can put the flame right where you need it.</li>
            <li>Couldn&#x27;t ask for more!</li>
            <li>I love it!</li>
            <li>Way better than my lighter!</li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>Love this thing!</li>
            <li>It can hold more than it looks like it can as well!</li>
            <li>best way to smoke, regardless of what your smoking.. came quick, not disappointed  at all! ..</li>
            <li>the hemp burns nice too.</li>
            <li>Very fast shipping, looks great.</li>
            <li>Will be buying more replacement wick.</li>
            <li>2 feet of wick MAXIMUM, comfortably fitting 1 foot of wick.</li>
            <li>Everything tastes so much better with the wick.</li>
            <li>Super cool amazing idea!</li>
            <li>Makes hits so smooth and so much better for you</li>
            <li>The product details on the item pageat accurate.</li>
            <li>Light one candle and use this product to light what ever.</li>
            <li>I still use the humbolt (cylinder; not pictured anymore) hempwick dispenser but its filled with Bee Line wick now.</li>
            <li>Fantastic idea</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m still using it for special occasions, and still have my lighters.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I would steer clear of this item if you already have a hemp wick holder, as the hemp wick itself is cheaper on its own.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The hemp wick itself is the best I have ever used in comparison with other highly regarded brands, and I would not purchase another type again.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It makes my hits more smooth, but the wick burns pretty fast.</li>
            <li>I love my new Humboldt Organic Hemp Wick Dispenser!</li>
            <li>Still a worthy purchase.</li>
            <li>But you go through it quick.  </li>
            <li>Also gives full flavor of your green lol and waterproof</li>
            <li>Very functional and easy on the eyes.</li>
            <li>Clean, crisp, tasting.</li>
            <li>just right.</li>
            <li>You think 50 feet is a lot right?  </li>
            <li>Seems like the glass dispenser is pretty solid and helps control the flame better...</li>
            <li>This product is exactly as pictured.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll be back to buy more slower burning wick.</li>
            <li>I loved how they used recycled newspaper to wrap  instead of some fancy stuff that cost money and is a waste.</li>
            <li>but I wish I got to choose the color I wanted, overall super cool product</li>
            <li>I love how this product keeps my hemp wick clean and it fits in my pocket without getting all messy!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s what I expected and I am satisfied with this purchase.</li>
            <li>It makes smoking so much smoother</li>
            <li>I also use it to light candles in deep jars.</li>
            <li>fast shipping.</li>
            <li>Its a very disconcerting dehydrated urine color and its mishaped and clunky</li>
            <li>Cool little thing, works fine..</li>
            <li>And as far as the humboldt hemp wick, its got minimal wick taste for a more pure herb taste.  </li>
            <li>This piece is very unique to the east coast where i live and i very much appreciate the quality and simple design as well as the insanely low price!!!!</li>
            <li>I like this product its nice and small for your hand, still holds a decent amount of wick, i also like this company&#x27;s 100 ft holders they are still small and nice in the hand.</li>
            <li>I still like beeline a little better though.</li>
            <li>This one is at least twice as big, and seems much thicker, holds a good amount of wick.  </li>
            <li>but they do say this size wick does and have other sizes available.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had mine a couple weeks and liking it so far.</li>
            <li>cute, thick glass, well blown.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s dark but you can still see how much is in it.</li>
            <li>Burns a little fast</li>

            <li> cute, thick glass, well blown.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s dark but you can still see how much is in it.</li>
            <li> Burns a little fast</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s the only problem other than that the glass is thick and sturdy, the cork stays inside just fine as well.</li>
            <li> no bubbles or cracks in the glass and the cork is a simple design as expected with the hempwick feeding through it.</li>
            <li> This small, thick glass tube is about as big as a bic lighter and its pretty nifty.  </li>
            <li> About 3 inches long and just under and inch wide.</li>
            <li> It was just as I expected!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d buy it 10 times over, because its does its job like a mother, its just a little roughly crafted.</li>
            <li> Very little taste, long burning.</li>
            <li> The cork hole is narrow</li>
            <li> Got the green one and like the shade.</li>
            <li> very clean, not having to taste the disgusting butane from lighters any longer.</li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s hard to thread my wick through</li>
            <li> Fits thick gauge wick as well.</li>
            <li> THick glass for starters and quality made.</li>
            <li> I paid 15$ for an ugly piece of glass, a cork, and 50ft of hempwick which in my case failed to impress.</li>

            <li> Makes using hemp wick a bit easier and a bit fancier. I&#x27;ve had mine a couple weeks and liking it so far. Fits thick gauge wick as well.</li>
            <li> Very nice and won&#x27;t burn your finger when u use your lighter. Also gives full flavor of your green lol and waterproof</li>
            <li> This small, thick glass tube is about as big as a bic lighter and its pretty nifty.  Will hold up to 6 feet of wick if u can get it in there just right. And as far as the humboldt hemp wick, its got minimal wick taste for a more pure herb taste.  I still like beeline a little better though. Still a worthy purchase.</li>
            <li> Arrived on time well packaged with newspaper the extra wick was wrapped in wax paper I think maybe tissue paper. The cork hole is narrow so it&#x27;s hard to thread my wick through and I think I have the smallest thickness. That&#x27;s the only problem other than that the glass is thick and sturdy, the cork stays inside just fine as well.</li>
            <li> Very fast shipping, looks great. Couldn&#x27;t ask for more!</li>
            <li> I love it! It&#x27;s what I expected and I am satisfied with this purchase. The product details on the item pageat accurate. Read before you buy.</li>
            <li> Nice way to avoid and fumes from your lighter!  Light one candle and use this product to light what ever.</li>
            <li> Cool little thing, works fine.. best way to smoke, regardless of what your smoking.. came quick, not disappointed  at all! ..kudos.</li>
            <li> Way better than my lighter! It makes my hits more smooth, but the wick burns pretty fast. Next time I would get a longer length.</li>
            <li> cute, thick glass, well blown. accidentally threw it across a blacktop and it didnt chip, scratch, or shatter. the hemp burns nice too. very clean, not having to taste the disgusting butane from lighters any longer.</li>
            <li> It was just as I expected! Love it!</li>
            <li> It makes smoking so much smoother</li>
            <li> I love how this product keeps my hemp wick clean and it fits in my pocket without getting all messy!</li>
            <li> Seems like the glass dispenser is pretty solid and helps control the flame better...I am a happy customer! Will be buying more replacement wick.</li>
            <li> Got the green one and like the shade. It&#x27;s dark but you can still see how much is in it. About 3 inches long and just under and inch wide. Burns a little fast but they do say this size wick does and have other sizes available. I also use it to light candles in deep jars. Very handy. Would buy again.</li>
            <li> I love this product!! Makes hits so smooth and so much better for you</li>
            <li> So if you like to burn and you have not tried one of these out for yourself, than treat yourself today.  This thing is awesome! Clean, crisp, tasting. Yum!  You think 50 feet is a lot right?  But you go through it quick.  Do yourself a favor and by a refill hemp pack.  Great costumer service.  I loved how they used recycled newspaper to wrap  instead of some fancy stuff that cost money and is a waste. Great product.  I would buy another one for myself and I would buy for a friend too!</li>
            <li> This product is exactly as pictured.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is not the BEST hemp wick holder in the world, and not the most eye pleasing piece of glass with a cork, however it does the job!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Each time you fill the vile, you can fill it with approx. 2 feet of wick MAXIMUM, comfortably fitting 1 foot of wick. Leave 4 to 6 inches of wick out the end when filling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The hemp wick itself is the best I have ever used in comparison with other highly regarded brands, and I would not purchase another type again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would steer clear of this item if you already have a hemp wick holder, as the hemp wick itself is cheaper on its own. If you are looking for a hemp wick holder however, you don&#x27;t need anything too fancy! Won&#x27;t ever regret this purchase, as it has made me a believer in Humboldt HempWick!</li>
            <li> A must have for any smoker using the hemp wick. Very functional and easy on the eyes. Love this thing!</li>
            <li> Simple , just how I like things .&lt;br /&gt;This company rocks .</li>
            <li> The hemp wick smells great but I wish I got to choose the color I wanted, overall super cool product</li>
            <li> I love my new Humboldt Organic Hemp Wick Dispenser! To me, it&#x27;s the best way to maximize the use of your hemp wick in a stylish way. Thank you Emerald Triangle!</li>
            <li> I bought one of these previously in a different color (someone walked off with it, bastard!).  This one is at least twice as big, and seems much thicker, holds a good amount of wick.  Ordered it on Thurs, arrived Tues... fast shipping.</li>
            <li> I like this product its nice and small for your hand, still holds a decent amount of wick, i also like this company&#x27;s 100 ft holders they are still small and nice in the hand.</li>
            <li> I paid 15$ for an ugly piece of glass, a cork, and 50ft of hempwick which in my case failed to impress. I still use the humbolt (cylinder; not pictured anymore) hempwick dispenser but its filled with Bee Line wick now. Its a very disconcerting dehydrated urine color and its mishaped and clunky but I dont smoke without it. I&#x27;d buy it 10 times over, because its does its job like a mother, its just a little roughly crafted.</li>
            <li> THick glass for starters and quality made. no bubbles or cracks in the glass and the cork is a simple design as expected with the hempwick feeding through it. It can hold more than it looks like it can as well! This piece is very unique to the east coast where i live and i very much appreciate the quality and simple design as well as the insanely low price!!!!</li>
            <li> I got this with my 250 ft roll. Fantastic idea but it is hand blown glass and is very fragile. It tipped over and cracked. I&#x27;m still using it for special occasions, and still have my lighters. Very little taste, long burning. The best is you can put the flame right where you need it.</li>
            <li> Super cool amazing idea! Everything tastes so much better with the wick. I&#x27;ll be back to buy more slower burning wick. This stuff is amazing and a good way to get away from inhaling all that butaine bleh</li>
