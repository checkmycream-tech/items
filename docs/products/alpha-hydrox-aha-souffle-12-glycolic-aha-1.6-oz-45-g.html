            <li>I think this product is just as good.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t help with acne, but I believe it&#x27;s good for evening out skin tone, acne scars, etc.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Good stuff try it</li>
            <li>Not as good as Nerium, but works in a pinch.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m good to go.  </li>
            <li>Every bit as good as the RX for Brown skin</li>

            <li>I&#x27;m not affiliated with any of these products, I just personally think they are awesome and my skin looks great.</li>
            <li>A nice moisturizer, I prefer the overnight cream for strength, but this will keep your face from drying out.</li>
            <li>Absolutely one of the best products I have ever used.</li>
            <li>I read about this on Paula&#x27;s Choice, she gave it high points, I agree, it works great and is a great value</li>
            <li>I love, love, love, this product!</li>

            <li>Happy New Year!!!</li>
            <li>I have seen a huge difference in my skin!</li>
            <li>Excellent product and results, especially for the price.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure my jaw dropped so</li>
            <li>maybe just that the skin is fresher looking and better taken care</li>
            <li>Love this product.</li>
            <li>They haven&#x27;t disappeared but they look a bit better.</li>
            <li>(I think that&#x27;s for bha), but I feel like my face looks better</li>
            <li>Also, make sure you wear sun screen if you leave the house because this cream leaves your skin more susceptible to sun damage.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s smooth and my comedones are flattening out!</li>
            <li>I will continue to use it and hopefully order more from you.</li>
            <li>My skin looks so much better.</li>
            <li>After continued use, you will find your skin glows with a healthy youthful shine.</li>
            <li>Works fantastic!  </li>
            <li>Love this products, work wonders on my skin.</li>
            <li>BETTER WITH EACH USE!&lt;br</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m completely satisfied.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so glad I could order this online.  </li>
            <li>Just make sure to wear your sunscreen because these products are strong</li>
            <li>Very potent stuff, noticed a difference after the first use.</li>
            <li>so I assumed this would be fine.</li>
            <li>This product helps the fine lines and smoothes the skin.</li>
            <li>I have used it for years and it  is the best at sloughing off old skin and bringing in new cells.</li>
            <li>have been very happy with it too (although I do wear makeup because I&#x27;ve got a little bit of discoloration).</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t seen huge results yet</li>
            <li>This one just did not make a huge difference to justify the price.</li>
            <li>Priced reasonably and is effective.</li>
            <li>It keeps my skin blemish and wrinkle free.  </li>
            <li>No irritation and keeps skin looking smooth.</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t say enough great things about it.  </li>
            <li>It really works!!!</li>
            <li>I love Alpha Hydrox products, I use this each night and wake up to smooth even toned skin, it does leave a bit of a &#x27;burning-tingling sensation&#x27; the first 5 minutes after applying.</li>
            <li>I have been using the Souffle and Intensive Serum for over a  little over a month and the changes to my skin are incredible.  </li>
            <li>and I use the other Alpha Hydrox products with great results.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re interested, I use Arbonne RE 9 Advanced Intensive Renewal Serum, and CSI Recovery Eye Cream with Arnica and Vitamin K.  </li>
            <li>ALSO USE SMOOTHIES CLEAR STRIPs on forehead at night,  to plump Wrinkles out much better  than Frownies!&lt;br</li>
            <li>BEST KEPT SECRET R</li>
            <li>My skin is consistently more clear and even-toned after using these products, and I like that this 12% souffle is not greasy, yet not drying.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;These fade discoloration and plump out any acne scars and DEEP or light wrinkles leaving smooth canvas face and moisturized too!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Really affordable, fast shipping!!</li>
            <li>In the morning my skin feels extremely smooth and soft.</li>
            <li>It has changed my skin so much in 3 days!</li>
            <li>It does tingle when you first put it on</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m in LOVE with the entire line of Alpha Hyrox!  </li>
            <li>but I found that over time (and with consistent use) my skin has improved a lot.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve noticed that most of the dry patches on my face have gone away.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t really know how it makes anyone look</li>
            <li>so you really can&#x27;t complain too much about the cost/value.</li>
            <li>They are reasonably priced and work too.</li>
            <li>I really notice a difference in my skin when I use it.  </li>
            <li>Face looks so much brighter and clearer.  </li>
            <li>Delivery was fast and my skin has cleared again.</li>
            <li>absolutely as advertised.</li>
            <li>Thanks~+~</li>
            <li>,  NEVER harshly pull back skin if wrinkles are deep because THESE WORK on their OWN in their way, so don&#x27;t damage ur skin by pulling taut to try to first smooth wrinkle prior to laying strip on it, sleep in over night .</li>
            <li>Also, I especially like the price - totally affordable!  :)</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this cream.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>A good product, and a little goes a long way.  </li>
            <li>After a patch test, I put it on my whole face last night for the first time.</li>
            <li>My skin is very soft.  </li>
            <li>I do love the other Alpha Hydrox products and use them daily.  </li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin &amp; so far no problems.</li>
            <li>I use the AHA lotion every day, but this is a little strong since I am in the sun more lately in my flower garden.  </li>
            <li>The redness has almost completely faded and the little fine lines around my eyes are gone.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 54 years old and have been using this at night for over 20 years.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve been using it for about a month or so now, and so far I like the results.</li>
            <li>I am a 42 year old, landscaper and old sun worshiper.  </li>
            <li>I also had one small blemish starting, but I can sure live with that.</li>
            <li>There&#x27;s a very slight stinging sensation, not troublesome at all, and in the morning my skin is as smooth as a baby&#x27;s bottom.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Simply PLace sticky sided strip onto wrinkle, if deep wrinkle slightly pull skin up to allow strip to stick in to wrinkled area .. and apply then let go of lightly held skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>REALLY works wonder around the OBAGI MEDICAL GRADE creams I bought and have 2/3 left of for over $100 bucks</li>
            <li>Bye-bye to the ridiculous department store rip offs which weren&#x27;t half this good.</li>
            <li>Then I went back to this, and started getting compliments on my face, being mistaken for my 24 year old son&#x27;s Wife!</li>
            <li>Beauty staple - keeps my skin clear and I reorder this stuff constantly.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Results last so far.</li>
            <li>I truly never expected them to work.  </li>
            <li>I love using this product, especially in late winter, early spring when I need new healthier looking skin.  </li>
            <li>There is a little stinging when I first apply it</li>
    </ol>

            <li> Then I went back to this, and started getting compliments on my face, being mistaken for my 24 year old son&#x27;s Wife!</li>
            <li> Beauty staple - keeps my skin clear and I reorder this stuff constantly.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Results last so far.</li>
            <li> I truly never expected them to work.  </li>
            <li> I love using this product, especially in late winter, early spring when I need new healthier looking skin.  </li>
            <li> There is a little stinging when I first apply it</li>
            <li> /&gt;I put a thin layer on at night and it seems to take the top layer of skin off leaving me w/o acne or dead skin cells, but instead my natural oils which seem to come to the surface.</li>
            <li> /&gt;You should give this a try, especially if you have dry skin.</li>
            <li> If I go awhile and don&#x27;t use it, it can sting a little, so just be aware of that and perhaps use slightly less.  </li>
            <li> first few times I applied it, it stung just a bit, but only in small areas of my face, not everywhere.</li>
            <li> This one was just not worth the extra $ for me.</li>
            <li> I only use it at night, and then put a little moisturizer over it.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;d recommend using only at night and rubbing in a small amount of this and topping it with your usual cream or oil, especially if you have dry skin, as this cream alone might not be moisturizing enough.</li>
            <li> I have closed comedones and I&#x27;m trying to get ride of them so that I can sign to a modeling agency.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for several weeks but could notice a difference in just a few days.</li>
            <li> Then stopped for about 8 years, trying other products.  </li>
            <li> Any time my skin starts to feel a little rough</li>
            <li> I use the Souffle everyday and the serum every other day at night.  </li>
            <li> I have now been using the Alpha Hydrox Soufflé for about a week and a half now.</li>
            <li> I have been using Alpha Hydrox products for about a year and a half</li>
            <li> I now just use a little BB cream and some powder</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t met an expensive night cream that makes my skin as clear and radiant as this.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had a few acne scars and this has helped lighten them a bit.</li>
            <li> Not very effective.</li>
            <li> Not sure what the difference between the 2 products is aside from the percentage of AHA</li>
            <li> And now it usually doesn&#x27;t sting at all.</li>
            <li> And for the price, it is unbelievable and unbeatable stuff!  </li>
            <li> SERIOUSLY</li>
            <li> Not too thin, not too thick.  </li>
            <li> so I tried other in-store brands, which resulted in horrible breakouts.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Excellent product and results, especially for the price.</li>
            <li> I was introduced to this product on accident when I asked a lady whose skin looked flawless what kind of foundation she uses. Her reply was that she wasn&#x27;t wearing foundation! I&#x27;m sure my jaw dropped so i had to know what else she was doing. She told me that she was using this product!&lt;br /&gt;I have been very happy with it too (although I do wear makeup because I&#x27;ve got a little bit of discoloration). I&#x27;ve been using it for 3 years now and people think i am about 4++ years younger than i am.&lt;br /&gt;I put a thin layer on at night and it seems to take the top layer of skin off leaving me w/o acne or dead skin cells, but instead my natural oils which seem to come to the surface. I don&#x27;t really know how it makes anyone look younger-- maybe just that the skin is fresher looking and better taken care of?&lt;br /&gt;Lastly, there may be places to get this for cheaper.. . Ulta with coupon? Regardless, I think one container lasts 9 -12 months so you really can&#x27;t complain too much about the cost/value.</li>
            <li> I use the AHA lotion every day, but this is a little strong since I am in the sun more lately in my flower garden.  I use it once a week and it works great.  I do like all the products I have tried from AHA.</li>
            <li> this is a great product and it does not burn the skin.  i use it at night.</li>
            <li> Love this product. You can see the good it does. Not a lot of lines on my face.</li>
            <li> I read about this on Paula&#x27;s Choice, she gave it high points, I agree, it works great and is a great value</li>
            <li> Excellent product.  Priced reasonably and is effective.</li>
            <li> Love there products works well and great prices</li>
            <li> Product is good but still overpricedt</li>
            <li> I was using prescription Retin A and now just this. I think this product is just as good. A lot cheaper and no prescription needed.</li>
            <li> Any time my skin starts to feel a little rough I put this on at night before bed.  There&#x27;s a very slight stinging sensation, not troublesome at all, and in the morning my skin is as smooth as a baby&#x27;s bottom.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used the same brand AHA 10% lotion before and had no problems so I assumed this would be fine. Everywhere I placed this product immediately broke out. Not sure what the difference between the 2 products is aside from the percentage of AHA but I threw this away after using it twice.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 54 years old and have been using this at night for over 20 years.  It keeps my skin blemish and wrinkle free.  It also helps minimize sun spots and is a great value.  I highly recommend this cream.</li>
            <li> So I had never heard of chemical exfoliation before but after reading about it on Skin Care Addiction, I wanted to give this a try.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using it for about a month or so now, and so far I like the results. I apply it at night before bed and wait around 30 minutes before I put on my moisturizer over it/after it. In the morning my skin feels extremely smooth and soft. I&#x27;ve had a few acne scars and this has helped lighten them a bit. They haven&#x27;t disappeared but they look a bit better. I can&#x27;t tell if this aha helps with pore-related things (I think that&#x27;s for bha), but I feel like my face looks better overall.&lt;br /&gt;The first few times I applied it, it stung just a bit, but only in small areas of my face, not everywhere. And now it usually doesn&#x27;t sting at all. It doesn&#x27;t help with acne, but I believe it&#x27;s good for evening out skin tone, acne scars, etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You should give this a try, especially if you have dry skin. I&#x27;ve noticed that most of the dry patches on my face have gone away. But not if I don&#x27;t apply moisturizer after this cream. Also, make sure you wear sun screen if you leave the house because this cream leaves your skin more susceptible to sun damage.</li>
            <li> I bought mine from Ulta. It has changed my skin so much in 3 days! I have closed comedones and I&#x27;m trying to get ride of them so that I can sign to a modeling agency. I put it on every NIGHT not during the day because my face can get greasy if I put a lot of stuff on it during the day. I have seen a huge difference in my skin! It&#x27;s smooth and my comedones are flattening out! They&#x27;re almost gone! I&#x27;m so happy with this product. I just came from Ulta I bought the foaming face wash! I sold on this brand!!</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for several months and I feel that it is a great AHA product for the price. No irritation and keeps skin looking smooth. Will continue to buy regularly.</li>
            <li> The best product that contains a lot of Alpha Hydroxy! Can&#x27;t beat the price.</li>
            <li> I love using this product, especially in late winter, early spring when I need new healthier looking skin.  It really works!!!</li>
            <li> I use these products. They are reasonably priced and work too. This product helps the fine lines and smoothes the skin.</li>
            <li> it cream is great for your skin. I was told by someone and now I can tell who ever reads this. Good stuff try it I think you&#x27;ll like it</li>
            <li> Thank you for this great product. I will continue to use it and hopefully order more from you. Have a great day and thank you again. Happy New Year!!!</li>
            <li> I think I got an expired dose.  Not very effective.</li>
            <li> what a great product and it does all that the claims promise</li>
            <li> Only used for 5 days can already see the difference with texture, acne has reduced  as well</li>
            <li> I have now been using the Alpha Hydrox Soufflé for about a week and a half now. I have very sensitive skin &amp; so far no problems. It does tingle when you first put it on but that goes away in  couple minutes. I haven&#x27;t seen huge results yet but I was only putting it on in the morning until I saw how my skin reacted to it. I am going to continue using this product.</li>
            <li> This is my second tube of the Alpha Hydrox AHA Soufflé.  I really notice a difference in my skin when I use it.  Face looks so much brighter and clearer.  There is a little stinging when I first apply it but that soon disapates.</li>
            <li> I bought this because I&#x27;m peri-menopausal and Christiane Northrup&#x27;s book suggested it.  Meh. No results whatsoever.  I like Neutrogena&#x27;s Retinol Night cream.  I can feel/see it work.</li>
            <li> My skin looks so much better. I&#x27;ve been using this for several weeks but could notice a difference in just a few days. I will definitely reorder this and have recommended it to others.</li>
            <li> I love, love, love, this product! I have used it for years and it  is the best at sloughing off old skin and bringing in new cells.After continued use, you will find your skin glows with a healthy youthful shine. I can&#x27;t be without it!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in LOVE with the entire line of Alpha Hyrox!  Wonderful stuff.  Works fantastic!  I started using years ago... Then stopped for about 8 years, trying other products.  Then I went back to this, and started getting compliments on my face, being mistaken for my 24 year old son&#x27;s Wife! No joke!  (I am 46). Once my son was asked if I were his Sister!  I will never stop using the product line unless they discontinue it, which I doubt they will!  Can&#x27;t say enough great things about it.  I tell everyone about it!  And for the price, it is unbelievable and unbeatable stuff!  SERIOUSLY👍👍😍😍</li>
            <li> Love this products, work wonders on my skin. Really affordable, fast shipping!!</li>
            <li> After a patch test, I put it on my whole face last night for the first time. I woke up with fewer wrinkles than when I went to bed. No kidding. There was truly a visible difference. I also had one small blemish starting, but I can sure live with that.</li>
            <li> Have used this product for years.  It&#x27;s the best over-the-counter Alpha-Hydroxy product I have found.</li>
            <li> I love Alpha Hydrox products, I use this each night and wake up to smooth even toned skin, it does leave a bit of a &#x27;burning-tingling sensation&#x27; the first 5 minutes after applying.</li>
            <li> Just so so for me. I purchased this off of the great reviews and I use the other Alpha Hydrox products with great results. This one was just not worth the extra $ for me. I will not be purchasing this again. I do love the other Alpha Hydrox products and use them daily.  This one just did not make a huge difference to justify the price.</li>
            <li> Not as good as Nerium, but works in a pinch.</li>
            <li> OK&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;EACH AM THE WRINKLES ARE GONE!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;used over 2 weeks now and Verses the Over $120 cream I was using by Obagi med grade... I stopped that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Been  using this 2 wks now and im blown AWAY!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I even went back bought another AND the NIGHT TIME RECSCUE product one by AHA too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These fade discoloration and plump out any acne scars and DEEP or light wrinkles leaving smooth canvas face and moisturized too!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Results last so far. BETTER WITH EACH USE!&lt;br /&gt;MOST INCREDIBLE...is my DEEP 2 FOREHEAD Wrinkles I always needed BOTOX FOR, but haven&#x27;t got it done in 2 yrs,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; THOSE WRINKLES R GONE BY AM!....and as day goes on they Dont RETURN TO THE DEPTH they were  BEFORE USING AHA cream!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I ALSO USE SMOOTHIES CLEAR STRIPs on forehead at night,  to plump Wrinkles out much better  than Frownies!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CELEBS BEST KEPT SECRET R THESE Smoothies!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;THE  SMOOTHIES  r sticky sided strips in varied shapes to plump out wrinkles AND STOP MUSCLE FROM being used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I JUST RREORDERED  TONS OF  them and They ARE  INCREDIBLE RESULTS ON Crows FEET and FORHEAD LINEs. or any wrinkle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Simply PLace sticky sided strip onto wrinkle, if deep wrinkle slightly pull skin up to allow strip to stick in to wrinkled area .. and apply then let go of lightly held skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BUT,  NEVER harshly pull back skin if wrinkles are deep because THESE WORK on their OWN in their way, so don&#x27;t damage ur skin by pulling taut to try to first smooth wrinkle prior to laying strip on it, sleep in over night . Strips will do the Job !&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Strips are invisible and I answer door w them on no one knows or says they see it, LOL&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;By AM your skin along with AHA SOUFLEE and night AHA RESCUE AHA cream REALLY works wonder around the OBAGI MEDICAL GRADE creams I bought and have 2/3 left of for over $100 bucks each verses AHA at $15 bucks or so.</li>
            <li> I used this before and it should sting a little.when I purchased this and used it ,it had no noticeable effect.seller refused to refund. you must request a refund within seven days.so that&#x27;s my loss.</li>
            <li> This is the best nighttime skin care product I&#x27;ve ever used. It has a wonderful texture and has really made a difference in my skin.</li>
            <li> Great product amount for the price!</li>
            <li> this is my third order and I keep on increasing the glycolic acid. I would recommend this product</li>
            <li> I have been using Alpha Hydrox products for about a year and a half (maybe two years?) and I am hooked.  It didn&#x27;t happen overnight but I found that over time (and with consistent use) my skin has improved a lot.  Whereas I used to use a full-blown foundation (and wouldn&#x27;t be seen without makeup) I now just use a little BB cream and some powder and I&#x27;m good to go.  I use the glycolic for day and the night &amp;#34;rescue&amp;#34; at night.  I will continue to use these products and would recommend them to anyone.  Also, I especially like the price - totally affordable!  :)</li>
            <li> Love this stuff, but I really liked the jar packaging better. Now I have to cut the tube open when it stops dispensing to get at the 15% of the product that won&#x27;t squeeze out.</li>
            <li> This stuff is awesome.  I&#x27;ve used it for over a year now and I&#x27;m completely satisfied. I use it at night on my face, neck, chest and the back of my hands.  Bye-bye to the ridiculous department store rip offs which weren&#x27;t half this good. The price is great and it&#x27;s a lot of product for the price.  All I use besides this AHA Souffle  is a daytime serum and an under eye cream.  If you&#x27;re interested, I use Arbonne RE 9 Advanced Intensive Renewal Serum, and CSI Recovery Eye Cream with Arnica and Vitamin K.  I&#x27;m not affiliated with any of these products, I just personally think they are awesome and my skin looks great.</li>
            <li> Our local pharmacy ceased carrying a similar product  I knew AHA worked great for my skin, but couldn&#x27;t find it over-the-counter, so I tried other in-store brands, which resulted in horrible breakouts. I&#x27;m so glad I could order this online.  I use both the toner and the cream.  Delivery was fast and my skin has cleared again. Yay!  My daughter noticed and now she&#x27;s using it too!</li>
            <li> This is amazing for your face, one of the best alawys put it on in the nighttime for my regime this+ indian healing clay mask is just amazing.</li>
            <li> absolutely as advertised. Every bit as good as the RX for Brown skin I had been using for 4x the cost!</li>
            <li> Beauty staple - keeps my skin clear and I reorder this stuff constantly. I wear it under vitamin C and moisturizer.</li>
            <li> A nice moisturizer, I prefer the overnight cream for strength, but this will keep your face from drying out. Thanks~+~</li>
            <li> Not too thin, not too thick.  A good product, and a little goes a long way.  My skin is consistently more clear and even-toned after using these products, and I like that this 12% souffle is not greasy, yet not drying.  I only use it at night, and then put a little moisturizer over it.  If I go awhile and don&#x27;t use it, it can sting a little, so just be aware of that and perhaps use slightly less.  I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Amazing for the price! I haven&#x27;t met an expensive night cream that makes my skin as clear and radiant as this. I&#x27;d recommend using only at night and rubbing in a small amount of this and topping it with your usual cream or oil, especially if you have dry skin, as this cream alone might not be moisturizing enough. I tend to treat it like a serum. Very potent stuff, noticed a difference after the first use.</li>
            <li> I am a skin care junkie.  I am a 42 year old, landscaper and old sun worshiper.  I was recently told by my dermatologist I have the beginning stages of sun damage around my hair line.  I was prescribed prescription strength Retin-A but I did some research and came across the Alpha Hydrox products.  I have been using the Souffle and Intensive Serum for over a  little over a month and the changes to my skin are incredible.  My skin is very soft.  The redness has almost completely faded and the little fine lines around my eyes are gone.  My neck showed improvement within a week of using both products.  I use the Souffle everyday and the serum every other day at night.  I truly never expected them to work.  I have tried everything out there and nothing has worked like this.  Just make sure to wear your sunscreen because these products are strong and they need to be paired with sun protection.  Absolutely one of the best products I have ever used.</li>
