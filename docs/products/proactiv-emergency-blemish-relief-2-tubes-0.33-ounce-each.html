            <li>Best product out there for flare ups!</li>
            <li>try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I know that benzoyl peroxide is my best bet for getting (and keeping)</li>
            <li>It is an excellent cleaner as well.</li>
            <li>I was really impressed that this did in fact work quite well.  </li>
            <li>In my mind, Proactiv is the number one name in acne control, so this has to be the best &amp;#34;emergency relief&amp;#34; that is on the market?!  </li>
            <li>Best of all, it works!</li>
            <li>Proactiv is reputed to be among the best acne treatments, and this did not disappoint.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>was watching Dr.  OZ  about anti aging of skin, he recommended  C Serum  and a good hydration through a skin moisturizer and lots of water  and to my horror  NO SALT!  </li>
            <li>YOU HAVE TO WORK  at beauty, knowledge, being happy....</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m happy to report:</li>
            <li>and I both tried these and both had great results.</li>
            <li>This cream works great on removing and preventing lots of skin blemish problems.</li>
            <li>Great product.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Knowing it takes a lot of work for a good complexion...and hearing my mums voice...</li>
            <li>Good ol&#x27; benzoyl peroxide does the trick in the Proactiv formula.  </li>
            <li>They ARE good, so make your own decision.  </li>
            <li>This product was very effective for me:)</li>
            <li>This is  a wonderful product, I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li>It is as effective as any benzoyl peroxide treatment.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;d not ever spend this kind of money for it.</li>
            <li>A family member tried this and stated: &amp;#34;“I get pimples very easily.</li>
            <li>So far, very nice!”</li>
            <li>A healthy and productive Granny Gal.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>That magic hasn&#x27;t been invented yet.</li>
            <li>This may actually be the perfect balance, and my skin appears to be clearing up.</li>
            <li>So, I chose to review this blemish control treatment to get an idea if these famous products do, in fact, work.</li>
            <li>Love this product.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t seem to be miraculous or make them magically disappear, but it does provide some relief to those pesky pimples that pop up out of no where.  </li>
            <li>you&#x27;ll get a lot more product and pay whatever</li>
            <li>Love Proactiv.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve been impressed with most of them (which is what brings me back again and again).</li>
            <li>A staple for me from now on for sure.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t get as many as I used to</li>
            <li>So in my mind, it is just ok</li>
            <li>They just AREN&#x27;T magic.</li>
            <li>But I was so happy with how well this has worked and will continue to use if I have any new breakouts.</li>
            <li>Works very quickly.  </li>
            <li>Easy to use for travel.  </li>
            <li>Proactiv advertises itself as something incredible for treating acne, better than other OTC products.  </li>
            <li>Applying just a tiny drop to the oncoming blemish does the trick, using this beautifully formulated BP 5% treatment</li>
            <li>If it works for you, fine, but I will stick with the OTC or Rx products from my doctor.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t expect magic, but it does seem to work quickly.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think that option is available yet, but if price is an issue, go in with a friend and split the pack.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think that option is available yet, but if price is an issue, go in with a friend and split the pack.</li>
            <li>I received it as a free gift from Proactiv</li>
            <li>/&gt;This is a great addition to your facial arsenal.  </li>
            <li>The cream is very light-weight without a scent of any kind</li>
            <li>If price is not an issue, then it&#x27;s a great solution for instant help for blemishes.</li>
            <li>I hadn’t tried any of the Proactive products before, but I had heard good things about the products themselves (though I have been warned to never buy direct from Proactive)</li>
            <li>Having grown up on the lucky side of a good genetic face complexion I was distressed that old age had come with a vengeance.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The cream was for a friend of mine that lost their original tubes while on vacation.</li>
            <li>Excellent for small blemishes.  </li>
            <li>I suspect that with consistent use for more than just two weeks, I will continue to acquire more positive results.</li>
            <li>The smell is a clean soap smell and when I washed my face afterwards, it didn&#x27;t feel slimy or crusty like the Origins</li>
            <li>What I was most impressed with is the inactive ingredients blended with the BP to make it fast absorbing and somewhat moisturizing for a product, that in essence, is supposed to dry out your skin.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The scent is light and fresh, application is easy and invisible, and the product washes right off your fingers.</li>
            <li>, one could compare the price of TWO tubes to a drugstore product and complain, but if you&#x27;re more interested in something that works, this is worth the price.</li>
            <li>, one could compare the price of TWO tubes to a drugstore product and complain, but if you&#x27;re more interested in something that works, this is worth the price.</li>
            <li>One of the best things about this is that it is very gel like, keeping it on the affected area rather than running down my face.  </li>
            <li>This is important because who wants to draw more attention to their problem skin and blemishes right?</li>
            <li>In honesty, I have to say that the Proactiv+Emergency Blemish Relief is better than some, not as good as others (I really love the clay mask) but more expensive than anything.</li>
            <li>This is a great product - the peroxide strength (5%) is strong enough to stop acne from further developing when applied as soon as a pimple begins to develop, but it&#x27;s not so strong that it dries out my skin.</li>
            <li>But this works in the best way that&#x27;s currently possible, considering the overall health your skin needs.</li>
            <li>Works quickly for him.</li>
            <li>I was amazed with how quickly it worked.</li>
            <li>I was able to test this Proactiv Emergency Blemish Relief on 3 different sized pimples and for the most part, I saw results after about 24 hours.</li>
            <li>It appears mild on the skin and smells</li>
            <li>will get the red out of the pimple overnight in most cases, and then a bit of makeup covers the bump just fine.</li>
            <li>so I thought it was definitely worth a</li>
            <li>Is it worth that price?  </li>
            <li>Regardless, if it works, then it&#x27;s worth it to me.</li>
            <li>OK, so far we&#x27;ve had this for about 5 days.  </li>
            <li>Thus, I have tried all sorts of acne solutions, with varying degrees of success.</li>
            <li>The oily sheen on my skin disappeared within an hour or so and the redness lessened pretty quickly as well.</li>
            <li>Overnight, things weren&#x27;t 100% cleared up, but they were headed in the right direction.</li>
            <li>Right.</li>
            <li>Right after this product shipped</li>
            <li>But it is easy to find benzoyl peroxide acne creams over the counter at up to 10% strength where I live, both at pharmacies and mass retailers.  </li>
            <li>Of course, some people are willing to pay any price for clear skin but still, this seems to cost more than it should.</li>
            <li>I love Proactiv in general</li>
            <li>I am pleasantly surprised to say that they hype about this product is actually true!</li>
            <li>my skin clear and this product is a strong dose (5%).  </li>
            <li>This isn’t actually unusual; many acne treatment products cause this, so it wasn’t unexpected and I have ways of dealing with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It doesn’t work quickly enough on the real problem blemishes to warrant spending that kind of money on it.</li>
            <li>It does have a light feel to it instead of heavy or creamy, which is nice.  </li>
            <li>I can honestly say that it doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin.</li>
            <li>I would notice dryness as my skin can get quite dry on its own.</li>
            <li>(I have normal to dry skin with acne fairly under control)</li>
            <li>Just put a little bit on, rub it on your washed face, and your good to go.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve found that the weakness of the type of Benzoyl Peroxide in other products I&#x27;ve tried requires too many and too imprecise applications to even begin to make a significant difference (as opposed to leaving it untreated)</li>
            <li>now I think she is going to hide it from me ;)</li>
            <li>I would say that it did help improve the raised area enough to cover with makeup, which made it look better than before she applied, but it does not make the acne go</li>
            <li>Their regular treatment product that comes in their sets works much better (and it&#x27;s not considered a spot or emergency treatment).</li>
            <li>It reduced the size of the pimple and made the pimple come to a head within 24 hours of my first application.</li>
            <li>I still occasionally get breakouts and this is the perfect solution for someone like me who doesn&#x27;t need a daily all-over face cream but just a spot treatment when those sudden breakouts happen.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not sure how the process works, but it seems that the high-grade concentration and micro-crystal format of the Benzoyl Peroxide makes the delivery far more effective.</li>
            <li>particular component is really worth the money.  </li>
            <li>For the price point I was expecting pretty fast results</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am in my early 30&#x27;s and rarely get many zits, when I do it is only one or two</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m still not 100% convinced, mostly because I haven&#x27;t been using this product long, but I think it certainly helped with the problem.</li>
            <li>When that happens, I want something that will not just clear it up, but will do it quickly.  </li>
            <li>never ends for something you can easily pick up at the local drug store.  </li>
            <li>This works well to clear up spot acne fairly quickly and painlessly.  </li>
            <li>suppose double dose means it is twice as strong as 2.5%, which I can agree with, since 2.5 * 2 &#x3D; 5.  </li>
            <li>The change in season certainly has brought about a few more than usual and this has been a welcome addition to my medicine cabinet.  </li>
            <li>They are looking quite more youthful and sleek and the product smelled better and was smoother and less like Elmer&#x27;s Glue globbed on your face with a wooden paddle.  </li>
            <li>These little tubes are the perfect size to stuff into your travel bag, and the product requires just a little bit to do its job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Overall, the product works, the substance fine, the cost prohibitive.</li>
            <li>As others have said, they are a little on the pricier side compared to what you can pick up at a drug store, that may be equally effective.</li>
            <li>/&gt;This is where a handy little tube of BP or Salicylic Acid can really work wonders.</li>
            <li>In about three days, it gently dries it out without overdrying the skin.</li>
            <li>And I would LOVE to pay them the $65 they really want even though they kept charging a defunct credit card and sending me boxes of products I didn&#x27;t want and are still sealed in their lovely seventies looking green and white packaging.  </li>
            <li>I thought that I might not get as much product as I&#x27;d like because of this</li>
            <li>and I know there are people that swear by Proactiv and some, not so much.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s gentle on the skin</li>
            <li>It takes a good 24 hours of applying the cream at least 2 times a day on blemishes for it to really work.</li>
            <li>And with Rosacea, as well as hormones, there can often be the most annoying blemishes, completely unrelated to age or generally excellent skin care.</li>
            <li>However, considering their great reputation for effectiveness, I was seriously interested in trying this spot treatment product for my occasional but regular single zit issue--happening these days more frequently than the monthly of my younger</li>
            <li>any blemishes we had shrunk right up and the redness was almost completely gone within 24 hours.</li>
            <li>They cleared up really quickly (within a couple of days at the most), but I was left with dry, peeling skin.  </li>
            <li>After day 1, two of the smaller blemishes showed a significant amount of dryness, so I could tell it was working.</li>
            <li>I was happy to see it isn&#x27;t loaded down with natural herbs and creams, since I get hives from several of those.  </li>
            <li>I was lucky (or rather unlucky) to start to get a rather large one above my eyebrow.</li>
            <li>Proactiv+Emergency Blemish Relief was actually first recommended to me by a sixteen year old in my family.</li>
            <li>so that a tiny swab of much-maligned alcohol does a better job of instantly drying out the zit before you&#x27;re tempted to pop</li>
            <li>Ok for on the spot treatment, because the tubes are pretty small.  </li>
            <li>I swear, it seems like the older</li>
            <li>It was one of those ones that get red quickly and swell a portion surrounding it on my forehead.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>He raved to me about how it &amp;#34;works really good&amp;#34;, which coming from a 15 year old boy is high praise indeed!  </li>
            <li>main concern with this product isn&#x27;t its effectiveness or attributes...</li>
            <li>I have used everything on the drug store shelf to take care of skin \\&quot;emergencies.\\&quot;  As much as I would like to tell you that this is worth every single penny, I&#x27;m really not that sure.</li>
            <li>held back two stars because I can&#x27;t see that this is anything more than two small (&amp;#60; 5ml) drugstore size tubes of BP 5%, dressed up in Proactiv packaging and marketing at a huge markup.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s true that his skin is already starting to clear up, so really I would recommend this for any age group.  </li>
            <li>and their company is little more than a billing scheme that once started</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried just about every single kind of spot treatment medication--and not just drugstore brands (foolishly, since most beauty brands&#x27; blemish treatments are really no more powerful even if a little kinder)--and really, nothing works.</li>
            <li>I also appreciated that it goes on clear and remains unnoticeable after applied.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I found however for acne that is more like a small cyst, this product really doesn&#x27;t have the power to eradicate the acne.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;However, I found that the product just didn’t work as well on the big monster blemishes (which I conveniently developed just in time to use this product on – lucky me).  </li>
            <li>Luckily( or unluckily) for me, I had a few blemishes I could test this product on right away.</li>
            <li>To the rescue I whipped out the newly received bottle of &amp;#34;Proactive+ Emergency Blemish Relief&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li>The problem with all of them, however, is that they are all irritable in some way, and at times they can cause new breakouts just from that irritation.</li>
            <li>But if you&#x27;re wanting to treat more intense acne, this is a terrific way to save a little money and get the amount of product you need.it out without overdrying the skin.</li>
            <li>But if you&#x27;re wanting to treat more intense acne, this is a terrific way to save a little money and get the amount of product you need.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Others are talking about drugstore products having higher percentages of Benzoyl Peroxide, but the key here is the quality and delivery.</li>
            <li>used it during the first sign of acne and the next morning, disaster was averted and I had no signs of breakouts.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Apply a small amount to the pimple and for most cases</li>
            <li>Perhaps if you have really sensitive skin, the 10 percent may seem too strong, but even when my daughter used the stronger one the first time, she had a slight bit of peeling for only one day, then no problem.  </li>
            <li>have not had any issues with excessive drying, and it does appear to work pretty quickly.</li>
            <li>Wow, I like this product.  </li>
            <li>It works really well similar to a mask product.</li>
            <li>As an adult in my thirties, I still get some pimples.</li>
            <li>Unfortunately I did not have a good experience with this product.  </li>
            <li>We seem to have a winner with Proactive, however based on the price, I would expect no less.  </li>
            <li>Sometimes with other products I&#x27;ve had trouble with it leaving my skin dried out to the point of peeling but neither of us has experienced any issues with this.</li>
            <li>/&gt;This is where Proactiv&#x27;s new product is different.</li>
            <li>While I can&#x27;t compare it to other products, this did exactly as advertised.&lt;br</li>
            <li>so I don&#x27;t have a major problem.  </li>
            <li>I generally dislike Proactiv.  </li>
            <li>was the skin and complexion of a 40 year old and in July I turn the big 70!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have applied it once every day for two weeks now and have barely had to think about it.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Three days later and the blemishes are nearly all gone.</li>
            <li>If you don&#x27;t like the mess of clay along with the awful smell of tea tree oil, the best scientific conclusion is that Proactiv wins!</li>
            <li>I get the more my skin changes for the worse.</li>
            <li>You can get a bottle of an equally useful topical for 90% less than this product&#x27;s unit price.</li>
            <li>The major product I can compare this to is Origins Spot Treatment which has Salicylic Acid as the active ingredient and comparatively speaking, this product worked very well with 5% benzoyl peroxide.  </li>
            <li>He&#x27;s tried other over-the-counter creams from the stores without much luck, but after trying this he&#x27;s sold.  </li>
            <li>After that, the pimple healed quickly and now not even a week later, I only have a slight red spot where the zit was.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When</li>
            <li>There&#x27;s very little product in these 2 tiny tubes and at nearly $50, that seems pretty unreasonable.</li>
            <li>two pack is $45.95 on Amazon right now – a two pack of really small tubes (.33 of an ounce each).  </li>
            <li>but luckily that isn&#x27;t an issue in the least.</li>
            <li>, it clears it in a day or two, unless heavily cystic or large.  </li>
    </ol>

            <li> That magic hasn&#x27;t been invented yet.</li>
            <li> This may actually be the perfect balance, and my skin appears to be clearing up.</li>
            <li> So, I chose to review this blemish control treatment to get an idea if these famous products do, in fact, work.</li>
            <li> Love this product.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t seem to be miraculous or make them magically disappear, but it does provide some relief to those pesky pimples that pop up out of no where.  </li>
            <li> you&#x27;ll get a lot more product and pay whatever</li>
            <li> Love Proactiv.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve been impressed with most of them (which is what brings me back again and again).</li>
            <li> A staple for me from now on for sure.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t get as many as I used to</li>
            <li> So in my mind, it is just ok</li>
            <li> They just AREN&#x27;T magic.</li>
            <li> But I was so happy with how well this has worked and will continue to use if I have any new breakouts.</li>
            <li> Works very quickly.  </li>
            <li> Easy to use for travel.  </li>
            <li> Proactiv advertises itself as something incredible for treating acne, better than other OTC products.  </li>
            <li> Applying just a tiny drop to the oncoming blemish does the trick, using this beautifully formulated BP 5% treatment</li>
            <li> If it works for you, fine, but I will stick with the OTC or Rx products from my doctor.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t expect magic, but it does seem to work quickly.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think that option is available yet, but if price is an issue, go in with a friend and split the pack.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think that option is available yet, but if price is an issue, go in with a friend and split the pack.</li>
            <li> I received it as a free gift from Proactiv</li>
            <li> /&gt;This is a great addition to your facial arsenal.  </li>
            <li> The cream is very light-weight without a scent of any kind</li>
            <li> If price is not an issue, then it&#x27;s a great solution for instant help for blemishes.</li>
            <li> I hadn’t tried any of the Proactive products before, but I had heard good things about the products themselves (though I have been warned to never buy direct from Proactive)</li>
            <li> Having grown up on the lucky side of a good genetic face complexion I was distressed that old age had come with a vengeance.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The cream was for a friend of mine that lost their original tubes while on vacation.</li>
            <li> Excellent for small blemishes.  </li>
            <li> I suspect that with consistent use for more than just two weeks, I will continue to acquire more positive results.</li>
            <li> The smell is a clean soap smell and when I washed my face afterwards, it didn&#x27;t feel slimy or crusty like the Origins</li>
            <li> What I was most impressed with is the inactive ingredients blended with the BP to make it fast absorbing and somewhat moisturizing for a product, that in essence, is supposed to dry out your skin.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The scent is light and fresh, application is easy and invisible, and the product washes right off your fingers.</li>
            <li> , one could compare the price of TWO tubes to a drugstore product and complain, but if you&#x27;re more interested in something that works, this is worth the price.</li>
            <li> , one could compare the price of TWO tubes to a drugstore product and complain, but if you&#x27;re more interested in something that works, this is worth the price.</li>
            <li> One of the best things about this is that it is very gel like, keeping it on the affected area rather than running down my face.  </li>
            <li> This is important because who wants to draw more attention to their problem skin and blemishes right?</li>
            <li> In honesty, I have to say that the Proactiv+Emergency Blemish Relief is better than some, not as good as others (I really love the clay mask) but more expensive than anything.</li>
            <li> This is a great product - the peroxide strength (5%) is strong enough to stop acne from further developing when applied as soon as a pimple begins to develop, but it&#x27;s not so strong that it dries out my skin.</li>
            <li> But this works in the best way that&#x27;s currently possible, considering the overall health your skin needs.</li>
            <li> Works quickly for him.</li>
            <li> I was amazed with how quickly it worked.</li>
            <li> I was able to test this Proactiv Emergency Blemish Relief on 3 different sized pimples and for the most part, I saw results after about 24 hours.</li>
            <li> It appears mild on the skin and smells</li>
            <li> will get the red out of the pimple overnight in most cases, and then a bit of makeup covers the bump just fine.</li>
            <li> so I thought it was definitely worth a</li>
            <li> Is it worth that price?  </li>
            <li> Regardless, if it works, then it&#x27;s worth it to me.</li>
            <li> OK, so far we&#x27;ve had this for about 5 days.  </li>
            <li> Thus, I have tried all sorts of acne solutions, with varying degrees of success.</li>
            <li> The oily sheen on my skin disappeared within an hour or so and the redness lessened pretty quickly as well.</li>
            <li> Overnight, things weren&#x27;t 100% cleared up, but they were headed in the right direction.</li>
            <li> Right.</li>
            <li> Right after this product shipped</li>
            <li> But it is easy to find benzoyl peroxide acne creams over the counter at up to 10% strength where I live, both at pharmacies and mass retailers.  </li>
            <li> Of course, some people are willing to pay any price for clear skin but still, this seems to cost more than it should.</li>
            <li> I love Proactiv in general</li>
            <li> I am pleasantly surprised to say that they hype about this product is actually true!</li>
            <li> my skin clear and this product is a strong dose (5%).  </li>
            <li> This isn’t actually unusual; many acne treatment products cause this, so it wasn’t unexpected and I have ways of dealing with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It doesn’t work quickly enough on the real problem blemishes to warrant spending that kind of money on it.</li>
            <li> It does have a light feel to it instead of heavy or creamy, which is nice.  </li>
            <li> I can honestly say that it doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin.</li>
            <li> I would notice dryness as my skin can get quite dry on its own.</li>
            <li> (I have normal to dry skin with acne fairly under control)</li>
            <li> Just put a little bit on, rub it on your washed face, and your good to go.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve found that the weakness of the type of Benzoyl Peroxide in other products I&#x27;ve tried requires too many and too imprecise applications to even begin to make a significant difference (as opposed to leaving it untreated)</li>
            <li> now I think she is going to hide it from me ;)</li>
            <li> I would say that it did help improve the raised area enough to cover with makeup, which made it look better than before she applied, but it does not make the acne go</li>
            <li> Their regular treatment product that comes in their sets works much better (and it&#x27;s not considered a spot or emergency treatment).</li>
            <li> It reduced the size of the pimple and made the pimple come to a head within 24 hours of my first application.</li>
            <li> I still occasionally get breakouts and this is the perfect solution for someone like me who doesn&#x27;t need a daily all-over face cream but just a spot treatment when those sudden breakouts happen.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure how the process works, but it seems that the high-grade concentration and micro-crystal format of the Benzoyl Peroxide makes the delivery far more effective.</li>
            <li> particular component is really worth the money.  </li>
            <li> For the price point I was expecting pretty fast results</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am in my early 30&#x27;s and rarely get many zits, when I do it is only one or two</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m still not 100% convinced, mostly because I haven&#x27;t been using this product long, but I think it certainly helped with the problem.</li>
            <li> When that happens, I want something that will not just clear it up, but will do it quickly.  </li>
            <li> never ends for something you can easily pick up at the local drug store.  </li>
            <li> This works well to clear up spot acne fairly quickly and painlessly.  </li>
            <li> suppose double dose means it is twice as strong as 2.5%, which I can agree with, since 2.5 * 2 &#x3D; 5.  </li>
            <li> The change in season certainly has brought about a few more than usual and this has been a welcome addition to my medicine cabinet.  </li>
            <li> They are looking quite more youthful and sleek and the product smelled better and was smoother and less like Elmer&#x27;s Glue globbed on your face with a wooden paddle.  </li>
            <li> These little tubes are the perfect size to stuff into your travel bag, and the product requires just a little bit to do its job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Overall, the product works, the substance fine, the cost prohibitive.</li>
            <li> As others have said, they are a little on the pricier side compared to what you can pick up at a drug store, that may be equally effective.</li>
            <li> /&gt;This is where a handy little tube of BP or Salicylic Acid can really work wonders.</li>
            <li> In about three days, it gently dries it out without overdrying the skin.</li>
            <li> And I would LOVE to pay them the $65 they really want even though they kept charging a defunct credit card and sending me boxes of products I didn&#x27;t want and are still sealed in their lovely seventies looking green and white packaging.  </li>
            <li> I thought that I might not get as much product as I&#x27;d like because of this</li>
            <li> and I know there are people that swear by Proactiv and some, not so much.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s gentle on the skin</li>
            <li> It takes a good 24 hours of applying the cream at least 2 times a day on blemishes for it to really work.</li>
            <li> And with Rosacea, as well as hormones, there can often be the most annoying blemishes, completely unrelated to age or generally excellent skin care.</li>
            <li> However, considering their great reputation for effectiveness, I was seriously interested in trying this spot treatment product for my occasional but regular single zit issue--happening these days more frequently than the monthly of my younger</li>
            <li> any blemishes we had shrunk right up and the redness was almost completely gone within 24 hours.</li>
            <li> They cleared up really quickly (within a couple of days at the most), but I was left with dry, peeling skin.  </li>
            <li> After day 1, two of the smaller blemishes showed a significant amount of dryness, so I could tell it was working.</li>
            <li> I was happy to see it isn&#x27;t loaded down with natural herbs and creams, since I get hives from several of those.  </li>
            <li> I was lucky (or rather unlucky) to start to get a rather large one above my eyebrow.</li>
            <li> Proactiv+Emergency Blemish Relief was actually first recommended to me by a sixteen year old in my family.</li>
            <li> so that a tiny swab of much-maligned alcohol does a better job of instantly drying out the zit before you&#x27;re tempted to pop</li>
            <li> Ok for on the spot treatment, because the tubes are pretty small.  </li>
            <li> I swear, it seems like the older</li>
            <li> It was one of those ones that get red quickly and swell a portion surrounding it on my forehead.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> He raved to me about how it &amp;#34;works really good&amp;#34;, which coming from a 15 year old boy is high praise indeed!  </li>
            <li> main concern with this product isn&#x27;t its effectiveness or attributes...</li>
            <li> I have used everything on the drug store shelf to take care of skin \\&quot;emergencies.\\&quot;  As much as I would like to tell you that this is worth every single penny, I&#x27;m really not that sure.</li>
            <li> held back two stars because I can&#x27;t see that this is anything more than two small (&amp;#60; 5ml) drugstore size tubes of BP 5%, dressed up in Proactiv packaging and marketing at a huge markup.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s true that his skin is already starting to clear up, so really I would recommend this for any age group.  </li>
            <li> and their company is little more than a billing scheme that once started</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried just about every single kind of spot treatment medication--and not just drugstore brands (foolishly, since most beauty brands&#x27; blemish treatments are really no more powerful even if a little kinder)--and really, nothing works.</li>
            <li> I also appreciated that it goes on clear and remains unnoticeable after applied.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I found however for acne that is more like a small cyst, this product really doesn&#x27;t have the power to eradicate the acne.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;However, I found that the product just didn’t work as well on the big monster blemishes (which I conveniently developed just in time to use this product on – lucky me).  </li>
            <li> Luckily( or unluckily) for me, I had a few blemishes I could test this product on right away.</li>
            <li> To the rescue I whipped out the newly received bottle of &amp;#34;Proactive+ Emergency Blemish Relief&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li> The problem with all of them, however, is that they are all irritable in some way, and at times they can cause new breakouts just from that irritation.</li>
            <li> But if you&#x27;re wanting to treat more intense acne, this is a terrific way to save a little money and get the amount of product you need.it out without overdrying the skin.</li>
            <li> But if you&#x27;re wanting to treat more intense acne, this is a terrific way to save a little money and get the amount of product you need.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Others are talking about drugstore products having higher percentages of Benzoyl Peroxide, but the key here is the quality and delivery.</li>
            <li> used it during the first sign of acne and the next morning, disaster was averted and I had no signs of breakouts.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Apply a small amount to the pimple and for most cases</li>
            <li> Perhaps if you have really sensitive skin, the 10 percent may seem too strong, but even when my daughter used the stronger one the first time, she had a slight bit of peeling for only one day, then no problem.  </li>
            <li> have not had any issues with excessive drying, and it does appear to work pretty quickly.</li>
            <li> Wow, I like this product.  </li>
            <li> It works really well similar to a mask product.</li>
            <li> As an adult in my thirties, I still get some pimples.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately I did not have a good experience with this product.  </li>
            <li> We seem to have a winner with Proactive, however based on the price, I would expect no less.  </li>
            <li> Sometimes with other products I&#x27;ve had trouble with it leaving my skin dried out to the point of peeling but neither of us has experienced any issues with this.</li>
            <li> /&gt;This is where Proactiv&#x27;s new product is different.</li>
            <li> While I can&#x27;t compare it to other products, this did exactly as advertised.&lt;br</li>
            <li> so I don&#x27;t have a major problem.  </li>
            <li> I generally dislike Proactiv.  </li>
            <li> was the skin and complexion of a 40 year old and in July I turn the big 70!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have applied it once every day for two weeks now and have barely had to think about it.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Three days later and the blemishes are nearly all gone.</li>
            <li> If you don&#x27;t like the mess of clay along with the awful smell of tea tree oil, the best scientific conclusion is that Proactiv wins!</li>
            <li> I get the more my skin changes for the worse.</li>
            <li> You can get a bottle of an equally useful topical for 90% less than this product&#x27;s unit price.</li>
            <li> The major product I can compare this to is Origins Spot Treatment which has Salicylic Acid as the active ingredient and comparatively speaking, this product worked very well with 5% benzoyl peroxide.  </li>
            <li> He&#x27;s tried other over-the-counter creams from the stores without much luck, but after trying this he&#x27;s sold.  </li>
            <li> After that, the pimple healed quickly and now not even a week later, I only have a slight red spot where the zit was.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s very little product in these 2 tiny tubes and at nearly $50, that seems pretty unreasonable.</li>
            <li> two pack is $45.95 on Amazon right now – a two pack of really small tubes (.33 of an ounce each).  </li>
            <li> but luckily that isn&#x27;t an issue in the least.</li>
            <li> , it clears it in a day or two, unless heavily cystic or large.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a waiting game, but from what I&#x27;ve seen so far, I&#x27;m willing to continue trying this out.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re like me and aren&#x27;t going to use this daily, I&#x27;d say a single tube will last you quite a while.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re like me and aren&#x27;t going to use this daily, I&#x27;d say a single tube will last you quite a while.</li>
            <li> I keep apply and it looks the same and takes just as long to go away</li>
            <li> However, I see this product as a sea change from the old green and white look of paste smelling creams.  </li>
            <li> and it took just a few seconds to completely dissolve on my skin.</li>
            <li> I think it actually caused my blemishes to come to a &amp;#34;head&amp;#34; and it actually caused an odd discoloration along my lower chin after one use.  </li>
            <li> This blemish relief helped dry out the pimples without drying out my face.</li>
            <li> It does dry up the skin where you apply it, so consider using some lotion in addition to using this.</li>
            <li> These are small tubes, but will likely last a long time for spot treatment.</li>
            <li> And for beginning or minor blemishes, give it about a day and a half, so long as you apply it morning and night before your moisturizer (and let it completely dry, which doesn&#x27;t take too long tho not immediate).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> And for beginning or minor blemishes, give it about a day and a half, so long as you apply it morning and night before your moisturizer (and let it completely dry, which doesn&#x27;t take too long tho not immediate).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It certainly hasn&#x27;t made my face worse</li>
            <li> Preferably with as little irritation as possible.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;d never tried any of Proactiv&#x27;s ubiquitous products before as they&#x27;ve long branded themselves as the one-stop company that sells complete skincare systems for those who suffer from serious acne.</li>
            <li> I use a light application of 10% glycolic acid cream for this type of acne and the blind pimple is usually gone in 3-4 days.</li>
            <li> I may still look gaunt due to a lot of weight lost but,</li>
            <li> In between all the other treatments, I decided to give this yet another chance since she continually raves about it.</li>
            <li> I have tried other 5% BP products although I cannot recall the names of them, but didn&#x27;t care for the flaking, smell, or texture.  </li>
            <li> I usually use Glytone, which is expensive as well, but has 10% benzoyl peroxide and the tube is huge in comparison and it has less ingredients.  </li>
            <li> I have combination skin, and those of you who do, too, know that drying can make things worse as just a little too much can tip your oil glands into overproduction.</li>
            <li> After a sizer  and on the road to recover, after such a long year or so needed to recover my complexion discolorations, patches of very dry skin and generally poor appearance.  </li>
            <li> However, w/ a multitude of other options and brands in store shelves for half the price, this product seems way over priced.</li>
            <li> Definitely not worth the money.</li>
            <li> Though my pimples have not completely vanished, they are extremely well contained and hardly noticeable, and my skin is not irritated by the substance at all.</li>
            <li> I have had a small bump on my cheek for years, thinking it might be a small damaged area of scare tissue, but some times it smaller than other times.  </li>
            <li> and I recommend it for sensitive skin and small blemishes however if you occasionally get cystic acne (I always called this type of acne a blind pimple because it never comes to a head)</li>
            <li> and we saw a slight improvement.  </li>
            <li> It also doesn&#x27;t have an overpowering alcohol or medicine smell, thought with anything like this there is a slight odor.  </li>
            <li> I also gave a tube of it to my teenage nephew who has had a serious problem with acne.  </li>
            <li> While it is a bit expensive you do get two tubes and a little of this goes a long way, so you will not have to be buying it on the regular.  </li>
            <li> dark circles Gone!,</li>
            <li> consistency of the cream itself is a little runny which I thought would be a problem.</li>
            <li> I have tried various products to nuke my acne, but they are either too weak or too harsh.  </li>
            <li> My reasoning is that I can buy much less expensive Benzoyl Peroxide products that are stronger (10 percent Benzoyl Peroxide vs this product&#x27;s 5 percent) that will do the same job quicker and for less money.  </li>
            <li> which is probably going to be less than $45!</li>
            <li> Maybe they keep your zit from getting worse, but the way they deliver the goods is usually pretty lame, because the drying aspect is a double-edged sword.</li>

            <li> Best product out there for flare ups!</li>
            <li> Arrived in the afternoon and that evening preparing for the night routine, I used this Proactive - Emergency relief treatment.  I have had a small bump on my cheek for years, thinking it might be a small damaged area of scare tissue, but some times it smaller than other times.  After a sizer  and on the road to recover, after such a long year or so needed to recover my complexion discolorations, patches of very dry skin and generally poor appearance.  Having grown up on the lucky side of a good genetic face complexion I was distressed that old age had come with a vengeance.&lt;br /&gt;Knowing it takes a lot of work for a good complexion...and hearing my mums voice...YOU HAVE TO WORK  at beauty, knowledge, being happy....anything really you want bad enough.&lt;br /&gt;I was watching Dr.  OZ  about anti aging of skin, he recommended  C Serum  and a good hydration through a skin moisturizer and lots of water  and to my horror  NO SALT!  Armed with my hubby&#x27;s purse and with the help of Amazon and their door too door service.  I ordered what was needed...6 months later ....dark circles Gone!, Bags under eyes Gone, Slack skin  Gone,  Coloration  Gone, Looking back at me was the skin and complexion of a 40 year old and in July I turn the big 70!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Amazing.&lt;br /&gt;  I still have a bump on my cheek but with the help of a Derma Wand the radio wave treatment for home, the bump is getting smaller and smaller.  I may still look gaunt due to a lot of weight lost but,but, by December i WILL BE  off Steroids.  A healthy and productive Granny Gal.&lt;br /&gt;I will still have Lupus  but this Proactive Blemish Relief will be helping with that bump on my cheek.</li>
            <li> I already have cleanser and moisturizing regimen that works.  But no matter how careful you are with your skin care, an unexpected zit will pop up from time to time…usually just in time for a big event or date. When that happens, I want something that will not just clear it up, but will do it quickly.  Preferably with as little irritation as possible.  I hadn’t tried any of the Proactive products before, but I had heard good things about the products themselves (though I have been warned to never buy direct from Proactive) so I thought it was definitely worth a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I know that benzoyl peroxide is my best bet for getting (and keeping) my skin clear and this product is a strong dose (5%).  I used it for several days in a row on a couple of tiny spots.  They cleared up really quickly (within a couple of days at the most), but I was left with dry, peeling skin.  This isn’t actually unusual; many acne treatment products cause this, so it wasn’t unexpected and I have ways of dealing with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, I found that the product just didn’t work as well on the big monster blemishes (which I conveniently developed just in time to use this product on – lucky me).  You know the ones: the painful, hard, obnoxious ones you get once in a while (especially during hormonal changes).  Even in concert with my benzoyl peroxide cleanser, it still took almost a week before that one cleared up sufficiently.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A two pack is $45.95 on Amazon right now – a two pack of really small tubes (.33 of an ounce each).  Is it worth that price?  I don’t think so.  It does work, but it’s not a miracle product.  It doesn’t work quickly enough on the real problem blemishes to warrant spending that kind of money on it. That’s why it’s only getting three stars from me.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d never tried any of Proactiv&#x27;s ubiquitous products before as they&#x27;ve long branded themselves as the one-stop company that sells complete skincare systems for those who suffer from serious acne. However, considering their great reputation for effectiveness, I was seriously interested in trying this spot treatment product for my occasional but regular single zit issue--happening these days more frequently than the monthly of my younger adulthood.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Others are talking about drugstore products having higher percentages of Benzoyl Peroxide, but the key here is the quality and delivery. I&#x27;ve tried just about every single kind of spot treatment medication--and not just drugstore brands (foolishly, since most beauty brands&#x27; blemish treatments are really no more powerful even if a little kinder)--and really, nothing works. Maybe they keep your zit from getting worse, but the way they deliver the goods is usually pretty lame, because the drying aspect is a double-edged sword. I have combination skin, and those of you who do, too, know that drying can make things worse as just a little too much can tip your oil glands into overproduction. I&#x27;ve found that the weakness of the type of Benzoyl Peroxide in other products I&#x27;ve tried requires too many and too imprecise applications to even begin to make a significant difference (as opposed to leaving it untreated) so that a tiny swab of much-maligned alcohol does a better job of instantly drying out the zit before you&#x27;re tempted to pop it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is where Proactiv&#x27;s new product is different. I&#x27;m not sure how the process works, but it seems that the high-grade concentration and micro-crystal format of the Benzoyl Peroxide makes the delivery far more effective. This will not work overnight for a full-blown blemish, but what product does? That magic hasn&#x27;t been invented yet. But this works in the best way that&#x27;s currently possible, considering the overall health your skin needs. In about three days, it gently dries it out without overdrying the skin. And for beginning or minor blemishes, give it about a day and a half, so long as you apply it morning and night before your moisturizer (and let it completely dry, which doesn&#x27;t take too long tho not immediate).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thus, one could compare the price of TWO tubes to a drugstore product and complain, but if you&#x27;re more interested in something that works, this is worth the price. If you&#x27;re like me and aren&#x27;t going to use this daily, I&#x27;d say a single tube will last you quite a while. I don&#x27;t think that option is available yet, but if price is an issue, go in with a friend and split the pack. But if you&#x27;re wanting to treat more intense acne, this is a terrific way to save a little money and get the amount of product you need.it out without overdrying the skin.

            <li> My daughter uses Proactive, and does like the line of products.  However, I don&#x27;t think this is particular component is really worth the money.  My reasoning is that I can buy much less expensive Benzoyl Peroxide products that are stronger (10 percent Benzoyl Peroxide vs this product&#x27;s 5 percent) that will do the same job quicker and for less money.  Perhaps if you have really sensitive skin, the 10 percent may seem too strong, but even when my daughter used the stronger one the first time, she had a slight bit of peeling for only one day, then no problem.  The other proactive products are already so expensive, we will continue to substitute something else for the emergency blemish relief.  We have found that a dab of toothpaste (not gel, must use paste) will get the red out of the pimple overnight in most cases, and then a bit of makeup covers the bump just fine.</li>
            <li> Over the years (lots of years) I have used everything on the drug store shelf to take care of skin \\&quot;emergencies.\\&quot;  As much as I would like to tell you that this is worth every single penny, I&#x27;m really not that sure. Proactiv+Emergency Blemish Relief was actually first recommended to me by a sixteen year old in my family. (How&#x27;s that for embarrassing moments?) In between all the other treatments, I decided to give this yet another chance since she continually raves about it. So, I alternate between store brand benzoyl peroxide, clay masks infused with tea tree and olive oil, etc, etc and Proactiv. In honesty, I have to say that the Proactiv+Emergency Blemish Relief is better than some, not as good as others (I really love the clay mask) but more expensive than anything. If you don&#x27;t like the mess of clay along with the awful smell of tea tree oil, the best scientific conclusion is that Proactiv wins!</li>
            <li> I generally dislike Proactiv.  I think their product is a joke and their company is little more than a billing scheme that once started never ends for something you can easily pick up at the local drug store.  However, I see this product as a sea change from the old green and white look of paste smelling creams.  They are looking quite more youthful and sleek and the product smelled better and was smoother and less like Elmer&#x27;s Glue globbed on your face with a wooden paddle.  They should stick to this mode of producing their product to attract a younger crowd.  And I would LOVE to pay them the $65 they really want even though they kept charging a defunct credit card and sending me boxes of products I didn&#x27;t want and are still sealed in their lovely seventies looking green and white packaging.  But that is neither here nor there, Proactiv.</li>
            <li> Wow, I like this product.  My skin has been horrible in my 30&#x27;s and 40&#x27;s, especially around my mouth, chin and temples.  I have tried various products to nuke my acne, but they are either too weak or too harsh.  This may actually be the perfect balance, and my skin appears to be clearing up.</li>
            <li> It seems everyone has heard of Proactiv, but I had actually never tried it. So, I chose to review this blemish control treatment to get an idea if these famous products do, in fact, work. I&#x27;m happy to report: They Do!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My daughter, who is 13, and I both tried these and both had great results. By using this twice a day - morning and evening - any blemishes we had shrunk right up and the redness was almost completely gone within 24 hours. I am pleasantly surprised to say that they hype about this product is actually true!</li>
            <li> Works very quickly.  My wife tried it and agreed...now I think she is going to hide it from me ;)</li>
            <li> Unfortunately I did not have a good experience with this product.  I think it actually caused my blemishes to come to a &amp;#34;head&amp;#34; and it actually caused an odd discoloration along my lower chin after one use.  For the price point I was expecting pretty fast results but this product did not work for my skin.  (I have normal to dry skin with acne fairly under control)</li>
            <li> The major product I can compare this to is Origins Spot Treatment which has Salicylic Acid as the active ingredient and comparatively speaking, this product worked very well with 5% benzoyl peroxide.  What I was most impressed with is the inactive ingredients blended with the BP to make it fast absorbing and somewhat moisturizing for a product, that in essence, is supposed to dry out your skin. The smell is a clean soap smell and when I washed my face afterwards, it didn&#x27;t feel slimy or crusty like the Origins tends to be.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used it during the first sign of acne and the next morning, disaster was averted and I had no signs of breakouts.  I have tried other 5% BP products although I cannot recall the names of them, but didn&#x27;t care for the flaking, smell, or texture.  We seem to have a winner with Proactive, however based on the price, I would expect no less.  This is about double the price of even the Origins, never mind over the counter products like Neutrogena.  Regardless, if it works, then it&#x27;s worth it to me.</li>
            <li> Love this product. Shipment well received and on time. Would order product from this seller again.</li>
            <li> OK, so far we&#x27;ve had this for about 5 days.  My daughter gets pop up acne around her temples and sometimes a random one here and there.  When we got it, she was in desperate need for &amp;#34;Emergency Relief&amp;#34;, as she was doing an audition in 2 days.  To the rescue I whipped out the newly received bottle of &amp;#34;Proactive+ Emergency Blemish Relief&amp;#34;.  She washed her face and applied the cream per the instructions, for two days.  Her acne spots are small, so not at all invasive and we saw a slight improvement.  I would say that it did help improve the raised area enough to cover with makeup, which made it look better than before she applied, but it does not make the acne go away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for emergency relief goes?  It doesn&#x27;t seem to be miraculous or make them magically disappear, but it does provide some relief to those pesky pimples that pop up out of no where.  I will continue to test it out and monitor the results and post the updates or changes as they come about.</li>
            <li> Ok for on the spot treatment, because the tubes are pretty small.  It also has a floral fragrance, which I&#x27;m not used to. I was happy to see it isn&#x27;t loaded down with natural herbs and creams, since I get hives from several of those.  It does have a light feel to it instead of heavy or creamy, which is nice.  I usually use Glytone, which is expensive as well, but has 10% benzoyl peroxide and the tube is huge in comparison and it has less ingredients.  I am passing this one over to my teenaged sons.</li>
            <li> The cream was for a friend of mine that lost their original tubes while on vacation. This cream works great on removing and preventing lots of skin blemish problems. It works really well similar to a mask product. It is an excellent cleaner as well. Great product.</li>
            <li> These little tubes are the perfect size to stuff into your travel bag, and the product requires just a little bit to do its job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have not had any issues with excessive drying, and it does appear to work pretty quickly. The oily sheen on my skin disappeared within an hour or so and the redness lessened pretty quickly as well. Overnight, things weren&#x27;t 100% cleared up, but they were headed in the right direction. Don&#x27;t expect magic, but it does seem to work quickly.</li>
            <li> I gave this to my teen daughter to use. She says it does nothing. Nothing at all. It doesn&#x27;t do anything to blemishes. It also doesn&#x27;t harm her skin. So it&#x27;s not as if it&#x27;s hurting her or making her skin worse. But she says it does not reduce blemishes or speed healing.</li>
            <li> This product was very effective for me:) I received it as a free gift from Proactiv and I bless the day they sent it to me!</li>
            <li> Go to the dermatologist and get Duac gel...you&#x27;ll get a lot more product and pay whatever your copay is- which is probably going to be less than $45!</li>
            <li> I am a 41 year-old woman and unfortunately, I still get pimples. I use Proactiv&#x27;s facial scrub twice daily but I still get a zit or two now and then. This blemish relief helped dry out the pimples without drying out my face. The only thing I didn&#x27;t like about this product was the price. There&#x27;s very little product in these 2 tiny tubes and at nearly $50, that seems pretty unreasonable. Of course, some people are willing to pay any price for clear skin but still, this seems to cost more than it should.</li>
            <li> It hasn&#x27;t helped me any. I keep apply and it looks the same and takes just as long to go away</li>
            <li> This is a great product - the peroxide strength (5%) is strong enough to stop acne from further developing when applied as soon as a pimple begins to develop, but it&#x27;s not so strong that it dries out my skin. These are small tubes, but will likely last a long time for spot treatment. As others have said, they are a little on the pricier side compared to what you can pick up at a drug store, that may be equally effective.</li>
            <li> A family member tried this and stated: &amp;#34;“I get pimples very easily. Everything from my oily hair to stress to sugar makes me break out. Thus, I have tried all sorts of acne solutions, with varying degrees of success. The problem with all of them, however, is that they are all irritable in some way, and at times they can cause new breakouts just from that irritation. Proactive+ does not have that defect. I have applied it once every day for two weeks now and have barely had to think about it. Though my pimples have not completely vanished, they are extremely well contained and hardly noticeable, and my skin is not irritated by the substance at all. Just put a little bit on, rub it on your washed face, and your good to go. I suspect that with consistent use for more than just two weeks, I will continue to acquire more positive results. So far, very nice!”</li>
            <li> Husband loves it. Works quickly for him. Love Proactiv. We are in our late 40&#x27;s. Stupid breakouts never end!!</li>
            <li> Proactiv advertises itself as something incredible for treating acne, better than other OTC products.  The Emergency Blemish Relief, which contains 5% benzoyl peroxide, claims to have a &amp;#34;double dose&amp;#34; of &amp;#34;prescription grade micro-crystal benzoyl peroxide&amp;#34; (whatever that means).  For almost $46, one hopes that it is all it is billed to be.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I suppose double dose means it is twice as strong as 2.5%, which I can agree with, since 2.5 * 2 &#x3D; 5.  But it is easy to find benzoyl peroxide acne creams over the counter at up to 10% strength where I live, both at pharmacies and mass retailers.  This product works as well as my daughter&#x27;s current Rx cream, but that does not say much, since her cream can also be purchased OTC but since the military fills her Rx for no cost, why should we not take advantage of that benefit of 20+ years of military service.  Her cream is about $6 at Walgreens.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Proactiv is an expensive version of an inexpensive acne treatment product, and has a lot of hype and celebrity spokes people advertising the line in commercials and magazines.  If it works for you, fine, but I will stick with the OTC or Rx products from my doctor.</li>
            <li> I was really impressed that this did in fact work quite well.  In my mind, Proactiv is the number one name in acne control, so this has to be the best &amp;#34;emergency relief&amp;#34; that is on the market?!  While I can&#x27;t compare it to other products, this did exactly as advertised.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am in my early 30&#x27;s and rarely get many zits, when I do it is only one or two so I don&#x27;t have a major problem.  The change in season certainly has brought about a few more than usual and this has been a welcome addition to my medicine cabinet.  One of the best things about this is that it is very gel like, keeping it on the affected area rather than running down my face.  It also doesn&#x27;t have an overpowering alcohol or medicine smell, thought with anything like this there is a slight odor.  I also appreciated that it goes on clear and remains unnoticeable after applied.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a great addition to your facial arsenal.  While it is a bit expensive you do get two tubes and a little of this goes a long way, so you will not have to be buying it on the regular.  Best of all, it works!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Proactive products off and on for years and I&#x27;ve been impressed with most of them (which is what brings me back again and again). This was not one of those products. I expect to see improvement when using an &amp;#34;emergency&amp;#34; or spot blemish treatment and I didn&#x27;t see that with this product. I used it on the same spot for several days and still no improvement. Definitely not worth the money. Their regular treatment product that comes in their sets works much better (and it&#x27;s not considered a spot or emergency treatment).</li>
            <li> I love Proactiv in general so I always take any opportunity that I get to try out one of their products. I swear, it seems like the older I get the more my skin changes for the worse. I&#x27;ve never had acne as a teenager yet in my late thirties it has become a reality. You can only imagine that I&#x27;m desperate to get rid of blemishes the minute they appear.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The consistency of the cream itself is a little runny which I thought would be a problem. I thought that I might not get as much product as I&#x27;d like because of this but luckily that isn&#x27;t an issue in the least. It takes a good 24 hours of applying the cream at least 2 times a day on blemishes for it to really work. I can honestly say that it doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin. This is important because who wants to draw more attention to their problem skin and blemishes right? Right. A staple for me from now on for sure.</li>
            <li> As an adult in my thirties, I still get some pimples. I don&#x27;t get as many as I used to but when I do, sometimes they can be big ones. Right after this product shipped I was lucky (or rather unlucky) to start to get a rather large one above my eyebrow. It was one of those ones that get red quickly and swell a portion surrounding it on my forehead.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I got this Blemish Relief in the mail, I immediately started using it. I was amazed with how quickly it worked. It reduced the size of the pimple and made the pimple come to a head within 24 hours of my first application. After that, the pimple healed quickly and now not even a week later, I only have a slight red spot where the zit was.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When using the product, you can use it up to 3 times. It does dry up the skin where you apply it, so consider using some lotion in addition to using this. But I was so happy with how well this has worked and will continue to use if I have any new breakouts.</li>
            <li> Luckily( or unluckily) for me, I had a few blemishes I could test this product on right away. I&#x27;m usually acne-free but then one random day I&#x27;d get a couple of white heads that refuse to go away unless treated. I was able to test this Proactiv Emergency Blemish Relief on 3 different sized pimples and for the most part, I saw results after about 24 hours. I started in the morning and applied 3 times that day. The cream is very light-weight without a scent of any kind and it took just a few seconds to completely dissolve on my skin. After day 1, two of the smaller blemishes showed a significant amount of dryness, so I could tell it was working. The 3rd larger blemish was still a tad red and raised, but It wasn&#x27;t getting any worse.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Three days later and the blemishes are nearly all gone. I&#x27;m still not 100% convinced, mostly because I haven&#x27;t been using this product long, but I think it certainly helped with the problem. It dried the pimples without actually drying out my face, and really, you only need a tiny amount. This product is very expensive so further testing on my end is needed before I can properly recommend it. Everyone&#x27;s skin is different and I know there are people that swear by Proactiv and some, not so much. It certainly hasn&#x27;t made my face worse so there is a plus there. It&#x27;s a waiting game, but from what I&#x27;ve seen so far, I&#x27;m willing to continue trying this out.</li>
            <li> Even in my 30s I still occasionally get breakouts and this is the perfect solution for someone like me who doesn&#x27;t need a daily all-over face cream but just a spot treatment when those sudden breakouts happen.  I also gave a tube of it to my teenage nephew who has had a serious problem with acne.  He&#x27;s tried other over-the-counter creams from the stores without much luck, but after trying this he&#x27;s sold.  He raved to me about how it &amp;#34;works really good&amp;#34;, which coming from a 15 year old boy is high praise indeed!  It&#x27;s true that his skin is already starting to clear up, so really I would recommend this for any age group.  Sometimes with other products I&#x27;ve had trouble with it leaving my skin dried out to the point of peeling but neither of us has experienced any issues with this.</li>
            <li> This is  a wonderful product, I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> This acne topical is 5% benzoyl peroxide. I have used it on my back and shoulder acne. It is as effective as any benzoyl peroxide treatment. Like any similar topical, remember that this can bleach clothing, towels and sheets so keep that in mind with use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My main concern with this product isn&#x27;t its effectiveness or attributes...it is price. You can get a bottle of an equally useful topical for 90% less than this product&#x27;s unit price. I just don&#x27;t see any added advantage to this preparation that would warrant the price tag. So in my mind, it is just ok and I&#x27;d not ever spend this kind of money for it. I don&#x27;t recommend it but I do recommend that you comparison shop.</li>
            <li> Excellent for small blemishes.  I found however for acne that is more like a small cyst, this product really doesn&#x27;t have the power to eradicate the acne.  It&#x27;s gentle on the skin and I recommend it for sensitive skin and small blemishes however if you occasionally get cystic acne (I always called this type of acne a blind pimple because it never comes to a head) then I would recommend something stronger.  I use a light application of 10% glycolic acid cream for this type of acne and the blind pimple is usually gone in 3-4 days.</li>
            <li> Works as advertised. However, w/ a multitude of other options and brands in store shelves for half the price, this product seems way over priced. If price is not an issue, then it&#x27;s a great solution for instant help for blemishes.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s no doubt that Rodan &amp; Fields skin care regimens work; I swear by one of their revitalizing regimens for discolored, aging skin. And with Rosacea, as well as hormones, there can often be the most annoying blemishes, completely unrelated to age or generally excellent skin care. &amp;#60;sigh&amp;#62;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is where a handy little tube of BP or Salicylic Acid can really work wonders. Applying just a tiny drop to the oncoming blemish does the trick, using this beautifully formulated BP 5% treatment lotion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The scent is light and fresh, application is easy and invisible, and the product washes right off your fingers. No irritation here.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I held back two stars because I can&#x27;t see that this is anything more than two small (&amp;#60; 5ml) drugstore size tubes of BP 5%, dressed up in Proactiv packaging and marketing at a huge markup. They ARE good, so make your own decision.  They just AREN&#x27;T magic.</li>
            <li> Good ol&#x27; benzoyl peroxide does the trick in the Proactiv formula.  This works well to clear up spot acne fairly quickly and painlessly.  It appears mild on the skin and smells fine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Apply a small amount to the pimple and for most cases, it clears it in a day or two, unless heavily cystic or large.  It sports a 5% solution and two small tubes.  Easy to use for travel.  Overall, the product works, the substance fine, the cost prohibitive.</li>
            <li> Proactiv is reputed to be among the best acne treatments, and this did not disappoint.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No side effects--none of the dryness the instructions cautioned against. I would notice dryness as my skin can get quite dry on its own. I did three applications on three different days on the same pimple, which was located on the side of my nose.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A teenage person in my family tried it on acne and found &amp;#34;it was good,&amp;#34; which is the ultimate endorsement.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When the directions say to just use a dab, they mean it. I used just a tiny dot and that sufficed.</li>
            <li> Son loves this and we purchase it often.</li>
            <li> My daughter says this helps with bad blemishes!</li>
