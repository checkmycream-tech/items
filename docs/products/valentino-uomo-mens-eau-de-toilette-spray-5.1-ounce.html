            <li>Valentino has created a wonderful blend of notes  that reflect, woody,sweet,cacao and nutty Valentino Uomo also embraces the warm and spicy fragrances.</li>
            <li>Smells good, but in no way do I smell chocolate, coffee, or hazelnut.</li>
            <li>The longevity isn&#x27;t that good</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a great autumn and fall smell and seems to be fairly liked by the folks around me and well tolerated by those who don&#x27;t like a cologne.  </li>
            <li>Smells really good.</li>
            <li>Very pleasant sweet smell.  </li>
            <li>Great smelling fragrance... Received many compliments on it.</li>
            <li>Also, the spray nozzle of the bottle itself sprays a good, abundant amount of cologne, which in anyone&#x27;s case, one or two sprays is all that&#x27;s needed all day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love this cologne!</li>

            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>Nice scent.  </li>
            <li>A good alternative to the most popular fragrances.</li>
            <li>Nice fragrance,</li>
            <li>While I loved the smell Valentino Uomo and was happy to have it replace my much loved but now discontinued &amp;#34;V by Valentino&amp;#34; from many years ago, I noticed that it left discolorations on my clothing.&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;The bottle is nice, has a great texture to it, and very masculine.</li>
            <li>They even included a cute lip balm, a sample fragrance and some coupons.</li>
            <li>And the price is so much better than Nordstrom&#x27;s.</li>
            <li>My favorite among the men&#x27;s toilettte Sprays I have.  </li>
            <li>I personally love it</li>
            <li>Love this Cologne.</li>
            <li>I wore it and got so many compliments.</li>
            <li>Love it</li>
            <li>Personally, I love it.</li>
            <li>Came early and smells good!</li>
            <li>Luckily I realized this before spraying it on any of my favorite dress shirts/sweaters, or I&#x27;d have been furious.</li>
            <li>Honestly, I think it smells very nice, but there are still other colognes out there at a similar price that smell as great and even</li>
            <li>Was introduced to the product by a free sample.</li>
            <li>I am very happy with my Valentino, everyday someone ask me what I am wearing.</li>
            <li>This cologne smells great only one problem.  </li>
            <li>Maybe a cheap dye in the coloring.</li>
            <li>Has a unique smell.  </li>
            <li>Just received my uniquely designed bottle of Valentino Uomo Eau De Toilette Spray for men in the 3.4 ounce size.</li>
            <li>Is this the replacement for the original Valentino?</li>
            <li>I had originally got a sample from nordstroms when I ordered from them and thought it was Women&#x27;s.</li>
            <li>It is a great warm subtle smell and it lasts all day.</li>
            <li>Even though the package arrived a day late (let&#x27;s blame the Christmas Season), it came in perfect conditions.</li>
            <li>Really fresh and sweet fragrance.</li>
            <li>It really does have strong coffee and chocolate notes, which causes for women to stop and ask what I&#x27;m wearing.</li>
            <li>My husband really liked his present.</li>
            <li>Kind of like the difference between toilet water and perfume.</li>
            <li>Smells great, but does leave stains on white clothing, so be careful!</li>
            <li>Love it, a little sweet</li>
            <li>This cologne lasts all day and doesn&#x27;t change character much throughout the day either.  </li>
            <li>highly recommend it!</li>
            <li>Very satisfield consumer.</li>
            <li>(I&#x27;m a fan of this particular designer)</li>
            <li>Smooth and light smell, doesn&#x27;t last long as I expected</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d definitely try to sample it before buying as some men won&#x27;t like it compared to the more generic traditional fragrances out there.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s ok, but it seems weaker than the bottle I get ay my Von Maur store, and it definitely does not last as long.</li>
            <li>It is a large bottle, so it is meant to last for a while.</li>
            <li>I received a tester sample of Valentino Uomo from my local Nordstrom, so that I could try out thr fragrance before investing in a large bottle.</li>
            <li>This fragrance is soft but masculine, I got this for my husband as a part of a gift package, and he loves it.</li>
            <li>The protective cap cam broken, I am not sure this is an authentic perfume, does not look like authentic for me!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>The spray nozzle is strong and it only takes a few pumps to get the coverage I need to last all day.  </li>

            <li> OMG! I love this cologne! can&#x27;t wait to wear it on tv!</li>
            <li> Authentic as described! Great price and awesome smell!</li>
            <li> IT IS A KILLER.......&lt;br /&gt;PEOPLE GET CAPTIVATED, MEN AND WOMEN.</li>
            <li> Last all day.  Very pleasant sweet smell.  It doesn&#x27;t stain my clothing I read other people said it did.  If you are worried about staining don&#x27;t spray it on your clothes as cologne is supposed to go on your body anyway and not your clothes.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ok, but it seems weaker than the bottle I get ay my Von Maur store, and it definitely does not last as long. Kind of like the difference between toilet water and perfume.</li>
            <li> Smells good, but in no way do I smell chocolate, coffee, or hazelnut. Maybe it&#x27;s just me. But, I got this for my dad and he LOVES it. My mom also thought it smells absolutely great. My parents would rate this cologne as 9/10. Honestly, I think it smells very nice, but there are still other colognes out there at a similar price that smell as great and even better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bottle is nice, has a great texture to it, and very masculine. It is a large bottle, so it is meant to last for a while.

            <li> My husband smells wonderful in this cologne oh my goodness yummy!!!</li>
            <li> I received a tester sample of Valentino Uomo from my local Nordstrom, so that I could try out thr fragrance before investing in a large bottle. While I loved the smell Valentino Uomo and was happy to have it replace my much loved but now discontinued &amp;#34;V by Valentino&amp;#34; from many years ago, I noticed that it left discolorations on my clothing.&lt;br /&gt;Another reviewer wrote that it leaves brown stains on white clothing. In my experience it has left bright/faded spots on my colored clothing, making them look like they were sprayed/misted with some sort of partial bleach mixture. Luckily I realized this before spraying it on any of my favorite dress shirts/sweaters, or I&#x27;d have been furious.

            <li> Came early and smells good!</li>
            <li> Really fresh and sweet fragrance. Works for both men and women. The longevity isn&#x27;t that good but it does linger on your skin for a long time and won&#x27;t choke people if they&#x27;re stuck in a lift with you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I&#x27;d definitely try to sample it before buying as some men won&#x27;t like it compared to the more generic traditional fragrances out there. I personally love it and I&#x27;ll definitely be buying again.</li>
            <li> I am very happy with my Valentino, everyday someone ask me what I am wearing.</li>
            <li> Great smelling fragrance... Received many compliments on it.</li>
            <li> A friend of mine couldn&#x27;t find this perfume anywhere, because he lives overseas. He said that because of this scent, girls go after him same way bees go after nectar. To bad that I couldn&#x27;t afford to buy more than one.</li>
            <li> This fragrance is soft but masculine, I got this for my husband as a part of a gift package, and he loves it.</li>
            <li> This cologne lasts all day and doesn&#x27;t change character much throughout the day either.  It&#x27;s a great autumn and fall smell and seems to be fairly liked by the folks around me and well tolerated by those who don&#x27;t like a cologne.  I&#x27;ve had compliments but no complaints.  The spray nozzle is strong and it only takes a few pumps to get the coverage I need to last all day.  I wouldn&#x27;t even consider another smell at the moment.  You can&#x27;t go wrong here.</li>
            <li> smells soooooooooooooooo  good!</li>
            <li> Nice fragrance,but I&#x27;m not sure I&#x27;m sold on it yet.</li>
            <li> Just received my uniquely designed bottle of Valentino Uomo Eau De Toilette Spray for men in the 3.4 ounce size. The delivery came one day earlier than expected so I was pleasantly surprised. Valentino has created a wonderful blend of notes  that reflect, woody,sweet,cacao and nutty Valentino Uomo also embraces the warm and spicy fragrances. Valentino Uomo for men is formulated in Spain. For something out of the ordinary I highly recommend Valenino Uomo ! I also have to say that the spray arrived wrapped perfectly so that it would not break in shipping. My congratulations to the supplier.</li>
            <li> Is this the replacement for the original Valentino?</li>
            <li> Love this stuff! It is a great warm subtle smell and it lasts all day. I have not had any of the discoloration experiences that a few reviews had mentioned.</li>
            <li> Love this Cologne. I had originally got a sample from nordstroms when I ordered from them and thought it was Women&#x27;s. Me being a female I wore it and got so many compliments. I went to order and found it it was men&#x27;s and I still ordered due to the lasting fragrance that is unisex in my opinion. Love it</li>
            <li> This smells incredible.  Everyone that smells it makes a comment about how great it smells!  Guys, women go nuts over this cologne.  There is something about it that .......  you know the rest....&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> This cologne smells great only one problem.  If this is sprayed on white cotton clothing it will leave a brown spot.  That tells me some corners  was cut in making this cologne.  Maybe a cheap dye in the coloring.</li>
            <li> Had a buddy in town who had this on and ran out and got me a bottle. Smells really good.</li>
            <li> Amazingly long lasting scent! Very satisfield consumer. Love it!</li>
            <li> There have been a lot of mixed reviews on this one. Personally, I love it. Every time I wear it I am complimented. It really does have strong coffee and chocolate notes, which causes for women to stop and ask what I&#x27;m wearing. A great fall or winter scent!</li>
            <li> Love it, a little sweet but you wont go wrong buying it.</li>
