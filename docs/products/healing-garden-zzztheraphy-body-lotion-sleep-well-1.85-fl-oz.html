            <li> I&#x27;ve been using \\&quot;Healing Garden zzzzzTherapy Body Lotion\\&quot; for the past few years, but then it was discontinued.  I even called \\&quot;Healing Garden\\&quot;, but to no avail.  I was heartbroken because I LOVE the scent and always received complements regarding the beautiful scent.  Luckily I found it again when checking the Internet.</li>
            <li> This is a small bottle - but since I can&#x27;t seem to find it anywhere anymore, I was glad to get a couple to tide me over and find a new scent.  Lovely scent and really good lotion.  Just wish there were the full size bottles still available!</li>

            <li> smelled like plastic. Not the same as the original. Packaging is deceitful.</li>
            <li> The Healing Garden&#x27;s ZzzzzTherapy is absolutely wonderful!  It has a nice, zingy, chamomile fragrance, and is soothing without being too strong.  Out of all the Healing Garden products, this is probably one of my favorites.  It&#x27;s the best nighttime stress relieving lotion you&#x27;ll find on the market today! :-)</li>
            <li> I have been yousing this lotion for over a year and love it.  I apply after a bath and before bedtime.</li>

            <li> Great lotion. I would definitely buy this product again. I have been looking for this lotion for a while so I am excited to have found it. Prompt service, item arrived on time.</li>
            <li> The fragrance and color seem a bit different than my first purchase of the lotion in a local retail store.</li>
            <li> I love this lotion and have been looking for it for a long time.  I will not pay this price for a 1.8 oz bottle though.  Get it back into the stores Healing Garden.  People will buy it!</li>
