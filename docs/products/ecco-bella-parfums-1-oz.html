            <li>Nice scent</li>
            <li>Has a really nice lemon scent, I have noticed that the bugs like it as well, so I have to be cautious and not to wear it when out in the garden and yard.</li>

            <li>This is a very nice clean smell.</li>
            <li>This is very bright and clean, and I find it similar and an excellent substitute for the Sugar fragrance I used to splurge on at Sephora.  </li>
            <li>and I went throught it very quickly!  </li>
            <li>If your looking for lemon verbena parfum that smells like it should this is surely it.</li>
            <li>and I can&#x27;t count how many compliments I&#x27;ve gotten about it.  </li>
            <li>I love the scent of this.</li>
            <li>I get head aches from most perfumes, but thankfully not from this one.</li>
            <li>I wanted a lemon verbena scent to complement a body scrub that I love.  </li>
            <li>Love this verbena scent and the fact that it is made with organic products.</li>
            <li>For the price, I haven&#x27;t found a citrus scent I like better.</li>
            <li>My daughter love this perfume.  </li>
            <li>and now it is her favorite.</li>
            <li>It is nothing like Love&#x27;s Lemon Spray.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t keep count of how many I have tried that irritate my senses.</li>
            <li>The price was right and it is a bright scent.  </li>
            <li>It dries to a nice lemony scent which makes me feel clean all day.</li>
            <li>THIS PERFUME HAS A STRONG AROMA.....</li>
            <li>This scent is probably fine for guys too.</li>
            <li>Ecco Bella&#x27;s products are free of animal ingredients and free of animal testing.  </li>
            <li>It goes on a bit strong, but fades quickly.  </li>
            <li>I love the way it smells when I first use it</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s all very well, communication is very good, I can definitely recommend&lt;br /&gt;Note</li>
            <li>Light, fresh, clean, lemony, but not overbearing.</li>
            <li>Very light lemon verbena scent, classic and clean.</li>
            <li>It is true lemon verbena scent.</li>
            <li>I love verbena and the price is so reasonable.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s fresh and clean-smelling.  </li>
            <li>It smells like a freshly juiced lemon, and that&#x27;s all.  </li>
            <li>It has a natural lemon scent, not chemically like many lemon scented perfumes.</li>
            <li>I read that some perfumes are made with suspect ingredients, so I feel better buying natural perfumes.</li>
            <li>Still well worth it.</li>
            <li>I really like lemon based fragrances for daytime wear, but no matter how much they cost, most seem to either fade within an hour or so, or have a unnatural chemical note that eventually overpowers the citrus</li>
            <li>I LOVE this perfume, especially since L&#x27;Occitane stopped making its verbena scent.</li>
            <li>I wish it would last longer, but for the price and the elegant fragrance, you can&#x27;t beat it.</li>
            <li>I often have a hard time finding perfumes that I like and that smell good on me.  </li>
            <li>Shipping way too much.</li>
            <li>haha.</li>
            <li>You really can put a lot on and not worry about choking anyone.</li>
            <li>I really like this perfume.  </li>
            <li>Very citrusy -</li>
            <li>This one is great because you only need a small amount, it lasts all day, and the price is reasonable.  </li>
            <li>The only possible issue I think anyone could have is that this may not be suitable for people with more sensitive skin because it is highly concentrated essential oil.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve had friends and co-workers compliment on the \\&quot;light, fresh\\&quot; fragrance and ask what I was wearing several hours after applying it, so I&#x27;m obviously not the only person still able to smell it.</li>
            <li>The fragrance is fresh and a little powerful when first applied.  </li>
            <li>Very light, not overwhelming.  </li>
            <li>This is a lovely perfume but comes in a small bottle</li>
            <li>and wow!</li>
            <li>is one of the very rare fragrances I&#x27;ve found that not only smells like fresh lemons, but that I can still detect the scent of a few hours later.&lt;br</li>
            <li>: in principle is to be attached externally visible to the German customs of the full invoice amount.</li>
            <li>You don&#x27;t have to worry about possibly putting too much on because the scent isn&#x27;t over powering.</li>
            <li>There is also a secondary smell that is sweet and a little floral, but very light.</li>
            <li>It isn&#x27;t sweet or heavy.</li>
            <li>I am very sensitive to cologne, perfume, essential oils.</li>
            <li>The scent doesn&#x27;t stay as long as regular perfumes, but I think you can expect that with natural products.</li>

            <li> If your looking for lemon verbena parfum that smells like it should this is surely it. Got this for my mom and she loved it!! A little spendy for the small amount though. Shipping way too much. Doesnt cost 10$ to ship this small item.</li>
            <li> This perfume smells so great! It smells like lemon heads candy. haha. I bought this perfume because of Laura Ingalls from Little House. You really can put a lot on and not worry about choking anyone.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff! Cheers you up in winter.</li>
            <li> This is very bright and clean, and I find it similar and an excellent substitute for the Sugar fragrance I used to splurge on at Sephora.  Very fresh after-shower fragrance and bet it will be great for summer.</li>
            <li> I really like this perfume.  It&#x27;s fresh and clean-smelling.  Very light, not overwhelming.  Very citrusy - but I like that.</li>
            <li> This is the only perfume I wear and I can&#x27;t count how many compliments I&#x27;ve gotten about it.  Very simple and natural fragrance with no musky undertones or artificial smells.  It smells like a freshly juiced lemon, and that&#x27;s all.  One spritz on your skin lasts all day.  Ecco Bella&#x27;s products are free of animal ingredients and free of animal testing.  The only possible issue I think anyone could have is that this may not be suitable for people with more sensitive skin because it is highly concentrated essential oil.</li>
            <li> I love the scent of this. It has a natural lemon scent, not chemically like many lemon scented perfumes. There is also a secondary smell that is sweet and a little floral, but very light. I get head aches from most perfumes, but thankfully not from this one. You don&#x27;t have to worry about possibly putting too much on because the scent isn&#x27;t over powering. You know like when you walk through the grocery store and can smell the woman&#x27;s (sometimes it&#x27;s a man!) perfume from the next aisle. This is a very nice clean smell.</li>
            <li> This is a lovely perfume but comes in a small bottle and I went throught it very quickly!  I did get some compliments on it when I wore it.</li>
            <li> I wanted a lemon verbena scent to complement a body scrub that I love.  This one is great because you only need a small amount, it lasts all day, and the price is reasonable.  I will be buying again.</li>
            <li> I purchased Ecco Bella Eau De Parfum Lemon Verbena on a whim.  I often have a hard time finding perfumes that I like and that smell good on me.  The price was right and it is a bright scent.  It is true lemon verbena scent. It goes on a bit strong, but fades quickly.  The latter comment is my only quibble.  I recommend this and would buy it again.  It&#x27;s the perfect summer perfume!</li>
            <li> I love the way it smells when I first use it but it doesn&#x27;t last long. Seems like by the time I get to work, the smell is gone.</li>
            <li> Smells lovely, unfortunately it doesn&#x27;t last at all. It&#x27;s gone 2 hours later.</li>
            <li> I LOVE this perfume, especially since L&#x27;Occitane stopped making its verbena scent. I wish it would last longer, but for the price and the elegant fragrance, you can&#x27;t beat it.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s all very well, communication is very good, I can definitely recommend&lt;br /&gt;Note: in principle is to be attached externally visible to the German customs of the full invoice amount. In the 1 piece shipment that was so, at 3 piece shipment not</li>
            <li> Love this verbena scent and the fact that it is made with organic products. I read that some perfumes are made with suspect ingredients, so I feel better buying natural perfumes. I love verbena and the price is so reasonable. The scent doesn&#x27;t stay as long as regular perfumes, but I think you can expect that with natural products. Still well worth it.</li>

            <li> My daughter love this perfume.  She used to watch Little House on the Prairie and this is the fragrance that the teacher would wear.  She wanted to try it and now it is her favorite.</li>
            <li> I had to try it and wow! does it smell good!!  I am so happy I tried it and will order it again and again...clean and refreshing and lasts!!  Thank you!!</li>
            <li> Nice scent, it was just what I was looking for. Has a really nice lemon scent, I have noticed that the bugs like it as well, so I have to be cautious and not to wear it when out in the garden and yard.</li>
            <li> THIS PERFUME HAS A STRONG AROMA.....IF YOU ARE SENSATIVE TO THAT, YOU MIGHT NOT LIKE THIS BUT IF YOU WANT A SCENT THAT LADTS, THIS IS GREAT FOR THAT....</li>
            <li> Very light lemon verbena scent, classic and clean.</li>
            <li> Light, fresh, clean, lemony, but not overbearing. It is nothing like Love&#x27;s Lemon Spray. Little goes a long way. This is just what I was looking for all of these years. I am very sensitive to cologne, perfume, essential oils. I can&#x27;t keep count of how many I have tried that irritate my senses. This is perfect. I hope they don&#x27;t stop making it now that I have found it. This scent is probably fine for guys too. It isn&#x27;t sweet or heavy.</li>
            <li> The fragrance is fresh and a little powerful when first applied.  It dries to a nice lemony scent which makes me feel clean all day.</li>
