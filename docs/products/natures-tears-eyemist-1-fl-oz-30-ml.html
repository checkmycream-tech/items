            <li>Best to stick with drops.</li>
            <li>the product was in great shape!!</li>
            <li>Good luck to you,  </li>
            <li>Very refreshing to the face, too.</li>
            <li>that was nice.</li>
            <li>And although the cooling sensation is nice for a while, but after it evaporates, the residue is so sticky that it makes me feel wanna take a bath.</li>
            <li>Not as nice as I thought it would be.</li>
            <li>You are better off buying those instead.</li>
            <li>only gave it 4 stars, as I reserve 5 stars for something really awesome, and</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so glad that I found this item on Amazon..</li>
            <li>love it because I can spray it in my eyes instead of drops.  </li>
            <li>I LOVE THIS PRODUCT.  </li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m so glad to be able to purchase this on line.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s pretty good.  </li>
            <li>This is a nice product for someone who has mild eye dryness or irritation.</li>
            <li>For me, this product has turned out to be the best for all of the reasons listed by other reviewers.  </li>
            <li>This comes out in a fine spray and its done.</li>
            <li>I am honestly amazed at the number of positive reviews for a product which is (to my surprise)</li>
            <li>This spray is great, especially for those who don&#x27;t like drops in the eyes!</li>
            <li>so when you use it have a towel or tissue nearby, other than that very good eye mist.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad other people liked it.</li>
            <li>It has changed from the easy to press old fashioned tip sprayer to a large plastic one that covers the whole top of the can-</li>
            <li>and if you don&#x27;t aim it just right</li>
            <li>And my eyes do not feel any better using this product than with regular eye drops.  </li>
            <li>If you have dry eyes, wear contacts, this is such a great product.  </li>
            <li>Yes the mist was nice, but it reminded me of evian and other mineral water mists.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not as effective as some other eye drops I&#x27;ve used, but it can be helpful.</li>
            <li>Actually the mist is good for the complexion too, so I get a double benefit.  </li>
            <li>As far as moisturizing my eyes, drops work far better.</li>
            <li>I have pretty dry eyes, and I love to read and watch videos.  </li>
            <li>I feel compelled to add my positive review of this product.  </li>
            <li>Thanks.</li>
            <li>I really had my hopes up for this eye mist.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m always rubbing them, making me look really \\&quot;good\\&quot;.</li>
            <li>It is very soothing and helps with dryness.</li>
            <li>Haha</li>
            <li>I order several packages at a time and this has been true for all the bottles.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>I had high hopes for this.</li>
            <li>Prospective buyers should be aware: this product has no active ingredients.</li>
            <li>you don&#x27;t get your eye because the normal tendency is to shut your eye.</li>
            <li>So it gets wasted easily.</li>
            <li>My eyes are sensitive or allergic to eye drops.</li>
            <li>It is also difficult to press and more cumbersome to use-- to get it right</li>
            <li>The new sprayer is too much water and a harder spray.</li>
            <li>altho&#x27; this is a nice product, and I will continue to use it, it&#x27;s not effective enough to either use by itself, or totally help my condition.  </li>
            <li>My eyes are so sensitive that I have to be careful how much of the lubricating drops I use.  </li>
            <li>I had purchased this product hoping to use it while traveling long distances and help cool down my eyes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>For those who are disappointed it is only water, it is a special sterile water, but there are people who have chemical sensitivities or are sensitive or allergic to most eye drops (like me) for whom this can be a help.</li>
            <li>I really like this product, I&#x27;m one of those people where drops never seem to get in, in other words a coward.</li>
            <li>they send this so quick it was unbelievable, not only that</li>
            <li>This new sprayer may be why some reviewers are saying their faces are getting too wet.</li>

            <li> I have had moderate to serious dry eye since Lasik surgery and can confirm that this product will give relief to all but the most minor of dry eye sufferers.</li>
            <li> It makes all the difference in your day if you find you&#x27;re having a symptomatic dry eye day and can spritz this into your eyes and be relieved of the sensitivity, blurring and constant feeling that you need to find a product that you can rely on when you have one of those days.</li>
            <li> Only 4 stars because the air pressure is surprisingly high and hard to aim.</li>
            <li> Very modern looking, but difficult to press and direct.  </li>
            <li> Left my face wet.</li>
            <li> and I bought them as a long shot hoping they would help.</li>
            <li> Do not buy unless you got money to burn and if your eyes burn a lot (are dry a lot).</li>
            <li> Even the ones with no preservatives make my eyes itch if I use them too often, so the Natures Tears EyeMist is helpful in keeping my eyes from getting too dry.  </li>
            <li> (The house gets dry in the winter.)&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just that dry eyes are an unsolvable problem.</li>
            <li> It does nothing for dry or allergic or irritated eyes.</li>
            <li> If you have dry eyes and find that using eye drops, while they may change how your eyes feel, still have irritated eyes both in appearance and feeling...</li>
            <li> In the winter my eyes get so dry</li>
            <li> DOES IT HELP RELIEVE MY DRY EYES</li>
            <li> I bought them because my contacts are always dry</li>
            <li> Even far away, it was like using an ordinary spray bottle on my face.  </li>
            <li> It will get your eyes, but also your entire forehead and down to nose level.</li>
            <li> And I used it for less than a second!  </li>
            <li> Since it is not available for me to buy locally, I have to find it online.</li>
            <li> having dry eyes is no fun.</li>
            <li> To relieve dry, tired eyes - especially when driving long distances - it can&#x27;t be beat.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, it has a large spray zone.</li>
            <li> It was very hard for me to find spray like this for dry eyes a couple of years back, and I&#x27;ll never switch.</li>
            <li> I found this eye spray in a drugstore when on vacation a few years ago.</li>
            <li> It would have lasted less, but since I noticed is so small</li>
            <li> I hardly see it in stores anymore</li>
            <li> Because you need to hold the product at least 10 inches from your eyes when applying, the mist can get in your face and hair...</li>
            <li> I had eye surgery, needed artificial tears, and couldn&#x27;t lean my head back for drops.</li>
            <li> It is too expensive for its size.</li>
            <li> It was difficult to not close my eyes when I felt the spray hit them.  </li>
            <li> You end up just blasting fake tears all over your face.</li>
            <li> This is a miserable exercise every time - wanting to dodge that spray.</li>

            <li> Do not buy unless you got money to burn and if your eyes burn a lot (are dry a lot). This lasted about a week. It would have lasted less, but since I noticed is so small I decided not to use it as often. It is too expensive for its size. If you have chronic dryness I wouldn&#x27;t recommend using this product. Yes the mist was nice, but it reminded me of evian and other mineral water mists. You are better off buying those instead. A lot of the water never made it to my eyes. Best to stick with drops.</li>
            <li> they send this so quick it was unbelievable, not only that but they even put in a pen! that was nice. the product was in great shape!! Thanks.</li>
            <li> I have pretty dry eyes, and I love to read and watch videos.  My eyes are so sensitive that I have to be careful how much of the lubricating drops I use.  Even the ones with no preservatives make my eyes itch if I use them too often, so the Natures Tears EyeMist is helpful in keeping my eyes from getting too dry.  And it does help.  Actually the mist is good for the complexion too, so I get a double benefit.  (The house gets dry in the winter.)&lt;br /&gt;I only gave it 4 stars, as I reserve 5 stars for something really awesome, and altho&#x27; this is a nice product, and I will continue to use it, it&#x27;s not effective enough to either use by itself, or totally help my condition.  I&#x27;d recommend it to anyone ....it&#x27;s pretty good.  It&#x27;s just that dry eyes are an unsolvable problem.</li>
            <li> Maybe it&#x27;s just me, but I don&#x27;t care for this product at all.  Even far away, it was like using an ordinary spray bottle on my face.  I was soaked!  And I used it for less than a second!  It was difficult to not close my eyes when I felt the spray hit them.  Thank goodness I wear waterproof mascara!  And my eyes do not feel any better using this product than with regular eye drops.  I really had my hopes up for this eye mist.  Oh well.  I&#x27;m glad other people liked it.</li>
            <li> I had purchased this product hoping to use it while traveling long distances and help cool down my eyes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But its mist is so widespread that it stains my nose, as well as forehead. And although the cooling sensation is nice for a while, but after it evaporates, the residue is so sticky that it makes me feel wanna take a bath. Moreover, since I wear eye glasses, the residue of the mist is uneasy.</li>
            <li> The instructions say to \\&quot;sweep\\&quot; the spray across the eyes. Try it. It is an automatic response to close the eyes if something is coming toward them. This is a miserable exercise every time - wanting to dodge that spray. Some of the substance does get into the eye, but there is nothing soothing about it. It does nothing for dry or allergic or irritated eyes.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so glad that I found this item on Amazon.. I&#x27;d been looking for it for years after buying it as a clearance item somewhere(could&#x27;t remember).  If you have dry eyes and find that using eye drops, while they may change how your eyes feel, still have irritated eyes both in appearance and feeling... For me, this product has turned out to be the best for all of the reasons listed by other reviewers.  I feel compelled to add my positive review of this product.  It makes all the difference in your day if you find you&#x27;re having a symptomatic dry eye day and can spritz this into your eyes and be relieved of the sensitivity, blurring and constant feeling that you need to find a product that you can rely on when you have one of those days.,. this is it for me!  I alternate w/Rotho cool(green cap)  Good luck to you,  having dry eyes is no fun. Give this product a go....</li>
            <li> I am honestly amazed at the number of positive reviews for a product which is (to my surprise) essentially purified water in a spray can. Prospective buyers should be aware: this product has no active ingredients. You might as well splash your eyes with distilled water.    I have had moderate to serious dry eye since Lasik surgery and can confirm that this product will give relief to all but the most minor of dry eye sufferers.</li>
            <li> The spray is thicker than I imagined and if you don&#x27;t aim it just right you don&#x27;t get your eye because the normal tendency is to shut your eye. So it gets wasted easily. Not as nice as I thought it would be.</li>
            <li> I found this eye spray in a drugstore when on vacation a few years ago. Since it is not available for me to buy locally, I have to find it online. My eyes are sensitive or allergic to eye drops. To relieve dry, tired eyes - especially when driving long distances - it can&#x27;t be beat. Very refreshing to the face, too. (Don&#x27;t use with mascara on, however, as it will run).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  ***Update Feb. 2014***  Natures Tears now has a different type sprayer - It has changed from the easy to press old fashioned tip sprayer to a large plastic one that covers the whole top of the can- Very modern looking, but difficult to press and direct.  This new sprayer may be why some reviewers are saying their faces are getting too wet. The new sprayer is too much water and a harder spray. It is also difficult to press and more cumbersome to use-- to get it right it can sometimes require several attempts or even two hands!  I order several packages at a time and this has been true for all the bottles.  I give it 4 instead of 5 stars now-&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;.... For those who have difficulty spraying into their eyes: try keeping your eyes open and looking in the opposite direction (so you can&#x27;t see the sprayer). For those who are disappointed it is only water, it is a special sterile water, but there are people who have chemical sensitivities or are sensitive or allergic to most eye drops (like me) for whom this can be a help.</li>
            <li> I really like this product, I&#x27;m one of those people where drops never seem to get in, in other words a coward. In the winter my eyes get so dry I&#x27;m always rubbing them, making me look really \\&quot;good\\&quot;. This comes out in a fine spray and its done. It was very hard for me to find spray like this for dry eyes a couple of years back, and I&#x27;ll never switch.</li>
            <li> This is a nice product for someone who has mild eye dryness or irritation. It&#x27;s not as effective as some other eye drops I&#x27;ve used, but it can be helpful. Because you need to hold the product at least 10 inches from your eyes when applying, the mist can get in your face and hair...but, for me, it wasn&#x27;t a big deal.</li>
            <li> Does what it says, lubricates and soothes. the only qurik I have with it is that it drenches you&#x27;re face, something that they said it doesn&#x27;t do. so when you use it have a towel or tissue nearby, other than that very good eye mist.</li>
            <li> This spray is great, especially for those who don&#x27;t like drops in the eyes! We use it all the time.</li>
            <li> I found it in a local store and when I went back they did not carry any longer.  Thank goodness I found it on Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;I love it because I can spray it in my eyes instead of drops.  It is very soothing and helps with dryness.</li>
            <li> I LOVE THIS PRODUCT.  NOT ONLY DOES IT HELP RELIEVE MY DRY EYES BUT I USE IT TO &amp;#34;WASH&amp;#34; MY FACE.  I&#x27;M IN A WHEELCHAIR &amp; CANNOT STAND TO WASH MY FACE.  THE EYE MIST IS HELPFUL.</li>
            <li> If you have dry eyes, wear contacts, this is such a great product.  I hardly see it in stores anymore and I&#x27;m so glad to be able to purchase this on line.  I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I had eye surgery, needed artificial tears, and couldn&#x27;t lean my head back for drops. I had high hopes for this. Unfortunately, it has a large spray zone. It will get your eyes, but also your entire forehead and down to nose level. Left my face wet. As far as moisturizing my eyes, drops work far better. I also cannot imagine using this while wearing makeup.</li>
            <li> I bought them because my contacts are always dry and I bought them as a long shot hoping they would help. Someone on the internet says they worked miracles. They didn&#x27;t. They do make you&#x27;re eyes feel refreshed though. I can&#x27;t imagine why you use these instead of eye drops though. Only 4 stars because the air pressure is surprisingly high and hard to aim. You end up just blasting fake tears all over your face. Haha</li>
