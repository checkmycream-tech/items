            <li>Great clippers!</li>
            <li>Grandson was very happy with this</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not too bulky and it was a good price that didn&#x27;t blow my budget!  </li>
            <li>The great majority of them could be done with the corners of the outliners.</li>
            <li>This clipper works really great, it doesnt come zero gapped , so you have to do it</li>
            <li>Excellent hair clippers top of the line for my business</li>
            <li>Works well and is great for designs in the hair of any kind.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t work as good as claim to be</li>
            <li>all its a good clipper for designs.</li>
            <li>I was very satisfied with my order.</li>
            <li>The finish product is always amazing to see when his work is done.  </li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m still learning this tool, but from my use on it so far, it is a great product!</li>
            <li>Just love to cut my sons hair.</li>
            <li>once i learn how to control it, works like magic...</li>
            <li>He can do more designs on his and our boys hair.</li>
            <li>With this machine we are able to be more creative, the samples are handy.&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;In time we can create more our style</li>
            <li>This is really a nice tool for putting designs in fresh hair cuts and is easy to use too !</li>
            <li>Works great and really produces clean lines</li>
            <li>Clippers arrived faster than expected, and they Work Great!</li>
            <li>Great and professional</li>
            <li>its like that tool you rarely ever use but its nice to have when needed.</li>
            <li>The Tattoo Trimmers are so easy to use.</li>
            <li>Wahl makes it look easy.</li>
            <li>but its easy</li>
            <li>Fine Line Trimmer</li>
            <li>When I 1st used it to start a design on my son&#x27;s head, it worked just fine.  </li>
            <li>Just make sure you blow off the excess hair from the trimmers and periodically turn it off so it doesn&#x27;t get too hot.</li>
            <li>I was so excited to try this when I 1st got it.  </li>
            <li>Good trimmers no big complaints, but I ended up doing the majority of the work with my andis t outliners.</li>
            <li>Using this for details does take a lot more time than just using normal trimmers and needs to be cleaned often while in use.</li>
            <li>Thanks!!</li>
            <li>A very nice machine i hope its very confortable and durable its very heavy and cool</li>
            <li>We have so much fun trying different designs in my hair, and my friends love coming over and trying their hand at it.  </li>
            <li>This item is exactly what I would expect.</li>
            <li>I used to get lines shaved in my head at the barbershop a couple times a month, but this has saved us so much time and money.  </li>
            <li>You may also need a straight egde buzzer too</li>
            <li>It gets close decently enough and does most details well enough.</li>
            <li>But they are mighty sharp.</li>
            <li>I use it on young boys that want their football number engraved in their hair!     </li>
            <li>I will be sending the Tattoo Trimmer back for a replacement very soon!</li>
            <li>If you have larger hands and are looking for thick lines that will definitely stand out, then this would probably be great for you.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t cut well, especially on hair any longer than a #1 on the sides, which a lot of my clients who are children are usually no shorter than a #2 and it really pulls their hair...</li>
            <li>Only bad thing I have to say about it is that the my blade didn&#x27;t come aligned perfectly.</li>
            <li>I am a professional hair dresser.</li>
            <li>I had ordered the Andis T-Edjer Professional Hair Trimmer and T-Blade</li>
            <li>I have cut a spider web thus far in her hair.  </li>
            <li>the blade is fine for making define curves in difficult area&#x27;s in design&#x27;s bt the trimmer to long and weak in power in my opinion and get hot quickly</li>
    </ol>

            <li> I do designs and stuff with my boys hair and thought this might do the trick, cutting down on time and making the designs more precise and sharp!  </li>
            <li> There was not enough tight curves and smaller lines to justify buying this product if i had it to do all over again.</li>
            <li> bought these for tight curves and smaller lines when doing hair art.</li>
            <li> So be careful.</li>
            <li> Did what I expected them to do.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t cut as sharp.</li>
            <li> when I use them and wahl doesn&#x27;t have those, work for a little while and go out on you</li>
            <li> Not recommended if you aren&#x27;t a professional because it can be difficult to use.</li>
            <li> Then after a few minutes it quit, the motor was running</li>
            <li> Anyway,  I don&#x27;t use it at all unless it&#x27;s on skin tight fades and even then I dint like how dull it is.</li>
            <li> but it quit working not sure Why either.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t buy it just sucks</li>
            <li> It works well, but your lines will be about 1/4 inch thick.  </li>
            <li> For some reason it&#x27;s very dull.</li>
            <li> This tool is awkward to hold while using and makes a slightly thicker line</li>
            <li> The tattoo  was a disappointment.</li>
            <li> not at all a bad product at all...</li>

            <li> I give it 3 * bc I don&#x27;t care for the trimmer itself the blade is fine for making define curves in difficult area&#x27;s in design&#x27;s bt the trimmer to long and weak in power in my opinion and get hot quickly I&#x27;m a barber of 29yrs and know quality trimmers when I use them and wahl doesn&#x27;t have those, work for a little while and go out on you</li>
            <li> I used to get lines shaved in my head at the barbershop a couple times a month, but this has saved us so much time and money.

            <li> Not an expert barber. Just love to cut my sons hair. The Tattoo Trimmers are so easy to use. But they are mighty sharp. So be careful.</li>
            <li> Works great and really produces clean lines</li>
            <li> Great and professional</li>
            <li> I had a problem  with the item being shipped  to me. The tattoo  was a disappointment. Didn&#x27;t cut as sharp.</li>
            <li> This is really a nice tool for putting designs in fresh hair cuts and is easy to use too !</li>
            <li> Excellent hair clippers top of the line for my business</li>
            <li> It gets close decently enough and does most details well enough. Using this for details does take a lot more time than just using normal trimmers and needs to be cleaned often while in use. I just wish it had either a swivel cord or no cord at all, as angling it is a bit cumbersome.</li>
            <li> For some reason it&#x27;s very dull. It doesn&#x27;t cut well, especially on hair any longer than a #1 on the sides, which a lot of my clients who are children are usually no shorter than a #2 and it really pulls their hair... Anyway,  I don&#x27;t use it at all unless it&#x27;s on skin tight fades and even then I dint like how dull it is.</li>

            <li> I was so excited to try this when I 1st got it.  I do designs and stuff with my boys hair and thought this might do the trick, cutting down on time and making the designs more precise and sharp!  When I 1st used it to start a design on my son&#x27;s head, it worked just fine.  Then after a few minutes it quit, the motor was running but the blade would not move back and forth.  I still like the idea of having it and I wish that it was working properly so I can use it!  It&#x27;s not too bulky and it was a good price that didn&#x27;t blow my budget!  I had ordered the Andis T-Edjer Professional Hair Trimmer and T-Blade also when I placed my order.  I had to use this 1 to finsh my son&#x27;s design on his head!  I will be sending the Tattoo Trimmer back for a replacement very soon!</li>
            <li> I brought these to cut designs in my girls hair.  She loves them!  I have cut a spider web thus far in her hair.  Next will be stars.  Great clippers!</li>
            <li> Todo me llego exacto a lo acordado tiene un seguro comprador aqui en la republica dominicana&lt;br /&gt;yo lo recomiendo y lo seguiria usando como mi suplidor</li>
            <li> I bought the Tattoo for my Husband for Christmas!!! He loves it. He can do more designs on his and our boys hair. The finish product is always amazing to see when his work is done.  If you haven&#x27;t bought your Tattoo yet, you wasting time. Go out and order one!! Thanks!!</li>
            <li> It does not trim my sons hair like I had thought. Wahl makes it look easy.</li>
            <li> Grandson was very happy with this</li>
            <li> These Wahl Tattoo trimmers get the job done</li>
            <li> This clipper works really great, it doesnt come zero gapped , so you have to do it but its easy , it took me 2 minutes, also it comes with a poster with haircut designs,&lt;br /&gt;Over all its a good clipper for designs.</li>
            <li> This tool is awkward to hold while using and makes a slightly thicker line then I anticipated. If you have larger hands and are looking for thick lines that will definitely stand out, then this would probably be great for you.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t buy it just sucks</li>
            <li> It works well, but your lines will be about 1/4 inch thick.  You may also need a straight egde buzzer too</li>
            <li> With this machine we are able to be more creative, the samples are handy.&lt;br /&gt;In time we can create more our style</li>
            <li> My passion is to be a barber and I&#x27;m still learning this tool, but from my use on it so far, it is a great product! Only bad thing I have to say about it is that the my blade didn&#x27;t come aligned perfectly. 4.5/5 stars</li>
            <li> A very nice machine i hope its very confortable and durable its very heavy and cool i wish that comes with a longer manual</li>
            <li> Did what I expected them to do.</li>
            <li> I was very satisfied with my order. I would definitely recommend amazon to my friends and family</li>
            <li> I wanted tattoo designs in my very short hair, and I knew I could not do them myself, so I took the Wahl Tattoo clipper to&lt;br /&gt;the salon for a stylist to use.  Everyone there loves using it.  I don&#x27;t always have the same stylist and one by one they&lt;br /&gt;say &amp;#34;I haven&#x27;t used that yet&amp;#34;,  let me do it next time~!  Works for me!!</li>
            <li> I got it so my hair dresser could shave Shinedown and three days grace in my head but it quit working not sure Why either.</li>
