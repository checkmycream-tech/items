            <li>Glad I found this one and am very satisfied with the product, with the exception of the streamlined handle.  </li>
            <li>yes their out there but not the strong and sturdy kind like this one...</li>
            <li>Sandpaper would do better.</li>
            <li>My wife is so happy with the Cala Stainless Steel Nail File.  </li>
            <li>I absolutely love this product.</li>
            <li>Thi one sure and it.</li>
            <li>It would be much better it</li>
            <li>There are better nails files than this one if you could even call this a file.</li>
            <li>The file is POLISHED SMOOTH!</li>
            <li>/&gt;So glad to find one on Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Well the reviews can&#x27;t be very true in my opinion.</li>
            <li>The file is not as strong as the Trim one.  </li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t find one that is like to one&#x27;s you could fine in the twentieth century.  </li>
            <li>Very fast filing, and with some care leaves pretty good finish.  </li>
            <li>May be worth $2, but not a cent more.</li>
            <li>Excellent product for very little money.  </li>
            <li>I have used this type of nail file many times and generally like them, but the file I got was so smooth that it wouldn&#x27;t file at all.  </li>
            <li>The little pointed edge at at the end of the file is great for scooping out dirt under your nail as well.</li>
            <li>This nail file is a piece of junk, it has no cutting surface.</li>
            <li>All of them are made of something other that Stainless Steel and do not do nearly as good of a job as the Cala.</li>
            <li>Was exactly how described in ad.</li>
            <li>but this kind the strong and sturdy kind is and was almost impossible to find...</li>
            <li>the cross-grid isn&#x27;t cut as deeply, but otherwise is good -- and at a low price.  </li>
            <li>she absolutely loves it&#x27;&#x27;</li>
            <li>5 inch stainless steel nail file tool I have used one like it  for 50 years</li>
            <li>After despairing that I would never again find a moderate priced steel nail file (which last MANY TIMES longer)--</li>
            <li>This file is also super durable and remains in a \\&quot;like new\\&quot; condition even though I purchased this several months ago.</li>
            <li>It takes a little more effort to file nails.</li>
            <li>It files your nails in a sharp and precise way without plitting them or damaging them.</li>
            <li>Stainless steel files are becoming a relic of the past.  </li>
            <li>It files your nails, but it&#x27;s nothing that will ever come close to a professional nail file.</li>
            <li>Then, back in the 1980s (or thereabouts), the \\&quot;diamond file\\&quot; came out, which is really not a file at all; it&#x27;s an abrasive-coated strip of metal that shreds the nail material instead of paring it off cleanly.  </li>
            <li>Very small and doesn&#x27;t fit in the hand.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think it is rough enough to mak e a decent match stiker!  </li>
            <li>Decades ago, all decent nail files were made like this, with many lines of parallel cutting edges cut into the surface of the metal blade.  </li>

            <li> This nail file is a piece of junk, it has no cutting surface. It doesn&#x27;t file. Sandpaper would do better.</li>
            <li> Reading the high reviews I chose this file because the revlon and others don&#x27;t last because they are sand paper glued on a thin piece of wood. Well the reviews can&#x27;t be very true in my opinion. This file has very little cuts in the steel and had no friction. It couldn&#x27;t file my nails at all!! DON\\&quot;T BUY IT!</li>
            <li> I have used this type of nail file many times and generally like them, but the file I got was so smooth that it wouldn&#x27;t file at all.  I&#x27;ve contacted the seller to try to resolve the issue so I&#x27;ll update this review if they get back to me</li>
            <li> My wife is so happy with the Cala Stainless Steel Nail File.  She has been searching for a replacement file for months.  All of them are made of something other that Stainless Steel and do not do nearly as good of a job as the Cala.</li>
            <li> After despairing that I would never again find a moderate priced steel nail file (which last MANY TIMES longer)-- no local stores carry them anymore nor do the major brands I&#x27;ve bought in past years list them anymore, I found this on line at a low price.  It&#x27;s narrower than those I&#x27;ve seen in years past and the cross-grid isn&#x27;t cut as deeply, but otherwise is good -- and at a low price.  I hope the manufacturer and the retailer will recognize this otherwise unmet market need and continue to carry them.</li>
            <li> Decades ago, all decent nail files were made like this, with many lines of parallel cutting edges cut into the surface of the metal blade.  Then, back in the 1980s (or thereabouts), the \\&quot;diamond file\\&quot; came out, which is really not a file at all; it&#x27;s an abrasive-coated strip of metal that shreds the nail material instead of paring it off cleanly.  For most people, the difference is trivial or completely irrelevant, but for those who know of and understand (and have a need for) the old-style file, this is the item you&#x27;ve been looking for.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product. It files your nails in a sharp and precise way without plitting them or damaging them. The little pointed edge at at the end of the file is great for scooping out dirt under your nail as well. This file is also super durable and remains in a \\&quot;like new\\&quot; condition even though I purchased this several months ago. If you are looking for a great quality without the the top quality price then this file is for you.</li>
            <li> I want a good triple scored nail file.  I can&#x27;t find one that is like to one&#x27;s you could fine in the twentieth century.  Thi one sure and it.</li>
            <li> Great file.  Stainless steel files are becoming a relic of the past.  Glad I found this one and am very satisfied with the product, with the exception of the streamlined handle.  Whatever happened to the concept of handles?</li>
            <li> Very small and doesn&#x27;t fit in the hand.  It would be much better it it had a larger diameter handle for grip.</li>
            <li> Too dull!  Does not file nails.  Threw in the trash can.  $7.06 wasted.  There are better nails files than this one if you could even call this a file.</li>
            <li> Totally useless.  I don&#x27;t think it is rough enough to mak e a decent match stiker!  Appears to be STAMPED out of sheet metal and polished to ease edges.  The file is POLISHED SMOOTH!</li>
            <li> This file was not worth the money.  When filing with it, it doesn&#x27;t even take any nail off.  It&#x27;s really dull since the cutting edges were not made deep enough to do the job.</li>
            <li> bought it for my sister as she cant find any with out a plastic head on it&#x27;&#x27; she absolutely loves it&#x27;&#x27;</li>
            <li> Excellent product for very little money.  Very fast filing, and with some care leaves pretty good finish.  Would buy again.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little foolish just to order a nail file but this kind the strong and sturdy kind is and was almost impossible to find...yes their out there but not the strong and sturdy kind like this one...it will last for years .</li>
            <li> Who knew stores do not carry this anymore ?TG Amazon does !&lt;br /&gt;A  5 inch stainless steel nail file tool I have used one like it  for 50 years, it vanished&lt;br /&gt;So glad to find one on Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;I only rate 5 star items.</li>
            <li> The file is not as strong as the Trim one.  It takes a little more effort to file nails.</li>
            <li> Was exactly how described in ad.</li>
            <li> buy something else, this product does not do the job.  cheep knock-off. no bite does not do the job.  try Trim brand nail file instead.</li>
            <li> Very cheap for the price !!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> It sort of worked. It didnt file too well, and then it sliced my finger open like a knife.&lt;br /&gt;I threw it away. The handle is too slippery also.</li>
            <li> It files your nails, but it&#x27;s nothing that will ever come close to a professional nail file. May be worth $2, but not a cent more. I paid almost $6, and I feel cheated. Don&#x27;t buy it.</li>
