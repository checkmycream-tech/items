            <li>Fantastic lotion!!  </li>
            <li>I LOVE these lotions for the perfect purse size that they are and mild, but aromatic scents.  </li>
            <li>Feels nice on your hands.</li>
            <li>They feel really nice on your hands.</li>
            <li>* Handy for travel or your purse</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s that they smelled kind of...funny and weird.&lt;br /</li>
            <li>And handy to keep in my purse.  </li>
            <li>I ordered the trial sizes to figure out which ones I liked &amp; gave the others to my daughter.</li>
            <li>Great scents that do not overpower and fade quickly</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m glad I did because I love it!</li>
            <li>This is a very nice lotion which absorbs quickly and doesn&#x27;t feel sticky afterwards.  </li>
            <li>Its a nice size for the purse and a quick feel good.</li>
            <li>Love the sampler pack.</li>
            <li>and they love it as well.</li>
            <li>I love their scents.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Love these products.</li>
            <li>I love it</li>
            <li>The first one I tried, which many have liked the scent of, was Jasmine, thinking that I too would like it.  </li>
            <li>The lotion is not thick and greasy and works well, pleasant fragrance for all scents.</li>
            <li>the consistancy is perfect not too watery ,not greasy, absorbs quick and the scent lasts for a long time.</li>
            <li>Was given a free sample of this on Mothers Day at a Restaurant.</li>
            <li>I particularly like this 6 pack because I can enjoy all the different wonderful scents.  </li>
            <li>It starts off feeling like a regular light hand cream, and then like 30 seconds it magically absorbs even more and leaves a silky smooth feeling without residue.&lt;br /</li>
            <li>It is a great product for the office because after about a minute on your skin there is absolutely no sticky residue so it doest gunk up your keyboard.  </li>
            <li>OPI avojuice lotion is to die for, soaks into your skin fast and makes it feel silky smooth!  </li>
            <li>Really smelled good and made the hands feel real soft.</li>
            <li>Since there are so many scents and it seemed that everyone has a different favorite, I decided to get the sampler</li>
            <li>Received quickly.  </li>
            <li>I read another review about the Jasmine not smelling right</li>
            <li>very sensitive skin and Avojuice feels smooth and silky with no adverse reactions.  </li>
            <li>My sampler did not come with exactly the same scents as listed: \\&quot;Jasmin, Cran &amp; Berry, Coconut Melon, Ginger Lily, Mango, rasbberry violet\\&quot;, mine came with Sweet Tea instead of Raspberry Violet, but I thought it was no big deal since I was searching for a good scent</li>
            <li>There was enough for five plus me :)</li>
            <li>so I could determine which large bottle I would purchase.  </li>
            <li>But if you are looking for the exact scents, I would email the particular seller you are planning to purchase from to find out which ones</li>
            <li>My favorite out of the 6 was the Mango, not because it smells amazing, but because it was the one least likely to give me a headache.  </li>
            <li>I just expected better quality scents from OPI, since they make quality nail polish.  </li>

            <li>Below Mango I equally tolerated Cran and Berry, Sweet Tea, and Ginger Lily&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>But I haven&#x27;t given up and have ordered single minis in different scents from eBay and have decided that my favorite, from the scents thus far I have tried</li>

            <li>I actually really like the Mango now, and I bought a giant bottle of the Hibiscus Blossom.  </li>
            <li>This is a HUGE disappointment because I specifically looked for the right combination of six scents that I wanted.</li>
            <li>I suffer from dry skin especially in the cold weather and this lotion makes them so soft in addition to smelling good.  </li>

            <li> I purchased this product because it is the one used by my local nail salon.  I&#x27;ve been trying to figure out where to get it from for years now and finally thought to look for it here and I&#x27;m glad I did because I love it! It feels and smells terrific on my skin.</li>
            <li> bought as gift /used product before loved it. took to long to arrive</li>
            <li> Used these as stocking sufferers. They smell wonderful. Feels nice on your hands.</li>
            <li> This is a very nice lotion which absorbs quickly and doesn&#x27;t feel sticky afterwards.  I ordered this mini pack so I could decide which scent I wanted in a larger bottle which I&#x27;ve already ordered so I have lots on hand.</li>
            <li> Love the sampler pack. Ever since I saw this lotion at a salon I&#x27;ve been dieing to try it. All the scents are tolerable, my fave is Mango. the consistancy is perfect not too watery ,not greasy, absorbs quick and the scent lasts for a long time.</li>
            <li> I love this lotion!  I have very sensitive skin and Avojuice feels smooth and silky with no adverse reactions.  It is a great product for the office because after about a minute on your skin there is absolutely no sticky residue so it doest gunk up your keyboard.  I have given this as stocking stuffers to friends and family and they love it as well.</li>
            <li> I LOVE these lotions for the perfect purse size that they are and mild, but aromatic scents.  However, I did not receive the six pack of lotions that are pictured here and are mentioned in the description.  This is a HUGE disappointment because I specifically looked for the right combination of six scents that I wanted.</li>
            <li> Update 4-4-14: I actually really like the Mango now, and I bought a giant bottle of the Hibiscus Blossom.  I love their scents.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I follow a lot of nail polish blogs and I have heard many times over that the Avojuice lotions are excellent.  Since there are so many scents and it seemed that everyone has a different favorite, I decided to get the sampler so I could determine which large bottle I would purchase.  My sampler did not come with exactly the same scents as listed: \\&quot;Jasmin, Cran &amp; Berry, Coconut Melon, Ginger Lily, Mango, rasbberry violet\\&quot;, mine came with Sweet Tea instead of Raspberry Violet, but I thought it was no big deal since I was searching for a good scent and I didn&#x27;t mind.  But if you are looking for the exact scents, I would email the particular seller you are planning to purchase from to find out which ones you will get.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PROS:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*** They feel really nice on your hands. It starts off feeling like a regular light hand cream, and then like 30 seconds it magically absorbs even more and leaves a silky smooth feeling without residue.&lt;br /&gt;*** Handy for travel or your purse&lt;br /&gt;*** Mango was the best scent out of the 6&lt;br /&gt;*** Below Mango I equally tolerated Cran and Berry, Sweet Tea, and Ginger Lily&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*** My favorite out of the 6 was the Mango, not because it smells amazing, but because it was the one least likely to give me a headache.  The other 3 mention above, it&#x27;s not that the smells were lacking, it&#x27;s that they smelled kind of...funny and weird.&lt;br /&gt;*** The first one I tried, which many have liked the scent of, was Jasmine, thinking that I too would like it.  OMG NO.  Immediate headache, and I had to wash it off my hands.  Extreme musk/vanilla smell.  It just does not smell like Jasmine!  I read another review about the Jasmine not smelling right so maybe they reformulated it? I don&#x27; know.  All I know is that I had to give it away before I threw it away.&lt;br /&gt;*** The Coconut Melon was also an immediate headache.  I like coconut but this one was nauseating and wrong.  Also gave away.&lt;br /&gt;*** If you have *very* dry hands I would not recommend this, because sometimes I feel that it is not enough.  But usually another dab and rub will suffice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is really too bad because I do like the lotion, I still use the 4 I saved often, and a little goes a long way.  I just expected better quality scents from OPI, since they make quality nail polish.  I guess they don&#x27;t make quality *scented* nail polish lol.  But I haven&#x27;t given up and have ordered single minis in different scents from eBay and have decided that my favorite, from the scents thus far I have tried, is the Hibiscus Blossom.

            <li> It is great.  I knew what I was ordering before I ordered it.  Not greasy; very refreshing.  I love it</li>
            <li> I particularly like this 6 pack because I can enjoy all the different wonderful scents.  I suffer from dry skin especially in the cold weather and this lotion makes them so soft in addition to smelling good.  I purchased these 6 packs for Christmas presents and everyone loved them.</li>
            <li> Loved this product. I decided I would get mini hand lotions for my bridesmaids as part of their Bridesmaid&#x27;s Survival Kit and I love them! I hope they will like it too. There was enough for five plus me :)</li>
            <li> Was given a free sample of this on Mothers Day at a Restaurant. Really smelled good and made the hands feel real soft. Looked it up on amazon and there it was in a six pack. I have gone through one bottle and starting on the second. Its a nice size for the purse and a quick feel good.</li>
            <li> OPI avojuice lotion is to die for, soaks into your skin fast and makes it feel silky smooth!  The scent of lotions in this pack are wonderful...Ginger Lily is the BEST!</li>
            <li> Fantastic lotion!!  Great scents that do not overpower and fade quickly, lotion soaks into skin and no greasy feeling.  Will be a fan for life.</li>
            <li> This stuff makes my skin feel so soft &amp; smoothie!  I ordered the trial sizes to figure out which ones I liked &amp; gave the others to my daughter.</li>
