            <li> Love this! Pleased with transaction.</li>

            <li> Well I did get what I paid for, however I am disappointed in that the perfume smell is so faint. I like to get out of&lt;br /&gt;the shower and have a pretty smell. Not so much with this wash. I do not recommend as a purchase.</li>
