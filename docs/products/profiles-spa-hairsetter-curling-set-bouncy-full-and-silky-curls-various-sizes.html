            <li>The flocking is great for wrapping and keeping your hair wound neatly.</li>
            <li>lol</li>
            <li>I had great bouncy curls.</li>
            <li>Now I am so so so happy with this set.</li>
            <li>so so happy with them.  </li>
            <li>These are great.  </li>
            <li>But, I found that even using product the curls do not stay as good as they do when I curl my hair with a curling iron.  </li>
            <li>Good Luck</li>
            <li>But they are good rollers.</li>
            <li>yes, these are good</li>
            <li>good product except for the clips.  </li>
            <li>They fit perfectly around the curlers and I&#x27;m so</li>
            <li>A wig stylist had just done my wig for my granddaughter&#x27;s wedding in Israel, and she had used a flocked hairsetter and my wig looked gorgeous.  </li>
            <li>I have been using hot rollers since I was a kid, and this is the best set I&#x27;ve had.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m in love with this set!</li>
            <li>the cute mint color the rollers are in are a plus!  </li>
            <li>and they turn out lovely!</li>
            <li>I love this curling set!  </li>
            <li>The clips that come with them are nice and hold the curlers nicely.</li>
            <li>she has used warm rollers for years-</li>
            <li>nice set</li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t recommend them unless you are the kind of person who can tolerate a lot of heat on hands and head.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>the clamps are very easy to use.</li>
            <li>Rollers come with 24 clips (not the metal pins) and they are very easy to use</li>
            <li>This setter did a fantastic job with the curlers at full heat, and not a fiber was damaged at all; I inspected every curl that I put into two wigs, and they were beautiful.  </li>
            <li>Satisfied with product.</li>
            <li>and I am in LOVE with it.</li>
            <li>but I prefer the use of these rollers because of the incredible volume, softness and natural look of the curl.  </li>
            <li>I love the sizes and the clips.</li>
            <li>you do it neatly and securely, you will end up with nice curls.</li>
            <li>This heat setter meets every need I could not find in most others:&lt;br</li>
            <li>(most important)&lt;br /&gt;</li>
            <li>when I don&#x27;t think that I will be able to find another set of them.</li>
            <li>though they might hold for  most of a day if set in the AM.</li>
            <li>They might be better for someone with thinner hair.</li>
            <li>Wish the set had the slid on clips and the price was lower but love the set.  </li>
            <li>love the clips that come with them.  </li>
            <li>I love the clips.</li>
            <li>I wish I had discovered this product many years ago.</li>
            <li>Love the clips.</li>
            <li>I find that this evenly gets all of my hair and creates a better curl.  </li>
            <li>Love this set!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Perhaps in the United States the flocked rollers don&#x27;t work on synthetic hair wigs, but I think it&#x27;s more of a disclaimer than anything else.  </li>
            <li>I WONDERED HOW MANY MORE WOULD COME OFF DURING THE COURSE OF USE.  </li>
            <li>SURE</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure otherwise it&#x27;s a fine product.</li>
            <li>I received and have been using the hot roller and like them; however, the clips that are supposed to secure the rollers in the hair do not do a good job.  </li>
            <li>setter costs more than the others, but it&#x27;s totally worth it!</li>
            <li>I&amp;#34;ve taken them traveling and they are easy to put in the bottom of a carry on bag, and I&#x27;ve even had them in checked baggage with no damage.</li>
            <li>Easy to use.</li>
            <li>I owned an older version of the flocked rollers and just loved them.  </li>
            <li>Lots more rollers than the old one and just as good.</li>
            <li>Not for fine, mid-length hair.</li>
            <li>On the positive side, it&#x27;s nice to have 24 rollers.</li>
            <li>For anyone with fine hair who is looking for genuine curls, don&#x27;t buy this set.</li>
            <li>I returned those rollers for these and overall am happy with them.  </li>
            <li>The rollers are flocked so they roll up smooth</li>
            <li>They are the best for staying firmly on the roller.</li>
            <li>The clips that come with them are FANTASTIC.</li>
            <li>Also, the clips can fit any size roller that is used, so one needn&#x27;t keep track of which size clip one is using.  </li>
            <li>I wanted to like these, I really did!!!  </li>
            <li>Once again I got these for my wife and she seems to like them quite well, Quick and easy to use</li>
            <li>I was really excited to try these, based on the reviews I read.  </li>
            <li>Love the flocking, and the color of the roller is pretty (just a perk).</li>
            <li>The selection of sizes is perfect, I really like the plastic clips instead of the old school metal ones, and they heat up thoroughly and relatively fast.</li>
            <li>She has long hair and feels the variety of roller sizes is great</li>
            <li>Stays hot and produces better curls as a result.</li>
            <li>The cushion on the rollers is gentle to my hair and I get that bouncy healthy looking hair in no time.</li>
            <li>The roller edges stay cool</li>
            <li>Ok, the first time I tried these, my curls fell right out.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have super curly hair, which I didn&#x27;t want.</li>
            <li>They heat quickly and give curls with lots of body.  </li>
            <li>Work well, but know they get very hot.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a sturdy little set that I am very glad I have!</li>
            <li>By the end of the day, they dropped to gorgeous loose curls (</li>
            <li>This product is well worth the money.  </li>
            <li>I let them warm up for 30 minutes and left them in for 30.  </li>
            <li>My old curlers worked fine, but I thought new ones would work better . .</li>
            <li>-- Overall, great product, set is not too large so takes up less room than other sets and works great!</li>
            <li>I contacted Amazon.com right away and UPS has already picked them up for a return.</li>
            <li>I used the old time Clairol hot rollers many years ago and never had any problems.  </li>
            <li>This is the best set of hot rollers I have ever owned, and I&#x27;ve owned several other drug store brands.</li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;Still loving the set (not that it&#x27;s been very long).</li>
            <li>Curlers heat up quickly (15 min max) and it does not take long to set hair to create voluminous, soft, beautiful, natural looking curls.</li>
            <li>The curlers heat up fairly quickly, and you will only burn your hand very mildly if at all while rolling.</li>
            <li>They aren&#x27;t all that different heat-wise than my former Remington rollers, but there are more of them and they seem to do the job ok.</li>
            <li>They work exactly as well as your talent in rolling</li>
            <li>They were so hot</li>
            <li>They were still so hot that they irritated my scalp.</li>
            <li>I have been using this brand of curlers for many years and this will be my third purchase of them.  </li>
            <li>I have used hot rollers for over 40 years.  </li>
            <li>Some attention needs to be made to design a better clip when used in short hair.  </li>
            <li>I like that it has more small rollers than most multi-size units.</li>
            <li>The rollers are too hot to handle, and too hot for the scalp to stand.  </li>
            <li>When I first bought these rollers, I was unsure because I didn&#x27;t even know what brand they were</li>
            <li>and then they&#x27;re ready!</li>
            <li>Overall, I&#x27;m in love wtih these and</li>
            <li>although I think I would have preferred if these came with the large white clamp clips because they seem to hold the hair better than the ones in this set.</li>
            <li>The seller packaged them very well - no damage at all - and the price was very reasonable.</li>
            <li>Overall, this product is LOVELY.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, just to mention as help, I like to hold the top end of the curler and roll my hair around it starting from the top (not from the bottom rolling up as some people do, and how you normally use a curling iron).</li>
            <li>, I hairsprayed them very lightly and waited 5 minutes for the hairspray to dry, and took them out.</li>
            <li>I tried the Babyliss rollers first since they were rated very well.  </li>
            <li>These may work better in long hair</li>
            <li>The curlers are nice looking, and easy to use, but they don&#x27;t get hot enough to give really tight curls.  </li>
            <li>Gave to younger grand daughter, safe enough for a 12 year old to handle.</li>
            <li>There is a lot I like about them - they heat up in short amount of time and are easy to work with.  </li>
            <li>Easy to set different types of curls</li>
            <li>Since there are 24 rollers, I was not overly concerned about one with a bit of disfigurement, although I certainly keep the rollers in sight while heating them.  </li>
            <li>bought them for my wife and see really likes the rollers</li>
            <li>but they heat up fast</li>
            <li>But the flocking really DOES help.</li>
            <li>Very disapointed.</li>
            <li>The only complaint I have is that one of the smallest roller had bumpy plastic around the top as if it had been exposed somehow to the heating element or a heating process of some kind.  </li>
            <li>These rollers really make a difference in the style.  </li>
            <li>The curling set was as described and it functions very satisfactorily.</li>
            <li>which is what I really want).  </li>
            <li>since I have so much, it takes quite a while to finish) or when I just wake up</li>
            <li>If I do them the day of, since they are rollers, they do come out really curly.  </li>
            <li>I could easily grasp an entire curler in my hand and felt only mild heat.</li>
            <li>I have very fine, short hair and only the smallest rollers would go in my hair.  </li>
            <li>I use them daily, but still, I think they should last more than 2 years.  </li>
            <li>I am older</li>
            <li>The curls were super bouncy and actually STAYED.</li>
            <li>Also, having so much hair, I&#x27;m so glad I can do my whole head with these (usually with 1 or 2 to spare)</li>
            <li>It has a black dot on top that turns red when the curlers are hot and ready.</li>
            <li>Has only one temperature &#x3D; extremely HOT!</li>
            <li>I tried them right when I got them and left them in for 10 minutes</li>
            <li>And just FYI, my hair is stick straight (asian) very long (almost to my bum) fine hair</li>
            <li>I deffinitely would recommend these rollers to anyone who is searching for a new set.</li>
            <li>and I just wanted to get some new ones.  </li>
            <li>Comes out looking very natural.</li>
            <li>I use no hairsprays, but wear my wigs in a very natural look.  </li>
            <li>Gets hot enough to set the curl without burning the fingers when using the product.</li>
            <li>but does not get hot enough.  </li>
            <li>The rollers get hot enough</li>
            <li>This hot roller set has several things I dislike - one</li>
            <li>This hair setter, despite being on for 30 minutes, never did get hot enough.</li>
            <li>The clips are entirely too large and do not work if you place curlers closely and roll to your scalp.</li>
            <li>I was so excited to see so many smaller sized rollers, however, they were not as small as I expected.  </li>
            <li>The flocked (soft, fuzzy) surface of the roller helps hold the hair in place.</li>
            <li>I would definitely recommend this product to everyone who has straight hair like mine.</li>
            <li>All I do after it sets completely</li>
            <li>It makes it easier if I hold the roller roughly halfway up my hair shaft (my hair is right at my shoulders)and</li>
            <li>I blow dry my hair and the curlers are heated and ready to go!</li>
            <li>Heat time is a little too long, but otherwise I am pleased with the product.</li>
            <li>I did have exactly what I wanted, which was tons of volume and bigger looser curls (even using the smaller rollers).</li>
            <li>They aren&#x27;t hard to fit back in the case (for me) and they curl really well.</li>
            <li>In my lifetime I have spent a fortune on hot curlers of every brand and type; none of which were satisfactory.</li>
            <li>Finally I tried waiting a longer period of time for them to cool down, but then they weren&#x27;t hot enough to actually curl my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The rollers produced soft, very loose waves that fell straight almost immediately after brushing.</li>
            <li>Also, I hold the end with one hand because the flocked part of the curler is not too hot (but the bottom end is), and then use my other hand to clip the hair.  </li>
            <li>Not only were they too large, the smallest of the small slid right out of my hair.  </li>
            <li>It does take a few minutes more to heat up than other units.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d so far only used it to straighten, but I thought, I&#x27;ll try it.</li>
            <li>I find that if I roll the curlers too far up, they can leave kinks in my hair, but I like to roll them about several inches away from my scalp (hanging)</li>
            <li>/&gt;They take a while to heat up, approximately 15 minutes, but I&#x27;m okay with that.</li>
            <li>Took a few tries to learn but now I&#x27;m perfectly fine.  </li>
            <li>I use only the very smallest curlers, and it makes wavy types of curls that don&#x27;t last that long.  </li>
            <li>I prefer the regular old simple clips.</li>
            <li>but she says that there just a little hot to hold on to so</li>
            <li>I had long, fine hair at the time, very little curl and did not last.</li>
            <li>If your hair is hard to curl (like mine), leave the rollers in until they are completely cool.</li>
            <li>and this last set barely 2 years.  </li>
            <li>So be aware, that it will give your hair body, but don&#x27;t count on tight curls that last all day.  </li>
            <li>My first set lasted almost 5 years, second set just a few years</li>
            <li>I really like the clips that hold the rollers in place because they leave no mark on the hair fibers and keep them tightly locked in place.  </li>
            <li>Perhaps for thin short hair they would have been fine.</li>

            <li> I WONDERED HOW MANY MORE WOULD COME OFF DURING THE COURSE OF USE.  </li>
            <li> SURE</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure otherwise it&#x27;s a fine product.</li>
            <li> I received and have been using the hot roller and like them; however, the clips that are supposed to secure the rollers in the hair do not do a good job.  </li>
            <li> setter costs more than the others, but it&#x27;s totally worth it!</li>
            <li> I&amp;#34;ve taken them traveling and they are easy to put in the bottom of a carry on bag, and I&#x27;ve even had them in checked baggage with no damage.</li>
            <li> Easy to use.</li>
            <li> I owned an older version of the flocked rollers and just loved them.  </li>
            <li> Lots more rollers than the old one and just as good.</li>
            <li> Not for fine, mid-length hair.</li>
            <li> On the positive side, it&#x27;s nice to have 24 rollers.</li>
            <li> For anyone with fine hair who is looking for genuine curls, don&#x27;t buy this set.</li>
            <li> I returned those rollers for these and overall am happy with them.  </li>
            <li> The rollers are flocked so they roll up smooth</li>
            <li> They are the best for staying firmly on the roller.</li>
            <li> The clips that come with them are FANTASTIC.</li>
            <li> Also, the clips can fit any size roller that is used, so one needn&#x27;t keep track of which size clip one is using.  </li>
            <li> I wanted to like these, I really did!!!  </li>
            <li> Once again I got these for my wife and she seems to like them quite well, Quick and easy to use</li>
            <li> I was really excited to try these, based on the reviews I read.  </li>
            <li> Love the flocking, and the color of the roller is pretty (just a perk).</li>
            <li> The selection of sizes is perfect, I really like the plastic clips instead of the old school metal ones, and they heat up thoroughly and relatively fast.</li>
            <li> She has long hair and feels the variety of roller sizes is great</li>
            <li> Stays hot and produces better curls as a result.</li>
            <li> The cushion on the rollers is gentle to my hair and I get that bouncy healthy looking hair in no time.</li>
            <li> The roller edges stay cool</li>
            <li> Ok, the first time I tried these, my curls fell right out.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have super curly hair, which I didn&#x27;t want.</li>
            <li> They heat quickly and give curls with lots of body.  </li>
            <li> Work well, but know they get very hot.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a sturdy little set that I am very glad I have!</li>
            <li> By the end of the day, they dropped to gorgeous loose curls (</li>
            <li> This product is well worth the money.  </li>
            <li> I let them warm up for 30 minutes and left them in for 30.  </li>
            <li> My old curlers worked fine, but I thought new ones would work better . .</li>
            <li> -- Overall, great product, set is not too large so takes up less room than other sets and works great!</li>
            <li> I contacted Amazon.com right away and UPS has already picked them up for a return.</li>
            <li> I used the old time Clairol hot rollers many years ago and never had any problems.  </li>
            <li> This is the best set of hot rollers I have ever owned, and I&#x27;ve owned several other drug store brands.</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;Still loving the set (not that it&#x27;s been very long).</li>
            <li> Curlers heat up quickly (15 min max) and it does not take long to set hair to create voluminous, soft, beautiful, natural looking curls.</li>
            <li> The curlers heat up fairly quickly, and you will only burn your hand very mildly if at all while rolling.</li>
            <li> They aren&#x27;t all that different heat-wise than my former Remington rollers, but there are more of them and they seem to do the job ok.</li>
            <li> They work exactly as well as your talent in rolling</li>
            <li> They were so hot</li>
            <li> They were still so hot that they irritated my scalp.</li>
            <li> I have been using this brand of curlers for many years and this will be my third purchase of them.  </li>
            <li> I have used hot rollers for over 40 years.  </li>
            <li> Some attention needs to be made to design a better clip when used in short hair.  </li>
            <li> I like that it has more small rollers than most multi-size units.</li>
            <li> The rollers are too hot to handle, and too hot for the scalp to stand.  </li>
            <li> When I first bought these rollers, I was unsure because I didn&#x27;t even know what brand they were</li>
            <li> and then they&#x27;re ready!</li>
            <li> Overall, I&#x27;m in love wtih these and</li>
            <li> although I think I would have preferred if these came with the large white clamp clips because they seem to hold the hair better than the ones in this set.</li>
            <li> The seller packaged them very well - no damage at all - and the price was very reasonable.</li>
            <li> Overall, this product is LOVELY.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, just to mention as help, I like to hold the top end of the curler and roll my hair around it starting from the top (not from the bottom rolling up as some people do, and how you normally use a curling iron).</li>
            <li> , I hairsprayed them very lightly and waited 5 minutes for the hairspray to dry, and took them out.</li>
            <li> I tried the Babyliss rollers first since they were rated very well.  </li>
            <li> These may work better in long hair</li>
            <li> The curlers are nice looking, and easy to use, but they don&#x27;t get hot enough to give really tight curls.  </li>
            <li> Gave to younger grand daughter, safe enough for a 12 year old to handle.</li>
            <li> There is a lot I like about them - they heat up in short amount of time and are easy to work with.  </li>
            <li> Easy to set different types of curls</li>
            <li> Since there are 24 rollers, I was not overly concerned about one with a bit of disfigurement, although I certainly keep the rollers in sight while heating them.  </li>
            <li> bought them for my wife and see really likes the rollers</li>
            <li> but they heat up fast</li>
            <li> But the flocking really DOES help.</li>
            <li> Very disapointed.</li>
            <li> The only complaint I have is that one of the smallest roller had bumpy plastic around the top as if it had been exposed somehow to the heating element or a heating process of some kind.  </li>
            <li> These rollers really make a difference in the style.  </li>
            <li> The curling set was as described and it functions very satisfactorily.</li>
            <li> which is what I really want).  </li>
            <li> since I have so much, it takes quite a while to finish) or when I just wake up</li>
            <li> If I do them the day of, since they are rollers, they do come out really curly.  </li>
            <li> I could easily grasp an entire curler in my hand and felt only mild heat.</li>
            <li> I have very fine, short hair and only the smallest rollers would go in my hair.  </li>
            <li> I use them daily, but still, I think they should last more than 2 years.  </li>
            <li> I am older</li>
            <li> The curls were super bouncy and actually STAYED.</li>
            <li> Also, having so much hair, I&#x27;m so glad I can do my whole head with these (usually with 1 or 2 to spare)</li>
            <li> It has a black dot on top that turns red when the curlers are hot and ready.</li>
            <li> Has only one temperature &#x3D; extremely HOT!</li>
            <li> I tried them right when I got them and left them in for 10 minutes</li>
            <li> And just FYI, my hair is stick straight (asian) very long (almost to my bum) fine hair</li>
            <li> I deffinitely would recommend these rollers to anyone who is searching for a new set.</li>
            <li> and I just wanted to get some new ones.  </li>
            <li> Comes out looking very natural.</li>
            <li> I use no hairsprays, but wear my wigs in a very natural look.  </li>
            <li> Gets hot enough to set the curl without burning the fingers when using the product.</li>
            <li> but does not get hot enough.  </li>
            <li> The rollers get hot enough</li>
            <li> This hot roller set has several things I dislike - one</li>
            <li> This hair setter, despite being on for 30 minutes, never did get hot enough.</li>
            <li> The clips are entirely too large and do not work if you place curlers closely and roll to your scalp.</li>
            <li> I was so excited to see so many smaller sized rollers, however, they were not as small as I expected.  </li>
            <li> The flocked (soft, fuzzy) surface of the roller helps hold the hair in place.</li>
            <li> I would definitely recommend this product to everyone who has straight hair like mine.</li>
            <li> All I do after it sets completely</li>
            <li> It makes it easier if I hold the roller roughly halfway up my hair shaft (my hair is right at my shoulders)and</li>
            <li> I blow dry my hair and the curlers are heated and ready to go!</li>
            <li> Heat time is a little too long, but otherwise I am pleased with the product.</li>
            <li> I did have exactly what I wanted, which was tons of volume and bigger looser curls (even using the smaller rollers).</li>
            <li> They aren&#x27;t hard to fit back in the case (for me) and they curl really well.</li>
            <li> In my lifetime I have spent a fortune on hot curlers of every brand and type; none of which were satisfactory.</li>
            <li> Finally I tried waiting a longer period of time for them to cool down, but then they weren&#x27;t hot enough to actually curl my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The rollers produced soft, very loose waves that fell straight almost immediately after brushing.</li>
            <li> Also, I hold the end with one hand because the flocked part of the curler is not too hot (but the bottom end is), and then use my other hand to clip the hair.  </li>
            <li> Not only were they too large, the smallest of the small slid right out of my hair.  </li>
            <li> It does take a few minutes more to heat up than other units.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d so far only used it to straighten, but I thought, I&#x27;ll try it.</li>
            <li> I find that if I roll the curlers too far up, they can leave kinks in my hair, but I like to roll them about several inches away from my scalp (hanging)</li>
            <li> /&gt;They take a while to heat up, approximately 15 minutes, but I&#x27;m okay with that.</li>
            <li> Took a few tries to learn but now I&#x27;m perfectly fine.  </li>
            <li> I use only the very smallest curlers, and it makes wavy types of curls that don&#x27;t last that long.  </li>
            <li> I prefer the regular old simple clips.</li>
            <li> but she says that there just a little hot to hold on to so</li>
            <li> I had long, fine hair at the time, very little curl and did not last.</li>
            <li> If your hair is hard to curl (like mine), leave the rollers in until they are completely cool.</li>
            <li> and this last set barely 2 years.  </li>
            <li> So be aware, that it will give your hair body, but don&#x27;t count on tight curls that last all day.  </li>
            <li> My first set lasted almost 5 years, second set just a few years</li>
            <li> I really like the clips that hold the rollers in place because they leave no mark on the hair fibers and keep them tightly locked in place.  </li>
            <li> Perhaps for thin short hair they would have been fine.</li>
            <li> I have long thick hair and needed something with more rollers that gets hotter than your average drug store brand.  </li>
            <li> I tried waiting a few seconds or minutes for them to cool down a bit.</li>
            <li> The curler heated up quickly and cooled down a little slower.  </li>
            <li> But that is minor - especially since you can always buy extra clips.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure who did the ratings for that product, but it absolutely did not even attempt to curl my hair.  </li>
            <li> I use this product several times a week in the morning before work and it does not take too long for those that are in a hurry in the morning.  </li>
            <li> Two - I don&#x27;t care how long you leave the rollers in,(I&#x27;ve left in for an hour)</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t hold them in my hands long enough to get them into my hair.</li>
            <li> IN MY PRESENT HAIRSETTER WERE NOT LARGE ENOUGH.</li>
            <li> I just started wearing my hair long.  </li>
            <li> My wigs range from moderately curly to very curly and when they&#x27;re washed and dried, they need a small amount of curling to get back their style.  </li>
            <li> Not sure if they get quite as hot as my previous profile curlers, but appear satisfactory.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m not a professional!  </li>
            <li> Larger quantity of every size of rollers than other sets have.</li>
            <li> The roller is not available for use until everything cools enough to pick it up and push it back together.</li>
            <li> I slept in them and they are still in loose curls.</li>
            <li> This new style of split rollers does not work for my thick (</li>
            <li> With my previous sets  I could expect the curl to last 2 days.  </li>
            <li> Sadly, I&#x27;ve bought hot rollers in the last few years that just didn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li> the curl is only &amp;#34;soft&amp;#34;; don&#x27;t expect to get very tight curls from this set.</li>
            <li> The only thing I will say, is that the clips that come with the set sometimes will leave a small crimp on her hair where they are locked in place.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried the other type of clips, but they don&#x27;t stay in as well.</li>
            <li> and they only had very few reviews (The brand is Profiles).</li>
            <li> its hard to find a set with smaller curlers in them like i need.</li>
            <li> I decided to give it one last ditch effort because I know my hair is hard to curl.</li>
            <li> , I run some water on the ends and pull them down</li>
            <li> , I have very long hair (just past my waist), so each roller gets a lot of hair wrapped around it.</li>
            <li> ABOUT HALF WAY THROUGH SETTING MY HAIR</li>
            <li> This setter has the individual heat posts rather than the little &amp;#34;wire&amp;#34; that goes across that the rollers hang on like all of the &amp;#34;ion&amp;#34; setters (which I&#x27;ve purchased several of and have found each useless).</li>
            <li> There are little feet at the bottom to wrap the cord, which makes storing them easier.</li>
            <li> that would be the one missing star.</li>
            <li> It relaxes after a few minutes, but I do want to mention that.</li>
            <li> I used all of the smallest rollers and a few medium sized ones.</li>
            <li> Curls do not look frozen or stiff as you often get with curling irons.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately, they would no longer heat up...after possibly 10 yrs.</li>
            <li> Needless to say, this is going back!</li>
            <li> Unfortunately I had to send them back and will have to stick with my curling iron.</li>
            <li> Needless to say, the set went back, in a hurry.</li>
            <li> Heating and makes my very thin hair last all day!  </li>
            <li> Hard to get hair around rollers.</li>
            <li> Clips are a bit hard</li>
            <li> Please note I am generally hard on things.  </li>
            <li> Each one had one or two negative factors.</li>
            <li> Rollers very hard to handle because of the heat and the small edges.</li>
            <li> At first, when I started reading the booklet that came with it, I was very disappointed because it said that it should not be used on synthetic wigs.  </li>
            <li> I am the world&#x27;s worst when it comes to rolling my hair in hot rollers.</li>
            <li> I have length very thick hair.  </li>
            <li> IT WAS A CASE OF POOR MANUFACTURING AND POOR QUALITY ASSURANCE.  </li>
            <li> I would only use this roller set if I hated my hair, and wanted to frizzle it all off my head.  </li>
            <li> I was wrong.  </li>
            <li> Disappointing.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t know if I just got a bad one or what.  </li>
            <li> You will be disappointed.</li>
            <li> Hated the metal ones that poke into your head.  </li>
            <li> And the wire, bobby pin type is the worst.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I buy the plastic curlers and use the tops on these instead of the clips provided.  Do not wrap the cords or they can develop a short in the wire or wear out easier.  This is my 3rd set in 8 years, because they curl the hair in 5 minutes and I can&#x27;t stand rollers or anything in my head at night or I get a headache by morning.</li>
            <li> I was really excited to try these, based on the reviews I read.  There is a lot I like about them - they heat up in short amount of time and are easy to work with.  The clips that come with them are nice and hold the curlers nicely. But, I found that even using product the curls do not stay as good as they do when I curl my hair with a curling iron.  Disappointing.</li>
            <li> bought them for my wife and see really likes the rollers but she says that there just a little hot to hold on to so that would be the one missing star. but they heat up fast</li>
            <li> Satisfied with product. Received in timely manner. Not sure if they get quite as hot as my previous profile curlers, but appear satisfactory.</li>
            <li> Gave this to my daughter for her birthday- she has used warm rollers for years- she loves this set - a variety of rollers and the clamps are very easy to use.</li>
            <li> I am the world&#x27;s worst when it comes to rolling my hair in hot rollers. But the flocking really DOES help. It makes it easier if I hold the roller roughly halfway up my hair shaft (my hair is right at my shoulders)and then start wrapping the bottom around, then just roll the rest up. Ok, the first time I tried these, my curls fell right out. I let them heat up 15 min, I left them in for 30. This time, I let them heat up about 25 min, and I did 1 step I deem crucial: I used my Redken starch spray 15. This basically pre-treats your hair to hold whatever heat treatment you do (straighten, curl, etc) and I am in LOVE with it. I&#x27;d so far only used it to straighten, but I thought, I&#x27;ll try it. So, I sprayed it before rolling each section. Then, I sprayed my entire head w/ hairspray after I had all my rollers in, and I left them in about an hour. I don&#x27;t have super curly hair, which I didn&#x27;t want. I did have exactly what I wanted, which was tons of volume and bigger looser curls (even using the smaller rollers). They are still lasting over 6 hours after I took them out. I will definitely keep this set, I just had to tweak my routine a bit! Love the flocking, and the color of the roller is pretty (just a perk).</li>
            <li> I bought this here,  because it was basically the only place i could find it! Great price too!</li>
            <li> Rollers never heated enough to curl my hair. I had long, fine hair at the time, very little curl and did not last.</li>
            <li> Rollers very hard to handle because of the heat and the small edges. Hard to get hair around rollers. Very disapointed.</li>
            <li> This product is well worth the money.  The flocked (soft, fuzzy) surface of the roller helps hold the hair in place. Curlers heat up quickly (15 min max) and it does not take long to set hair to create voluminous, soft, beautiful, natural looking curls. I use this product several times a week in the morning before work and it does not take too long for those that are in a hurry in the morning.  I also have a curling iron but I prefer the use of these rollers because of the incredible volume, softness and natural look of the curl.  Curls do not look frozen or stiff as you often get with curling irons.  Tip: Use a heat protection spray before you place hair around the roller. Once all of your hair is on the rollers, add a bit of flexible hair spray while it is cooling. Your curls will last all day! Rollers come with 24 clips (not the metal pins) and they are very easy to use although I think I would have preferred if these came with the large white clamp clips because they seem to hold the hair better than the ones in this set. But that is minor - especially since you can always buy extra clips. -- Overall, great product, set is not too large so takes up less room than other sets and works great!</li>
            <li> These rollers work great! I love the sizes and the clips. I deffinitely would recommend these rollers to anyone who is searching for a new set.</li>
            <li> I have long thick hair and needed something with more rollers that gets hotter than your average drug store brand.

            <li> The curlers heat up fairly quickly, and you will only burn your hand very mildly if at all while rolling. They work exactly as well as your talent in rolling curls.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you do it neatly and securely, you will end up with nice curls.</li>
            <li> This is the best set of curlers that I have ever owed. Gets hot enough to set the curl without burning the fingers when using the product.</li>
            <li> I had Profiles Spa rollers for several years and they were terrific.  Unfortunately, they would no longer heat up...after possibly 10 yrs. of excellent service.  So, I knew I wanted to purchase the same brand and did so via Amazon.  The only complaint I have is that one of the smallest roller had bumpy plastic around the top as if it had been exposed somehow to the heating element or a heating process of some kind.  Since there are 24 rollers, I was not overly concerned about one with a bit of disfigurement, although I certainly keep the rollers in sight while heating them.  Heat time is a little too long, but otherwise I am pleased with the product.</li>
            <li> I just started wearing my hair long.  These rollers really make a difference in the style.  Easy to set different types of curls</li>
            <li> nice set but does not get hot enough.  Don&#x27;t know if I just got a bad one or what.  Gave to younger grand daughter, safe enough for a 12 year old to handle.</li>
            <li> This set is awesome! I blow dry my hair and the curlers are heated and ready to go! The cushion on the rollers is gentle to my hair and I get that bouncy healthy looking hair in no time. I don&#x27;t know when I&#x27;ll ever stand there and curl every section piece by piece again. The only thing I will say, is that the clips that come with the set sometimes will leave a small crimp on her hair where they are locked in place. It relaxes after a few minutes, but I do want to mention that. I did buy extra clips (in case I lose some in the future) but there are plenty that come with the roller set.</li>
            <li> The Spa 24 Profiles Curling set arrived in excellent condition. The curling set was as described and it functions very satisfactorily.</li>
            <li> Work well, but know they get very hot.</li>
            <li> This heat setter meets every need I could not find in most others:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* The rollers get hot enough (most important)&lt;br /&gt;* There are plenty of each of the 3 sizes (8 each)&lt;br /&gt;* The rollers are flocked so they roll up smooth&lt;br /&gt;* The roller edges stay cool&lt;br /&gt;* It has an on/off switch&lt;br /&gt;* Even the lid closes quietly, something I&#x27;ve never found in another heat setter and didn&#x27;t know I needed until now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This setter costs more than the others, but it&#x27;s totally worth it! This setter has the individual heat posts rather than the little &amp;#34;wire&amp;#34; that goes across that the rollers hang on like all of the &amp;#34;ion&amp;#34; setters (which I&#x27;ve purchased several of and have found each useless). Also, the posts are labeled as to which size roller goes where, but any of the sizes can go on any of that posts, another feature I&#x27;ve never seen in another setter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For comparison to help determine what results you can expect personally, I have very long hair (just past my waist), so each roller gets a lot of hair wrapped around it. Using the largest rollers and leaving them in for only about 5 minutes got me glorious, long-lasting curls.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m going to buy another one for when this one finally wears out. I don&#x27;t want to have to do without it again.</li>
            <li> I have been using hot rollers since I was a kid, and this is the best set I&#x27;ve had. The selection of sizes is perfect, I really like the plastic clips instead of the old school metal ones, and they heat up thoroughly and relatively fast. The velvet covering makes it easier to capture stray hair, and the curl lasts for a couple of days if maintained with enough hairspray. There are little feet at the bottom to wrap the cord, which makes storing them easier. The seller packaged them very well - no damage at all - and the price was very reasonable. I&amp;#34;ve taken them traveling and they are easy to put in the bottom of a carry on bag, and I&#x27;ve even had them in checked baggage with no damage. It&#x27;s a sturdy little set that I am very glad I have!</li>
            <li> This hot roller set has several things I dislike - one the &amp;#34;clamps&amp;#34; are too large/big/tall; the front ones are in the way when curling the back of head. Two - I don&#x27;t care how long you leave the rollers in,(I&#x27;ve left in for an hour) the curl is only &amp;#34;soft&amp;#34;; don&#x27;t expect to get very tight curls from this set. I don&#x27;t think curlers get as &amp;#34;hot&amp;#34; as others seem to rate it. On the positive side, it&#x27;s nice to have 24 rollers.</li>
            <li> Heating and makes my very thin hair last all day!  Clips are a bit hard but I&#x27;m not a professional!  I just keep trying different ways to use them and place them</li>
            <li> This is the best set of hot rollers I have ever owned, and I&#x27;ve owned several other drug store brands.</li>
            <li> Beware! I don&#x27;t know if this product was defective or what. I followed the instructions and waited 15 minutes for the rollers to heat up. They were so hot I couldn&#x27;t hold them in my hands long enough to get them into my hair. I tried waiting a few seconds or minutes for them to cool down a bit. They were still so hot that they irritated my scalp. Finally I tried waiting a longer period of time for them to cool down, but then they weren&#x27;t hot enough to actually curl my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I wouldn&#x27;t recommend them unless you are the kind of person who can tolerate a lot of heat on hands and head.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No reflection on the seller, it&#x27;s not their fault. I contacted Amazon.com right away and UPS has already picked them up for a return.</li>
            <li> I have been using this brand of curlers for many years and this will be my third purchase of them.  My first set lasted almost 5 years, second set just a few years and this last set barely 2 years.  I use them daily, but still, I think they should last more than 2 years.  They heat quickly and give curls with lots of body.  I panic when I don&#x27;t think that I will be able to find another set of them.</li>
            <li> I have very fine, short hair and only the smallest rollers would go in my hair.  I&#x27;m sure otherwise it&#x27;s a fine product.</li>
            <li> I started to roll my hair. If I&#x27;m in a hurry, I plug them in &amp; start rolling my hair. Ten minutes later, it&#x27;s time to take them out &amp; style my hair.</li>
            <li> Not for fine, mid-length hair. This hair setter, despite being on for 30 minutes, never did get hot enough. I could easily grasp an entire curler in my hand and felt only mild heat. The clips are entirely too large and do not work if you place curlers closely and roll to your scalp. They flip-flop around and left an indentation in my hair. I used all of the smallest rollers and a few medium sized ones. When I took them out after 15-20 minutes, I had nothing. The rollers produced soft, very loose waves that fell straight almost immediately after brushing. For anyone with fine hair who is looking for genuine curls, don&#x27;t buy this set. You will be disappointed. Needless to say, this is going back!</li>
            <li> I have used hot rollers for over 40 years.  This new style of split rollers does not work for my thick (though above chin length) hair. I have kept them out of desperation. I returned 5 others to stores.  Since I retired I set my hair after washing at night (rather than 5 AM for 40 years)and take the rollers out prior to going to sleep. With my previous sets  I could expect the curl to last 2 days.  Not so with these though they might hold for  most of a day if set in the AM. They might be better for someone with thinner hair. Good Luck</li>
            <li> Sadly, I&#x27;ve bought hot rollers in the last few years that just didn&#x27;t work. I had almost given up. But these are great. They aren&#x27;t hard to fit back in the case (for me) and they curl really well.</li>
            <li> Wish the set had the slid on clips and the price was lower but love the set.  its hard to find a set with smaller curlers in them like i need.</li>
            <li> Once again I got these for my wife and she seems to like them quite well, Quick and easy to use</li>
            <li> The curlers are nice looking, and easy to use, but they don&#x27;t get hot enough to give really tight curls.  I use only the very smallest curlers, and it makes wavy types of curls that don&#x27;t last that long.  So be aware, that it will give your hair body, but don&#x27;t count on tight curls that last all day.  Product was purchased in Sept. 2014.</li>
            <li> I received and have been using the hot roller and like them; however, the clips that are supposed to secure the rollers in the hair do not do a good job.  Some attention needs to be made to design a better clip when used in short hair.  These may work better in long hair but I can&#x27;t verify as I have short hair.</li>
            <li> I have length very thick hair.  Because of the coating on them there wasn&#x27;t enough heat to hold the curl.  Perhaps for thin short hair they would have been fine.</li>
            <li> I bought these several years ago, they still worked but the lid broke and I just wanted to get some new ones.  Please note I am generally hard on things.  anyone else would not have had that problem.  But they are good rollers. love the clips that come with them.  Hated the metal ones that poke into your head.  yes, these are good</li>
            <li> Bought for my daughter who loves it.  She has long hair and feels the variety of roller sizes is great</li>
            <li> Even though rollers were flocked, couldn&#x27;t get them to stay in hair.  I used the old time Clairol hot rollers many years ago and never had any problems.  Sent these back and went back to my curling iron.</li>
            <li> good product except for the clips.  I am older so the clips are unweildy for me to use.  I prefer the regular old simple clips.</li>
            <li> I like that it has more small rollers than most multi-size units. It does take a few minutes more to heat up than other units.</li>
            <li> I wanted to like this!  I was so excited to see so many smaller sized rollers, however, they were not as small as I expected.  Not only were they too large, the smallest of the small slid right out of my hair.  Unfortunately I had to send them back and will have to stick with my curling iron.</li>
            <li> Larger quantity of every size of rollers than other sets have. Stays hot and produces better curls as a result.</li>
            <li> Has only one temperature &#x3D; extremely HOT! The rollers are too hot to handle, and too hot for the scalp to stand.  I would only use this roller set if I hated my hair, and wanted to frizzle it all off my head.  Needless to say, the set went back, in a hurry.</li>
            <li> In my lifetime I have spent a fortune on hot curlers of every brand and type; none of which were satisfactory. Each one had one or two negative factors. This product has no negatives. It has 24 rollers instead of the paltry amount others provide. The flocking is great for wrapping and keeping your hair wound neatly. I love the clips. They are the best for staying firmly on the roller. I&#x27;ve tried the other type of clips, but they don&#x27;t stay in as well. And the wire, bobby pin type is the worst. Some electric curlers I&#x27;ve used succumb to gravity causing me to roll again and again. I would definitely recommend this product to everyone who has straight hair like mine. It has a black dot on top that turns red when the curlers are hot and ready. A bag for the clips is included. If your hair is hard to curl (like mine), leave the rollers in until they are completely cool. I wish I had discovered this product many years ago.</li>
            <li> The end of the rollers separate when lifting them off the heating rod.  The roller is not available for use until everything cools enough to pick it up and push it back together.</li>
            <li> Easy to use. No crinkles . Love the clips. Comes out looking very natural. I just went through chemotherapy so lost my hair, but can&#x27;t wait to use this again lol</li>
            <li> When I first bought these rollers, I was unsure because I didn&#x27;t even know what brand they were and they only had very few reviews (The brand is Profiles). But I had initially bought them because of the sizes (I have jumbo rollers so I wanted some rollers that were pretty small for variation.  I tried them right when I got them and left them in for 10 minutes (the box says to do 5) and took them out. I had great bouncy curls. In about 5-10 minutes, all the curls were gone even with hairspray.. Dissapointed but determined, I tried again and left them in for 15 minutes and took them out. In 5-10 minutes, the same thing happened.  And just FYI, my hair is stick straight (asian) very long (almost to my bum) fine hair but there&#x27;s a lot of it.  I decided to give it one last ditch effort because I know my hair is hard to curl. I left them in for 30 minutes then after that, I hairsprayed them very lightly and waited 5 minutes for the hairspray to dry, and took them out. Now I am so so so happy with this set. The curls were super bouncy and actually STAYED. (I hairsprayed after I took the rollers out too).  By the end of the day, they dropped to gorgeous loose curls (which is what I really want).  I slept in them and they are still in loose curls. I&#x27;m in love with this set! I plan on doing it at night and then sleeping on them so I have those looser curls.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They take a while to heat up, approximately 15 minutes, but I&#x27;m okay with that. I turn them on when I&#x27;m blowdrying my hair (since I have so much, it takes quite a while to finish) or when I just wake up and I&#x27;m still groggy I just press the button and do some morning routines and then they&#x27;re ready! The clips that come with them are FANTASTIC. They fit perfectly around the curlers and I&#x27;m so so so happy with them.  I find that if I roll the curlers too far up, they can leave kinks in my hair, but I like to roll them about several inches away from my scalp (hanging) and then I don&#x27;t see any kinks.  Overall, I&#x27;m in love wtih these and the cute mint color the rollers are in are a plus!  Also, having so much hair, I&#x27;m so glad I can do my whole head with these (usually with 1 or 2 to spare) and I don&#x27;t do very big sections, so that&#x27;s great!  Even comes with a bag with drawstrings for the clips which is so convenient. Overall, this product is LOVELY.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, just to mention as help, I like to hold the top end of the curler and roll my hair around it starting from the top (not from the bottom rolling up as some people do, and how you normally use a curling iron). I find that this evenly gets all of my hair and creates a better curl.  Also, I hold the end with one hand because the flocked part of the curler is not too hot (but the bottom end is), and then use my other hand to clip the hair.  Took a few tries to learn but now I&#x27;m perfectly fine.  Love this set!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-Update 9/26/2012&lt;br /&gt;Still loving the set (not that it&#x27;s been very long). Just wanted to update that I had mentioned I&#x27;d slept in them for looser curls.. If I do them the day of, since they are rollers, they do come out really curly.  All I do after it sets completely and I&#x27;ve hairsprayed it, I run some water on the ends and pull them down and they turn out lovely!</li>
            <li> I love this curling set!  At first, when I started reading the booklet that came with it, I was very disappointed because it said that it should not be used on synthetic wigs.  I wear wigs for religious reasons, specifically synthetic wigs made of Elura fiber.  My wigs range from moderately curly to very curly and when they&#x27;re washed and dried, they need a small amount of curling to get back their style.  I use no hairsprays, but wear my wigs in a very natural look.  A wig stylist had just done my wig for my granddaughter&#x27;s wedding in Israel, and she had used a flocked hairsetter and my wig looked gorgeous.  I decided to try it on my wig anyway because it needed an in-between cleaning lift.  This setter did a fantastic job with the curlers at full heat, and not a fiber was damaged at all; I inspected every curl that I put into two wigs, and they were beautiful.  Perhaps it&#x27;s because the wigs are Elura, but they weren&#x27;t damaged at all.  The curler heated up quickly and cooled down a little slower.  I really like the clips that hold the rollers in place because they leave no mark on the hair fibers and keep them tightly locked in place.  Also, the clips can fit any size roller that is used, so one needn&#x27;t keep track of which size clip one is using.  Perhaps in the United States the flocked rollers don&#x27;t work on synthetic hair wigs, but I think it&#x27;s more of a disclaimer than anything else.  It&#x27;s a great set and works beautifully.</li>
            <li> I owned an older version of the flocked rollers and just loved them.  But they finally gave out and I looked for another set.  These are great.  Lots more rollers than the old one and just as good.</li>
            <li> I PURCHASED THIS HAIR SETTER BECAUSE THE DIAMETER OF THE ROLLERS IN MY PRESENT HAIRSETTER WERE NOT LARGE ENOUGH. THE LARGER NUMBER OF ROLLERS CONTAINED IN THE SET WAS A PLUS FACTOR. I READ THE DIRECTIONS, PLUGGED IT IN AND WAITED FOR IT TO HEAT.  ABOUT HALF WAY THROUGH SETTING MY HAIR I PICKED A ROLLER OFF THE ROD AND THE END CAP CAME OFF AND I HAD TWO PIECES IN MY HAND--ACTUALLY THREE BECAUSE THE ROLLER ITSELF WAS IN TWO PIECES.  I WONDERED HOW MANY MORE WOULD COME OFF DURING THE COURSE OF USE.  SURE WASN&#x27;T THE DISTRIBUTORS FAULT--IT WAS A CASE OF POOR MANUFACTURING AND POOR QUALITY ASSURANCE.  BACK IT WENT.</li>
            <li> I wanted to like these, I really did!!!  I let them warm up for 30 minutes and left them in for 30.  When I took them out, there were no curls.  My old curlers worked fine, but I thought new ones would work better . . . I was wrong.  Maybe I got a defective set, but I&#x27;m not going to try again and will return these rollers</li>
