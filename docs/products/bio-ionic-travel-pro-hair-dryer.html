            <li>I ended up selling them at my yard sale because they did not do as good a job.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t think it would do as good of a job as it did.</li>
            <li>My friend and I shared it because neither of us wanted to use the dryers provided when this was superior to those.</li>
            <li>anymore, I just take my own.</li>
            <li>good price too, much better than retail</li>
            <li>My older one was perfect.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very easy to use</li>
            <li>I own many of the Bio-Ionic products.</li>

            <li>The information on Amazon wasnÂ´t very accurate, so I just picked the cheappest one</li>
            <li>ITS VERY LIGHT AND DRYERS</li>
            <li>It tends to warm up very quickly.</li>
            <li>YOUR HAIR LEAVING IT SMOOTH AND FRIZZ FREE!!</li>
            <li>fried my hair, so i threw it away and got 2 more bio-ionics.  </li>
            <li>love love these.  </li>
            <li>I love them all</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>Love this.  </li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>I love this dryer, which packs a lot of power for a portable.</li>
            <li>The resulting frizz was overwhelming.  </li>
            <li>Size is ok, weigh is ok, but I was looking for a travel hair dryer that would be at leas 1800 watts.  </li>
            <li>I ordered this dryer to replace one I had for many years.  </li>
            <li>In fact, we&#x27;re reordering this. :)</li>
            <li>It was OK for that</li>
            <li>This hairdryer fold so ingenuously that I love the design and its easy to pack.</li>
            <li>I love the way it dries  my hair so quickly!  </li>
            <li>Most of their products are amazing, and I am sure this one would have been too if it had not broken.  </li>
            <li>Does a darn good job - and I am very demanding of my hairdryers.</li>
            <li>Light weight; does not damage hair and easy to store.  </li>
            <li>The price is steep but this dryer is light years away from anything you can pick-up in a department store.  </li>
            <li>bought a T3, which was supposed to be fabulous.  </li>
            <li>&quot; it is light and compact and blowing</li>
            <li>The Bio-Ionic Travel Pro Hair Dryer is a great travel companion; it did well with the current in Italy.  </li>
            <li>The order was quick and easy and the seller was prompt with shipping...</li>
            <li>and the speed is automatically reduced, which significantly adds to drying time.</li>
            <li>Just wish it had a cool shot button.</li>
            <li>JUST AS WELL AS ANY FULL SIZE</li>
            <li>AS A FULL SIZE BLOW DRYER..</li>
            <li>I had an earlier version of the Bio Ionic travel drier and loved it.  </li>
            <li>I bought this dryer to replace my prior BioIonic dryer that I loved.</li>
            <li>Not bad.</li>
            <li>I used it with satisfaction here in the States, but the very first time I got overseas, the unit burned out after 3 minutes&#x27; use.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know how much I buy into the ionic thing, but this dryer does leave the hair smooth.</li>
            <li>I take extremely good care of my electronics and damage was not responsible for the breakage.  </li>
            <li>There are many other better products and manufacturers out there.</li>
            <li>so it&#x27;s way compact and does not get super hot.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used it daily for 3+ years and the dryer has held up beautifully and the overall condition of my hair has improved drastically.  </li>
            <li>And if it lasts as long as my previous Bio-Ionic I will be very happy.</li>
            <li>All in all -much better than my T3 travel dryer and much smaller than my Sultra &#x27;travel&#x27; dryer.</li>
            <li>It is now smooth, shiny and soft with no split ends or damage from heat drying.  </li>
            <li>had one of these and finally dropped it one too many times.  </li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t purchased this hair dryer yet, and will most likely improve my rating when I try it out.</li>
            <li>Does it have a swivel handle like its more recent version?</li>
            <li>so I was able wrap the 2nd hair dryer for my daughter</li>
            <li>I bought this product for my sister and wife since they love the regular size Bio-Ionic dryer.</li>
            <li>The replacement lasted exactly two months before the handle on the replacement also broke.</li>
            <li>I ultimately replaced with a Supra Solano and am totally satisfied with that dryer.  </li>
            <li>It was okay, not too loud or strong, but I couldn&#x27;t tell that the ionic feature made much difference when compared to regular dryers.</li>
            <li>So I quickly came to Amazon to order a new Bio Ionic.  </li>
            <li>My hair never looked this good using the dinosaur-era dryers I owned in the past so there must be something to it.  </li>
            <li>It is powerful, small and light and easy to handle.</li>
            <li>It dries your hair ok but very bulky to hold and dry.</li>
            <li>AND AS MUCH POWER</li>
            <li>The neck, right above the control button, cracked and I saw a fire flicked inside right after the drop.</li>
            <li>They produce a little more heat but not as much air flow which makes it easier to style using a styling brush.</li>
            <li>I bought this for a trip to Europe in April 2010 and was really pleased with it...until last month, when all of a sudden, the \\&quot;high\\&quot; button just stopped working.</li>
            <li>power is decent but it is not durable.&lt;br /&gt;Less</li>
            <li>I never risk the hotel having a decent dryer, etc.</li>
            <li>The Bio Ionic eventually broke and, since the price had more than doubled in the years since I last purchased one, I just picked up something at the local drug store.  </li>
            <li>I bought this particular ionic hair dryer to take with me overseas.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>I think it&#x27;s my new fave.</li>
            <li>great price, doesn&#x27;t dry out my hair, and is sturdy enough to handle everyday use and abuse.</li>
            <li>I expect my hair dryer to dry my hair quickly without drying it and without tiring my arm</li>
            <li>This did keep working for about 3 years before I just stopped using it, but the performance was far below my expectations for the price.</li>
            <li>The only issue I have is that I wish the nozzle was more narrow.</li>
            <li>It dries my hair more quickly than conventional driers (I have A LOT of thick, curly hair)</li>
            <li>Its small and powerful and does the job very well.</li>
            <li>it comes with low and high setting.  </li>
            <li>SMALL LIGHT WEIGHT</li>
            <li>Have just purchased my second (an updated version with a new nozzle design).</li>
            <li>The twisting action required for folding the handle to the compact position seems to have stressed the handle, making it fall apart after a total of four-month&#x27;s use.</li>
            <li>It also performed far and above the hair dryers that were provided by the hotels and pensiones.  </li>
            <li>The hair dryer, small enough to carry and very powerful.  </li>
            <li>you only need to set the low because the amount of air is enough to dry hair fast and you will feel hair very soft and not frizzy afterward.</li>
            <li>The whole thing is pretty ridiculous.</li>
            <li>and it absolutely cuts down on the frizz.    </li>
            <li>I initially liked that the dryer was small and lightweight; however, after very few uses the handle broke open and I was left holding a handful of wiring.</li>
            <li>than 3 months later of being in my suitcase in Europe and barely used, it snapped in 3 different pieces.</li>
            <li>I have fairly thick, long, color-treated hair and can get a smooth frizz-free blowout in under 10 minutes.  </li>
            <li>I bought a second one to keep in our other home and it also lacked the quality and performance of the older one.</li>

            <li> I bought a second one to keep in our other home and it also lacked the quality and performance of the older one.</li>
            <li> I have slightly longer than shoulder-length hair, of normal thickness.</li>
            <li> I have had the same feelings about the one pass flat iron.</li>
            <li> For now, it seems strange that what&#x27;s crucial for a travel hair dryer - size - is not specified anywhere.</li>
            <li> I have had 2 flat irons, 2 curling irons and 2 hairdryers.  </li>
            <li> have long curly hair</li>
            <li> went ahead and bought another one from a beauty supplier for less than $30 which also have dual voltage and 2 heat settings and is about the same</li>
            <li> My hair tends to dry out with any other type of styling iron, dryer, etc.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this one now for months, and I couldn&#x27;t be happier - back to non-frizzy, healthy-looking, quickly dried hair.</li>
            <li> Will attempt to see if they will replace, but based on prior experience with this company, I am doubtful their customer service will be any better than their products.</li>
            <li> (I&#x27;m weakened due to a medical condition) - this dried my hair in under 10 min</li>
            <li> I ordered it very late and never expected to have it for my trip; it arrived days earlier than expected.</li>
            <li> replaces older model with broken handle.  </li>
            <li> Also, the voltage label rubbed off soon after I started using it, and so I had to scratch the numbers in with a sharp object.</li>
            <li> The cool button doesn&#x27;t get terribly cold, though.     </li>
            <li> I have purchased other Ionic hair dryers because they were less money.</li>
            <li> and I would say this product is not worth the money.&lt;br /&gt;For</li>
            <li> For over $60, completely not worth it.</li>
            <li> You can spend money sending it in for repair which will be half the cost of the dryer itself.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Hair is healthier and less frizzy.</li>
            <li> Two days ago, while on vacation, the handle snapped in half.</li>
            <li> but there was no information about watts, and it happens to be a 1200 watts, with just hot air, no option for cold air.  </li>
            <li> I have thick hair and can get it dry with this in under 5 mins.     </li>
            <li> I had it for years and evidently forgot how bad conventional driers were.  </li>
            <li> and my arm was only slightly tired.</li>
            <li> but it did a very slow job of actually drying my hair, which is not quite shoulder length and on the thick side.</li>
            <li> It stopped working in six weeks and past the time I could exchange the item.</li>
            <li> It is color-treated, therefore delicate.</li>
            <li> To make matters worse, this seller has ignored both my email request for help and the one Amazon forwarded to them.</li>
            <li> I received the Bio-Ionic hair dryer broken.  </li>

            <li> I am disappointed.</li>
            <li> size.&lt;br /&gt;Deeply disappointed in this product.</li>
            <li> Bio Ionics did replace the defective dryer (I stupidly paid the $18.95 warranty replacement fee - which is now $35) and $25 to ship it to the Bio Ionics.</li>
            <li> I took this dual-voltage dryer to Paris and with a turn of the screw at the base of the handle it ran like a dream.</li>

            <li> Not bad. Does a darn good job - and I am very demanding of my hairdryers. I have slightly longer than shoulder-length hair, of normal thickness. It is color-treated, therefore delicate. I expect my hair dryer to dry my hair quickly without drying it and without tiring my arm (I&#x27;m weakened due to a medical condition) - this dried my hair in under 10 min and my arm was only slightly tired. It&#x27;s super-light, has two speeds, folds up so it&#x27;s way compact and does not get super hot. All in all -much better than my T3 travel dryer and much smaller than my Sultra &#x27;travel&#x27; dryer. I think it&#x27;s my new fave. Just wish it had a cool shot button. Then it would be perfect.</li>
            <li> THIS IS ONE OF THE BEST DRYERS IVE EVER OWNED! I HAVE WORKED IN A SALON FOR OVER 11 YRS AND FIND THIS DRYER WORKS JUST AS WELL AS ANY FULL SIZE PRICY ONE. ITS VERY LIGHT AND DRYERS YOUR HAIR LEAVING IT SMOOTH AND FRIZZ FREE!!</li>
            <li> I bought this for a trip to Europe in April 2010 and was really pleased with it...until last month, when all of a sudden, the \\&quot;high\\&quot; button just stopped working. My purchase was made through Amazon from a company called \\&quot;Shear Up.\\&quot; I got it for a very good price and there seems to be a one-year warranty from the manufacturer. But they want $19 and won&#x27;t take checks. The whole thing is pretty ridiculous. I&#x27;ve written to ShearUp and we&#x27;ll see what they say. I used to have a Conair which lasted me 10 years. Now this fancy one couldn&#x27;t even make it a year?? I am disappointed.</li>
            <li> The hair dryer, small enough to carry and very powerful.  it comes with low and high setting.  you only need to set the low because the amount of air is enough to dry hair fast and you will feel hair very soft and not frizzy afterward.</li>
            <li> I purchased this hair dryer for travel. It stopped working in six weeks and past the time I could exchange the item.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve owned one of these for over 3 years and can&#x27;t rave about it enough. Have just purchased my second (an updated version with a new nozzle design). I have fairly thick, long, color-treated hair and can get a smooth frizz-free blowout in under 10 minutes.  The price is steep but this dryer is light years away from anything you can pick-up in a department store.  I&#x27;ve used it daily for 3+ years and the dryer has held up beautifully and the overall condition of my hair has improved drastically.  It is now smooth, shiny and soft with no split ends or damage from heat drying.  From what I understand you have to use the nozzle in order to get the conditioning benefits...somthing about baked minerals(?).  I know, I know...when I tried to explain it to my husband he burst out laughing.  What can I say?  My hair never looked this good using the dinosaur-era dryers I owned in the past so there must be something to it.  Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> had one of these and finally dropped it one too many times.  bought a T3, which was supposed to be fabulous.  fried my hair, so i threw it away and got 2 more bio-ionics.  love love these.  great price, doesn&#x27;t dry out my hair, and is sturdy enough to handle everyday use and abuse.</li>
            <li> I use to work in the salon industry and I would say this product is not worth the money.&lt;br /&gt;For something that is \\&quot;travel\\&quot; it is light and compact and blowing power is decent but it is not durable.&lt;br /&gt;Less than 3 months later of being in my suitcase in Europe and barely used, it snapped in 3 different pieces. For over $60, completely not worth it. You can spend money sending it in for repair which will be half the cost of the dryer itself.&lt;br /&gt;I went ahead and bought another one from a beauty supplier for less than $30 which also have dual voltage and 2 heat settings and is about the same size.&lt;br /&gt;Deeply disappointed in this product.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t purchased this hair dryer yet, and will most likely improve my rating when I try it out. For now, it seems strange that what&#x27;s crucial for a travel hair dryer - size - is not specified anywhere. Does anyone know what the length of it is in inches or centimetres? Does it have a swivel handle like its more recent version? Thank you in advance!</li>
            <li> I had this dryer for two years, specifically for travel, and used it during two two-month overseas trips. It was okay, not too loud or strong, but I couldn&#x27;t tell that the ionic feature made much difference when compared to regular dryers. Also, the voltage label rubbed off soon after I started using it, and so I had to scratch the numbers in with a sharp object. But the worst problem was that the handle fell apart on my last trip, exposing the electrical wiring and giving me a shock. And because parts had fallen out of the handle, I couldn&#x27;t figure out how to put it back together. The twisting action required for folding the handle to the compact position seems to have stressed the handle, making it fall apart after a total of four-month&#x27;s use. Not recommended.</li>
            <li> GREAT TRAVEL HAIR DRYER ........ SMALL LIGHT WEIGHT AND AS MUCH POWER AS A FULL SIZE BLOW DRYER..LOVE IT !!</li>
            <li> The hair dryer is O.K. It is actually bulky and the handle rotates in to make it smaller. It is an awkward design. It dries your hair ok but very bulky to hold and dry.</li>
            <li> This is my second Bio-Ionic Travel Pro Hair Dryer in 10 years. They produce a little more heat but not as much air flow which makes it easier to style using a styling brush. The size I great for traveling. I have purchased other Ionic hair dryers because they were less money. I ended up selling them at my yard sale because they did not do as good a job. I&#x27;d buy this again in a minute.</li>
            <li> I own many of the Bio-Ionic products. I purchased this for a trip to Europe since it was dual voltage. It worked well with a plug converter. It automatically switches to the voltage there once plugged in.&lt;br /&gt;I have long curly hair and I used this as I do at home, with my Bio-Ionic brush, to blow out my hair. I didn&#x27;t think it would do as good of a job as it did. The only issue I have is that I wish the nozzle was more narrow. I think it would be perfect if it was. However, it did the job and I&#x27;m happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li> Bio-ionic hair care products are the best. My hair tends to dry out with any other type of styling iron, dryer, etc. than those made by Bio-ionic.  I have had 2 flat irons, 2 curling irons and 2 hairdryers.  I love them all and they all still work.  This hairdryer fold so ingenuously that I love the design and its easy to pack. I never risk the hotel having a decent dryer, etc. anymore, I just take my own.</li>
            <li> Love it. Folds for travel.  Doesn&#x27;t leave hair frizzy like some dryers.  This is one of the best dryers you can buy.  And if it lasts as long as my previous Bio-Ionic I will be very happy.</li>
            <li> Love this.  Use it daiiy.  Light weight; does not damage hair and easy to store.  Like how it folds up</li>
            <li> replaces older model with broken handle.  great design and love the cool setting.  good price too, much better than retail</li>
            <li> It is powerful, small and light and easy to handle. My&lt;br /&gt;friend let me use hers and I had to have it.</li>
            <li> I love this product. My hair feels wonderful and soft. It makes my hair look shiny and bouncier and my curl holds all day. Great product. Great price and speedy delivery . It got here before Christmas so I was able wrap the 2nd hair dryer for my daughter and she loves it . Thank you</li>
            <li> Its small and powerful and does the job very well. I bought this for my wife we travel alot and she was looking for something compact and had quality she owns the larger model for home use and anything that was not this quality would not do</li>
            <li> The Bio-Ionic Travel Pro Hair Dryer is a great travel companion; it did well with the current in Italy.  It has a switch to change it from 110 to 220. The order was quick and easy and the seller was prompt with shipping...I ordered it very late and never expected to have it for my trip; it arrived days earlier than expected. It also performed far and above the hair dryers that were provided by the hotels and pensiones.  My friend and I shared it because neither of us wanted to use the dryers provided when this was superior to those.</li>
            <li> I love this dryer, which packs a lot of power for a portable. I use it every day as I don&#x27;t want a bulky unit cluttering my bathroom. I have thick hair and can get it dry with this in under 5 mins.     I don&#x27;t know how much I buy into the ionic thing, but this dryer does leave the hair smooth. The cool button doesn&#x27;t get terribly cold, though.     I took this dual-voltage dryer to Paris and with a turn of the screw at the base of the handle it ran like a dream. Couldn&#x27;t even tell the difference!</li>
            <li> This is an excellent product.  It dries my hair more quickly than conventional driers (I have A LOT of thick, curly hair) and it absolutely cuts down on the frizz.    I had an earlier version of the Bio Ionic travel drier and loved it.  I had it for years and evidently forgot how bad conventional driers were.  The Bio Ionic eventually broke and, since the price had more than doubled in the years since I last purchased one, I just picked up something at the local drug store.  I couldn&#x27;t believe the difference.  The resulting frizz was overwhelming.  So I quickly came to Amazon to order a new Bio Ionic.  I&#x27;ve had this one now for months, and I couldn&#x27;t be happier - back to non-frizzy, healthy-looking, quickly dried hair.</li>
            <li> Size is ok, weigh is ok, but I was looking for a travel hair dryer that would be at leas 1800 watts.  The information on Amazon wasnÂ´t very accurate, so I just picked the cheappest one but there was no information about watts, and it happens to be a 1200 watts, with just hot air, no option for cold air.  It tends to warm up very quickly.</li>
            <li> I initially liked that the dryer was small and lightweight; however, after very few uses the handle broke open and I was left holding a handful of wiring. To make matters worse, this seller has ignored both my email request for help and the one Amazon forwarded to them. Buy another brand from another seller!</li>
            <li> I bought this product for my sister and wife since they love the regular size Bio-Ionic dryer. Easier for them to carry when they go away on trips. Definitely recommend it.</li>
            <li> I ordered this dryer to replace one I had for many years.  I love the way it dries  my hair so quickly!  Great product!</li>
            <li> I received the Bio-Ionic hair dryer broken.  I took it out of the package and the handle promptly fell apart.</li>
            <li> I bought this for a friend and it&#x27;s the best dryer ever.  Makes a great gift.  Hair is healthier and less frizzy.</li>
            <li> UPDATE (delayed). Bio Ionics did replace the defective dryer (I stupidly paid the $18.95 warranty replacement fee - which is now $35) and $25 to ship it to the Bio Ionics. The replacement lasted exactly two months before the handle on the replacement also broke. Am totally done with Bio Ionics. There are many other better products and manufacturers out there. I ultimately replaced with a Supra Solano and am totally satisfied with that dryer.  I bought this dryer to replace my prior BioIonic dryer that I loved. I bought this one in September, 2013. This model didn&#x27;t perform nearly half as well as my older one and have felt they manufactured it with lesser quality components. Two days ago, while on vacation, the handle snapped in half. I take extremely good care of my electronics and damage was not responsible for the breakage.  I am very disappointed in Bio Ionics. I have had the same feelings about the one pass flat iron. My older one was perfect. I bought a second one to keep in our other home and it also lacked the quality and performance of the older one. I am done with Bio Ionics. Will attempt to see if they will replace, but based on prior experience with this company, I am doubtful their customer service will be any better than their products.</li>
            <li> I bought this particular ionic hair dryer to take with me overseas.  I used it with satisfaction here in the States, but the very first time I got overseas, the unit burned out after 3 minutes&#x27; use.  I was in Italy for ten days in May 2014.  It is beyond the window for returns, so I will throw it away.  I am very disappointed and would not recommend this product for use overseas at all!</li>
            <li> I purchased this item along with 2 Bio Ionic one pass Nan&#x27;s and later bought another one of these travel dryers.  This dryer broke after using it a dozen times.  Something inside just broke and it is not usable or returnable.  Most of their products are amazing, and I am sure this one would have been too if it had not broken.  I have Walmart dryers that lasted way longer than this.  Just disappointing.</li>
            <li> We had this dryer for over 2 years until I dropped it while drying my hair. The neck, right above the control button, cracked and I saw a fire flicked inside right after the drop. I didn&#x27;t turn it on again in case it causes fire. But this dryer served its purpose for that length of time. It&#x27;s very easy to use and it&#x27;s lightweight. In fact, we&#x27;re reordering this. :)</li>
            <li> I bought this for travel and the dual voltage feature. It was OK for that but it did a very slow job of actually drying my hair, which is not quite shoulder length and on the thick side. It&#x27;s like it overheats constantly and the speed is automatically reduced, which significantly adds to drying time. It does this regardless of whether I am in Europe or in the US. This did keep working for about 3 years before I just stopped using it, but the performance was far below my expectations for the price. Also there is no heat setting, which is also weird considering the price.</li>
