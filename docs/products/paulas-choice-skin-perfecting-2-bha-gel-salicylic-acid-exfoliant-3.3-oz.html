            <li>However, if you wash your face, apply this, wait 15 minutes (for the chemical exfoliation to break through the oils), and then place an acne treatment, you&#x27;ll see the best results.</li>
            <li>So I purchased this gel and am very happy with the results!</li>
            <li>This is the best out there!</li>
            <li>I am very happy.</li>
            <li>PAULAS IS THE BEST SKIN  PRODUCT LINE i have ever used!!</li>
            <li>price on here is very good.</li>
            <li>--Paula&#x27;s Choice makes great stuff!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This gel is great for my face, which is combination.</li>
            <li>I experienced an allergic reaction to products containing salicylic acid</li>
            <li>It is though a great product for people trying to get rid of acne.</li>
            <li>It worked great on my oily t-zone, I can see the smoother pore, not as oily and not as enlarged after one week use.</li>
            <li>I am loving this product and will be ordering it again!</li>
            <li>I received the 2% liquid as a sample, and loved it -</li>
            <li>but it feels good</li>
            <li>It really is a good exfoliant, I have combination skin with rosacea subtype 2.</li>
            <li>For the price point I&#x27;m more than happy with my purchase and will Continue to.</li>
            <li>My skin has looked so much better since I started using this stuff!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s amazing.</li>
            <li>/&gt;This is a great product and I have tried both the gel and liquid; both work great, it just depends on your personal preference</li>
            <li>--I&#x27;ve been a victim of the breakout cycle for years, and this is truly, HONESTLY one of the best products I&#x27;ve ever used</li>
            <li>Will buy again and maybe even more Paula&#x27;s Choice products.</li>
            <li>I love my Paula Choice.</li>
            <li>However, I have prime and got better shipping.</li>
            <li>I LOVE THE fact that is a gel</li>
            <li>and it dries to a wonderful matte finish, skin perfection, smaller pores , no grease  </li>
            <li>I notice a HUGE difference if I don&#x27;t use it, (much more roughness and breakout), so I always have a bottle.</li>
            <li>I applied this product nightly, waiting until I finished one whole bottle before writing a review, just to give it a fair chance.  </li>
            <li>I look better and am more confident than ever, and plan on trying many more Paula&#x27;s Choice products--I can&#x27;t recommend it enough!!</li>
            <li>I did NOT even notice a difference in fine lines or sun discoloration either.  </li>
            <li>Also, I do NOT agree with any of the claims they mentioned/listed in the description box such as:&lt;br /&gt;- Unclogs &amp; diminishes enlarged pores, great for blackheads, acne breakouts</li>
            <li>I was wondering if I should&#x27;v stick with 1%, but this 2% one is so great for my t-zone daily use</li>
            <li>A good alternative is the Stridex red box BHA exfoliating pads, but I think the Paula&#x27;s Choice is better.</li>
            <li>It is very rare to get all of this in one bottle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>works great as long as I use once or twice a week</li>
            <li>First off, use my Refer-A-Friend link to get $10 Off and FREE SHIPPING! :</li>
            <li>It helps to clean out pores, acne breakouts, and lighten hyper pigmentation.  </li>
            <li>However, thanks to this product, this concern has been largely alleviated.</li>
            <li>really wanted to love this product, but this just isn&#x27;t for me.</li>
            <li>Though this product is no miracle worker, and hasn&#x27;t completely cleared my skin, it is truly a good product that I will be sure to recommend in the future.</li>
            <li>Really rely on this one for overall good skin tone.</li>
            <li>Results are pretty quick, to my surprise</li>
            <li>I need to get a replacement right away.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also kind of pricy, but it seems to go a long way.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m planning to try using Stridex on half my face and PC on the other to see if the Paula&#x27;s Choice really is that much better, because Stridex is SO much cheaper, but I think that sadly (or happily for the Paula&#x27;s Choice people!)</li>
            <li>It works very well!</li>
            <li>The effects are consistent.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very gentle on my super sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>The shipping was so fast.</li>
            <li>7 days without it, really made a change.</li>
            <li>The price is reasonable for the amount of time it lasts you, however I don&#x27;t see any improvement.</li>
            <li>fantastic product, great for me with super oily skin keeps the creepy oilies from taking charge!!  </li>
            <li>and I found this to be better since it&#x27;s gel and won&#x27;t really run down your finger or cotton ball like the liquid form.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s now clear and smooth, and NOT red or irritated, I cannot believe it.</li>
            <li>I wanted to like this, but I&#x27;m going from mild acne to moderate.</li>
            <li>My skin is clearer, pores are smaller, looks healthier - and keeps my oiliness in check during these hot summer NY months!</li>
            <li>the Stridex breaks me out a little. :)</li>
            <li>This keeps my skin exfoliated and smooth, and keeps breakouts minimal.</li>
            <li>NICE AND THICK</li>
            <li>I mean, how many of us use up a whole bottle of any product?</li>
            <li>I have normal to oily skin depending on the weather, and my skin isn&#x27;t sensitive at all.</li>
            <li>I feel like this is like the first skincare product that actually made me breakout like this.</li>
            <li>It is completely ineffective in preventing acne.  </li>
            <li>It depends on whether you&#x27;re sensitive to menthol, which is in the Stridex but not in Paula&#x27;s Choice.</li>
            <li>In a while, it absorbs well and my skin is soft.</li>
            <li>However, my cheek zone where it&#x27;s sensitive w/ rosacea, did not like it.</li>
            <li>No more occasional pimples, smoother texture, more &amp;#34;glow&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>I remember seeing in dermatology website saying BHA is not good for rosacea skin, but since some are ok with it, I decided to give it a try.</li>
            <li>my largest and most frequent concern regarding acne has been the scars it leaves behind.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin which is dry to normal.  </li>
            <li>This used to be my holy grail for pimples, but the new packaging and formula (?) is very very running and hard to put on (and stay on)</li>
            <li>Waiting a half hour from for the gel to absorb is highly recommended and the difference is abundantly clear.</li>
            <li>This has the right percentage of BHA required for physical exfoliation (2%), the correct pH (3.7), and soothing ingredients like green tea.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> My skin is now baby soft, clearer with less redness, and literally looks younger.  </li>
            <li> This is a true game changer.  </li>

            <li> This product is one of the few that does not irritate my skin and helps to heal minor skin imperfections.</li>
            <li> A little goes a very long way.</li>
            <li> Cystic acne, blackheads, dark spots got darker.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It also doubles for me as a shaving savior, when I have those annoying little red bumps I swipe this right over and in a day they are gone.</li>
            <li> anothet waste of money</li>
            <li> Could be purging, but I&#x27;m not sure I want to wait it out.</li>
            <li> I have eczema on my face and it&#x27;s hard to put acne products on it without making me look even worse.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a bit irritating</li>
            <li> But at the beginning i feel weird!</li>
            <li> This product, however, is making me breakout all over my face (painful acne).</li>
            <li> Very disappointing.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I have been using this for about 5 weeks and can tell the difference.  Does not dry out my skin or make it peal like other products.  Will buy again and maybe even more Paula&#x27;s Choice products.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin which is dry to normal.  This product visibly reduced the darker pores on and around my nose!</li>
            <li> This used to be my holy grail for pimples, but the new packaging and formula (?) is very very running and hard to put on (and stay on) the spot I want it to.</li>
            <li> This did wonders for my skin. Waiting a half hour from for the gel to absorb is highly recommended and the difference is abundantly clear.</li>
            <li> I actually gave this product as a gift but have it as well!&lt;br /&gt;This is the number one product that has helped me get rid of my acne. This in combination with my pocketderm has gotten rid of acne I&#x27;ve had for over 8 years. This has the right percentage of BHA required for physical exfoliation (2%), the correct pH (3.7), and soothing ingredients like green tea. It is very rare to get all of this in one bottle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;TIP- Alone, I don&#x27;t think this could handle my acne. However, if you wash your face, apply this, wait 15 minutes (for the chemical exfoliation to break through the oils), and then place an acne treatment, you&#x27;ll see the best results.</li>
            <li> I have combination oily and dry skin- my largest and most frequent concern regarding acne has been the scars it leaves behind. However, thanks to this product, this concern has been largely alleviated. Though this product is no miracle worker, and hasn&#x27;t completely cleared my skin, it is truly a good product that I will be sure to recommend in the future. It has cleared my skin immensely, increased my confidence, evened my skin tone, and has not irritated my skin in any way. I am so thankful that I purchased this product!  (Submitted by her daughter)Thank you Paula&#x27;s choice.</li>
            <li> This is a true game changer.  I use the gel at night and the liquid version in the morning. My skin is now baby soft, clearer with less redness, and literally looks younger.  Thank you!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this stuff once a day, before going to bed, for a week now... I have normal to oily skin depending on the weather, and my skin isn&#x27;t sensitive at all. This product, however, is making me breakout all over my face (painful acne). I get that skincare products could be either a hit or miss, and everyone reacts to each product differently, but this is definitely a big miss for me. I feel like this is like the first skincare product that actually made me breakout like this. Also, I do NOT agree with any of the claims they mentioned/listed in the description box such as:&lt;br /&gt;- Unclogs &amp; diminishes enlarged pores, great for blackheads, acne breakouts&lt;br /&gt;- Smooths wrinkles, reduces redness &amp; builds collagen. Reveals radiant, even-toned &amp; younger looking skin&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really wanted to love this product, but this just isn&#x27;t for me.</li>
            <li> works great as long as I use once or twice a week</li>
            <li> I received the 2% liquid as a sample, and loved it - except I felt like I was wasting it my applying it with a cotton pad. So I purchased this gel and am very happy with the results! My skin is clearer, pores are smaller, looks healthier - and keeps my oiliness in check during these hot summer NY months! It also doubles for me as a shaving savior, when I have those annoying little red bumps I swipe this right over and in a day they are gone. I am loving this product and will be ordering it again!</li>
            <li> It works very well! For the price point I&#x27;m more than happy with my purchase and will Continue to. Results are pretty quick, to my surprise</li>
            <li> I use this product every morning and night. I have very dry skin, which clogs my pores and causes breakouts. This keeps my skin exfoliated and smooth, and keeps breakouts minimal. I use it on my neck and chest as well. I notice a HUGE difference if I don&#x27;t use it, (much more roughness and breakout), so I always have a bottle. It&#x27;s very gentle on my super sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> Another homerun from the Paula line. I had this and the liquid form as samples and I found this to be better since it&#x27;s gel and won&#x27;t really run down your finger or cotton ball like the liquid form. I recommend you put on very little since it can ball up if you apply too much.</li>
            <li> This works. It even leads to a younger appearance. It&#x27;s amazing. I have chronic heats on my forehead. Before this product the only product that worked was Zapzit but Zapzit leaves my forehead with a permanent shine and the helpful effects started to wear off. Paula&#x27;s choice has my entire face looking rejuvenated without the over-shine. The effects are consistent. I have no heats so long as I keep using it. This is the best out there!</li>
            <li> This product is one of the few that does not irritate my skin and helps to heal minor skin imperfections. Really rely on this one for overall good skin tone.</li>
            <li> First off, use my Refer-A-Friend link to get $10 Off and FREE SHIPPING! : https://goo.gl/ZHQrkQ&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a great product and I have tried both the gel and liquid; both work great, it just depends on your personal preference--I&#x27;ve been a victim of the breakout cycle for years, and this is truly, HONESTLY one of the best products I&#x27;ve ever used--Paula&#x27;s Choice makes great stuff!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My skin tone has evened, my acne has all but disappeared, and my skin itself is softer than it has ever been. I look better and am more confident than ever, and plan on trying many more Paula&#x27;s Choice products--I can&#x27;t recommend it enough!!</li>
            <li> I applied this product nightly, waiting until I finished one whole bottle before writing a review, just to give it a fair chance.  It is completely ineffective in preventing acne.  I did NOT even notice a difference in fine lines or sun discoloration either.  Very disappointing.</li>
            <li> My skin has looked so much better since I started using this stuff! No more occasional pimples, smoother texture, more &amp;#34;glow&amp;#34;. My only complaint is that it leaves my skin shiny, so I can only use it at night. I might switch to the lotion one so I can maybe use it in the morning as well. It&#x27;s also kind of pricy, but it seems to go a long way. A good alternative is the Stridex red box BHA exfoliating pads, but I think the Paula&#x27;s Choice is better. It depends on whether you&#x27;re sensitive to menthol, which is in the Stridex but not in Paula&#x27;s Choice. I&#x27;m planning to try using Stridex on half my face and PC on the other to see if the Paula&#x27;s Choice really is that much better, because Stridex is SO much cheaper, but I think that sadly (or happily for the Paula&#x27;s Choice people!) the Stridex breaks me out a little. :)</li>
            <li> I love my Paula Choice. This is my second bottle. As soon as I was running out, I panicked. I need to get a replacement right away. I received my bottle before I ran out. The shipping was so fast. I thought it would take a week or two. This gel is great for my face, which is combination. I mean, how many of us use up a whole bottle of any product? I recommend you try this. It helps to clean out pores, acne breakouts, and lighten hyper pigmentation.  I left it at home when I went on a trip. 7 days without it, really made a change. Cystic acne, blackheads, dark spots got darker.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The price on here is very good. Comparable to Paula&#x27;s Choice Website. However, I have prime and got better shipping.</li>
            <li> This works! I have eczema on my face and it&#x27;s hard to put acne products on it without making me look even worse. This cleared up my skin. It&#x27;s now clear and smooth, and NOT red or irritated, I cannot believe it. I am very happy.</li>
            <li> I experienced an allergic reaction to products containing salicylic acid so I could not use this product. It is though a great product for people trying to get rid of acne.</li>
            <li> it doesnt work. anothet waste of money</li>
            <li> Am i only one who feels when I&#x27;m applying  BHA 2% gel on my face, it switches to sticky texture. I thought it was supposed to feel like moisturizing texture, which is like water formula. In a while, it absorbs well and my skin is soft. But at the beginning i feel weird! Please let me know how you guys think!</li>
            <li> I tried it once but it feels good</li>
            <li> I waited almost 3 weeks of use to write this review. It really is a good exfoliant, I have combination skin with rosacea subtype 2. It worked great on my oily t-zone, I can see the smoother pore, not as oily and not as enlarged after one week use. However, my cheek zone where it&#x27;s sensitive w/ rosacea, did not like it. I remember seeing in dermatology website saying BHA is not good for rosacea skin, but since some are ok with it, I decided to give it a try. After 3 days of consecutive use it starts to break me out on cheek area. Now I use it daily for T-Zone, and only use 1-2 times/week on my cheek.  I was wondering if I should&#x27;v stick with 1%, but this 2% one is so great for my t-zone daily use so I&#x27;ll say this is the product for those with enlarged pore/excess oil production. Rosacea/sensitive skin needs to use it cautiously and don&#x27;t use it daily.</li>
            <li> I wanted to like this, but I&#x27;m going from mild acne to moderate. Could be purging, but I&#x27;m not sure I want to wait it out. Been using for almost 2 weeks.</li>
            <li> fantastic product, great for me with super oily skin keeps the creepy oilies from taking charge!!  I LOVE THE fact that is a gel I SMEAR IT ON MY FOREHEAD NICE AND THICK and it dries to a wonderful matte finish, skin perfection, smaller pores , no grease  PAULAS IS THE BEST SKIN  PRODUCT LINE i have ever used!!</li>
            <li> This is excelente !!!!!!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t notice a difference in my pore size or blackheads diminishing. It&#x27;s a bit irritating so I use it only once a day. A little goes a very long way. The price is reasonable for the amount of time it lasts you, however I don&#x27;t see any improvement.</li>
