            <li>I am over 50 and love the way this tightens and reduces wrinkles.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s okay</li>
            <li>I adore Philosophy products, but this one is one that I am not head over heels in love with.</li>
            <li>If you are looking for a better peel, do the Microdelivery two step peel.</li>
            <li>Okay I&#x27;m a woman (38-45)</li>
            <li>but I love</li>
            <li>Though I can&#x27;t be sure about that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>My skin has never felt cleaner or looked better.</li>
            <li>This peel is pretty good.</li>
            <li>i&#x27;m not a peel type of person I enjoy the masks better....</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had drs office peels and no, it&#x27;s not that strong but for what it is</li>
            <li>Makes my face feel really smooth and glows afterwards.  </li>
            <li>All I feel is a light tingle and there is a bit of redness for about 2 minutes after I wash it off.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t leave my skin flaky after use, but it does make my skin smooth and soft!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>i hadn&#x27;t used any type of peel prior to this one, and it works great on my skin.</li>
            <li>awww yisssss</li>
            <li>this enzyme peel is pretty hilarious.  </li>
            <li>I have normal to dry skin, and find this is perfect for weekly use to give your skin a refreshed, glowing appearance.  </li>
            <li>This is a great peel if you just want a quick little treat for your skin.</li>
            <li>In fact, I actually give this to my mother friends as gifts because I think it&#x27;s really useful when you need to look good fast and are multitasking!</li>
            <li>I think it&#x27;s totally worth it.</li>
            <li>Easy to use gel form, not messy.</li>
            <li>It may reduce fine lines after a lot of use, but I havent noticed and it didnt do anything as far as blackhead reduction or pore reduction for me.</li>
            <li>I would definitely order more when I run out.  </li>
            <li>And Philosophy was one of the first with the peels, which I did not realize, and this makes a visible difference in my skin.</li>
            <li>I even like it better than the Dr Gross pads or Avon&#x27;s Anew pads.</li>
            <li>Not too harsh, smells good.</li>
            <li>Makes my skin feel really clean and soft</li>
            <li>I use this more as a daily cleanser, I wouldn&#x27;t really call this a peel.</li>
            <li>I was looking for a peel at a local store and this was strongly recommended.</li>
            <li>My skin feels much smoother.</li>
            <li>This product really works.</li>
            <li>Recently I noticed that my camel&#x27;s face did not have the beautiful glow that it usually possesses.  </li>
            <li>easy to apply, fast acting, gentle, I was able to feel a difference after few minutes.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t think this worked at all, I use other Philosophy peel products that work much better</li>
            <li>I tried a dab on the back of my hand and when I washed it off about 5 minutes later, the skin was silky smooth</li>
            <li>My skin care budget is pretty tight, but I think that this item is worth it.</li>
            <li>This peel will make your skin soft, but it didnt provide the results I was hoping for.</li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t reccommend for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>It does leave my skin soft.</li>
            <li>The directions say to leave it on \\&quot;one to three minutes as tolerated\\&quot;, I left it on for five minutes since I felt absolutely nothing.</li>
            <li>Amazon will not issue a refund because it was not sold directly from them, the retailer on Amazon who sells this product is Angela&#x27;s Beauty Supply Inc., they will not refund on a product that has been opened.</li>
            <li>I contacted Philosophy and they will not stand by their product, they said I would have had to buy it DIRECTLY from them.</li>
            <li>Do not waste your money.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a mother and busy</li>
            <li>leaves it soft and supple, like a baby&#x27;s butt.</li>
            <li>Wound recommend it to busy ladies.</li>
            <li>Yes, I can leave it on longer than usual and that&#x27;s fine</li>

            <li> It&#x27;s like trying to calm an angry badger stuck in a burlap sack.&lt;br</li>
            <li> In a few weeks, it has softened the lines on my forehead and upper chest, and minimized my pores with no irritation or redness.</li>

            <li> Waste of money.</li>
            <li> She was shying away from her water bucket, presumably due to the shame of seeing the dull color of her once-radiant face, not to mention the wrinkles that lined her eyes.  </li>
            <li> I usually leave it on for longer than the suggested amount of time without irritation.</li>
            <li> but I leave this on for at least 10 minutes, two or three times a week.  </li>
            <li> We go through approximately one bottle per week.</li>
            <li> I was disappointed</li>

            <li> I use this product every other day.  I am over 50 and love the way this tightens and reduces wrinkles.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s okay i&#x27;m not a peel type of person I enjoy the masks better.... if you&#x27;re looking for a good product Pangea Acai mask is great!!! leaves skin feeling like a baby!!!</li>
            <li> Would buy again.  It has been great for my skin.  Makes my face feel really smooth and glows afterwards.  I would definitely order more when I run out.  Smells nice. Great product</li>
            <li> Not too harsh, smells good.</li>
            <li> Makes my skin feel really clean and soft</li>
            <li> I was looking for a peel at a local store and this was strongly recommended. I tried a dab on the back of my hand and when I washed it off about 5 minutes later, the skin was silky smooth and I was sold. My skin care budget is pretty tight, but I think that this item is worth it. I am a fair complected redhead but I leave this on for at least 10 minutes, two or three times a week.  In a few weeks, it has softened the lines on my forehead and upper chest, and minimized my pores with no irritation or redness. I wish that I could afford to apply this stuff head-to-toe!</li>
            <li> I have normal to dry skin, and find this is perfect for weekly use to give your skin a refreshed, glowing appearance.  Easy to use gel form, not messy.</li>
            <li> I adore Philosophy products, but this one is one that I am not head over heels in love with. If you are looking for a better peel, do the Microdelivery two step peel. This peel will make your skin soft, but it didnt provide the results I was hoping for. This is a great peel if you just want a quick little treat for your skin. It may reduce fine lines after a lot of use, but I havent noticed and it didnt do anything as far as blackhead reduction or pore reduction for me. I have oily skin and it doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin at all. All I feel is a light tingle and there is a bit of redness for about 2 minutes after I wash it off. I usually leave it on for longer than the suggested amount of time without irritation. Always follow with moisturizer!! It doesn&#x27;t leave my skin flaky after use, but it does make my skin smooth and soft!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line: good quick peel for oily skin! I wouldn&#x27;t reccommend for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I use this more as a daily cleanser, I wouldn&#x27;t really call this a peel. It does leave my skin soft.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t notice any results. The directions say to leave product on for 1-3 minuets as tolerated, but I didn&#x27;t even feel a tingle. I was disappointed</li>
            <li> This peel is pretty good. It burns a little but it gets the job done. When I use this peel My skin feels much smoother.</li>
            <li> I already wrote a review that I love this product, works great!!  Will recommend to clients.</li>
            <li> This product was a BIG disappointment, it did absolutely nothing. The directions say to leave it on \\&quot;one to three minutes as tolerated\\&quot;, I left it on for five minutes since I felt absolutely nothing. At the end, it had done nothing. Waste of money. Amazon will not issue a refund because it was not sold directly from them, the retailer on Amazon who sells this product is Angela&#x27;s Beauty Supply Inc., they will not refund on a product that has been opened. I contacted Philosophy and they will not stand by their product, they said I would have had to buy it DIRECTLY from them. Do not waste your money.You should also consider this a lesson in buying from outside retailer&#x27;s on Amazon as you end up with no one to stand by their sale.If you feel you want to try a product that costs a lot of money, buy it from the source, so you have someone to hold accountable for the product.</li>
            <li> Okay I&#x27;m a woman (38-45) and I love this peel! I know other reviewers say it&#x27;s not strong enough-and I can see that point. I&#x27;m a mother and busy so I think this is great because I can put it on, brush my teeth,take off my jewelery and it&#x27;s done. My skin looks clearer, smoother  and it&#x27;s not red or irritated. In fact, I actually give this to my mother friends as gifts because I think it&#x27;s really useful when you need to look good fast and are multitasking! And Philosophy was one of the first with the peels, which I did not realize, and this makes a visible difference in my skin. Yes, I can leave it on longer than usual and that&#x27;s fine but I love it doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin yet produces results. I even like it better than the Dr Gross pads or Avon&#x27;s Anew pads. I&#x27;ve had drs office peels and no, it&#x27;s not that strong but for what it is I think it&#x27;s totally worth it.</li>
            <li> its small, but i like this peel well enough. i use every philosophy face treatment so this is a nice addition.</li>
            <li> this is a neat little product. i hadn&#x27;t used any type of peel prior to this one, and it works great on my skin. leaves it soft and supple, like a baby&#x27;s butt. awww yisssss</li>
            <li> easy to apply, fast acting, gentle, I was able to feel a difference after few minutes. Wound recommend it to busy ladies.</li>
            <li> Recently I noticed that my camel&#x27;s face did not have the beautiful glow that it usually possesses.  She was shying away from her water bucket, presumably due to the shame of seeing the dull color of her once-radiant face, not to mention the wrinkles that lined her eyes.  I purchased this product in an attempt to rejuvenate her skin and give her the confidence to prance across the desert the way she once did.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-My camel&#x27;s face has shown substantial improvement.  She is now prone to spending hours at the pond gazing at her resplendent reflection.&lt;br /&gt;-Applying this enzyme peel is pretty hilarious.  It&#x27;s like trying to calm an angry badger stuck in a burlap sack.&lt;br /&gt;-This would probably work for humans too.  Though I can&#x27;t be sure about that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-Usually she just licks up everything I apply.  I think it might be the pineapple.  We go through approximately one bottle per week.</li>
            <li> This product really works. My skin has never felt cleaner or looked better. I saw a difference in my face after just two uses !</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t think this worked at all, I use other Philosophy peel products that work much better</li>
