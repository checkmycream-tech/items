    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>Took it to my hairdresser and she was very impressed.  </li>
            <li>The conditioner is awesome, and leaves my curls springy and moisturized.</li>
            <li>Best thing that has ever happened to my hair.</li>
            <li>and I found they are the best for my hair type.</li>
            <li>I am not that impressed with these hair care products that I must buy them again.  </li>
            <li>For example, it responded incredibly well for almost two bottles of the Leave-In Detangler.  </li>
            <li>but it smells real nice &amp; the detangler works</li>
            <li>But good price!</li>
            <li>/&gt;The conditioner works great, and I use the leave-in conditioner spray every day.</li>
            <li>The leave-in is great to use after I wash my hair, but it is also great for sparing every day use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>So I was happy to get it.</li>
            <li>ITS  AFFORDABLE,THE DELIVERY  SERVICE GREAT.</li>
            <li>This line of products are amazing!  </li>
            <li>Good product line I like using all 3 products together, and my scalp like it as well.</li>
            <li>Good product</li>
            <li>For some maybe a good buy and for others may not.</li>
            <li>Good product for my hear.</li>
            <li>I did not like the shampoo and could not get a good lather.</li>
            <li>The castor oil is good treatment and may have worked better if I would&#x27;ve maybe have used it longer!</li>
            <li>I love this stuff!</li>
            <li>These products are absolutely AMAZING.</li>
            <li>This is set is amazing.  </li>
            <li>This is an amazing product ordering again once it&#x27;s finished NN</li>
            <li>The smell is overwhelming but good product.</li>
            <li>and she liked the products.</li>
            <li>I really liked the way it felt when I was shampooing my hair.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s own since about February.</li>
            <li>and it also is good in that it softens and conditions my hair for a healthy look and feel.</li>
            <li>Also my hair and scalp feels clean without feeling stripped and I luve that!!</li>
            <li>It has a very strong smell that some dislike.</li>
            <li>Very very strong smell</li>
            <li>I will definitely have to try the conditioner and leave in because this shampoo is everything to my hair, lol!!</li>
            <li>I have to give it some more time.</li>
            <li>I tried this trio and found that when I washed my hair, it did feel a bit better</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this product</li>
            <li>Because it hits way more than it misses, I still like this product.</li>
            <li>After falling absolutely in love with the oil, I decided to go ahead and purchase the hair food and this combo</li>
            <li>I was always a skeptic before about sulfate free, but this is a great line to try if you&#x27;re interested.</li>
            <li>My hair did feel very clean after washing.</li>
            <li>Not much of a lather when washing which is perfect.  </li>
            <li>FYI, the fragrance is STRONG.</li>
            <li>I believe these products made the difference in length, strength and strong roots and edges.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a great deep shampoo/conditioner to use once in awhile.</li>
            <li>(I think it&#x27;s important to know a person&#x27;s hair type when considering the relevancy of his/her review.)</li>
            <li>Only one washing is ever needed, and it provides great slip.  </li>
            <li>Has anyone seen any significant hair growth while using these products?</li>
            <li>Although based on how other products perform, I believe the product is a great price.  </li>
            <li>They seemed to work fine at first, and then as I would wash my hair, the shampoo didn&#x27;t seem as slippery, and neither did the conditioner.</li>
            <li>/&gt;However, I don&#x27;t have anybody wandering up to my and burying their faces into my hair, and my body spray and deodorant quickly overpower any residual scent from the hair care.</li>
            <li>This is the first time I&#x27;ve purchased these products so I can&#x27;t give an accurate account of the cost.  </li>
            <li>The shampoo is sulfate free and washed my hair pretty well...</li>
            <li>far as I can tell, this trio helps to keep hair moisturized; many find that castor oil helps hair to grow and thicken.</li>
            <li>However, now that I&#x27;m further into my transition, it&#x27;s not always effective.  </li>
            <li>I love this line of products because they are ALL NATURAL.</li>
            <li>I did buy the Strong Roots Red Pimiento Hair Growth Oil which that is strong smelling</li>
            <li>The shampoo is rich and really cleans my hair</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve noticed a pretty decent improvement in my hair, particularly in the fine baby hairs around my hair line, so I decided to buy the full set for additional hair</li>
            <li>Let me say, however, the two conditioners certainly do, by comparison!</li>
            <li>So whenever I use the conditioner, I laugh because it really does smell like a jar of dill pickles sitting in a freshly cut pine wood</li>
            <li>I would have rated this product higher, but I did realize this is not for bleached hair; so I gave to my sis</li>
            <li>I did not like it at first, but I am now quite used to it and rather like</li>
            <li>I usually do a hot oil before I wash once a week.</li>
            <li>and this is the first time trying the conditioner</li>
            <li>Buying this bundle allowed me to try the conditioner for the first time.  </li>
            <li>I also realize that my results may be even better with my next use.</li>
            <li>so I can&#x27;t pinpoint exactly what helped,</li>
            <li>Our hair is being repaired and growing and not only looks healthy but IS healthier than it was.  </li>
            <li>For me, that makes this shampoo worthy of its somewhat high price tag.</li>
            <li>Even during my transition, my hair has consistently responded very well to this shampoo.  </li>
            <li>I also mixed it with my Shea moisture black soap shampoo and it smells great.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s not bad unless you live with someone who has a sensitive nose to certain scents, like my spouse who doesn&#x27;t care for the smell.  </li>
            <li>It really helps me to comb my hair out without tangling.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s no Herbal Essences, but customers like me would be purchasing these products for their gentle hair care, not the smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Well this one is very liquid-y</li>
            <li>I would absolutely recommend this to everyone.</li>
            <li>However, since I&#x27;m getting the results I desire which is a healthier head of hair and much faster growth, I will continue using the Tropic Isle products.  </li>
            <li>When I first opened the conditioner, I gasped and told my husband, \\&quot;Whew, this smells like a furniture store with all new, polished wood furniture!\\&quot;</li>
            <li>would recommend this to anybody, so long as they&#x27;re prepared for the strong scent.</li>
            <li>First, it should be noted that I am 3-1/2 months into my transition from relaxed to natural.</li>
            <li>Anything Jamaican Black Castor Oil I love.  </li>
            <li>Only used once I will give me feed back if after more uses</li>
            <li>so I mainly apply at night to avoid going out with the scent in the morning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will</li>
            <li>so i am satisfied but will only use this for hair restoration not my daily maintenance.</li>
            <li>Cannot wait to order a few more bottles.</li>
            <li>I normally rely on a prescription Ketoconazole shampoo 2%, but even with that and use of prescription scalp creams, I still suffer.</li>
            <li>Then I decided to wear a full lace for about 3 months and condition my hair and scalp regularly with the Tropic Isle products and I was quite surprised.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve always heard of the healing properties of natural products and JBCO in particular, but this exceeded expectations.</li>
            <li>I plan on using in the future for a week, then rewashing my hair with other organic hair care that washes out better and leaves my hair fluffier.</li>
            <li>They arrived quick and faster than the expected date.</li>
            <li>So far I like the way it cleanse my hair</li>
            <li>so far I like it)</li>
            <li>I feel my hair really grows with multiple use of this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks!</li>
            <li>The leave in conditioner keeps my hair soft during washings.</li>
            <li>All natural products that moisturizes and conditions hair leaving it manageable.</li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t provide as much slip as I was expecting, but enough to make it  tolerable.</li>
            <li>Leaves natural hair soft.</li>
            <li>Low Sulfate, NO Sulfate, or designed specifically for natural hair!!</li>
            <li>And the ingredient list is a big plus, because its all natural ingredients!!</li>
            <li>A new twist to traditional castor oil products.</li>
            <li>apparently</li>
            <li>I wash and condition my hair daily, after I complete my morning exercise routine.  </li>
            <li>ALL ROUND WORTH PURCHASING.</li>
            <li>It seems too heavy and my hair doesn&#x27;t feel right after using it.</li>
            <li>No matter how dirty or how much product buildup I have on my hair after a week, it gently and thoroughly gets it clean.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t rate it higher due to how it left my hair feeling.  </li>
            <li>My hair is also very finicky and unpredictably temperamental when it comes to hair products.</li>
            <li>I have very thick, very wavy, and course \\&quot;combination hair\\&quot; -- mostly type 4B, with small areas that are borderline</li>
            <li>I wore weave for a very long time and when I finally decided to go natural</li>

            <li> I have very, very long hair.</li>
            <li> Be careful though: a  little goes a long way, so don&#x27;t pour a bunch in your hand like you would with other shampoos.</li>
            <li> Less dry scalp and soothing sensation to my scalp.</li>
            <li> A little of each product goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> I have been using Tropical isle shampoo and some of their other products for over two years</li>
            <li> Coupled with the other two products, this bundle is a keeper for me.  </li>

            <li> And as I have thinning, baby-fine hair, none of these products weigh down my hair, or make it appear lank, greasy or dirty.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Purchased for my mom we started with the black castor oil which she like alot then</li>

            <li> Doing so will save you at least $5.</li>

            <li> The smell is overwhelming but good product. Good product line I like using all 3 products together, and my scalp like it as well. Less dry scalp and soothing sensation to my scalp.</li>
            <li> I would have rated this product higher, but I did realize this is not for bleached hair; so I gave to my sis and she liked the products.</li>
            <li> I am a nautral African American woman and I have never had a shampoo that instantly softens my hair the moment I apply it!!!. As soon as I put the shampoo in my hair I could instantly finger detangle my hair and that has NEVER been possible with any other shampoo I&#x27;ve used be it Low Sulfate, NO Sulfate, or designed specifically for natural hair!! And the ingredient list is a big plus, because its all natural ingredients!! Also my hair and scalp feels clean without feeling stripped and I luve that!! I will definitely have to try the conditioner and leave in because this shampoo is everything to my hair, lol!! Will defiinitely be sticking with this for awhile!!!</li>
            <li> I really liked the way it felt when I was shampooing my hair. It seems to replenish it and strengthen it. I have very, very long hair. I didn&#x27;t rate it higher due to how it left my hair feeling.  It seems too heavy and my hair doesn&#x27;t feel right after using it. I plan on using in the future for a week, then rewashing my hair with other organic hair care that washes out better and leaves my hair fluffier. It&#x27;s a great deep shampoo/conditioner to use once in awhile.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the shampoo from this set on it&#x27;s own since about February. I&#x27;ve noticed a pretty decent improvement in my hair, particularly in the fine baby hairs around my hair line, so I decided to buy the full set for additional hair care.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The conditioner works great, and I use the leave-in conditioner spray every day. It really helps me to comb my hair out without tangling. And as I have thinning, baby-fine hair, none of these products weigh down my hair, or make it appear lank, greasy or dirty.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only caveat is, as others have mentioned, the smell! Phew! I&#x27;d read other reviewers claim the shampoo had a &#x27;funky&#x27; scent, which didn&#x27;t bother me in the least. Let me say, however, the two conditioners certainly do, by comparison! When I first opened the conditioner, I gasped and told my husband, \\&quot;Whew, this smells like a furniture store with all new, polished wood furniture!\\&quot; He took a whiff and said, \\&quot;It smells like a pickle.\\&quot; So whenever I use the conditioner, I laugh because it really does smell like a jar of dill pickles sitting in a freshly cut pine wood drawer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The spray conditioner is the same. It makes sense since bay, basil, cedarwood and cypress are included in the ingredients list.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, I don&#x27;t have anybody wandering up to my and burying their faces into my hair, and my body spray and deodorant quickly overpower any residual scent from the hair care. It&#x27;s no Herbal Essences, but customers like me would be purchasing these products for their gentle hair care, not the smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this to anybody, so long as they&#x27;re prepared for the strong scent.</li>
            <li> So far I like the way it cleanse my hair I&#x27;m using this as a in between co washing. I like to change up on shampoo and conditioners. Only used once I will give me feed back if after more uses I don&#x27;t like.My hair did feel very clean after washing. (I had a lot of product build up didn&#x27;t wash as soon waiting on this product to arrive to try,so far I like it)</li>
            <li> Took it to my hairdresser and she was very impressed.  Cannot wait to order a few more bottles. Good product</li>
            <li> Left my hair feeling sicky</li>
            <li> I did not like the way it made my hair feel but it smells real nice &amp; the detangler works</li>
            <li> First, please understand that this is not Pantene and does not have any artificial perfumes. So, it smells like what&#x27;s in it: Castor oil, pimento, etc. It has a very strong smell that some dislike. I did not like it at first, but I am now quite used to it and rather like it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While these products are usually touted for naturally curly hair, I see no reason why it shouldn&#x27;t work for a variety of different hair types. I find that the shampoo is cleansing without stripping my hair and creating fly-aways. The conditioner is awesome, and leaves my curls springy and moisturized. The leave-in is great to use after I wash my hair, but it is also great for sparing every day use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As far as I can tell, this trio helps to keep hair moisturized; many find that castor oil helps hair to grow and thicken.</li>
            <li> Best thing that has ever happened to my hair. The smell is not a big deal, it&#x27;s definately not something you can&#x27;t get used to. My hair has definately gotten thicker and stronger since I&#x27;ve been using. I wore weave for a very long time and when I finally decided to go natural I had really bad split ends, and serious hair loss around the perimeter of my head. I&#x27;ve been using this as well as the protein deep conditioner and the hair oil. I usually do a hot oil before I wash once a week. You must buy !!!!</li>
            <li> I seen the picture of the girl who had bald spots like mines. The girl who does my hair said it is working . I have to give it some more time.</li>
            <li> Anything Jamaican Black Castor Oil I love.  I feel my hair really grows with multiple use of this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks!</li>
            <li> I have been using Tropical isle shampoo and some of their other products for over two years and I found they are the best for my hair type. The shampoo is rich and really cleans my hair and this is the first time trying the conditioner and it also is good in that it softens and conditions my hair for a healthy look and feel. The leave in conditioner keeps my hair soft during washings. I would recommend these products.</li>
            <li> A new twist to traditional castor oil products. All natural products that moisturizes and conditions hair leaving it manageable. Fantistic on your baby&#x27;s hair too.</li>
            <li> I tried this trio and found that when I washed my hair, it did feel a bit better so I can feel the Shea butter that it has and the castor oil in it. The scent is awful at times unbearable to stand so I stopped using it. I did buy the Strong Roots Red Pimiento Hair Growth Oil which that is strong smelling so I mainly apply at night to avoid going out with the scent in the morning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will I purchase this again, if I&#x27;m desperate yes but other than that, doubt it. The castor oil is good treatment and may have worked better if I would&#x27;ve maybe have used it longer! For some maybe a good buy and for others may not. But good price!</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product</li>
            <li> This line of products are amazing!  I use this trio set as well as the jamaican castor oil and protein conditioner (for deep conditioning).  The shampoo cleans me and my daughter&#x27;s hair without stripping it.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t really like the smell of this (too mediciny), and it doesn&#x27;t do anything that any other shampoo and conditioner (which you can purchase for a lot less money) can do.  Pass it by.</li>
            <li> The answer is no, I don&#x27;t think so.  I am not that impressed with these hair care products that I must buy them again.  They seemed to work fine at first, and then as I would wash my hair, the shampoo didn&#x27;t seem as slippery, and neither did the conditioner.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t work as stated.</li>
            <li> First, it should be noted that I am 3-1/2 months into my transition from relaxed to natural. I have very thick, very wavy, and course \\&quot;combination hair\\&quot; -- mostly type 4B, with small areas that are borderline 4C.  (I think it&#x27;s important to know a person&#x27;s hair type when considering the relevancy of his/her review.) My hair is also very finicky and unpredictably temperamental when it comes to hair products. For example, it responded incredibly well for almost two bottles of the Leave-In Detangler.  However, now that I&#x27;m further into my transition, it&#x27;s not always effective.  Sometimes it provides no slip at all! Because it hits way more than it misses, I still like this product. When it hits, it melts and detangles all of my hair like butter. If you&#x27;re like me, you may be used to a creamy detangling formula. Well this one is very liquid-y, so don&#x27;t let that set you back - especially if it works for you.  Shampoo:  I love this stuff! No matter how dirty or how much product buildup I have on my hair after a week, it gently and thoroughly gets it clean. Only one washing is ever needed, and it provides great slip.  Be careful though: a  little goes a long way, so don&#x27;t pour a bunch in your hand like you would with other shampoos. For me, that makes this shampoo worthy of its somewhat high price tag. Even during my transition, my hair has consistently responded very well to this shampoo.  Conditioner:  Buying this bundle allowed me to try the conditioner for the first time.  I&#x27;ve only used it once, but the results were favorable. It didn&#x27;t provide as much slip as I was expecting, but enough to make it  tolerable. I also realize that my results may be even better with my next use. Coupled with the other two products, this bundle is a keeper for me.  Just an added note:  If you like or want to try all three of these items, definitely buy them with this bundle. Doing so will save you at least $5. I wish I came across it sooner.  Hope this helps, ladies (and gents).  Blessings!</li>
            <li> Has anyone seen any significant hair growth while using these products?</li>
            <li> I love this line of products because they are ALL NATURAL. The shampoo is sulfate free and washed my hair pretty well...I was always a skeptic before about sulfate free, but this is a great line to try if you&#x27;re interested. FYI, the fragrance is STRONG.</li>
            <li> Good product for my hear.</li>
            <li> Very very strong smell I had to cut the smell with other oils after washing the hair. I also mixed it with my Shea moisture black soap shampoo and it smells great. It did work for my edges though so i am satisfied but will only use this for hair restoration not my daily maintenance.</li>
            <li> They arrived quick and faster than the expected date. I am taking this product with me to Kenya for a friend who has a salon their. So I was happy to get it. If you zip around the net you will see that JBCO makes women hair grow all the time!</li>
            <li> These products are absolutely AMAZING. Its literally unbelievable. I have been suffering from sebhoraic dermatitis for years! I get dry itchy scalp that is at its worst in the colder months. I normally rely on a prescription Ketoconazole shampoo 2%, but even with that and use of prescription scalp creams, I still suffer. I washed my hair with this JBCO shampoo and conditioner and it was gone. Not reduced, not improved...gone. I&#x27;ve always heard of the healing properties of natural products and JBCO in particular, but this exceeded expectations. For the people whining about the smell - it&#x27;s really not that bad, not overpowering, and definitely not something that stays with you post rinsing. I would absolutely recommend this to everyone.</li>
            <li> Purchased for my mom we started with the black castor oil which she like alot then when I mentioned that there were other products she asked me to get these for her also.</li>
            <li> I WILL DEFINITELY RECOMMEND  THIS PRODUCT TO ALL. ITS  AFFORDABLE,THE DELIVERY  SERVICE GREAT. ALL ROUND WORTH PURCHASING. HAVE NOT REGRETTED BUYING.</li>
            <li> My hair was broken off severely.  Dried and brittle and after watching dozens of you tube videos and doing research, I started off with the black jamaican castor oil. 8oz.  After falling absolutely in love with the oil, I decided to go ahead and purchase the hair food and this combo set.&lt;br /&gt;I wore the 27 piece weave, and sew in weaves all done by the wrong people apparently and my hair was brittle.  Then I decided to wear a full lace for about 3 months and condition my hair and scalp regularly with the Tropic Isle products and I was quite surprised.  (I also began drinking water and taking a multivitamin)....so I can&#x27;t pinpoint exactly what helped, but since I also used this in my daughter&#x27;s hair (age 8 and 13) and notice the difference in them also....I believe these products made the difference in length, strength and strong roots and edges.  Not much of a lather when washing which is perfect.  Our hair is being repaired and growing and not only looks healthy but IS healthier than it was.  We are african american and our hair is of a yaki texture.  It works well.</li>
            <li> This is set is amazing.  Only reason I didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars is because they don&#x27;t make bigger bottles.</li>
            <li> I did not like the shampoo and could not get a good lather. It was to oily and had a hard time trying to rinse it out of my hair. I finally had to use another shampoo to cleanse my hair.</li>
            <li> Smells horrible.  I like the way the conditioner makes my hair feel.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, none of the Tropic Isle Living Jamaican products work for me.  My hair came out in lumps after using the shampoo and protein conditioner.  I used the castor oil and my hair line has thinned out.</li>
            <li> This is the first time I&#x27;ve purchased these products so I can&#x27;t give an accurate account of the cost.  Although based on how other products perform, I believe the product is a great price.  I&#x27;ve been using these products after I cut off all of the relaxer (chemicals) out of my hair.  I wash and condition my hair daily, after I complete my morning exercise routine.  A little of each product goes a long way.  I like the way my hair feels after I use these products.  I can see that my hair seems to be healthier and stronger after using the Tropic Isle products for only one month.  The smell may require some getting use to but it&#x27;s not bad unless you live with someone who has a sensitive nose to certain scents, like my spouse who doesn&#x27;t care for the smell.  However, since I&#x27;m getting the results I desire which is a healthier head of hair and much faster growth, I will continue using the Tropic Isle products.  I recommend all of these products.</li>
            <li> With any of the Jamaican black castor oil bro ducts. I like it. Leaves natural hair soft. The product can be used with processed hair too.</li>
            <li> This is an amazing product ordering again once it&#x27;s finished NN</li>
