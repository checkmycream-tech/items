            <li>I couldn&#x27;t wait to take a shower and clean my face!</li>
            <li>I bought this product with high hopes based from many good reviews online.</li>
            <li>so I decided to change and look for something else which led me to buy PTR Acne Kit with high hopes based on many good reviews.</li>
            <li>it makes me feel really clean :)</li>
            <li>When I noticed the great results, I bought the bigger bottles of the cleanser, and</li>
            <li>Works great, low price for a starter kit</li>
            <li>I have fair and slightly sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>So if other people notice then it has to be doing some thing good!</li>
            <li>Nothing special.</li>
            <li>I thought I would try something more high end than my neutrogena 2.5% benzoyl peroxide cream and what a mistake!</li>
            <li>I have gone on to buy full sizes of all the products.</li>
            <li>I bought a full size of both the sulfur and aha bha face wash.</li>
            <li>so I follow up with a super creamy moisturizer.</li>
            <li>Is i Received it exactly on time!</li>
            <li>I have already ordered big versions of the beads, cleanser &amp; clearing gel &amp; use them daily to great results; I can tell in the texture of my skin when I skip the buffing beads because they smooth everything out so well.</li>
            <li>The only thing I really liked was the scrub</li>
            <li>It was worth a try.</li>
            <li>I had tried many drug store products and exfoliating products and even tried proactive and even though my skin looked clear I still had under the skin bumps that would not go away.</li>
            <li>I personally have not tried the oil free tube yet and the salycilic acid gel isn&#x27;t my favorite</li>
            <li>The clearing gel is worth the price</li>
            <li>After one use if really feels clean.</li>
            <li>Great skin care product only wish it came in larger sizes.</li>
            <li>I still keep this kit handy, and if my skin gets out of control I use it for a day or two, and everything goes back to normal.  </li>
            <li>overall pretty pleased</li>
            <li>is this first product that has STOPPED my breakouts</li>
            <li>I still use sulfate-free soap to remove makeup and end-of-day or first thing in the morning face grease - I seem to have stuff that&#x27;s more than simple oil.  </li>
            <li>I have used this for about a month religiously and have fallen In love with it immediatly.</li>
            <li>My acne kit arrived on the 4th day and I saw immediate results in the first 24 hours.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used Clinique and it did good on me for few years</li>
            <li>Products are just a sampler kit pretty much.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m suffering from mild adult acne.</li>
            <li>This really helped my post-partum acne.  </li>
            <li>This really works for me.</li>
            <li>I really notice a difference in shine on the days I forget to put it on.</li>
            <li>always had luck with sulfur based products and the combination of sulfur and acid ingredients in these products really work for me</li>
            <li>thank you so much</li>
            <li>but they are very small, good thing</li>
            <li>I would recommend this product to anyone looking for a sensitive way to clear mild acne.</li>
            <li>It has definitely helped to reduce my mild acne.</li>
            <li>I received these products 3 days ago and when I got the package I was really dissapointed at how small the products were for the price, but, good things come in small packages because my skin is looking amazing after only 3 days of using them!!  </li>
            <li>I had a decent amount of milia on my checks which were driving me nuts.</li>
            <li>I only used it for a week or two, which got my skin back in balance, and then I switched back to my normal, more mild soap.  </li>
            <li>The only bad part is that now I have to purchase the full size bottle to make him happy!</li>
            <li>I would highly reccomend these products.</li>
            <li>I buy his products and he makes high quality stuff.</li>
            <li>I purchased this for my daughter who has very oily skin and frequently breaks out.</li>
            <li>We lost power for a few days(5) and I wasn&#x27;t able to wash my face</li>
            <li>I have to be vigilant because it&#x27;s not my normal system that&#x27;s causing this</li>
            <li>, it looks clearer now, not perfect, but is really better, I recommend it!!</li>
            <li>Also because I have very sensitive skin, and Can&#x27;t use alot of products.</li>
            <li>Not that I expected full size bottles</li>
            <li>My new go-to for clear skin.</li>
            <li>Is a little pricey but worth very cent.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know that this has worked any miracles, but I do think it has helped clear up my skin.</li>
            <li>I bought this kit thinking it would help clear my skin</li>
            <li>When I stare to brake out I use the whole system and I notice a change the very next day.</li>
            <li>I\\&quot;ve had a coworker tell me how soft and clear my face was.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 60 years old and on medication that causes acne - again.  </li>
            <li>I do recommend this, and would rate it 5 stars if I weren&#x27;t so sensitive to it.</li>
            <li>I have adult acne and used everything on my face</li>
            <li>I pruchesed this product because over the last 10 years I have been battling adult acne.  </li>
            <li>At first there was a little dryness created by the clearing gel and spot treatment.</li>
            <li>I finally decided to suck it up and spend a little extra on a few more products to try.</li>
            <li>I have had this kit for a week, and my face is clear already with no new breakouts.</li>

            <li> I&#x27;m 60 years old and on medication that causes acne - again.  </li>
            <li> I do recommend this, and would rate it 5 stars if I weren&#x27;t so sensitive to it.</li>
            <li> I have adult acne and used everything on my face</li>
            <li> I pruchesed this product because over the last 10 years I have been battling adult acne.  </li>
            <li> At first there was a little dryness created by the clearing gel and spot treatment.</li>
            <li> I finally decided to suck it up and spend a little extra on a few more products to try.</li>
            <li> I have had this kit for a week, and my face is clear already with no new breakouts.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend for trouble skin.</li>
            <li> The little under the skin bumps are getting smaller and I can visibly see that my pores in my cheeks and nose are clear.</li>
            <li> I was using another brand I picked up in the grocery store and it has the same essential active ingredient as PTR</li>
            <li> but the products in the kit is a lil smaller than I expected.</li>
            <li> Thought I was done with this stuff a long time ago.  </li>
            <li> The other brand I was using left my skin feeling slimy - I was using the anti-acne wash and the pore refining scrub.  </li>
            <li> The buffing beads dont go a very long way they dont suds up well.</li>
            <li> Mask was so dry that it fell out of the container and is unusable.</li>
            <li> I have only been using dime size amounts of each product and a little goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and there are places on my face that can become a little raw - especially around the nose.  </li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re a male looking to purchase skin care products look at the Jack Black line on amazon.</li>
            <li> and he said he&#x27;s only noticed a little difference.</li>
            <li> The other acne products didn&#x27;t really dry out the acne</li>
            <li> I seen a different in my face just after a few weeks.</li>
            <li> Did not shrink it even a little, make it less red, etc.</li>
            <li> I use it every other day.</li>
            <li> Purchased it here at amazon because its cheaper  compare to other online stores.</li>
            <li> The wash and buffing beads do have sulfates, but unlike soaps or other products I&#x27;ve used it doesn&#x27;t seem to bother me noticeably.  </li>
            <li> The reason for the 3 stars is this is so rough on your face!</li>
            <li> and it has been a difficult struggle to find a regime that wouldn&#x27;t break me out and show real results .</li>
            <li> It takes hours for my swelling to go down</li>
            <li> I decided to use both every other day instead of everyday.</li>
            <li> This product is expensive, but I figure I will order the kits and when necessary order the larger sizes.  </li>
            <li> I have always had very red, random breakouts that leave blemishes lasting for weeks.</li>
            <li> I am sorry I waited so long to actually try it.</li>
            <li> I get a little acne every now and then.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for a few weeks now.</li>
            <li> Anti Glare Product was dried out.  </li>
            <li> I have been getting cystic acne for the past few months.</li>
            <li> The beads are too small and sparse and feels oily.</li>
            <li> I used the CLNS cleanser for 3 days hoping it would help with my redness and unfortunately the only difference I noticed</li>
            <li> Very harsh on my skin.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t expect miracles, but I get at least slight improvement using drugstore products, this seriously sucked.</li>
            <li> Anyway the sulfur treatment is seriously stinky and lingers.</li>
            <li> Been using for about a month and discernible difference over less expensive products.</li>
            <li> And worst of all,  my skin became extremely dry to the extent that it burned my skin (chin area) due to dryness.</li>
            <li> Burned my skin, ended up irritating it and making it worse.</li>
            <li> Seals on each product were broken.  </li>
            <li> but I was getting worse.  </li>
            <li> Im a latin dark skin guy with BAD acne, and now I have a noticeable improvement on my face</li>

            <li> I thought I would try something more high end than my neutrogena 2.5% benzoyl peroxide cream and what a mistake! This set did NOTHING for my acne. I don&#x27;t have cystic acne (they&#x27;re not lumpy or painful) but my acne is considered severe. I have countless breakouts on my chin and along my jawline that are red and do not have the yellow \\&quot;head\\&quot; to pop. Anyway the sulfur treatment is seriously stinky and lingers. It did nothing for my acne. Did not shrink it even a little, make it less red, etc. The cleanser is whatever and the scrub is...ineffective. The beads are too small and sparse and feels oily. I don&#x27;t like using any of the products in this kit because of how they feel, smell, and their overall ineffectiveness. The salicylic acid gel is also useless. I didn&#x27;t expect miracles, but I get at least slight improvement using drugstore products, this seriously sucked. Fails so bad.</li>
            <li> The only thing I really liked was the scrub The other acne products didn&#x27;t really dry out the acne so didnt work for me to well</li>
            <li> This really helped my post-partum acne.  I only used it for a week or two, which got my skin back in balance, and then I switched back to my normal, more mild soap.  I still keep this kit handy, and if my skin gets out of control I use it for a day or two, and everything goes back to normal.  I recommend this to all adults I know suffering from acne.</li>
            <li> I love love love the buffing beads, cleanser, and acne clearing gel in this kit. Haven&#x27;t used the primer as primers tend to make my face mad at me &amp; the spot treatment does not work for me. I have already ordered big versions of the beads, cleanser &amp; clearing gel &amp; use them daily to great results; I can tell in the texture of my skin when I skip the buffing beads because they smooth everything out so well. The one product of these that I will never be without again is the clearing gel however, it&#x27;s that good.</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t say this stuff gets rid of acne, as my husband has been using it and he said he&#x27;s only noticed a little difference. It was worth a try.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for a few weeks now. It has definitely helped to reduce my mild acne. I have fair and slightly sensitive skin. At first there was a little dryness created by the clearing gel and spot treatment. I decided to use both every other day instead of everyday. Also, I found it best to apply a moisturizer first. I have gone on to buy full sizes of all the products. I would recommend this product to anyone looking for a sensitive way to clear mild acne.</li>
            <li> Love the scrub, but the wash made me breakout even more,just not the product for me though it may work for others</li>
            <li> Burned my skin, ended up irritating it and making it worse. Don&#x27;t do it!</li>
            <li> Seals on each product were broken.  Anti Glare Product was dried out.  Mask was so dry that it fell out of the container and is unusable.</li>
            <li> I picked this set up on another site and feel in love with it. I came here looking for more. I love how it made my face feel. After one use if really feels clean. I use it every other day. I seen a different in my face just after a few weeks. I&#x27;m 32 and I some times break out like a teenager. This really works for me. We lost power for a few days(5) and I wasn&#x27;t able to wash my face and I stared to brake out again. I couldn&#x27;t wait to take a shower and clean my face! When I stare to brake out I use the whole system and I notice a change the very next day. I\\&quot;ve had a coworker tell me how soft and clear my face was. So if other people notice then it has to be doing some thing good!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know that this has worked any miracles, but I do think it has helped clear up my skin. It is a bit drying so I also bought the Peter Thomas Roth Oiless to put on after all of these treatments. The oil mattifying gel works wonders. I really notice a difference in shine on the days I forget to put it on.</li>
            <li> Peter Thomas Roth Blemish Buster Kit ($51 Value)  This product was horrible I get a little acne every now and then. I bought this kit thinking it would help clear my skin but it did the opposite of that. I don&#x27;t know why but this kit is a travel size kit the bottles are smaller versions of the actual product considering the size this product is overpriced. If you&#x27;re a male looking to purchase skin care products look at the Jack Black line on amazon.</li>
            <li> I purchased this for my daughter who has very oily skin and frequently breaks out. She used to use Wexler product but they don&#x27;t make that any more. So I&#x27;m glad we were able to find a replacement for her</li>
            <li> Excellent for adult acne. I am sorry I waited so long to actually try it. My new go-to for clear skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always used PTR products and absolutely love it. but the products in the kit is a lil smaller than I expected. overall pretty pleased</li>
            <li> I been using it for a month now and they work great for me, Im a latin dark skin guy with BAD acne, and now I have a noticeable improvement on my face, it looks clearer now, not perfect, but is really better, I recommend it!!</li>
            <li> Great skin care product only wish it came in larger sizes. Is a little pricey but worth very cent. Highly recommend for trouble skin.</li>
            <li> I have had acne all my life&lt;br /&gt;bad scarring and hyperpigmentation&lt;br /&gt;Ive tried everything from prescription drugs to the popular &amp;#34;proactive&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;This is this first product that has STOPPED my breakouts completely&lt;br /&gt;have been using for a month now and very happy with results&lt;br /&gt;Have always had luck with sulfur based products and the combination of sulfur and acid ingredients in these products really work for me</li>
            <li> Great purchase value.</li>
            <li> I was recommended this product from a friend. I bought the small kit to try it out first, just incase I didn&#x27;t like it. Also because I have very sensitive skin, and Can&#x27;t use alot of products. When I noticed the great results, I bought the bigger bottles of the cleanser, and Acne gel. I recommend this product to anyone suffering from Acne.</li>
            <li> Products are just a sampler kit pretty much. Not that I expected full size bottles but they are very small, good thing Is i Received it exactly on time!</li>
            <li> I bought this product with high hopes based from many good reviews online. Purchased it here at amazon because its cheaper  compare to other online stores. I&#x27;m not used to writing reviews but since this product did not do good on me so just to warn others to think twice before purchasing this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m suffering from mild adult acne. I&#x27;ve used Clinique and it did good on me for few years but my skin became used to it so I decided to change and look for something else which led me to buy PTR Acne Kit with high hopes based on many good reviews. Some reviews says they breakout but later cleared it out. I understand that process so I decided to give this a try. But these products are not for me I guess! It made me breakout even more. And worst of all,  my skin became extremely dry to the extent that it burned my skin (chin area) due to dryness. Now I have brownish/reddish patch on my lower lip/chin area !!! I&#x27;m only using this for 2 weeks and this is happening to me??? If only I could return this I will definitely return this back to the seller! The burning sensation which I still have while writing this review makes me soooo angry and devastated!</li>
            <li> Works great, low price for a starter kit</li>
            <li> I pruchesed this product because over the last 10 years I have been battling adult acne.  I never had big breakouts but alot of under the skin bumps and clogged pores.  I had tried many drug store products and exfoliating products and even tried proactive and even though my skin looked clear I still had under the skin bumps that would not go away. I received these products 3 days ago and when I got the package I was really dissapointed at how small the products were for the price, but, good things come in small packages because my skin is looking amazing after only 3 days of using them!!  I have only been using dime size amounts of each product and a little goes a long way.  The cleanser is smooth and I can feel how clean my skin is when I am done but the exfoliating beads are awesome. The little under the skin bumps are getting smaller and I can visibly see that my pores in my cheeks and nose are clear. My skin looks flawless and refreshed and  I am so excited to see what my skin looks like a week from now.  I would highly reccomend these products.</li>
            <li> Very harsh on my skin. I did notice that it got rid of some current acne when I used it, but it didn&#x27;t prevent it from happening.  It does bleach towels! I wouldn&#x27;t buy again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 60 years old and on medication that causes acne - again.  Thought I was done with this stuff a long time ago.  I have cystic acne; it hurts and its difficult to heal.  I was using another brand I picked up in the grocery store and it has the same essential active ingredient as PTR but I was getting worse.  The other brand I was using left my skin feeling slimy - I was using the anti-acne wash and the pore refining scrub.  It never felt like I got the stuff rinsed off.  So I decided to try this product.  Within 5 days I was so much better - so much better.  I still use sulfate-free soap to remove makeup and end-of-day or first thing in the morning face grease - I seem to have stuff that&#x27;s more than simple oil.  Then I use all of the products, except I don&#x27;t use the matte finish at night.  And what I really love is I can easily rinse the cleanser and the buffing beads off.  My skin squeaks.  I have to be vigilant because it&#x27;s not my normal system that&#x27;s causing this it&#x27;s medication I will never be rid of, but I&#x27;m getting things under control.  This product is expensive, but I figure I will order the kits and when necessary order the larger sizes.  I have sensitive skin and there are places on my face that can become a little raw - especially around the nose.  When that happens, I skip an application.  The wash and buffing beads do have sulfates, but unlike soaps or other products I&#x27;ve used it doesn&#x27;t seem to bother me noticeably.  Probably how it&#x27;s formulated, the amount or the fact that it rinses so well.  Whatever the reason, it is working for me.</li>
            <li> This kit def gets ride of acne. I have been getting cystic acne for the past few months. Nothing has worked. I&#x27;ve looked like a teenaged pizza face lol.  I have had this kit for a week, and my face is clear already with no new breakouts. The reason for the 3 stars is this is so rough on your face! I have to bathe in facial moisturizer to keep my skin from looking like sand paper. For some reason when I wake up in the mornings my eyes are swollen shut. It takes hours for my swelling to go down and I look like I have been beat up, ha. Maybe I&#x27;m a bit allergic to one of the ingredients? I&#x27;m going to drop my use to 2-3 x a week and see if that helps with the side effects. I do recommend this, and would rate it 5 stars if I weren&#x27;t so sensitive to it. Others may not be. So I believe the 5 star ratings and reviews.</li>
            <li> Nothing special. Been using for about a month and discernible difference over less expensive products.</li>
            <li> Peter Thomas Roth is the man. I buy his products and he makes high quality stuff. I bought this for my husband to try and he absolutely loved it. The only bad part is that now I have to purchase the full size bottle to make him happy! lol.</li>
            <li> I have adult acne and used everything on my face Peter Thomas Roth is a skin God. I love his products!</li>
            <li> perfect things I never heard It is doing well in my family we all love it. thank you so much</li>
            <li> The buffing beads dont go a very long way they dont suds up well. I bought a full size of both the sulfur and aha bha face wash. I personally have not tried the oil free tube yet and the salycilic acid gel isn&#x27;t my favorite i dont recommend it for people who have stubborn skin like me. Not a miracle product but i will say the face wash i love it makes me feel really clean :)</li>
            <li> I had a decent amount of milia on my checks which were driving me nuts. Milia are formed when keratin (a substance produced by the skin) becomes entrapped beneath the outer layer of the skin, forming a tiny cyst. The milia are almost impossible to scrub away...believe me I have tried.  The products in this kits (face wash,scrub and treatment gel) have helped to actually get rid of the milia after 1 months use.  Thrilled with the results.  It can be drying so I follow up with a super creamy moisturizer.</li>
            <li> I have used this for about a month religiously and have fallen In love with it immediatly. I ah e acne scars from teen years and it has been a difficult struggle to find a regime that wouldn&#x27;t break me out and show real results . I have even made my husband use it and he now asks when I will be buyin the larger sets of these. The clearing gel is worth the price and if you follow the directions correctly you will get the results you r looking for .</li>
            <li> I cannot believe this product, I&#x27;ve tried everything you can think of for my acne and nothing has worked; I have tried things from proactive to prescriptions from my doctor. I have always had very red, random breakouts that leave blemishes lasting for weeks. I finally decided to suck it up and spend a little extra on a few more products to try. I purchased this along with this:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00NUPUDJ0/ref&#x3D;oh_aui_detailpage_o00_s00?ie&#x3D;UTF8&amp;psc&#x3D;1&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While waiting for the acne kit to arrive I used the CLNS cleanser for 3 days hoping it would help with my redness and unfortunately the only difference I noticed was in the softness of my skin, but no acne improvement. My acne kit arrived on the 4th day and I saw immediate results in the first 24 hours. I have posted pictures to show the results.</li>
