            <li> it&#x27;s not..as long as they make it, I will order it.</li>
            <li> says it is the same as their other products..</li>
            <li> also works well at night when lenses get smudgy or dry - it will buy you another hour or two at night with lens wear.</li>
            <li> I tend to have dry eyes</li>
            <li> They clear out eye lashes and small particles in your eyes.  </li>
            <li> No other drops I&#x27;ve ever used over the past 42 years come close to the level of cleaning ability and thus comfort</li>
            <li> It’s not available in local stores anymore.</li>
            <li> Tried other eye drops</li>
            <li> i sleep in my 30 day contacts and some mornings i need a little moistener and works for that too.</li>
            <li> Unable to find in stores.</li>
            <li> will continue ordering, but hate all these reviews, I&#x27;m a per son of few words and hate taking the time out of my schedule to fill in the blanks for you</li>
            <li> I will be very sad when they stop making this product</li>

            <li> clears the smudge and protein off hard/RGP lenses.  I use every morning once lenses are in.  also works well at night when lenses get smudgy or dry - it will buy you another hour or two at night with lens wear. I will be very sad when they stop making this product</li>
            <li> I tend to have dry eyes so these drops, which are thicker than most, are really good for me. And I haven&#x27;t been able to find them in drug stores for years so I&#x27;m most grateful to be able to get them from Amazon!</li>
            <li> If these are ever discontinued I&#x27;ll have to give up contact lenses. No other drops I&#x27;ve ever used over the past 42 years come close to the level of cleaning ability and thus comfort Clerz Plus provides.</li>
            <li> cleans contacts while in your eye and lubricates as well. Nice product.</li>
            <li> Use Clerz twice daily</li>
            <li> Coud not do wothout it.  Tried other eye drops but these are superior</li>
            <li> Only in-eye cleaner that really works. I can make 10 day contacts  last 30 days without ever taking them out and they are not extended wear.  Luv it!</li>
            <li> So far I like these drops. I have some contacts that get gooey and these seem to help. I liked the advice to put them in your eyes before you put in your contacts. It&#x27;s nice to have a bottle for at home, in my purse, and at the gym.</li>
            <li> The only type of eye drops that work with my disposable contacts. I’ve been using this product for many years. It’s not available in local stores anymore.</li>
            <li> Only eye drop I will use as a contact lens wearer.</li>
            <li> Good product and hard to fine.  will continue ordering, but hate all these reviews, I&#x27;m a per son of few words and hate taking the time out of my schedule to fill in the blanks for you</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for years, and it&#x27;s the best in the market for moistening lenses while being worn. Always clears off debris and makes wearing lenses very comfortable. Doesn&#x27;t add to film on lenses.</li>
            <li> Awesome product, have used it for years and years. Can&#x27;t find it in the States and alcon says it is the same as their other products..it&#x27;s not..as long as they make it, I will order it. Eyes feel so much better with this product!</li>
            <li> I purchased these eye drops for my family and myself.  We use them when needed.  They clear out eye lashes and small particles in your eyes.  These drops are for contact lens wearers.  What I liked about this purchase is I received 6 boxes with this one order which saved money, time and gas.  There&#x27;s nothing like running out of eye drops when you need them.  I would recommend this product.</li>
            <li> The disappearing Clerz, online only these days. Great drop and cleans lenses well. I only wish it were possible o get them locally.</li>
            <li> I have found that Clerz plus works best for me. After using it for several years, it disappeared from store shelves. I was relieved to find it on Amazon.</li>
            <li> These are truly THE BEST eye drops I have ever used! My eyes produce a lot of &amp;#34;gunk&amp;#34; throughout the day, and these are the only drops that have ever helped me! Please don&#x27;t ever stop selling these! I love them!!!!!</li>
            <li> clerz was recommended by my ophthalmologist years ago and it is the best product for clearing your eyes of junk without having to take the contacts out.  i sleep in my 30 day contacts and some mornings i need a little moistener and works for that too. easy to carry in your purse for those moments when you are out and about. you will probably never use another product of this type again.</li>
            <li> Best drops for gas perm lenses</li>
            <li> This is the only lens cleaner that I can really use for comfort and clear vision. Unable to find in stores. Very happy I could order, have delivered to my home and receive in a short time.</li>
            <li> Recommended by my doctor.  Really works!</li>
            <li> I have used Clerz plus for many years with my extended wear contacts as it is the only eye drop that really helps keep down the protein deposits and makes my lenses comfortable</li>
