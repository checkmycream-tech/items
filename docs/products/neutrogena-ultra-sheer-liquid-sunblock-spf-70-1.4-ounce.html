            <li>Perfect for every day use!!</li>
            <li>Now, everyone from Chanel to Laura Mercier makes a liquid, but this one is the BEST.  </li>
            <li>Neutrogena has one of the best skin care science labs in the world, and the brand is known for making ground-breaking advancements in sun care year after year.  </li>
            <li>It works wonderfully under my Colorstay foundation</li>
            <li>Nonetheless, this is an excellent product for the price</li>
            <li>Excellent product!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very happy it is spf 70.  </li>

            <li>Might no be the best in the water.</li>
            <li>I like this best for a lot of reasons</li>
            <li>and Amazon has the best price I&#x27;ve seen.</li>
            <li>After 5 days of hiking around Death Valley National Park, I haven&#x27;t turned into a lobster yet so this sunblock lotion works perfectly.</li>
            <li>Best sunscreen I have found.</li>
            <li>Thank goodness because it goes on perfectly under my makeup.  </li>
            <li>Instead, it blends in perfectly, leaving no residue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The best part is that when I use this product the melasma on my forehead doesn&#x27;t appear.</li>
            <li>This is the best sun screen to use under makeup.</li>

            <li>The best product I ever used!</li>
            <li>perfect!</li>
            <li>It is a great product at a very good price.  </li>
            <li>I cherish beautiful skin.  </li>
            <li>The texture of the cream is a bit \\&quot;liquidy\\&quot; like foundation, and blends in beautifully.  </li>
            <li>This stuff is great though.</li>
            <li>This means if I run out or I&#x27;m out of town, I can have sunscreen for my face that looks and feels great.</li>
            <li>This one seems great and although on the pricier side, if it acts as a mattifier for my oily face, I am 100%</li>
            <li>This is a great sunscreen.</li>
            <li>This product is great for all of us.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m happy to say that since using this product the melasma has lightened to the point where it is barey noticeable.</li>
            <li>Great for your face.  </li>
            <li>But I kept upgrading my sunscreen based on Paula&#x27;s recommendations, and through the years, formulations have improved by great leaps and bounds.</li>
            <li>Compact, spill-proof and squish proof container that is great for travel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This Neutrogena product feels so nice on my skin, no reactions at all, and it smells wonderful, but it&#x27;s not a perfume</li>
            <li>This is a great product, have been using it for years.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;i love it!!</li>
            <li>He has fair , beautiful skin (think Cate Blanchett).</li>
            <li>Easy to apply on face, give me excellent protection.</li>
            <li>It applies very easily and doesn&#x27;t sweat off or run into my eyes!</li>
            <li>, I think this Neutrogena is a good one for its price.</li>
            <li>I have paid quadruple+ to try the luxury liquid sunblocks and they are not as good as this one.  </li>
            <li>I have really fair skin</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m extremely fair complected.</li>
            <li>wanted liquid sunscreen because I used to use shisedo sunscreen and loved the texture of the liquid</li>
            <li>Good protecrio</li>
            <li>It is a light lotion perfect for my face.</li>
            <li>me from burning in water and sun for a day at the water park which is a tall order for someone with fair skin.</li>
            <li>Almost anyone can relate to this issue unless you&#x27;re fair skinned.</li>
            <li>all good.</li>
            <li>I can use a lot of it (because you need to be generous for good UV protection) and it truly disappears into my skin.</li>
            <li>It is not greasy - your skin will feel as good as before you applied this sunscreen.</li>
            <li>This is a good sunscreen.</li>
            <li>Good before makeup</li>
            <li>Great stuff - works well and goes on easily!</li>
            <li>This isn&#x27;t only the best product Neutrogena sells, but the best sunscreen product on the market at any price point.</li>
            <li>make sure you shake item!  </li>
            <li>it is my favorite sunscreen for my face!</li>
            <li>PROTECT YOUR SKIN :)!</li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>We are all very fair redheads and burn extremely quickly.</li>
            <li>This stuff is great, goes on easy and has a shaker in the bottle just like a can of Guinness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Kept</li>
            <li>Neutrogena Dry-Touch is good, but this is better.</li>
            <li>Blocks the sun, but kind of cakes on my face and flakes off.  </li>
            <li>I am so thrilled to have found this.</li>
            <li>This is the absolute best sunblock.  </li>
            <li>nice texture.</li>
            <li>I really liked this product.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s just a nice milk lotion/sunscreen smell.</li>
            <li>Makeup goes over it nice</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re at the beach, I prefer using these too because it dries nice, almost to a powdery finish.</li>
            <li>Love, Love Love this sunscreen!!  </li>
            <li>My skin is very sensitive and this works great!</li>
            <li>and it gets irritated very easily.  </li>
            <li>My favorite sunscreen is Clarins, but it adds up quickly, and after trying SO MANY sunscreens I find these sunscreen &amp;#34;drops&amp;#34; are the perfect budget friendly option!</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s a really nice non greasy sunscreen, i like it and will buy more</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin and this stuff is awesome.</li>
            <li>day i was reading how most of the sunscreens in asia were the liquid kind</li>
            <li>so it spreads out easily and is NOT greasy!</li>
            <li>it really protects the skin and wears so beautifully under makeup.</li>
            <li>I have very fair skin and live in the desert southwest</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very light and works well under my makeup.  </li>
            <li>I use it over my moisturizer, since is liquid is easy to absorb and feels nice.</li>
            <li>With sensitive, very fair skin,  this exceeds any from the dermatologist.</li>
            <li>They work great under makeup without changing formula and texture, and I have mixed it into pure pigments and used it as a custom foundation it works great!</li>
            <li>I tried so many of them.</li>
            <li>For my face, I found the best one - Shiseido Urban Environment Oil-Free UV Protector SPF 42.  </li>
            <li>My face doesn&#x27;t look oily and it&#x27;s matte most of the day.</li>
            <li>LOVE LOVE LOVE.  </li>
            <li>I love love love this product.</li>
            <li>I also love it that it doesn&#x27;t have this sticky texture and any funky smell.</li>
            <li>My favorite sunscreen.  </li>
            <li>It is more liquid than cream</li>
            <li>This is a lot better than the Neutrogena Age Shield face sunblock because it is in liquid form so after application, as if you didn&#x27;t put anything on</li>
            <li>I am truly a skincare junkie and only use the best.  </li>
            <li>That is, until Neutrogena outdoes itself and comes out with the next best thing.</li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t have been more pleased.</li>
            <li>In any case, I think that the Neutrogina SPF 70 sport is more reliable.</li>
            <li>LOVE IT.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this sunscreen.</li>
            <li>so an effective sunblock is my most important skin product.</li>
            <li>I use the 70 SPF and then apply a 30 SPF foundation sparingly on top of it.</li>
            <li>I love most</li>
            <li>i&#x27;d gone through many tubes of these</li>
            <li>so I stocked up. :)</li>
            <li>I love this</li>
            <li>but I wish it were more waterproof.</li>
            <li>But for daily use this is wonderful.</li>
            <li>Love this stuff.</li>
            <li>its an okay product.</li>
            <li>Will try to look for a better product that would suit my skin more</li>
            <li>Ok product, I use it at the beach or when working out.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s light &amp; absorbs well!</li>
            <li>Light but effective.</li>
            <li>My favorite sunscreen.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so happy I found a high SPF sunblock that doesn&#x27;t make me break out or irritates my skin!</li>
            <li>Love this stuff.</li>
            <li>love love love it.&lt;br /&gt;got</li>
            <li>may be the liquidy consistency, but whatever magic is in this bottle</li>
            <li>I am convinced that this product has single-handedly kept 10 years of aging off my face--maybe more.</li>
            <li>The best facial sunscreen on the market, period.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried many brands and types but none gave me the comfort I seek until I gave this one a try.</li>
            <li>Based on my experiences, I bought couple more already.</li>
            <li>Even more, no outbreaks in my acne-prone</li>
            <li>I love it because I have some spots where I like to apply concealer and it will stay put on my face with this sunscreen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Most sunscreen product for the face leave my face looking greasy.</li>
            <li>I just make sure to wash my skin immediately when I come home.  </li>
            <li>I absolutely love it.</li>
            <li>It is light and effective at protecting you from the sun..</li>
            <li>I must say of all the facial sunscreens, this is the best one I have ever used!  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s fantastic!</li>
            <li>My skin is more even</li>
            <li>I know that sunblocks are very unique for each person.</li>
            <li>Works great &amp; after reading some of the reviews for more pricey high SPF products</li>
            <li>and I LOVE how easy this product is to apply to your skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I like the lack of smell since many products have a strong fragrance.  </li>
            <li>I burn easily, so when I put my favorite body lotion on, I add 6-7 drops of Neutrogena.</li>
            <li>I used this sunscreen for many years and love the light texture and packaging.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve spent many years searching for the perfect sunscreen that I can&#x27;t feel, but that still works well.</li>
            <li>) Works great under makeup - you can apply this sunscreen and it is not heavy, chalky or greasy so makeup will stay put on your face!</li>
            <li>what i like about this product most is the smooth application.</li>
            <li>A nice lightweight liquid that dries quickly and feels smooth rather than greasy or chalky.</li>
            <li>so it&#x27;s easy to apply to my face.</li>
            <li>and I can easily get sunburn in 20-40 minutes.</li>
            <li>Easy application, no greasiness, clothing not stained.  </li>
            <li>It does not leave a greasy/oily residue and is easy to apply.</li>
            <li>This makes it really easy to rub into my face, as opposed to some of the thicker sunscreens where it feels like you have to spend minute after minute rubbing them</li>
            <li>so it&#x27;s easy to spread.</li>
            <li>I strongly dislike how they smell or feel on my skin.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>My exposed scalp and face haven&#x27;t shown any allergies or intolerances to the product and it seems to provide strong protection.  </li>
            <li>strong smell</li>
            <li>It does not affect any makeup that&#x27;s put on top of it (wait about one minute for full absorption, then have at it).</li>
            <li>Yes, it&#x27;s still easy to carry and goes on smooth</li>
            <li>It is light and not greasy therefore makes makeup application easy..</li>
            <li>This sunscreen applies smooth and easy, does not seem greasy and protects.</li>
            <li>Very light and absorbs, fast thank you Neutrogena for making a light weight coverage sunscreen!</li>
            <li>Really keeps the harmful rays away with its astounding SPF 70.</li>
            <li>the expense is justified</li>
            <li>no chalk look and goes on smooth and no smell.</li>
            <li>A fragrance free version would be perfection.</li>
            <li>Fantastic sunblock.</li>
            <li>if you shake, it goes on smooth and disappears.</li>
            <li>This is now my default sunscreen, and I am happy enough with it that I&#x27;ve stopped looking for alternatives.</li>
            <li>This stuff is fabulous.</li>
            <li>makeup goes on so smoothly.</li>
            <li>That suits my fair and sensitive skin</li>
            <li>I really hope this is here to stay because this is one of the best facial sunscreens I have ever used.</li>
            <li>I love that it soaks right into my face without any stickiness at all.</li>
            <li>No white residue and a very nice matte finish.</li>
            <li>This sunblock not only is very effective, but I like the way it applies.</li>
            <li>This means a lot to me, since I feel much more confident going out with my normal makeup in place.</li>
            <li>With light sensitive skin, I have been pleased with many of Neutrogena&#x27;s sunblocks.</li>
            <li>So, I find that it spreads better when I moisturize first.</li>
            <li>, Neutrogena will not be able to call this product a sunblock (overpromising), market it as SPF 70 (higher SPFs have diminishing returns, so FDA is limiting SPF claims to 50) or say that it is waterproof or sweatproof (again overpromising).  </li>
            <li>I have been using this sunscreen for years after a long search for the perfect high SPF sunscreen for my face that I could wear during the summer under makeup or without it.</li>
            <li>love this!  very thin, perfect for the face.</li>
            <li>It is a liquid, so it goes on easily and is quickly absorbed.  </li>
            <li>Amazon price is usually pretty good compared to CVS, Walgreens, Target and BB&amp;B near me.</li>
            <li>I have been looking for a good sunblock for daily protection.  </li>
            <li>While it is true that I may not have reapplied it that often</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve tried various SPF products through the years as I have fair skin that needs sun protection.</li>
            <li>On the days I plan on putting on full make-up</li>
            <li>Good product if you need a daily sunblock.</li>
            <li>I used this several times before shucking it.&lt;br /&gt;I am fair skinned and burned in 1/2 hour.</li>
            <li>I have oily, hyper-allergenic skin (I&#x27;m also the opposite of fair, on the tan side).</li>
            <li>it leaves no white cast, is very easy to spread and offers superior sun protection.</li>
            <li>Having a good strong sunscreen on everyday is so important.  </li>
            <li>Dries quickly.</li>
            <li>Blends extremely quickly and well.</li>
            <li>This is *the* best daily facial sunblock.</li>
            <li>SO, I feel like I have enough experience to say that the Neutrogena Ultra Sheer liquid sunblock is the best sunscreen on the market.</li>
            <li>Usually the sun is very bright with no clouds at all</li>
            <li>This is the very first Sunscreen that I can use on my face and it will not break out.  </li>
            <li>and I used this every day last winter in FL and was very pleased.  </li>
            <li>It actually soaks in pretty quickly and looks fairly matte once it does.</li>
            <li>I owe him a new one :)</li>
            <li>But now, my new favorite is the mineral liquid version...called Pure and Free</li>
            <li>I hope they make higher SPFs soon!</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s very high SPF but light.</li>
            <li>i do not wear foundation but use a light pressed powder and it really sets the sunscreen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Great for everyday wear</li>
            <li>Any dermatologist worth his salt will tell you that when it comes to sunblock, go for science over prestige.  </li>
            <li>The chemical block, like Neutrogena products, takes about 20 minutes to bind to the skin and become effective, so you must put it on 20 minutes prior to sun exposure.  </li>
            <li>I am an old man with a bald spot at the top of my head.</li>
            <li>easily absorbed.</li>
            <li>So far, I&#x27;m LOVE this.</li>
            <li>I wear sunblock everyday, so it was important to find one that was easy to apply, didn&#x27;t have a very strong scent, wouldn&#x27;t make my face break out, and would work well under makeup.</li>
            <li>i stopped looking for other options and trying on different sunscreens because it truly is the best out there for oily skin.</li>
            <li>As you can imagine, I have tried many, many kinds of sunscreens, including high end brands found only at Sephora and department stores.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It can look just a bit greasy right after application.</li>
            <li>right now, amazon is having a sale too</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t absorb in my skin right away as I hoped.</li>
            <li>It disappears right away.  </li>
            <li>That&#x27;s always the hardest part, right?</li>
            <li>and I was conerned that my newly bald cranium will burn easily without the protection of hair.  </li>
            <li>Yes, if you use foundation the white sheen is not noticeable, but if you don&#x27;t want to put foundation on and just dust your face with some pressing powder, this is the perfect defense against sun damage and not look like you dipped your face in sour cream.</li>
            <li>I love the sunblock and the small size and nice look of the container.  </li>
            <li>sure i would rather use something without parabens, more natural and vegan,  has physical sunblocks, etc.</li>
            <li>Oh, I have spent so much money on finding the perfect facial sunscreen.  </li>
            <li>This sunblock is wonderful, goes on with a little white film and soaks right in.  </li>
            <li>I am delighted to boast that I have been diligent (slightly crazed) about skincare since my mid-20&#x27;s and now look it.  </li>
            <li>Overall, this is the perfect year round sunscreen for your face.</li>
            <li>I really like this sunscreen because it dries quickly and invisibly on my skin.</li>
            <li>also usually do not use cheap skincare products for face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>So I only wear it for &#x27;special occasions&#x27; or when I want to wear a decent amount of makeup on top.</li>
            <li>Everything else that I tried either melted off my face, made me break out, had a really strong smell, made my skin super oily, or all of the above.</li>
            <li>I was using Mentholatum&#x27;s SunPlay SPF 80 PA++ before I tried Neutrogena&#x27;s Ultra Sheer, and this liquid sunblock is so much better to apply under foundation/concealer than having a can sprayed on your face.</li>
            <li>I typically love neutrogena products - especially their sunscreen.  </li>
            <li>and I stay pretty matte</li>
            <li>Today was the first day trying it</li>
            <li>not a big deal at all :)</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had sunscreen make my skin oily and even cause acne cysts before, but this was the first to put a rash on my face.</li>
            <li>The only store that stocks it that I know of is Target but the price is better on Amazon.</li>
            <li>I still got pretty burnt</li>
            <li>I came across this, from the description, it seemed like a decent product that is close to what I was looking for - a sunscreen that is super</li>
            <li>I apply the product on top of some basic moisturizer and does not seem to interfere.  </li>
            <li>I love it for the following reasons:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>i put this on first after washing my face, so that it can chemically bind to the surface of my skin.</li>
            <li>I purchased this to try another higher SPF since I use the [[ASIN:B004D2C5FY</li>
            <li>But for a second I did wonder if I got the authentic product....</li>
            <li>I use sunscreen everyday and am always on the lookout for a good one for my face.  </li>
            <li>Has a strong rose scent that I find hard to tolerate.</li>
            <li>I live in a very warm and sunny climate where often there are no clouds in the sky and little shade.</li>
            <li>If you use too much it can make your face look greasier, but after some practice you can find the right</li>
            <li>Neutrogena Ultra Sheer Liquid is a miracle product for me because it goes on so easy, absorbs super fast and doesn&#x27;t feel or look greasy.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very fair skinned and have been using sun screen basically everyday since I was a teen.</li>
            <li>- so many ultra light facial sunscreens are only SPF 15</li>
            <li>This lives up to its name:  super, super lightweight and sheer.</li>
            <li>I use sunscreens religiously and therefore have used many brands over the years, from drugstore types to high end department stores.</li>
            <li>I  rely on this Neutrogena liquid sunblock for my face and neck because it goes on easily and never leaves a white residue.</li>
            <li>i mix this with my moisturizer every day - its sheer and does not have a strong sunscreen smell.</li>
            <li>This is the best sunscreen I&#x27;ve found, and, like other reviewers, I have tried a lot - other Neutrogena products, department store brands, Eltamd UV Clear SPF 46, organic sunscreens, etc, etc, etc.  </li>
            <li>It soaks in super fast and makes my skin feel really soft.</li>
            <li>This product was unfortunately not for me - glad to see it works well for other people.</li>
            <li>It works fine for him--no white residue.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve learned to like the thickness of it--it might mean better quality/protection, and it doesn&#x27;t run as easily.  </li>
            <li>I would definitely shift back to neutrogena if they release any good natural sunscreen products !</li>
            <li>Moreover, it protects your skin from both UVA and UVB rays which are responsible for aging and burning of the skin.  </li>
            <li>Fabulous for facial protection!  </li>
            <li>No one needs to know that I&#x27;m wearing sunscreen and with this stuff you really can&#x27;t tell.</li>
            <li>It goes on well under make-up and seems to really help protect me from the sun</li>
            <li>you can&#x27;t really feel it on the face.</li>
            <li>My skin just didn&#x27;t like it much</li>
            <li>Goes On smoothly, does invisibly with no white residue or sticky texture.</li>
            <li>I tried out the Neutrogena Ultra-Sheer and really like this sunscreen.  </li>
            <li>I like this product and is easily available through Amazon or your local drugstores.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s moisturizing, but protective (SPF 70!!) and very absorbent.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this sunblock!</li>
            <li>This is the only sunscreen I&#x27;ve ever felt comfortable wearing on my face.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t used this much yet as I&#x27;m saving it for vacation time in the sun.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve become a bit of a sunblock connoisseur after so much time hiking in the desert.</li>
            <li>and I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li>My dermatologist recommended the physical blocks, like zinc oxide, because they are effective immediately and last longer on the skin.</li>
            <li>The Eltamd UV Clear SPF 46 was working well for awhile, but it seemed a wee bit thicker, and there was just a hint more of the \\&quot;white</li>
            <li>So definitely give this product a try if you&#x27;re looking for a good sunblock, but be careful how close you get it to your eyes!</li>
            <li>so I will have to update and see if this is not only a long lasting sunblock or also a great mattifier to control oil too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>A little goes a long way and it works great.  </li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t give that &amp;#34;ghostlike&amp;#34; appearance like most other sunscreens.</li>
            <li>I really, really dislike the white cast many sunscreens leave on your face and this does not leave a white film at all.</li>
            <li>If you live in a sunny state I would recommend this product!</li>
            <li>A sunscreen formulated for the face shouldn&#x27;t run into the eyes so easily with even minimal sweating.</li>
            <li>This feels dry and comfortable as soon as you spread it on your face.</li>
            <li>use this mainly on my arms and neck.  </li>
            <li>that is just as cosmetically elegant as the Japanese and European sunscreens that I have to order online.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m definitely going to keep ordering this since I have never been able to find it in any of my local stores.</li>
            <li>This sunscreen does better than the more expensive brands that I have tried.</li>
            <li>really surprised that this isn&#x27;t sold more widely in retail stores.</li>
            <li>so now I am on high alert when it comes to my sun exposure.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>high protection.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve worn this all day at high altitudes with no reapplication and have not been burned at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>(physical block sheer liquids are easily 3-4x as much money).</li>
            <li>Okay you may call me paranoid but SPF 70 can make me feel a little safer from the sun now.</li>
            <li>If you need a sunscreen to protect your skin but don&#x27;t want something greasy and heavy because you love to wear makeup</li>
            <li>nice lotion, not to thick</li>
            <li>I live at 7,000 feet in the high desert</li>
            <li>I see and tried another sunscreen that has physical sunblocks and leaves no white cast and is as easy to apply, this one is it.</li>
            <li>Maybe my dermatologist was right after all, but I couldn&#x27;t have done it without Neutrogena Ultra sheer!</li>
            <li>I have tried other Neutrogena non-liquid sunblocks, and while I am sure they are effective, they leave white, at times gummy, blotches on my face--even if I don&#x27;t use any other facial product.</li>
            <li>This is my new go-to sunblock for my face under my makeup.  </li>
            <li>I live in Arizona</li>
            <li>the new FDA rules that are coming into effect</li>
            <li>I live in one of the sunniest places in the U.S., and I have melasma.  </li>
            <li>I have vitiligo and live in sunny Florida, so using sunscreen is a must for me.  </li>
            <li>Others are still too greasy, slippery under make-up, or just plain more pricey without being better, so save yourself the trouble -- I did the leg work for you!  </li>
            <li>Even though before this product I would use oil free sunblock and face lotion before applying my makeup, I still got very oily in a few hours.  </li>
            <li>This is the only product that does not turn ghostly white and feels light.  </li>
            <li>and if you put it on dry skin your skin will quickly absorb it unless you have skin that&#x27;s moisturized.  </li>
            <li>It is comfortable enough for me to use it repeatedly and extensively.</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li>I have rosacea and very sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li>I have a very sensitive skin and need protection throughout the day against the sun.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s water and sweat-proof so it will actually remain on your face even if it&#x27;s hot.</li>
            <li>Wow!  </li>
            <li>the product is an old stock and expires on August 2015!</li>
            <li>Even though it&#x27;s just 1.4 oz, it lasts a long time and is well worth the cost.</li>
            <li>: it is affordable, it leaves no white \\&quot;mask\\&quot;, it is 70 SPF, it does not irritate my sensitive skin, and it is light enough that I don&#x27;t notice I&#x27;m wearing it</li>
            <li>and she had such pretty skin.</li>
            <li>so it goes on easy and doesn&#x27;t feel heavy on the face.</li>
            <li>Dries practically matte and has a faint, pleasant scent.</li>
            <li>When I shop for a broad spectrum high level sunscreen...</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m careful about the products I use on my face because I am mildly allergic to the sun and have sensitive as well as acne-prone skin.  </li>
            <li>A little bit squeezed onto an index finger goes directly to the spot; its texture is fine.</li>
            <li>That being said, finding a sunscreen that works isn&#x27;t all that hard, but finding a sunscreen that you can wear under makeup without compromises is a HUGE deal!</li>
            <li>i had others that would pill into little white balls if i tried to apply foundation on top.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s hard to find in most stores.</li>
            <li>Clear.</li>
            <li>It isn&#x27;t greasy and it dries clear.  </li>
            <li>Neutrogena Clear Face Sunblock Lotion, SPF 30, 3 Ounce]]</li>
            <li>Not heavy or oily.</li>
            <li>Rubs in well and offers</li>
            <li>containers and don&#x27;t require much product for solid protection.</li>
            <li>use this occasionally and it is very convenient.</li>
            <li>The sunblock is so light that once it&#x27;s dried</li>
            <li>and I was so surprised</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried them all, but my biggest problem was the product not soaking into my skin fast enough before I put on my makeup or it getting into my eyes if I wiped my face.</li>
            <li>Got some of this near my eye area (like 1&amp;#34; under my eye) and didn&#x27;t have time to wash it off before work.</li>
            <li>If not just for cancer protection but to keep you young looking.  </li>
            <li>pleasantly surprised -</li>
            <li>but it definitely feels very close to having no sunscreen on.</li>
            <li>My sensitive skin loves this - it doesn&#x27;t break me out and it doesn&#x27;t make my skin itch.  </li>
            <li>I have sensitive, combination skin that is prone to outbreaks.</li>
            <li>Melasma worsens when unprotected skin is exposed to direct sunlight.</li>
            <li>But I would recommend natural sunscreens/sunblocks.</li>
            <li>Near odorless.</li>
            <li>It really is ultra sheer - it comes out in a runny liquid form.</li>
            <li>It rubs in completely -</li>
            <li>/&gt;Realize that I have Lupus, and extremely sensitive skin, as in I get rashes by anything.</li>
            <li>If you wear it swimming it will run and if it gets near your mouth ...</li>
            <li>It really does go on sheer under makeup.  </li>
            <li>Completely disappears immediately.</li>
            <li>Perfect for adding up make up base and foundation.</li>
            <li>Cant really get used to wearing this under make up - its still pretty heavy and smells like sunscreen.</li>
            <li>other sunscreens make my face extremely greasy and make any makeup i put on top disappear in one or two hours.</li>
            <li>I kind of hate this one too, but at least it&#x27;s cheap and better than a lot of them in terms of not making your face oily.</li>
            <li>It is a high SPF, non greasy, ultra sheer, and you can wear makeup over it if you so choose.</li>
            <li>Most facial sunscreens I used have stayed a little white.  </li>
            <li>It has gotten hard to find at some of my local stores, but I am always able to find it on Amazon.</li>
            <li>I started using liquid sunblock with the Walgreens version, which on the outside looked exactly like this Neutrogena version (just different logos and now discontinued), so I can only compare this Neutrogena liquid sunblock with the Walgreens liquid sunblock.  </li>
            <li>would really recommend the other Clear Face product instead</li>
            <li>(and I&#x27;m about to be forty), so I needed something powerful enough to minimize the sun damage and moisturizing enough to handle really dry air.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried just using straight sunscreen, the same kind that goes on my body, but it ends up stinging my eyes like crazy as the day goes on.  </li>
            <li>Now to be clear this product does not lighten the skin, but it protected my skin from further sun damage and gave it time to heal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Sure, it&#x27;s full of possibly toxic chemicals, but I figure the possible long-term risks are balanced out by cutting my risk of skin cancer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This product is truly greaseless on the skin and absorbs completely when applied as the last step in skincare.  </li>
            <li>I have developed some red blotch sun damage (that may eventually turn pre-cancerous).</li>
            <li>I  purchased this product a short while ago, and so far I like it.</li>
            <li>Currently, I&#x27;m going to try devita natural sunscreen.</li>
            <li>This is gentle enough, sheer enough, &amp; SPF 70.  </li>
            <li>While it is a little more expensive than most facial sunscreens (which is why I purchase from Amazon), a little goes a long way and the advantages are definitely worth the cost.&lt;br</li>
            <li>This is a real plus as I must wear sunblock lotion due to health</li>
            <li>and I live in Southern California so daily sunscreen is crucial to my survival.</li>
            <li>I have been through so many different sunscreens - half drugstore brands, half natural / organic brands, and a few high end brands.</li>
            <li>We live at high altitude and wear it year round as we get burned in the winter from the sun reflecting off of snow.</li>
            <li>A little goes a long way, and the small size is nice for airport travel since it&#x27;s TSA compliant.  </li>
            <li>With intense sun for an all day, all week vacation, my skin was totally protected - absolutely no burning!</li>
            <li>I apply this sunscreen prior to applying my face primer, and by the time I&#x27;m applying foundation (usually Bare Minerals)</li>
            <li>This was one of her recommendations a few years ago, and that&#x27;s when I bought my first bottle.</li>
            <li>It provides a beautiful base for make-up application.  </li>
            <li>The only reason I didn&#x27;t give it five stars is that it doesn&#x27;t have any zinc oxide or other physical block sunblock in it, it is purely chemical block ingredients.</li>
            <li>It is not greasy and very light, almost too light that it leaves you looking very, very dry. :(</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve ben using other Neurogena products over the years and got this particular one after a YouTube review by a woman in her 50s who swore by it</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t make my face oily like other high SPF sun block.</li>
            <li>Feels dry, stays put, doesn&#x27;t irritate my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>As long as it offers same protection I will keep using it.  </li>
            <li>It is thin and easily applied.  </li>
            <li>do wish it was a little less greasy, but it is light.</li>
            <li>I have a kid with bad eczema and fair skin.</li>

    <ol>
            <li> Perfect for every day use!!</li>
            <li> Now, everyone from Chanel to Laura Mercier makes a liquid, but this one is the BEST.  </li>
            <li> Neutrogena has one of the best skin care science labs in the world, and the brand is known for making ground-breaking advancements in sun care year after year.  </li>
            <li> It works wonderfully under my Colorstay foundation</li>

            <li> I&#x27;m very happy it is spf 70.  </li>

            <li> Best sunscreen I have found.</li>
            <li> Thank goodness because it goes on perfectly under my makeup.  </li>

            <li> I cherish beautiful skin.  </li>
            <li> The texture of the cream is a bit \\&quot;liquidy\\&quot; like foundation, and blends in beautifully.  </li>
            <li> This stuff is great though.</li>
            <li> This means if I run out or I&#x27;m out of town, I can have sunscreen for my face that looks and feels great.</li>
            <li> This one seems great and although on the pricier side, if it acts as a mattifier for my oily face, I am 100%</li>
            <li> This is a great sunscreen.</li>
            <li> This product is great for all of us.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m happy to say that since using this product the melasma has lightened to the point where it is barey noticeable.</li>
            <li> Great for your face.  </li>
            <li> But I kept upgrading my sunscreen based on Paula&#x27;s recommendations, and through the years, formulations have improved by great leaps and bounds.</li>
            <li> Compact, spill-proof and squish proof container that is great for travel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This Neutrogena product feels so nice on my skin, no reactions at all, and it smells wonderful, but it&#x27;s not a perfume</li>
            <li> This is a great product, have been using it for years.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;i love it!!</li>

            <li> Easy to apply on face, give me excellent protection.</li>
            <li> It applies very easily and doesn&#x27;t sweat off or run into my eyes!</li>
            <li> , I think this Neutrogena is a good one for its price.</li>
            <li> I have paid quadruple+ to try the luxury liquid sunblocks and they are not as good as this one.  </li>
            <li> I have really fair skin</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m extremely fair complected.</li>
            <li> wanted liquid sunscreen because I used to use shisedo sunscreen and loved the texture of the liquid</li>
            <li> Good protecrio</li>
            <li> It is a light lotion perfect for my face.</li>
            <li> me from burning in water and sun for a day at the water park which is a tall order for someone with fair skin.</li>
            <li> Almost anyone can relate to this issue unless you&#x27;re fair skinned.</li>
            <li> all good.</li>
            <li> I can use a lot of it (because you need to be generous for good UV protection) and it truly disappears into my skin.</li>
            <li> It is not greasy - your skin will feel as good as before you applied this sunscreen.</li>
            <li> This is a good sunscreen.</li>
            <li> Good before makeup</li>
            <li> Great stuff - works well and goes on easily!</li>
            <li> This isn&#x27;t only the best product Neutrogena sells, but the best sunscreen product on the market at any price point.</li>
            <li> make sure you shake item!  </li>
            <li> it is my favorite sunscreen for my face!</li>
            <li> PROTECT YOUR SKIN :)!</li>
            <li> Love it!</li>
            <li> We are all very fair redheads and burn extremely quickly.</li>
            <li> This stuff is great, goes on easy and has a shaker in the bottle just like a can of Guinness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Kept</li>
            <li> Neutrogena Dry-Touch is good, but this is better.</li>
            <li> Blocks the sun, but kind of cakes on my face and flakes off.  </li>
            <li> I am so thrilled to have found this.</li>
            <li> This is the absolute best sunblock.  </li>
            <li> nice texture.</li>
            <li> I really liked this product.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s just a nice milk lotion/sunscreen smell.</li>
            <li> Makeup goes over it nice</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re at the beach, I prefer using these too because it dries nice, almost to a powdery finish.</li>
            <li> Love, Love Love this sunscreen!!  </li>
            <li> My skin is very sensitive and this works great!</li>
            <li> and it gets irritated very easily.  </li>
            <li> My favorite sunscreen is Clarins, but it adds up quickly, and after trying SO MANY sunscreens I find these sunscreen &amp;#34;drops&amp;#34; are the perfect budget friendly option!</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s a really nice non greasy sunscreen, i like it and will buy more</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and this stuff is awesome.</li>
            <li> day i was reading how most of the sunscreens in asia were the liquid kind</li>
            <li> so it spreads out easily and is NOT greasy!</li>
            <li> it really protects the skin and wears so beautifully under makeup.</li>
            <li> I have very fair skin and live in the desert southwest</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very light and works well under my makeup.  </li>
            <li> I use it over my moisturizer, since is liquid is easy to absorb and feels nice.</li>
            <li> With sensitive, very fair skin,  this exceeds any from the dermatologist.</li>
            <li> They work great under makeup without changing formula and texture, and I have mixed it into pure pigments and used it as a custom foundation it works great!</li>
            <li> I tried so many of them.</li>
            <li> For my face, I found the best one - Shiseido Urban Environment Oil-Free UV Protector SPF 42.  </li>
            <li> My face doesn&#x27;t look oily and it&#x27;s matte most of the day.</li>
            <li> LOVE LOVE LOVE.  </li>
            <li> I love love love this product.</li>
            <li> I also love it that it doesn&#x27;t have this sticky texture and any funky smell.</li>
            <li> My favorite sunscreen.  </li>
            <li> It is more liquid than cream</li>
            <li> This is a lot better than the Neutrogena Age Shield face sunblock because it is in liquid form so after application, as if you didn&#x27;t put anything on</li>
            <li> I am truly a skincare junkie and only use the best.  </li>
            <li> That is, until Neutrogena outdoes itself and comes out with the next best thing.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t have been more pleased.</li>
            <li> In any case, I think that the Neutrogina SPF 70 sport is more reliable.</li>
            <li> LOVE IT.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this sunscreen.</li>
            <li> so an effective sunblock is my most important skin product.</li>
            <li> I use the 70 SPF and then apply a 30 SPF foundation sparingly on top of it.</li>
            <li> I love most</li>
            <li> i&#x27;d gone through many tubes of these</li>
            <li> so I stocked up. :)</li>
            <li> I love this</li>
            <li> but I wish it were more waterproof.</li>
            <li> But for daily use this is wonderful.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff.</li>
            <li> its an okay product.</li>
            <li> Will try to look for a better product that would suit my skin more</li>
            <li> Ok product, I use it at the beach or when working out.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s light &amp; absorbs well!</li>
            <li> Light but effective.</li>
            <li> My favorite sunscreen.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so happy I found a high SPF sunblock that doesn&#x27;t make me break out or irritates my skin!</li>
            <li> Love this stuff.</li>
            <li> love love love it.&lt;br /&gt;got</li>
            <li> may be the liquidy consistency, but whatever magic is in this bottle</li>
            <li> I am convinced that this product has single-handedly kept 10 years of aging off my face--maybe more.</li>
            <li> The best facial sunscreen on the market, period.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried many brands and types but none gave me the comfort I seek until I gave this one a try.</li>
            <li> Based on my experiences, I bought couple more already.</li>
            <li> Even more, no outbreaks in my acne-prone</li>
            <li> I love it because I have some spots where I like to apply concealer and it will stay put on my face with this sunscreen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Most sunscreen product for the face leave my face looking greasy.</li>
            <li> I just make sure to wash my skin immediately when I come home.  </li>
            <li> I absolutely love it.</li>
            <li> It is light and effective at protecting you from the sun..</li>
            <li> I must say of all the facial sunscreens, this is the best one I have ever used!  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s fantastic!</li>
            <li> My skin is more even</li>
            <li> I know that sunblocks are very unique for each person.</li>
            <li> Works great &amp; after reading some of the reviews for more pricey high SPF products</li>
            <li> and I LOVE how easy this product is to apply to your skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I like the lack of smell since many products have a strong fragrance.  </li>
            <li> I burn easily, so when I put my favorite body lotion on, I add 6-7 drops of Neutrogena.</li>
            <li> I used this sunscreen for many years and love the light texture and packaging.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve spent many years searching for the perfect sunscreen that I can&#x27;t feel, but that still works well.</li>
            <li> ) Works great under makeup - you can apply this sunscreen and it is not heavy, chalky or greasy so makeup will stay put on your face!</li>
            <li> what i like about this product most is the smooth application.</li>
            <li> A nice lightweight liquid that dries quickly and feels smooth rather than greasy or chalky.</li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s easy to apply to my face.</li>
            <li> and I can easily get sunburn in 20-40 minutes.</li>
            <li> Easy application, no greasiness, clothing not stained.  </li>
            <li> It does not leave a greasy/oily residue and is easy to apply.</li>
            <li> This makes it really easy to rub into my face, as opposed to some of the thicker sunscreens where it feels like you have to spend minute after minute rubbing them</li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s easy to spread.</li>
            <li> I strongly dislike how they smell or feel on my skin.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> My exposed scalp and face haven&#x27;t shown any allergies or intolerances to the product and it seems to provide strong protection.  </li>
            <li> strong smell</li>
            <li> It does not affect any makeup that&#x27;s put on top of it (wait about one minute for full absorption, then have at it).</li>
            <li> Yes, it&#x27;s still easy to carry and goes on smooth</li>
            <li> It is light and not greasy therefore makes makeup application easy..</li>
            <li> This sunscreen applies smooth and easy, does not seem greasy and protects.</li>
            <li> Very light and absorbs, fast thank you Neutrogena for making a light weight coverage sunscreen!</li>
            <li> Really keeps the harmful rays away with its astounding SPF 70.</li>
            <li> the expense is justified</li>
            <li> no chalk look and goes on smooth and no smell.</li>
            <li> A fragrance free version would be perfection.</li>
            <li> Fantastic sunblock.</li>
            <li> if you shake, it goes on smooth and disappears.</li>
            <li> This is now my default sunscreen, and I am happy enough with it that I&#x27;ve stopped looking for alternatives.</li>
            <li> This stuff is fabulous.</li>
            <li> makeup goes on so smoothly.</li>
            <li> That suits my fair and sensitive skin</li>
            <li> I really hope this is here to stay because this is one of the best facial sunscreens I have ever used.</li>
            <li> I love that it soaks right into my face without any stickiness at all.</li>
            <li> No white residue and a very nice matte finish.</li>
            <li> This sunblock not only is very effective, but I like the way it applies.</li>
            <li> This means a lot to me, since I feel much more confident going out with my normal makeup in place.</li>
            <li> With light sensitive skin, I have been pleased with many of Neutrogena&#x27;s sunblocks.</li>
            <li> So, I find that it spreads better when I moisturize first.</li>
            <li> , Neutrogena will not be able to call this product a sunblock (overpromising), market it as SPF 70 (higher SPFs have diminishing returns, so FDA is limiting SPF claims to 50) or say that it is waterproof or sweatproof (again overpromising).  </li>
            <li> I have been using this sunscreen for years after a long search for the perfect high SPF sunscreen for my face that I could wear during the summer under makeup or without it.</li>
            <li> love this!  very thin, perfect for the face.</li>
            <li> It is a liquid, so it goes on easily and is quickly absorbed.  </li>
            <li> Amazon price is usually pretty good compared to CVS, Walgreens, Target and BB&amp;B near me.</li>
            <li> I have been looking for a good sunblock for daily protection.  </li>
            <li> While it is true that I may not have reapplied it that often</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve tried various SPF products through the years as I have fair skin that needs sun protection.</li>
            <li> On the days I plan on putting on full make-up</li>
            <li> Good product if you need a daily sunblock.</li>
            <li> I used this several times before shucking it.&lt;br /&gt;I am fair skinned and burned in 1/2 hour.</li>
            <li> I have oily, hyper-allergenic skin (I&#x27;m also the opposite of fair, on the tan side).</li>
            <li> it leaves no white cast, is very easy to spread and offers superior sun protection.</li>
            <li> Having a good strong sunscreen on everyday is so important.  </li>
            <li> Dries quickly.</li>
            <li> Blends extremely quickly and well.</li>
            <li> This is *the* best daily facial sunblock.</li>
            <li> SO, I feel like I have enough experience to say that the Neutrogena Ultra Sheer liquid sunblock is the best sunscreen on the market.</li>
            <li> Usually the sun is very bright with no clouds at all</li>
            <li> This is the very first Sunscreen that I can use on my face and it will not break out.  </li>
            <li> and I used this every day last winter in FL and was very pleased.  </li>
            <li> It actually soaks in pretty quickly and looks fairly matte once it does.</li>
            <li> I owe him a new one :)</li>
            <li> But now, my new favorite is the mineral liquid version...called Pure and Free</li>
            <li> I hope they make higher SPFs soon!</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s very high SPF but light.</li>
            <li> i do not wear foundation but use a light pressed powder and it really sets the sunscreen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Great for everyday wear</li>
            <li> Any dermatologist worth his salt will tell you that when it comes to sunblock, go for science over prestige.  </li>
            <li> The chemical block, like Neutrogena products, takes about 20 minutes to bind to the skin and become effective, so you must put it on 20 minutes prior to sun exposure.  </li>
            <li> I am an old man with a bald spot at the top of my head.</li>
            <li> easily absorbed.</li>
            <li> So far, I&#x27;m LOVE this.</li>
            <li> I wear sunblock everyday, so it was important to find one that was easy to apply, didn&#x27;t have a very strong scent, wouldn&#x27;t make my face break out, and would work well under makeup.</li>
            <li> i stopped looking for other options and trying on different sunscreens because it truly is the best out there for oily skin.</li>
            <li> As you can imagine, I have tried many, many kinds of sunscreens, including high end brands found only at Sephora and department stores.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It can look just a bit greasy right after application.</li>
            <li> right now, amazon is having a sale too</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t absorb in my skin right away as I hoped.</li>
            <li> It disappears right away.  </li>
            <li> That&#x27;s always the hardest part, right?</li>
            <li> and I was conerned that my newly bald cranium will burn easily without the protection of hair.  </li>
            <li> Yes, if you use foundation the white sheen is not noticeable, but if you don&#x27;t want to put foundation on and just dust your face with some pressing powder, this is the perfect defense against sun damage and not look like you dipped your face in sour cream.</li>
            <li> I love the sunblock and the small size and nice look of the container.  </li>
            <li> sure i would rather use something without parabens, more natural and vegan,  has physical sunblocks, etc.</li>
            <li> Oh, I have spent so much money on finding the perfect facial sunscreen.  </li>
            <li> This sunblock is wonderful, goes on with a little white film and soaks right in.  </li>
            <li> I am delighted to boast that I have been diligent (slightly crazed) about skincare since my mid-20&#x27;s and now look it.  </li>
            <li> Overall, this is the perfect year round sunscreen for your face.</li>
            <li> I really like this sunscreen because it dries quickly and invisibly on my skin.</li>
            <li> also usually do not use cheap skincare products for face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> So I only wear it for &#x27;special occasions&#x27; or when I want to wear a decent amount of makeup on top.</li>
            <li> Everything else that I tried either melted off my face, made me break out, had a really strong smell, made my skin super oily, or all of the above.</li>
            <li> I was using Mentholatum&#x27;s SunPlay SPF 80 PA++ before I tried Neutrogena&#x27;s Ultra Sheer, and this liquid sunblock is so much better to apply under foundation/concealer than having a can sprayed on your face.</li>
            <li> I typically love neutrogena products - especially their sunscreen.  </li>
            <li> and I stay pretty matte</li>
            <li> Today was the first day trying it</li>
            <li> not a big deal at all :)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had sunscreen make my skin oily and even cause acne cysts before, but this was the first to put a rash on my face.</li>
            <li> The only store that stocks it that I know of is Target but the price is better on Amazon.</li>
            <li> I still got pretty burnt</li>
            <li> I came across this, from the description, it seemed like a decent product that is close to what I was looking for - a sunscreen that is super</li>
            <li> I apply the product on top of some basic moisturizer and does not seem to interfere.  </li>
            <li> I love it for the following reasons:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> i put this on first after washing my face, so that it can chemically bind to the surface of my skin.</li>
            <li> I purchased this to try another higher SPF since I use the [[ASIN:B004D2C5FY</li>
            <li> But for a second I did wonder if I got the authentic product....</li>
            <li> I use sunscreen everyday and am always on the lookout for a good one for my face.  </li>
            <li> Has a strong rose scent that I find hard to tolerate.</li>
            <li> I live in a very warm and sunny climate where often there are no clouds in the sky and little shade.</li>
            <li> If you use too much it can make your face look greasier, but after some practice you can find the right</li>
            <li> Neutrogena Ultra Sheer Liquid is a miracle product for me because it goes on so easy, absorbs super fast and doesn&#x27;t feel or look greasy.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very fair skinned and have been using sun screen basically everyday since I was a teen.</li>
            <li> - so many ultra light facial sunscreens are only SPF 15</li>
            <li> This lives up to its name:  super, super lightweight and sheer.</li>
            <li> I use sunscreens religiously and therefore have used many brands over the years, from drugstore types to high end department stores.</li>
            <li> I  rely on this Neutrogena liquid sunblock for my face and neck because it goes on easily and never leaves a white residue.</li>
            <li> i mix this with my moisturizer every day - its sheer and does not have a strong sunscreen smell.</li>
            <li> This is the best sunscreen I&#x27;ve found, and, like other reviewers, I have tried a lot - other Neutrogena products, department store brands, Eltamd UV Clear SPF 46, organic sunscreens, etc, etc, etc.  </li>
            <li> It soaks in super fast and makes my skin feel really soft.</li>
            <li> This product was unfortunately not for me - glad to see it works well for other people.</li>
            <li> It works fine for him--no white residue.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve learned to like the thickness of it--it might mean better quality/protection, and it doesn&#x27;t run as easily.  </li>
            <li> I would definitely shift back to neutrogena if they release any good natural sunscreen products !</li>
            <li> Moreover, it protects your skin from both UVA and UVB rays which are responsible for aging and burning of the skin.  </li>
            <li> Fabulous for facial protection!  </li>
            <li> No one needs to know that I&#x27;m wearing sunscreen and with this stuff you really can&#x27;t tell.</li>
            <li> It goes on well under make-up and seems to really help protect me from the sun</li>
            <li> you can&#x27;t really feel it on the face.</li>
            <li> My skin just didn&#x27;t like it much</li>
            <li> Goes On smoothly, does invisibly with no white residue or sticky texture.</li>
            <li> I tried out the Neutrogena Ultra-Sheer and really like this sunscreen.  </li>
            <li> I like this product and is easily available through Amazon or your local drugstores.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s moisturizing, but protective (SPF 70!!) and very absorbent.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this sunblock!</li>
            <li> This is the only sunscreen I&#x27;ve ever felt comfortable wearing on my face.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used this much yet as I&#x27;m saving it for vacation time in the sun.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve become a bit of a sunblock connoisseur after so much time hiking in the desert.</li>
            <li> and I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> My dermatologist recommended the physical blocks, like zinc oxide, because they are effective immediately and last longer on the skin.</li>
            <li> The Eltamd UV Clear SPF 46 was working well for awhile, but it seemed a wee bit thicker, and there was just a hint more of the \\&quot;white</li>
            <li> So definitely give this product a try if you&#x27;re looking for a good sunblock, but be careful how close you get it to your eyes!</li>
            <li> so I will have to update and see if this is not only a long lasting sunblock or also a great mattifier to control oil too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way and it works great.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t give that &amp;#34;ghostlike&amp;#34; appearance like most other sunscreens.</li>
            <li> I really, really dislike the white cast many sunscreens leave on your face and this does not leave a white film at all.</li>
            <li> If you live in a sunny state I would recommend this product!</li>
            <li> A sunscreen formulated for the face shouldn&#x27;t run into the eyes so easily with even minimal sweating.</li>
            <li> This feels dry and comfortable as soon as you spread it on your face.</li>
            <li> use this mainly on my arms and neck.  </li>
            <li> that is just as cosmetically elegant as the Japanese and European sunscreens that I have to order online.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m definitely going to keep ordering this since I have never been able to find it in any of my local stores.</li>
            <li> This sunscreen does better than the more expensive brands that I have tried.</li>
            <li> really surprised that this isn&#x27;t sold more widely in retail stores.</li>
            <li> so now I am on high alert when it comes to my sun exposure.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> high protection.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve worn this all day at high altitudes with no reapplication and have not been burned at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> (physical block sheer liquids are easily 3-4x as much money).</li>
            <li> Okay you may call me paranoid but SPF 70 can make me feel a little safer from the sun now.</li>
            <li> If you need a sunscreen to protect your skin but don&#x27;t want something greasy and heavy because you love to wear makeup</li>
            <li> nice lotion, not to thick</li>
            <li> I live at 7,000 feet in the high desert</li>
            <li> I see and tried another sunscreen that has physical sunblocks and leaves no white cast and is as easy to apply, this one is it.</li>
            <li> Maybe my dermatologist was right after all, but I couldn&#x27;t have done it without Neutrogena Ultra sheer!</li>
            <li> I have tried other Neutrogena non-liquid sunblocks, and while I am sure they are effective, they leave white, at times gummy, blotches on my face--even if I don&#x27;t use any other facial product.</li>
            <li> This is my new go-to sunblock for my face under my makeup.  </li>
            <li> I live in Arizona</li>
            <li> the new FDA rules that are coming into effect</li>
            <li> I live in one of the sunniest places in the U.S., and I have melasma.  </li>
            <li> I have vitiligo and live in sunny Florida, so using sunscreen is a must for me.  </li>
            <li> Others are still too greasy, slippery under make-up, or just plain more pricey without being better, so save yourself the trouble -- I did the leg work for you!  </li>
            <li> Even though before this product I would use oil free sunblock and face lotion before applying my makeup, I still got very oily in a few hours.  </li>
            <li> This is the only product that does not turn ghostly white and feels light.  </li>
            <li> and if you put it on dry skin your skin will quickly absorb it unless you have skin that&#x27;s moisturized.  </li>
            <li> It is comfortable enough for me to use it repeatedly and extensively.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li> I have rosacea and very sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li> I have a very sensitive skin and need protection throughout the day against the sun.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s water and sweat-proof so it will actually remain on your face even if it&#x27;s hot.</li>
            <li> Wow!  </li>
            <li> the product is an old stock and expires on August 2015!</li>
            <li> Even though it&#x27;s just 1.4 oz, it lasts a long time and is well worth the cost.</li>
            <li> : it is affordable, it leaves no white \\&quot;mask\\&quot;, it is 70 SPF, it does not irritate my sensitive skin, and it is light enough that I don&#x27;t notice I&#x27;m wearing it</li>
            <li> and she had such pretty skin.</li>
            <li> so it goes on easy and doesn&#x27;t feel heavy on the face.</li>
            <li> Dries practically matte and has a faint, pleasant scent.</li>
            <li> When I shop for a broad spectrum high level sunscreen...</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m careful about the products I use on my face because I am mildly allergic to the sun and have sensitive as well as acne-prone skin.  </li>
            <li> A little bit squeezed onto an index finger goes directly to the spot; its texture is fine.</li>
            <li> That being said, finding a sunscreen that works isn&#x27;t all that hard, but finding a sunscreen that you can wear under makeup without compromises is a HUGE deal!</li>
            <li> i had others that would pill into little white balls if i tried to apply foundation on top.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to find in most stores.</li>
            <li> Clear.</li>
            <li> It isn&#x27;t greasy and it dries clear.  </li>
            <li> Neutrogena Clear Face Sunblock Lotion, SPF 30, 3 Ounce]]</li>
            <li> Not heavy or oily.</li>
            <li> Rubs in well and offers</li>
            <li> containers and don&#x27;t require much product for solid protection.</li>
            <li> use this occasionally and it is very convenient.</li>
            <li> The sunblock is so light that once it&#x27;s dried</li>
            <li> and I was so surprised</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried them all, but my biggest problem was the product not soaking into my skin fast enough before I put on my makeup or it getting into my eyes if I wiped my face.</li>
            <li> Got some of this near my eye area (like 1&amp;#34; under my eye) and didn&#x27;t have time to wash it off before work.</li>
            <li> If not just for cancer protection but to keep you young looking.  </li>
            <li> pleasantly surprised -</li>
            <li> but it definitely feels very close to having no sunscreen on.</li>
            <li> My sensitive skin loves this - it doesn&#x27;t break me out and it doesn&#x27;t make my skin itch.  </li>
            <li> I have sensitive, combination skin that is prone to outbreaks.</li>
            <li> Melasma worsens when unprotected skin is exposed to direct sunlight.</li>
            <li> But I would recommend natural sunscreens/sunblocks.</li>
            <li> Near odorless.</li>
            <li> It really is ultra sheer - it comes out in a runny liquid form.</li>
            <li> It rubs in completely -</li>
            <li> /&gt;Realize that I have Lupus, and extremely sensitive skin, as in I get rashes by anything.</li>
            <li> If you wear it swimming it will run and if it gets near your mouth ...</li>
            <li> It really does go on sheer under makeup.  </li>
            <li> Completely disappears immediately.</li>
            <li> Perfect for adding up make up base and foundation.</li>
            <li> Cant really get used to wearing this under make up - its still pretty heavy and smells like sunscreen.</li>
            <li> other sunscreens make my face extremely greasy and make any makeup i put on top disappear in one or two hours.</li>
            <li> I kind of hate this one too, but at least it&#x27;s cheap and better than a lot of them in terms of not making your face oily.</li>
            <li> It is a high SPF, non greasy, ultra sheer, and you can wear makeup over it if you so choose.</li>
            <li> Most facial sunscreens I used have stayed a little white.  </li>
            <li> It has gotten hard to find at some of my local stores, but I am always able to find it on Amazon.</li>
            <li> I started using liquid sunblock with the Walgreens version, which on the outside looked exactly like this Neutrogena version (just different logos and now discontinued), so I can only compare this Neutrogena liquid sunblock with the Walgreens liquid sunblock.  </li>
            <li> would really recommend the other Clear Face product instead</li>
            <li> (and I&#x27;m about to be forty), so I needed something powerful enough to minimize the sun damage and moisturizing enough to handle really dry air.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried just using straight sunscreen, the same kind that goes on my body, but it ends up stinging my eyes like crazy as the day goes on.  </li>
            <li> Now to be clear this product does not lighten the skin, but it protected my skin from further sun damage and gave it time to heal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Sure, it&#x27;s full of possibly toxic chemicals, but I figure the possible long-term risks are balanced out by cutting my risk of skin cancer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This product is truly greaseless on the skin and absorbs completely when applied as the last step in skincare.  </li>
            <li> I have developed some red blotch sun damage (that may eventually turn pre-cancerous).</li>
            <li> I  purchased this product a short while ago, and so far I like it.</li>
            <li> Currently, I&#x27;m going to try devita natural sunscreen.</li>
            <li> This is gentle enough, sheer enough, &amp; SPF 70.  </li>
            <li> While it is a little more expensive than most facial sunscreens (which is why I purchase from Amazon), a little goes a long way and the advantages are definitely worth the cost.&lt;br</li>
            <li> This is a real plus as I must wear sunblock lotion due to health</li>
            <li> and I live in Southern California so daily sunscreen is crucial to my survival.</li>
            <li> I have been through so many different sunscreens - half drugstore brands, half natural / organic brands, and a few high end brands.</li>
            <li> We live at high altitude and wear it year round as we get burned in the winter from the sun reflecting off of snow.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way, and the small size is nice for airport travel since it&#x27;s TSA compliant.  </li>
            <li> With intense sun for an all day, all week vacation, my skin was totally protected - absolutely no burning!</li>
            <li> I apply this sunscreen prior to applying my face primer, and by the time I&#x27;m applying foundation (usually Bare Minerals)</li>
            <li> This was one of her recommendations a few years ago, and that&#x27;s when I bought my first bottle.</li>
            <li> It provides a beautiful base for make-up application.  </li>
            <li> The only reason I didn&#x27;t give it five stars is that it doesn&#x27;t have any zinc oxide or other physical block sunblock in it, it is purely chemical block ingredients.</li>
            <li> It is not greasy and very light, almost too light that it leaves you looking very, very dry. :(</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve ben using other Neurogena products over the years and got this particular one after a YouTube review by a woman in her 50s who swore by it</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t make my face oily like other high SPF sun block.</li>
            <li> Feels dry, stays put, doesn&#x27;t irritate my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> As long as it offers same protection I will keep using it.  </li>
            <li> It is thin and easily applied.  </li>
            <li> do wish it was a little less greasy, but it is light.</li>
            <li> I have a kid with bad eczema and fair skin.</li>
            <li> Strange smell, not bad smell but not nice either.</li>
            <li> It is VERY thin and watery, so don&#x27;t be surprised by that, but it works because you smooth it on and it feels like nothing is on your face.</li>
            <li> It does help with moisturizing apparently because I don&#x27;t feel dry while getting sand-blasted by the desert winds.</li>
            <li> I look a little shiny for a few minutes after applying the sunscreen, but it goes away quickly and does not leave any white residue.  </li>
            <li> only complaint about this sunblock is that when I first started using it</li>
            <li> Due to my olive skin tone, the white residue was immediately apparent.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just that I know that PPD has a bigger effect on aging and pigmentation in the long run, so this matters to me since I&#x27;m about to turn 40</li>
            <li> so sunscreen is almost a prerequisite all year long, but especially in the summer.</li>
            <li> Long lasting protection.</li>
            <li> I would buy them and then find out they were too thick, hard to spread, or left a huge white cast on my skin (i&#x27;m asian with medium skin tone).</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it every day for at least a year now, and last summer my face did not get pink for the first time ever.</li>
            <li> This was nearly 10 years ago and it was no easy transition, especially living on the coast of</li>
            <li> Goes on very thin and makes an easy layer under makeup.  </li>
            <li> Took this backpacking with me because it&#x27;s a small bottle and high spf.</li>
            <li> sun damage is the major source of skin aging and wrinkles; your skin will thank you years down the road.</li>
            <li> Keep in mind that it isn&#x27;t a moisturizer, it&#x27;s a daily sunscreen and therefore should not be expected to moisturize.</li>
            <li> It wears well under makeup and protects all day long.</li>
            <li> I started using this product a few years ago when I developed melasma (brown patches on the skin).</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s no residual greasy feeling or strange smell.</li>
            <li> When applied it does not take a long time for the lotion to dissolve/</li>
            <li> ...see my long long list) like eye moisturizers, face moisturizer, foundation, concealer, cream blush, lip moisturizer &amp; plumper!</li>
            <li> There is very minimal (almost none) white residue.  </li>
            <li> I tried some other sunscreens - however, they were heavy and left a white residue (probably from the titanium dioxide, since that is the chemical used for white pigment in paint and food coloring).  </li>
            <li> morning I wash my face, pat my face dry, and then apply this product.</li>
            <li> liquid version absorbs a lot quicker (~ 5 min), is easier to spread around and once dry</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been a sunscreen fanatic since I started following Paula Begoun in the early 1990s.</li>
            <li> Nothing worked under makeup; by lunchtime, I&#x27;d have to reapply or at least heavily touch-up my makeup because it had slid right off my face.</li>
            <li> I usually use the Neutrogena Dry Touch Cream, which works relatively well as long as you leave enough time for it to absorb (~10 - 15 min).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very fair-skinned, so this is not a good thing.</li>
            <li> For those who has sensitive skin might need to test a small area on your skin before applying on all areas.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> My dermatologist was not happy when I first went to visit her.</li>
            <li> I bought this to wear under makeup and found not only did it burn my eyes (even when I tried very hard to keep it away from the eye area), but my entire face would burn shortly after application and turn red.  </li>
            <li> I keep coming back to this one as it has one of the highest SPFs and less greasy.</li>
            <li> I found myself with super watery eyes at inconvenient times (driving on the highway, trying to keep eyes open for a picture), to the point where I almost couldn&#x27;t see.</li>
            <li> Applies with a very minimal white cast.&lt;br /&gt;- Non-greasy and dries down to an almost powder-like finish.&lt;br /&gt;- Does not affect makeup layered on top.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have spent a lot of money and time trying to find an spf lotion or cream that does not break me out and turn greasy and oily.  </li>
            <li> If I wear this by the pool and my face gets wet</li>
            <li> have tried a wide range of sunscreen for face (wide price range as well) and didn&#x27;t like them all.&lt;br /</li>
            <li> As with any sunscreen, you need to be careful when you blend it around your eyes.  </li>
            <li> also, with other sunblock, he always has white streaks all over his face/ears/neck like some sort of a messy clown, but not with this stuff.</li>
            <li> Skin feels dry and slightly moisturized.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It is on the runnier side but a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t leave my skin all shiny like other sunscreens.</li>
            <li> The bottle is really small, but the stuff seems to last forever</li>
            <li> Works extremely well</li>
            <li> so you&#x27;ve got to layer one over the other.  </li>
            <li> No residue to interfere with other products I apply</li>
            <li> My dermatologist said that my melasma was untreatable (due to other factors) but to use sunblock going forward.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m always on the look out for these to go on sale at other places, but Amazon has been the best.&lt;br /&gt;ps- even my husband loves it.</li>
            <li> My sun-freckled skin and tanned legs were chastised and this former tanning-junkie was given an order: No More Sun.</li>
            <li> I put it on every morning and goes well under make up and other products.</li>
            <li> i have extremely oily skin, so that i cannot leave the house without blotting papers.</li>
            <li> sunscreen works extremely well.</li>
            <li> Back then, sunscreens were thick, greasy, and occlusive--every one of them, even the very few that were designated as facial sunscreens.</li>
            <li> Hard to find locally during winter</li>
            <li> Although it is expensive, I expect the 1.4 oz bottle will last a long time, considering how little I use daily.</li>
            <li> Although the container is small it lasts for a long time.  </li>
            <li> Small bottle lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> it is small (1.4 oz), and expensive for its size, but it is so worth it.</li>
            <li> you have been thinking of this sunscreen and find creams too thick sometimes or have problems with white cast, I would recommend you give this a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> On the down side, it feels heavier than Supergoop and doesn&#x27;t mix well with moisturizer</li>
            <li> Never get sunburned, and your sunglasses don&#x27;t slide down your nose.  </li>
            <li> That is less greasy and provides drier finish.</li>
            <li> It does have a slight smell, but I find that after applying it the smell fades away to the point where I don&#x27;t notice it.</li>
            <li> The Neutrogena liquid sunblock is slightly thicker than the Walgreens version.  </li>
            <li> I found this at Target for less then $9.00.  </li>
            <li> Not like a typical sunscreen.</li>
            <li> Putting SPF cream there is a nuisance, and often leaves a greasy mess.</li>
            <li> However, it will see a little oily on my face.</li>
            <li> What it did to my face looks worse than the spots I&#x27;ve gotten from other kinds and is pretty uncomfortable.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s one of the few areas I feel</li>
            <li> /&gt;Update: It&#x27;s been a few years now since I started using this product.</li>
            <li> I did NOT want a heavy lotion on my face.</li>
            <li> I use it everyday on my face.</li>
            <li> and I did not like the greasy, heavy feel of that product.</li>
            <li> It made me look paler and dead.</li>
            <li> After a few minutes you forgot you had it on.</li>
            <li> Nonetheless, I fell asleep without washing off this sunscreen a few times and didn&#x27;t see my skin condition getting worse.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the product everyday for over a year now.</li>
            <li> Needed something that wouldn&#x27;t be so harsh.</li>
            <li> My go-to sunblock - i wear it everyday beneath my primer and make up.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have any noticeable spots on my face because I stay out of prolonged sun exposure and wear sunscreen everyday.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like heavy moisturizers, which clog my pores, so</li>
            <li> /&gt;There IS a white residue after you use it and worse after you reapply it like you should.</li>
            <li> , I use it everyday and it does not give me rashes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and I know that i&#x27;m protecting my skin everyday.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s thin so a little goes a long way</li>
            <li> My skin condition usually get worse when that happens (whiteheads, blocked pores, red bumps etc).</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for the past three years with no problems, and I wear it all year round.</li>
            <li> Some smell too much like sunscreen (downright cruel in November), some leave a thick white residue, some have a laughable SPF, and some make me shinier than a new</li>
            <li> Sunblock and sunscreen leave a feeling on my skin that I hate, so I rarely use them.</li>
            <li> They are small 1.4 oz.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if the formula was changed or it never worked as well as I thought.</li>
            <li> appreciate small size.</li>
            <li> Neutrogena products are usually rated highly.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure I would buy it again.</li>
            <li> I am using this product as my ONLY sunblock lotion even if it is expensive.</li>
            <li> but I usually wear it on my walks and planning to pack it into my suitcase for Hawaii.</li>
            <li> usually.</li>
            <li> The only reason i gave it 4 stars and not 5 is because if i use it every day it will start to break me out, but even then, the breakouts arent as bad as w/ other products.</li>
            <li> I have a naturally oily skin so anything greasy will make me very uncomfortable.</li>

            <li> Hard to believe, I know but try it.</li>
            <li> i have used it before learning this and it applied thick.  </li>
            <li> it is a liquid rather than a lotion or cream, like applying a thick toner.</li>
            <li> Every morning I put a thin layer of moisturizer on my face.  </li>
            <li> I like the thin consistency of this, although it sometimes makes my face burn.</li>
            <li> This is thin and goes on well.  </li>

            <li> consistency.&lt;br /&gt;Another major negative, is it tastes awful!</li>
            <li> If it wasn&#x27;t so expensive, I&#x27;d use it everywhere.</li>
            <li> I thought I was going to have to order from Japan or Korea for the rest of my life, for a sunscreen that didn&#x27;t feel greasy, or cause a horrible white cast!  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

            <li> I have been looking for a good sunblock for daily protection.  I tried so many of them. Some with moisturizer. Some don&#x27;t.  I don&#x27;t like the stickiness feeling and the white reside.  For those with moisturizer, it always makes my face look oily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I finally tried this Neutrogena.  I bought it at Target. It&#x27;s so easier to put it on.  There is very minimal (almost none) white residue.  I like it.  However, it will see a little oily on my face. This is a chemical sunblock.  For those who has sensitive skin might need to test a small area on your skin before applying on all areas.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use this mainly on my arms and neck.  For my face, I found the best one - Shiseido Urban Environment Oil-Free UV Protector SPF 42.  It also a liquid sunblock.  But this one is a physical sunblock.  Every morning I put a thin layer of moisturizer on my face.  Wait for a moment.  Then I put this Shisideo SPF 42 on it.  My face doesn&#x27;t look oily and it&#x27;s matte most of the day. I like it a lot.  However, it&#x27;s a bit costly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In conclusion, I think this Neutrogena is a good one for its price.</li>
            <li> LOVE LOVE LOVE.  This is the very first Sunscreen that I can use on my face and it will not break out.  It does not look shiny and covers well with makeup.  My skin is very sensitive and this works great!</li>
            <li> Sunblock and sunscreen leave a feeling on my skin that I hate, so I rarely use them. I&#x27;m very fair-skinned, so this is not a good thing. But the Neutrogena Ultra Sheer doesn&#x27;t leave that feeling -- my skin just feels like skin, not skin with stuff on it. I&#x27;ve been using it every day for at least a year now, and last summer my face did not get pink for the first time ever. Sure, it&#x27;s full of possibly toxic chemicals, but I figure the possible long-term risks are balanced out by cutting my risk of skin cancer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also use it on my legs and shoulders. If it wasn&#x27;t so expensive, I&#x27;d use it everywhere. Neutrogena Dry-Touch is good, but this is better.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s a really nice non greasy sunscreen, i like it and will buy more</li>
            <li> I have spent a lot of money and time trying to find an spf lotion or cream that does not break me out and turn greasy and oily.  I have very sensitive skin and it gets irritated very easily.  This is the only product that does not turn ghostly white and feels light.  It&#x27;s a sheer liquid so it spreads out easily and is NOT greasy! The only reason i gave it 4 stars and not 5 is because if i use it every day it will start to break me out, but even then, the breakouts arent as bad as w/ other products.</li>
            <li> I love love love this product. I was using Mentholatum&#x27;s SunPlay SPF 80 PA++ before I tried Neutrogena&#x27;s Ultra Sheer, and this liquid sunblock is so much better to apply under foundation/concealer than having a can sprayed on your face. I also love it that it doesn&#x27;t have this sticky texture and any funky smell.</li>
            <li> Strange smell, not bad smell but not nice either. The texture is quite watery so it&#x27;s easy to apply to my face. I like that it&#x27;s very high SPF but light. Not heavy or oily.</li>
            <li> I typically love neutrogena products - especially their sunscreen.  I bought this to wear under makeup and found not only did it burn my eyes (even when I tried very hard to keep it away from the eye area), but my entire face would burn shortly after application and turn red.  This product was unfortunately not for me - glad to see it works well for other people.</li>
            <li> My favorite sunscreen.  I use it daily. It is more liquid than cream so it doesn&#x27;t leave a white film on my face. Rubs in well and offers&lt;br /&gt;70% SPF. One caution: do not get this in your eyes unless you to burn and tear!</li>
            <li> Perfect for every day use!!</li>
            <li> This is a lot better than the Neutrogena Age Shield face sunblock because it is in liquid form so after application, as if you didn&#x27;t put anything on but you know it&#x27;s there &amp; it works as a sunblock. I do a lot of my work out in the field in the heat of the sun. The make up stays on longer than with the Age Shield product. Bought it for $12 at a local store well known for \\&quot;lower prices.\\&quot;</li>
            <li> Really keeps the harmful rays away with its astounding SPF 70.</li>
            <li> I apply this every day and have been since it launched several years back.  As I enter my mid-30&#x27;s, this the time where you look around and can tell who has and has not been protecting their skin.  I am delighted to boast that I have been diligent (slightly crazed) about skincare since my mid-20&#x27;s and now look it.  Liquid sunblocks came to the market with Clarins&#x27; revolutionary product, and I was faithful to that for years.  Now, everyone from Chanel to Laura Mercier makes a liquid, but this one is the BEST.  I have paid quadruple+ to try the luxury liquid sunblocks and they are not as good as this one.  This product is truly greaseless on the skin and absorbs completely when applied as the last step in skincare.  It provides a beautiful base for make-up application.  Moreover, it protects your skin from both UVA and UVB rays which are responsible for aging and burning of the skin.  Others are still too greasy, slippery under make-up, or just plain more pricey without being better, so save yourself the trouble -- I did the leg work for you!  I am truly a skincare junkie and only use the best.  It&#x27;s one of the few areas I feel the expense is justified bc I cherish beautiful skin.  So when I tell you I have no problem paying $800 for skin cream, please believe me when I tell you this product cannot be beat by anything more expensive out on the market.  Any dermatologist worth his salt will tell you that when it comes to sunblock, go for science over prestige.  Neutrogena has one of the best skin care science labs in the world, and the brand is known for making ground-breaking advancements in sun care year after year.  It sets the standard for others to follow, and you can see this if you pay close attention to skin care trends.  You may find something in a prettier package with a fancier price tag, but it will not outdo this product.  I would not be without it.  That is, until Neutrogena outdoes itself and comes out with the next best thing.</li>
            <li> Fabulous for facial protection!  Dries quickly. Does not flake off.</li>
            <li> I have really fair skin and I live in Southern California so daily sunscreen is crucial to my survival. Everything else that I tried either melted off my face, made me break out, had a really strong smell, made my skin super oily, or all of the above. This stuff is great though. It&#x27;s water and sweat-proof so it will actually remain on your face even if it&#x27;s hot. It soaks in super fast and makes my skin feel really soft. It doesn&#x27;t leave my skin all shiny like other sunscreens. It also doesn&#x27;t have a lingering smell. No one needs to know that I&#x27;m wearing sunscreen and with this stuff you really can&#x27;t tell. Keep in mind that it isn&#x27;t a moisturizer, it&#x27;s a daily sunscreen and therefore should not be expected to moisturize.</li>
            <li> With light sensitive skin, I have been pleased with many of Neutrogena&#x27;s sunblocks. I took two of these Ultra Sheer Liquid SPF 70 to the tropics that lasted for 6 months. I couldn&#x27;t have been more pleased. They are small 1.4 oz. containers and don&#x27;t require much product for solid protection. No skin irritation either.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: It&#x27;s been a few years now since I started using this product. Yes, it&#x27;s still easy to carry and goes on smooth but it may not be working as well as I thought. I have developed some red blotch sun damage (that may eventually turn pre-cancerous). I&#x27;m not sure if the formula was changed or it never worked as well as I thought. While it is true that I may not have reapplied it that often but I keep out of the sun as much as possible and wear protective hats. In any case, I think that the Neutrogina SPF 70 sport is more reliable. We only get one skin so we can&#x27;t take chances.</li>
            <li> I recently tried this because my mother got skin cancer so now I am on high alert when it comes to my sun exposure. I put it on my face after an acne cream that I use and it feels like it isn&#x27;t even on! It is VERY thin and watery, so don&#x27;t be surprised by that, but it works because you smooth it on and it feels like nothing is on your face. LOVE IT. I did NOT want a heavy lotion on my face. I have sensitive skin and this stuff is awesome.</li>
            <li> appreciate small size. Neutrogena products are usually rated highly.&lt;br /&gt;I use this occasionally and it is very convenient. probably will&lt;br /&gt;continue using again.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this sunscreen. It&#x27;s the only sunscreen I can get just about anywhere in the US that is just as cosmetically elegant as the Japanese and European sunscreens that I have to order online. This means if I run out or I&#x27;m out of town, I can have sunscreen for my face that looks and feels great. It works wonderfully under my Colorstay foundation and I stay pretty matte all day.&lt;br /&gt;HOWEVER, the PPD for this sunscreen is only 11 and when I used the Ciba BASF sunscreen calculator, it listed the SPF as only 30. I wonder what basis Neutrogena uses for the SPF rating it lists.&lt;br /&gt;Since Avene Tres Haute Emulsion SPF 50 is cheaper per ounce and has a PPD of 20, I will use this during the summer; however if I can&#x27;t get hold of it I will definitely run back to the Neutrogena in a pinch. It&#x27;s just that I know that PPD has a bigger effect on aging and pigmentation in the long run, so this matters to me since I&#x27;m about to turn 40 and I&#x27;m extremely fair complected.</li>
            <li> I have very fair skin and live in the desert southwest so an effective sunblock is my most important skin product. I  rely on this Neutrogena liquid sunblock for my face and neck because it goes on easily and never leaves a white residue. I have tried other Neutrogena non-liquid sunblocks, and while I am sure they are effective, they leave white, at times gummy, blotches on my face--even if I don&#x27;t use any other facial product. I ordered a non-liquid form by mistake recently and gave it to my husband. It works fine for him--no white residue. Guess skin texture is key.</li>
            <li> Wow!  I thought I was going to have to order from Japan or Korea for the rest of my life, for a sunscreen that didn&#x27;t feel greasy, or cause a horrible white cast!  Very light and absorbs, fast thank you Neutrogena for making a light weight coverage sunscreen!</li>
            <li> Please don&#x27;t quit making this, Neutrogena!  I have used this daily for years.  It is thin and easily applied.  Although the container is small it lasts for a long time.  I use the 70 SPF and then apply a 30 SPF foundation sparingly on top of it.</li>
            <li> This is my go-to sunscreen. I use it everyday on my face. It goes on well under make-up and seems to really help protect me from the sun, I get a lot darker when I am not wearing it. It also does not cause me to break out, which a lot of sunscreens do. The bottle is really small, but the stuff seems to last forever, I find that a bottle can last me for a month or two and I use it daily (however, I only use it on my face).</li>
            <li> I used this sunscreen for many years and love the light texture and packaging.  But now, my new favorite is the mineral liquid version...called Pure and Free I think.  That is less greasy and provides drier finish.</li>
            <li> A sunscreen formulated for the face shouldn&#x27;t run into the eyes so easily with even minimal sweating. This one does. Ow. And it keeps hurting until you wash your face.</li>
            <li> Blocks the sun, but kind of cakes on my face and flakes off.  I&#x27;m not sure I would buy it again.</li>
            <li> UPDATE JUNE 10:  I am using this product as my ONLY sunblock lotion even if it is expensive. I tried another brand for my neck and arms and I did not like the greasy, heavy feel of that product. While wearing the Neutrogenia Ultra Sheer Liquid Sunblock I feel nothing at all. The sunblock is so light that once it&#x27;s dried it&#x27;s like you are not wearing anything at all. This is a real plus as I must wear sunblock lotion due to health concerns.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve tried various SPF products through the years as I have fair skin that needs sun protection. I found this newest Neutrogenia product at a local discount department store last week and thought I&#x27;d give it a try. I did try the Neutrogenia Ultra Sheer Liquid Sunblock SPF 70 and I LOVE how easy this product is to apply to your skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Each morning I wash my face, pat my face dry, and then apply this product. On the days I plan on putting on full make-up, I then apply my face make-up over this sunblock. I&#x27;ve had no problems using my face make-up after applying this sunblock.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I love most is how the product is unscented. That suits my fair and sensitive skin just fine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> This is my new go-to sunblock for my face under my makeup.  I can&#x27;t wear any type of a cream sunblock, makes my skin oily and break out.  I am so thrilled to have found this.</li>
            <li> Today was the first day trying it and I was so surprised when I went to go reapply my make up in the afternoon that I was not oily or shiny.  I think it was this product.  Even though before this product I would use oil free sunblock and face lotion before applying my makeup, I still got very oily in a few hours.  This was day one so I will have to update and see if this is not only a long lasting sunblock or also a great mattifier to control oil too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wanted liquid sunscreen because I used to use shisedo sunscreen and loved the texture of the liquid but it was so expensive.  This one seems great and although on the pricier side, if it acts as a mattifier for my oily face, I am 100% sold!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I saw some reviews complaining about the white cast  - just rub it in!!!!  not a big deal at all :)</li>
            <li> Works extremely well but I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it for working out.</li>
            <li> Not oily and doesn&#x27;t clog my pores. Applies very sheer and doen&#x27;t make my face shiny. A moisturizer should probably be used to prevent dryness</li>
            <li> I have been through so many different sunscreens - half drugstore brands, half natural / organic brands, and a few high end brands. I would buy them and then find out they were too thick, hard to spread, or left a huge white cast on my skin (i&#x27;m asian with medium skin tone). so i am always on the lookout.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;one day i was reading how most of the sunscreens in asia were the liquid kind so they spread easier and do not leave a white cast, i wanted to try some. at the same time, I found out that neutrogena makes two  \\&quot;liquid\\&quot; sunscreen (spf 55 and 70). woohoo! i promptly went into one of the drugstore and got one to try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i love it!! sure i would rather use something without parabens, more natural and vegan,  has physical sunblocks, etc. but it&#x27;s hard to find one that works for my skin. i&#x27;d gone through many tubes of these and they are the only facial sunscreen i stock up on now. it leaves no white cast, is very easy to spread and offers superior sun protection. i do not feel or have sunburns after being out all day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It can look just a bit greasy right after application. i do not wear foundation but use a light pressed powder and it really sets the sunscreen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;until I see and tried another sunscreen that has physical sunblocks and leaves no white cast and is as easy to apply, this one is it. right now, amazon is having a sale too so I stocked up. :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;if you have been thinking of this sunscreen and find creams too thick sometimes or have problems with white cast, I would recommend you give this a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i was having the same issue with a body sunscreen and I found my HG in the coppertone foaming sunscreen too.</li>
            <li> I love this but I wish it were more waterproof. If I wear this by the pool and my face gets wet it runs in my eyes and burns. But for daily use this is wonderful. I live in a very warm and sunny climate where often there are no clouds in the sky and little shade. I spend a lot of time on the playground or out in open fields, the beach, outdoor shopping centers, and by the pool. Usually the sun is very bright with no clouds at all and I can easily get sunburn in 20-40 minutes. When I wear this with my regular moisturizer, my freckles don&#x27;t even come out. I don&#x27;t tan or burn at all. My skin stays protected but doesn&#x27;t break out. I&#x27;m definitely going to keep ordering this since I have never been able to find it in any of my local stores.</li>
            <li> I use this every day and especially when I play golf. It protects and doesn&#x27;t run into my eyes. It was recommended by a friend.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff. Sunscreen that doesn&#x27;t feel greasy on the face and doesn&#x27;t sting if it gets in your eyes.</li>
            <li> Goes on gray.  Good protecrio</li>
            <li> This lives up to its name:  super, super lightweight and sheer. Goes on like a liquid, almost like water. Blends extremely quickly and well. Clear. You can wear it daily under your makeup. The only reason I didn&#x27;t give it five stars is that it doesn&#x27;t have any zinc oxide or other physical block sunblock in it, it is purely chemical block ingredients. My dermatologist recommended the physical blocks, like zinc oxide, because they are effective immediately and last longer on the skin. The chemical block, like Neutrogena products, takes about 20 minutes to bind to the skin and become effective, so you must put it on 20 minutes prior to sun exposure.  Nonetheless, this is an excellent product for the price (physical block sheer liquids are easily 3-4x as much money).</li>
            <li> I have rosacea and very sensitive skin.  My pores get clogged if I use the wrong products and I HAVE to wear sunscreen on my face every day.  This sunblock is wonderful, goes on with a little white film and soaks right in.  I use it in place of moisturizer before I put on my make-up.  It is a light lotion perfect for my face.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very fair skinned and have been using sun screen basically everyday since I was a teen. I&#x27;ve tried them all, but my biggest problem was the product not soaking into my skin fast enough before I put on my makeup or it getting into my eyes if I wiped my face. Neutrogena Ultra Sheer Liquid is a miracle product for me because it goes on so easy, absorbs super fast and doesn&#x27;t feel or look greasy. This has become my must have sunblock.</li>
            <li> I like to wear this under my makeup in the summer.  It is light and not greasy therefore makes makeup application easy..</li>
            <li> its an okay product. Doesn&#x27;t absorb in my skin right away as I hoped. Will finish the bottle but will not buy it again. Will try to look for a better product that would suit my skin more</li>
            <li> I have to wear sunscreen every day for health reasons and I absolutely hate it. I kind of hate this one too, but at least it&#x27;s cheap and better than a lot of them in terms of not making your face oily. It actually soaks in pretty quickly and looks fairly matte once it does. On the down side, it feels heavier than Supergoop and doesn&#x27;t mix well with moisturizer so you&#x27;ve got to layer one over the other.  While it doesn&#x27;t look greasy it does feel greasy when you touch your skin while wearing it.  Edit: Got some of this near my eye area (like 1&amp;#34; under my eye) and didn&#x27;t have time to wash it off before work. By the time I got home I had a rash where it got on that part of my skin. I&#x27;ve had sunscreen make my skin oily and even cause acne cysts before, but this was the first to put a rash on my face. Won&#x27;t recommend it to anyone anymore. What it did to my face looks worse than the spots I&#x27;ve gotten from other kinds and is pretty uncomfortable.</li>
            <li> Ok product, I use it at the beach or when working out. Cant really get used to wearing this under make up - its still pretty heavy and smells like sunscreen.</li>
            <li> This is the absolute best sunblock.  I use it every day under my makeup.  It is a great product at a very good price.  It has gotten hard to find at some of my local stores, but I am always able to find it on Amazon.</li>
            <li> This is a great sunscreen. It doesn&#x27;t make me look shiny or feel gross at all. I love that it soaks right into my face without any stickiness at all.</li>
            <li> Well, I tested this out today and attended the Feast of San Genaro. It is not greasy and very light, almost too light that it leaves you looking very, very dry. :( I don&#x27;t know who said that it doesn&#x27;t leave a white cast because it does! That&#x27;s just on my body though---my face was a different story. It made me look paler and dead. Now, I don&#x27;t know what to use. I am sad.</li>
            <li> Easy application, no greasiness, clothing not stained.  With intense sun for an all day, all week vacation, my skin was totally protected - absolutely no burning!</li>
            <li> This stuff is great, goes on easy and has a shaker in the bottle just like a can of Guinness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Kept me from burning in water and sun for a day at the water park which is a tall order for someone with fair skin. I used it liberally on my neck and face. After a few minutes you forgot you had it on. I will be using this again.</li>
            <li> I like the thin consistency of this, although it sometimes makes my face burn.</li>
            <li> I usually use the Neutrogena Dry Touch Cream, which works relatively well as long as you leave enough time for it to absorb (~10 - 15 min).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This liquid version absorbs a lot quicker (~ 5 min), is easier to spread around and once dry you can&#x27;t really feel it on the face. The only issue is that it&#x27;s a lot more expensive than the cream version. So I only wear it for &#x27;special occasions&#x27; or when I want to wear a decent amount of makeup on top. For everyday, I would opt for the cream version since it is much cheaper.</li>
            <li> Stings your eyes when working out...</li>
            <li> Excellent product! When I shop for a broad spectrum high level sunscreen...this is my go to product! It&#x27;s light &amp; absorbs well! No residue to interfere with other products I apply (sigh...see my long long list) like eye moisturizers, face moisturizer, foundation, concealer, cream blush, lip moisturizer &amp; plumper! Works great &amp; after reading some of the reviews for more pricey high SPF products I think I will be staying with this one!</li>
            <li> Good product if you need a daily sunblock. My skin just didn&#x27;t like it much...burned my eyes also for several hours after application</li>
            <li> This is one of the sheerest sun screens I&#x27;ve used. I really, really dislike the white cast many sunscreens leave on your face and this does not leave a white film at all. Almost anyone can relate to this issue unless you&#x27;re fair skinned. Yes, if you use foundation the white sheen is not noticeable, but if you don&#x27;t want to put foundation on and just dust your face with some pressing powder, this is the perfect defense against sun damage and not look like you dipped your face in sour cream. I live in Arizona so sunscreen is almost a prerequisite all year long, but especially in the summer. I use sunscreens religiously and therefore have used many brands over the years, from drugstore types to high end department stores. I keep coming back to this one as it has one of the highest SPFs and less greasy. I&#x27;ve been using it for years. The Neutrogena brand does not cause me to break out as it has others. Guess it&#x27;s not for everyone. It&#x27;s hard to find in most stores. The only store that stocks it that I know of is Target but the price is better on Amazon.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very light and works well under my makeup.  I like the lack of smell since many products have a strong fragrance.  As summer approaches, I&#x27;ll find out how well the coverage works.</li>
            <li> I have used this product now for 3-4 years. I use it on my daughters, ages 9&amp;12 as well. We are all very fair redheads and burn extremely quickly. This product is great for all of us. It wears well under makeup and protects all day long. It does not leave a greasy/oily residue and is easy to apply. We live at high altitude and wear it year round as we get burned in the winter from the sun reflecting off of snow. I would highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I use sunscreen everyday and am always on the lookout for a good one for my face.  This is thin and goes on well.  It disappears right away.  Most facial sunscreens I used have stayed a little white.  I also have a problem with facial sunscreens stinging.  This one did not.  I&#x27;m very happy it is spf 70.  Having a good strong sunscreen on everyday is so important.  If not just for cancer protection but to keep you young looking.  Give this a try.</li>
            <li> This is the best sunscreen for darker skin types. no chalk look and goes on smooth and no smell. Great buy!!!</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin and I used this every day last winter in FL and was very pleased.  Qualifier..only for routine exposure, no tanning</li>
            <li> A nice lightweight liquid that dries quickly and feels smooth rather than greasy or chalky. A fragrance free version would be perfection.</li>
            <li> Fantastic sunblock. Light but effective.</li>
            <li> My favorite sunscreen. With sensitive, very fair skin,  this exceeds any from the dermatologist. Goes On smoothly, does invisibly with no white residue or sticky texture. You don&#x27;t even notice it with our without makeup. Long lasting protection. Small bottle lasts a long time. Hard to find locally during winter so I stock up here.</li>
            <li> Has a strong rose scent that I find hard to tolerate. Prevents sunburn (does job as sunscreen) and similar to the Laroche-posay equivalent in texture and how it goes on. But that scent.</li>
            <li> I burn easily, so when I put my favorite body lotion on, I add 6-7 drops of Neutrogena. At the rate I use it, about 20 drops/day, it lasts all summer.</li>
            <li> Took this backpacking with me because it&#x27;s a small bottle and high spf. I still got pretty burnt so I don&#x27;t feel this protected me well.</li>
            <li> the product is an old stock and expires on August 2015! Are you kidding me?? I intend to use for 3 to 5 months!</li>
            <li> make sure you shake item!  i have used it before learning this and it applied thick.  if you shake, it goes on smooth and disappears.</li>
            <li> I have always hated using sunscreen. I strongly dislike how they smell or feel on my skin.&lt;br /&gt;I have tried a wide range of sunscreen for face (wide price range as well) and didn&#x27;t like them all.&lt;br /&gt;  The last two I used was Peter Thomas Roth and Neutrogena Ultra Sheer Dry-Touch - I hated both.&lt;br /&gt;I also usually do not use cheap skincare products for face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I came across this, from the description, it seemed like a decent product that is close to what I was looking for - a sunscreen that is super lighweight.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Very pleasantly surprised - I don&#x27;t put a lot on but it definitely feels very close to having no sunscreen on. I have bad habits of falling asleep without washing off sunscreen or makeup. My skin condition usually get worse when that happens (whiteheads, blocked pores, red bumps etc). Nonetheless, I fell asleep without washing off this sunscreen a few times and didn&#x27;t see my skin condition getting worse.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Everyone&#x27;s skin reaction is different, but I definitely will recommend all friends and family to try it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PS-the expiration of the sunscreen I received is approx one year from my amazon order date.</li>
            <li> This is a daily staple for me since I came across it over a year ago.  I put it on over my moisturizer and it doesn&#x27;t give that whitish tinge that sunblock can give.  I&#x27;m olive skinned so bad zinc oxide type spf can look bad on me but this goes on invisible after you rub it in.  My sensitive skin loves this - it doesn&#x27;t break me out and it doesn&#x27;t make my skin itch.  It&#x27;s thin so a little goes a long way and if you put it on dry skin your skin will quickly absorb it unless you have skin that&#x27;s moisturized.  So, I find that it spreads better when I moisturize first.</li>
            <li> This sunblock has been recommended to me but unfortunately I cannot use it. By the end of the day my face was covered with pimples. I know that sunblocks are very unique for each person. I do not have any problems with La Roche Posay or SkinCeuticals brands.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the product everyday for over a year now. I have a very sensitive skin and need protection throughout the day against the sun. I would recommend this product. Might no be the best in the water.</li>
            <li> I have a kid with bad eczema and fair skin. Needed something that wouldn&#x27;t be so harsh. This seems to work well.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so happy I found a high SPF sunblock that doesn&#x27;t make me break out or irritates my skin! It applies very easily and doesn&#x27;t sweat off or run into my eyes!</li>
            <li> I am an old man with a bald spot at the top of my head. Putting SPF cream there is a nuisance, and often leaves a greasy mess. I  purchased this product a short while ago, and so far I like it. A little bit squeezed onto an index finger goes directly to the spot; its texture is fine. Although it is expensive, I expect the 1.4 oz bottle will last a long time, considering how little I use daily.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive, combination skin that is prone to outbreaks. I started using this product a few years ago when I developed melasma (brown patches on the skin). Melasma worsens when unprotected skin is exposed to direct sunlight. My dermatologist said that my melasma was untreatable (due to other factors) but to use sunblock going forward. I&#x27;m happy to say that since using this product the melasma has lightened to the point where it is barey noticeable. Now to be clear this product does not lighten the skin, but it protected my skin from further sun damage and gave it time to heal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This liquid sunblock works well under make-up and does not cause skin outbreaks. Even though it&#x27;s just 1.4 oz, it lasts a long time and is well worth the cost.</li>
            <li> love this!  very thin, perfect for the face.</li>
            <li> This is the best sunscreen I&#x27;ve found, and, like other reviewers, I have tried a lot - other Neutrogena products, department store brands, Eltamd UV Clear SPF 46, organic sunscreens, etc, etc, etc.  I like this best for a lot of reasons: it is affordable, it leaves no white \\&quot;mask\\&quot;, it is 70 SPF, it does not irritate my sensitive skin, and it is light enough that I don&#x27;t notice I&#x27;m wearing it and I can sneak another product (like a retinol treatment) underneath it and I still don&#x27;t notice it.  I live at 7,000 feet in the high desert and I am outside a lot (and I&#x27;m about to be forty), so I needed something powerful enough to minimize the sun damage and moisturizing enough to handle really dry air.  The Eltamd UV Clear SPF 46 was working well for awhile, but it seemed a wee bit thicker, and there was just a hint more of the \\&quot;white mask\\&quot; effect. Also, the Elta is double the price of this.  This is now my default sunscreen, and I am happy enough with it that I&#x27;ve stopped looking for alternatives.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way and it works great.  Non-greasy.  Great for your face.  Love this stuff.</li>
            <li> Great stuff - works well and goes on easily!</li>
            <li> My dermatologist tells me keep sunscreen on my bald head.  This is what I use and like it.</li>
            <li> not sticky or greasy at all! love love love it.&lt;br /&gt;got myself another tube and another one for my mom. hope they never stop making this! and Amazon has the best price I&#x27;ve seen. I&#x27;m always on the look out for these to go on sale at other places, but Amazon has been the best.&lt;br /&gt;ps- even my husband loves it. he hates putting on sunblock on his face because it tends to make its way into his eyes at some point, but this stuff just disappears when you apply.  also, with other sunblock, he always has white streaks all over his face/ears/neck like some sort of a messy clown, but not with this stuff. may be the liquidy consistency, but whatever magic is in this bottle, your skin soaks it up! husband approved is a gold star in my book.</li>
            <li> My go-to sunblock - i wear it everyday beneath my primer and make up. nice texture. easily absorbed. high protection. all good.</li>
            <li> I use this stuff religiously.  Goes on very thin and makes an easy layer under makeup.  Can&#x27;t be without it.</li>
            <li> I really liked this product. It works ! At the same time, I&#x27;ve used some protective clothing too along with the product. Its not greasy and doesn&#x27;t leave any white residue. It moisturizes the skin too. My only concern is it included some harmful carcinogenic ingredients. I haven&#x27;t done my research properly and ordered this. Now I&#x27;m using this because I already have it. But I would recommend natural sunscreens/sunblocks. Currently, I&#x27;m going to try devita natural sunscreen. I would definitely shift back to neutrogena if they release any good natural sunscreen products !</li>
            <li> I recently shaved my head and I was conerned that my newly bald cranium will burn easily without the protection of hair.  I tried some other sunscreens - however, they were heavy and left a white residue (probably from the titanium dioxide, since that is the chemical used for white pigment in paint and food coloring).  Due to my olive skin tone, the white residue was immediately apparent.  I tried out the Neutrogena Ultra-Sheer and really like this sunscreen.  It is a liquid, so it goes on easily and is quickly absorbed.  I look a little shiny for a few minutes after applying the sunscreen, but it goes away quickly and does not leave any white residue.  My exposed scalp and face haven&#x27;t shown any allergies or intolerances to the product and it seems to provide strong protection.  I apply the product on top of some basic moisturizer and does not seem to interfere.  I like this product and is easily available through Amazon or your local drugstores.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With the new FDA rules that are coming into effect, Neutrogena will not be able to call this product a sunblock (overpromising), market it as SPF 70 (higher SPFs have diminishing returns, so FDA is limiting SPF claims to 50) or say that it is waterproof or sweatproof (again overpromising).  As a result, later in 2012 this product will probably be labeled a broad-spectrum (protects against UVA and UVB rays), water resistant sunscreen, SPF 50+.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been a sunscreen fanatic since I started following Paula Begoun in the early 1990s. Back then, sunscreens were thick, greasy, and occlusive--every one of them, even the very few that were designated as facial sunscreens. Nothing worked under makeup; by lunchtime, I&#x27;d have to reapply or at least heavily touch-up my makeup because it had slid right off my face. But I kept upgrading my sunscreen based on Paula&#x27;s recommendations, and through the years, formulations have improved by great leaps and bounds. This was one of her recommendations a few years ago, and that&#x27;s when I bought my first bottle. This stuff is fabulous. I can use a lot of it (because you need to be generous for good UV protection) and it truly disappears into my skin. It does not affect any makeup that&#x27;s put on top of it (wait about one minute for full absorption, then have at it). I am convinced that this product has single-handedly kept 10 years of aging off my face--maybe more. The best facial sunscreen on the market, period.</li>
            <li> This is *the* best daily facial sunblock. I&#x27;ve just purchased my 4th or 5th bottle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;- No sunscreen smell.&lt;br /&gt;- Applies with a very minimal white cast.&lt;br /&gt;- Non-greasy and dries down to an almost powder-like finish.&lt;br /&gt;- Does not affect makeup layered on top.&lt;br /&gt;- Compact, spill-proof and squish proof container that is great for travel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Amazon price is usually pretty good compared to CVS, Walgreens, Target and BB&amp;B near me.</li>
            <li> I wear sunblock everyday, so it was important to find one that was easy to apply, didn&#x27;t have a very strong scent, wouldn&#x27;t make my face break out, and would work well under makeup. This sunblock fulfills all of those requirements. It does have a slight smell, but I find that after applying it the smell fades away to the point where I don&#x27;t notice it. If you use too much it can make your face look greasier, but after some practice you can find the right balance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only complaint about this sunblock is that when I first started using it I think I put it too close my eyes, and by the end of the day sweat would carry the sunblock into my eyes. I found myself with super watery eyes at inconvenient times (driving on the highway, trying to keep eyes open for a picture), to the point where I almost couldn&#x27;t see. So definitely give this product a try if you&#x27;re looking for a good sunblock, but be careful how close you get it to your eyes!</li>
            <li> I bought this as a necessity for my trip to Death Valley National Park. I have a naturally oily skin so anything greasy will make me very uncomfortable. I&#x27;ve tried many brands and types but none gave me the comfort I seek until I gave this one a try. When applied, it takes about 15 minutes for the white streaks to disappear. Afterward, I don&#x27;t feel like I have applied it at all. It does help with moisturizing apparently because I don&#x27;t feel dry while getting sand-blasted by the desert winds. After 5 days of hiking around Death Valley National Park, I haven&#x27;t turned into a lobster yet so this sunblock lotion works perfectly. It is comfortable enough for me to use it repeatedly and extensively. Based on my experiences, I bought couple more already.</li>
            <li> Best sunscreen I have found. Feels dry, stays put, doesn&#x27;t irritate my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> This is the only sunscreen I can use on my face. Thank goodness because it goes on perfectly under my makeup.  I&#x27;ve tried just using straight sunscreen, the same kind that goes on my body, but it ends up stinging my eyes like crazy as the day goes on.  This is gentle enough, sheer enough, &amp; SPF 70.  Can&#x27;t beat it.</li>
            <li> My dermatologist was not happy when I first went to visit her. My sun-freckled skin and tanned legs were chastised and this former tanning-junkie was given an order: No More Sun. Ever. This was nearly 10 years ago and it was no easy transition, especially living on the coast of South Carolina.&lt;br /&gt;  Since that time, I&#x27;ve worked through countless facial suncreens / sunblocks. That&#x27;s always the hardest part, right? Some smell too much like sunscreen (downright cruel in November), some leave a thick white residue, some have a laughable SPF, and some make me shinier than a new car.&lt;br /&gt;  SO, I feel like I have enough experience to say that the Neutrogena Ultra Sheer liquid sunblock is the best sunscreen on the market. It&#x27;s moisturizing, but protective (SPF 70!!) and very absorbent. No white residue and a very nice matte finish. Near odorless. Even more, no outbreaks in my acne-prone skin.&lt;br /&gt;  While it is a little more expensive than most facial sunscreens (which is why I purchase from Amazon), a little goes a long way and the advantages are definitely worth the cost.&lt;br /&gt;  FYI - Not waterproof, but doesn&#x27;t claim to be.&lt;br /&gt;  Fast-forward to last week when I was asked if I was starting college soon. I&#x27;m 31. Maybe my dermatologist was right after all, but I couldn&#x27;t have done it without Neutrogena Ultra sheer!</li>
            <li> I have been using this sunscreen for years after a long search for the perfect high SPF sunscreen for my face that I could wear during the summer under makeup or without it. This sunscreen does better than the more expensive brands that I have tried. I love it for the following reasons:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1) It really is ultra sheer - it comes out in a runny liquid form. This makes it really easy to rub into my face, as opposed to some of the thicker sunscreens where it feels like you have to spend minute after minute rubbing them in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2) It rubs in completely - it does not leave a chalky white residue on my face. Instead, it blends in perfectly, leaving no residue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3) It is not greasy - your skin will feel as good as before you applied this sunscreen. No greasy residue to deal with. Skin feels dry and slightly moisturized.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4) Works great under makeup - you can apply this sunscreen and it is not heavy, chalky or greasy so makeup will stay put on your face! I love it because I have some spots where I like to apply concealer and it will stay put on my face with this sunscreen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;5) Prevents sunburns - so many ultra light facial sunscreens are only SPF 15 and so I worry that my face will get burned after a short time in the sun. With this sunscreen you get SPF 70 coverage which keeps my face from being burned, especially during the summer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only con is that is does not moisturize deeply like a moisturizer, but this product does not claim to be a moisturizer. So I moisturize at night before bed. Overall, this is the perfect year round sunscreen for your face. It is a high SPF, non greasy, ultra sheer, and you can wear makeup over it if you so choose. I it is my favorite sunscreen for my face!</li>
            <li> I spend a lot of time outdoors walking, riding my bike, and just being out. This sunscreen applies smooth and easy, does not seem greasy and protects.</li>
            <li> I really like this sunscreen because it dries quickly and invisibly on my skin. Most sunscreen product for the face leave my face looking greasy. This is the only product that doesn&#x27;t. I put it on every morning and goes well under make up and other products. The best part is that when I use this product the melasma on my forehead doesn&#x27;t appear.</li>
            <li> Great for everyday wear</li>
            <li> Okay you may call me paranoid but SPF 70 can make me feel a little safer from the sun now. This Neutrogena product feels so nice on my skin, no reactions at all, and it smells wonderful, but it&#x27;s not a perfume strong smell it&#x27;s just a nice milk lotion/sunscreen smell. I&#x27;ve ben using other Neurogena products over the years and got this particular one after a YouTube review by a woman in her 50s who swore by it and she had such pretty skin. So far, I&#x27;m LOVE this. Makeup goes over it nice but I usually wear it on my walks and planning to pack it into my suitcase for Hawaii. PROTECT YOUR SKIN :)! I hope this helps.</li>
            <li> This is the best sun screen to use under makeup. It isn&#x27;t greasy and it dries clear.  It doesn&#x27;t give that &amp;#34;ghostlike&amp;#34; appearance like most other sunscreens.</li>
            <li> I started using liquid sunblock with the Walgreens version, which on the outside looked exactly like this Neutrogena version (just different logos and now discontinued), so I can only compare this Neutrogena liquid sunblock with the Walgreens liquid sunblock.  The Neutrogena liquid sunblock is slightly thicker than the Walgreens version.  I&#x27;ve learned to like the thickness of it--it might mean better quality/protection, and it doesn&#x27;t run as easily.  After I apply it, the sunblock doesn&#x27;t seem to be visible at all.  I love the sunblock and the small size and nice look of the container.  I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll ever be switching back to the regular lotion/cream type sunblock that I&#x27;ve used for years before!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m careful about the products I use on my face because I am mildly allergic to the sun and have sensitive as well as acne-prone skin.  I just make sure to wash my skin immediately when I come home.  I highly recommend this sunblock!</li>
            <li> Daily AM usage summer &amp; winter.  I mix it into my moistureizer.</li>
            <li> This sunscreen was recommended by my dermatologist because I wanted something lightweight to wear daily.  I live in one of the sunniest places in the U.S., and I have melasma.  I don&#x27;t have any noticeable spots on my face because I stay out of prolonged sun exposure and wear sunscreen everyday.  I don&#x27;t like heavy moisturizers, which clog my pores, so this is the best thing I&#x27;ve found.  I&#x27;ve been using this for the past three years with no problems, and I wear it all year round.</li>
            <li> I found this at Target for less then $9.00.  Next time I will buy at target. I should have checked before I made this purchase.</li>
            <li> what i like about this product most is the smooth application. i have extremely oily skin, so that i cannot leave the house without blotting papers. other sunscreens make my face extremely greasy and make any makeup i put on top disappear in one or two hours. i had others that would pill into little white balls if i tried to apply foundation on top. but with this ultra sheer sunblock. makeup goes on so smoothly. it is a liquid rather than a lotion or cream, like applying a thick toner. it is small (1.4 oz), and expensive for its size, but it is so worth it. it really protects the skin and wears so beautifully under makeup. i put this on first after washing my face, so that it can chemically bind to the surface of my skin. sun damage is the major source of skin aging and wrinkles; your skin will thank you years down the road. i wouldn&#x27;t know what to do if it ever got discontinued! i buy several at a time. i stopped looking for other options and trying on different sunscreens because it truly is the best out there for oily skin.</li>
            <li> Great protection for my unprotected scalp!</li>
            <li> My husband and I like this for our faces. We use it when we&#x27;re fishing for hours. Never get sunburned, and your sunglasses don&#x27;t slide down your nose.  I like it because it&#x27;s not oily and doesn&#x27;t leave a residue. We use the regular brands for the rest of our bods.</li>
            <li> do wish it was a little less greasy, but it is light.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve spent many years searching for the perfect sunscreen that I can&#x27;t feel, but that still works well. This is it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This sunscreen works extremely well. That being said, finding a sunscreen that works isn&#x27;t all that hard, but finding a sunscreen that you can wear under makeup without compromises is a HUGE deal! I apply this sunscreen prior to applying my face primer, and by the time I&#x27;m applying foundation (usually Bare Minerals) I can&#x27;t even tell that I have sunscreen on my face. This means a lot to me, since I feel much more confident going out with my normal makeup in place. I&#x27;ve worn this all day at high altitudes with no reapplication and have not been burned at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m really surprised that this isn&#x27;t sold more widely in retail stores. This isn&#x27;t only the best product Neutrogena sells, but the best sunscreen product on the market at any price point.</li>
            <li> I purchased this to try another higher SPF since I use the [[ASIN:B004D2C5FY Neutrogena Clear Face Sunblock Lotion, SPF 30, 3 Ounce]] one and I was wondering if I could go a bit higher.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Realize that I have Lupus, and extremely sensitive skin, as in I get rashes by anything. This product made me have a horrible rash after being in the sun, it was so horrible I could not believe it was made by the same company.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There IS a white residue after you use it and worse after you reapply it like you should. I used this solely on my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would really recommend the other Clear Face product instead, I use it everyday and it does not give me rashes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hope this was helpful.</li>
            <li> This is the only sunscreen I&#x27;ve ever felt comfortable wearing on my face. I have an oily complexion, and putting lotion or anything on my face is a terrible idea... usually. This feels dry and comfortable as soon as you spread it on your face. I absolutely love it. I wish I knew about this in my 20&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> I have oily skin and for some reason I find that sunscreen makes me sweat.  This product goes on like water and doesn&#x27;t make either \\&quot;issue\\&quot; worse.</li>
            <li> nice lotion, not to thick so it goes on easy and doesn&#x27;t feel heavy on the face.</li>
            <li> I used this several times before shucking it.&lt;br /&gt;I am fair skinned and burned in 1/2 hour. It is a very thin consistency.&lt;br /&gt;Another major negative, is it tastes awful! If you wear it swimming it will run and if it gets near your mouth ... Yuk!&lt;br /&gt;I would not recommend this and will throw mine away.</li>
            <li> Great product! Easy to apply on face, give me excellent protection. I use it every day.</li>
            <li> Love, Love Love this sunscreen!!  Goes on great underneath makeup!! Price comparable to Walmart Looked for this all last year.Finally found it onAmazon!!</li>
            <li> Dries practically matte and has a faint, pleasant scent. Does not feel or smell like sunscreen!</li>
            <li> The best product I ever used!</li>
            <li> i mix this with my moisturizer every day - its sheer and does not have a strong sunscreen smell. perfect!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s Neutrogena, what else needs to be said about their quality. I haven&#x27;t used this much yet as I&#x27;m saving it for vacation time in the sun.</li>
            <li> This is a great product, have been using it for years.  It is light and effective at protecting you from the sun..</li>
            <li> I have vitiligo and live in sunny Florida, so using sunscreen is a must for me.  As you can imagine, I have tried many, many kinds of sunscreens, including high end brands found only at Sephora and department stores.  Oh, I have spent so much money on finding the perfect facial sunscreen.  But, my search ended when I found the Neutrogena Ultra Sheer Liquid Sunblock.  I must say of all the facial sunscreens, this is the best one I have ever used!  It really does go on sheer under makeup.  The texture of the cream is a bit \\&quot;liquidy\\&quot; like foundation, and blends in beautifully.  As with any sunscreen, you need to be careful when you blend it around your eyes.  As you know, if you get it in your eyes, it does sting a bit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hope they never stop making this product.  It&#x27;s fantastic!</li>
            <li> This is probably the 12th bottle of Ultra Sheer Liquid I&#x27;ve gone through.  The formulation must have changed recently - it looks and feels quite watery.  So it is sheer in that sense.  As long as it offers same protection I will keep using it.  But for a second I did wonder if I got the authentic product....</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t make my face oily like other high SPF sun block. Perfect for adding up make up base and foundation.</li>
            <li> If you need a sunscreen to protect your skin but don&#x27;t want something greasy and heavy because you love to wear makeup this is it!!! My favorite sunscreen is Clarins, but it adds up quickly, and after trying SO MANY sunscreens I find these sunscreen &amp;#34;drops&amp;#34; are the perfect budget friendly option! They work great under makeup without changing formula and texture, and I have mixed it into pure pigments and used it as a custom foundation it works great! If you&#x27;re at the beach, I prefer using these too because it dries nice, almost to a powdery finish. Not like a typical sunscreen. I really hope this is here to stay because this is one of the best facial sunscreens I have ever used. I hope they make higher SPFs soon!</li>
            <li> This is a good sunscreen.I use it over my moisturizer, since is liquid is easy to absorb and feels nice.If you live in a sunny state I would recommend this product!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve become a bit of a sunblock connoisseur after so much time hiking in the desert. This sunblock not only is very effective, but I like the way it applies. It&#x27;s very fluid during application so it&#x27;s easy to spread. Once it&#x27;s on you forget it&#x27;s there. There&#x27;s no residual greasy feeling or strange smell. A little goes a long way, and the small size is nice for airport travel since it&#x27;s TSA compliant.  This is my go-to sunblock and I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> Love it! Good before makeup</li>
            <li> I started using this product because my friend left this in my purse. I ....just never returned it. I owe him a new one :) He has fair , beautiful skin (think Cate Blanchett). I have oily, hyper-allergenic skin (I&#x27;m also the opposite of fair, on the tan side). This product seems to be very universal upon pleasing multiple clienteles. It eliminates all the horrible aspects of putting on lotion in my opinion. When applied it does not take a long time for the lotion to dissolve/ It is on the runnier side but a little goes a long way. My skin is more even and I know that i&#x27;m protecting my skin everyday.</li>
            <li> Completely disappears immediately. No greasy feeling. No oily residue. It&#x27;s gone and you can put makeup or anything else over it. Or just leave it as is.  It&#x27;s the ONLY sunblock I have ever used that has this ability to soak in and disappear. Hard to believe, I know but try it. And let me know how it worked for you.</li>
