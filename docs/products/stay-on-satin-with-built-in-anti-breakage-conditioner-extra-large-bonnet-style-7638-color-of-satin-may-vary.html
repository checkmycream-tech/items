            <li>Is great for my hair!</li>
            <li>awesome bonnet.</li>
            <li>The best part is that it STAYS ON!</li>
            <li>If you have relaxed hair this is best for set styles (roller sets, twist sets, etc.)</li>
            <li>This is one of the BEST satin hair bonnets, it does not come off during the night and it also fits my 5 year olds head without coming off during the night.</li>
            <li>Great product.</li>
            <li>Works great.</li>
            <li>It smells great and stayed on all night.</li>
            <li>They stay on while sleeping; I love them!!</li>
            <li>My mother is more than happy with it.</li>
            <li>Nice satin bonnet</li>
            <li>I am transitioning out of hair weaves and into wearing my natural hair so a good bonnet that stays on and does move my style is great for that.</li>
            <li>Does what it says and it was very comfortable to sleep in...</li>
            <li>my hair was absolutely perfect the next morning!</li>
            <li>I already ordered 2 more, will continue to get.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not the sexiest, but if your honey has a fetish for French Pastry chefs perhaps you can pull something off, lol!</li>
            <li>I wore this at night hoping that my hair would be okay for easy styling in the morning.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also quite comfortable.</li>
            <li>When I first saw it I wanted to cry, but after trying it on I fell in love with the color because it brought out my skin</li>
            <li>wrapping my hair up with a scarf was not cutting it!</li>
            <li>After I put on my plastic shower cap for deep conditioning, I put this on top to help lock in the moisture even more.</li>
            <li>For me, it&#x27;s just nice to have finally found a bonnet that stays on my head while I sleep.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think it has an elastic band, but it has the right amount of \\&quot;give\\&quot; to hug your forehead...</li>
            <li>Very large.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BE AWARE:</li>
            <li>so I was amazed that the bonnet stayed on my head the first night.  </li>
            <li>I will be buying more but smaller ones.</li>
            <li>Does exactly what it&#x27;s suppose to do.</li>
            <li>It is not tight and its just comfortable.</li>
            <li>I bought other ones online just so that I&#x27;ll have them handy to switch out.  </li>
            <li>So I&#x27;m very disappointed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>And it really stays on all night.</li>
            <li>This bonnet is better than expected.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t really wrap my hair anymore</li>
            <li>, It&#x27;s not  really snug enough to secure a wrap, but you could always get a mesh wrap with the velco and use this over it to cover the top of your hair.</li>
            <li>This is much gentler on my hair style.</li>
            <li>The bonnet has conditioner in it and made her hair very soft.</li>
            <li>I will be buying another one but in the regular size so that my natural hair will lay down better with my extensions&lt;</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t feel like I have a large head; my dress maker&#x27;s tape shows a head circumference of a little under 23 inches, for what it&#x27;s worth.</li>
            <li>Stay On Satin (Extra Large) /</li>
            <li>but I made the mistake of getting the extra large one.</li>
            <li>I would recommend it for natural or chemically processed hair.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m not sure if the \\&quot;conditioner\\&quot; part really means much.  </li>
            <li>I am an AA female and I have been natural for almost two years (no chemicals, dyes, or relaxers).</li>
            <li>so my natural hair sometimes is not completely layed in place)</li>
            <li>On a positive note, it wasn&#x27;t too tight.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t speak to the anti-breakage conditioner, but I base my hair and scalp with JBCO (Jamaican Black Cator Oil), Jojoba oil, and Almond oil at night (experimenting with stuff) and it absorbs everything pretty well and best of all prevents face leakage (when the oil makes it&#x27;s way down your hair edges), thus preventing breakout!</li>

            <li> I have natural hair and finally discovered that my edges would not grow due to to the friction caused by rubbing my hair on the pillowcase while sleeping.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> bought this to wear at night, but the \\&quot;extra large\\&quot; size is way too tight; I can barely get it on, and even then it&#x27;s insta-pinched-headache time.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m almost never in the hair section of a store simply because I&#x27;ve got my routine down.  </li>
            <li> but I did wear it one night and found it to be too tight and actually gave me a headache.</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;Maybe a little too big</li>
            <li> (I have a partial weave</li>
            <li> I sleep like a wild banchee and this little sucker hangs in there.</li>
            <li> this is so not worth your money.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t slide back or up, no more nights of broken sleep, because you feel it slipping off in the middle of the night and keep tugging at it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s been about a month and a half now.  </li>
            <li> it made me feel so uncomfortable that i would wake up in the middle of night from headaches and there would be a mark/line on my forehead the next day.  </li>
            <li> It kinda looks like a chef&#x27;s hat, but less mushroom shaped.</li>
            <li> and I typically use scarves.</li>
            <li> I received a black one, I was expecting the pictured item.</li>

            <li> I don&#x27;t like wearing black to bed.</li>
            <li> I like this bonnet but it is really tight.</li>
            <li> this was tooooooo tight for my head.</li>
            <li> However, as it stayed on, it&#x27;s not a huge deal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Also, the material is *very* thin and feels like a single cat scratch would tear it.</li>
            <li> and i have a very small head.  </li>
            <li> The base of the bonnet is soft and snug.</li>
            <li> I have a small head and the rim of it is uncomfortable and requires a lot of stretching.</li>
            <li> without having to wake up with those stupid lines across your head from regular scarves and elastic.</li>
            <li> Unable to say whether it helps with breakage</li>
            <li> The color that will be sent to you is random.</li>

            <li> Unable to say whether it helps with breakage but I did wear it one night and found it to be too tight and actually gave me a headache.</li>
            <li> I wore this at night hoping that my hair would be okay for easy styling in the morning.  The cap was too big for my head and I did not feel like it kept my hair in place.</li>
            <li> I have curly hair &amp; I wear one every night. They stay on while sleeping; I love them!! Great product. :-]</li>
            <li> Stay On Satin (Extra Large) / B007I5256C&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought this to wear at night, but the \\&quot;extra large\\&quot; size is way too tight; I can barely get it on, and even then it&#x27;s insta-pinched-headache time. I don&#x27;t feel like I have a large head; my dress maker&#x27;s tape shows a head circumference of a little under 23 inches, for what it&#x27;s worth. Also, the material is *very* thin and feels like a single cat scratch would tear it. So I&#x27;m very disappointed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;~ Ana Mardoll</li>
            <li> Does what it says and it was very comfortable to sleep in...my hair was absolutely perfect the next morning! I am a fan!</li>
            <li> Is great for my hair!</li>
            <li> I am a AA women, I bought this because I have been having problems with my satin scarf staying on. I will be buying another one but in the regular size so that my natural hair will lay down better with my extensions&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BE AWARE: The color that will be sent to you is random. In my case I got the brown color -.- When I first saw it I wanted to cry, but after trying it on I fell in love with the color because it brought out my skin tone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PROS&lt;br /&gt;Fast delivery (though I am an Amazon Prime member)&lt;br /&gt;Great Material&lt;br /&gt;Stays on all night&lt;br /&gt;Smells great&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS&lt;br /&gt;Maybe a little too big (I have a partial weave so my natural hair sometimes is not completely layed in place)</li>
            <li> awesome bonnet. My daughter has it for 2 weeks now and it has not fallen off during sleep. wish i would have invested in this years ago.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m almost never in the hair section of a store simply because I&#x27;ve got my routine down.  However, one night I decided to browse around in a local drugstore and saw this product.  I&#x27;d been saying that I needed to get satin pillowcases for a couple of years now because scarves simply don&#x27;t stay on my head when I sleep.  I figured why not try this to protect my fragile hair?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m a restless sleeper so I was amazed that the bonnet stayed on my head the first night.  I tried it again and it was there the next morning.  It&#x27;s been about a month and a half now.  It still stays on! It&#x27;s also quite comfortable. I bought other ones online just so that I&#x27;ll have them handy to switch out.  I used a different one on a trip recently and that stayed on too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just a word of warning though.  I&#x27;m not sure if the sizes are consistent.  I bought the same size for the replacement ones, but for the one I used when I traveled it seemed a bit looser.  However, as it stayed on, it&#x27;s not a huge deal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not sure if the \\&quot;conditioner\\&quot; part really means much.  Plus, even if there is product in the bonnet, it&#x27;s going to wear off eventually.  For me, it&#x27;s just nice to have finally found a bonnet that stays on my head while I sleep.</li>
            <li> Nice satin bonnet but I made the mistake of getting the extra large one. I found a way to use it though. After I put on my plastic shower cap for deep conditioning, I put this on top to help lock in the moisture even more. Works great. I will be buying more but smaller ones.</li>
            <li> I like this bonnet but it is really tight. I have a small head and the rim of it is uncomfortable and requires a lot of stretching.</li>
            <li> Does exactly what it&#x27;s suppose to do. And it really stays on all night.</li>
            <li> I have natural hair and finally discovered that my edges would not grow due to to the friction caused by rubbing my hair on the pillowcase while sleeping.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just wrapping my hair up with a scarf was not cutting it! It would slide back and leave my edges exposed...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;THIS STAY ON SATIN BONNET stays put! and since purchasing it 2 months ago my edges have grown 1 inch.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;for the PRICE this is a MUST HAVE for all naturals esp those trying to grow their hair out</li>
            <li> this was tooooooo tight for my head. and i have a very small head.  it made me feel so uncomfortable that i would wake up in the middle of night from headaches and there would be a mark/line on my forehead the next day.  this is so not worth your money.</li>
            <li> Very large.  I already ordered 2 more, will continue to get.</li>
            <li> This bonnet is better than expected. My mother is more than happy with it. The bonnet has conditioner in it and made her hair very soft. It was delivered on time.</li>
            <li> I am an AA female and I have been natural for almost two years (no chemicals, dyes, or relaxers). I don&#x27;t really wrap my hair anymore so I didn&#x27;t see the need for a bonnet, but now that I have become an hair oil junkie, I needed something to protect my hair at night. This product works well. It&#x27;s not the sexiest, but if your honey has a fetish for French Pastry chefs perhaps you can pull something off, lol! The base of the bonnet is soft and snug. I don&#x27;t think it has an elastic band, but it has the right amount of \\&quot;give\\&quot; to hug your forehead...without having to wake up with those stupid lines across your head from regular scarves and elastic. It kinda looks like a chef&#x27;s hat, but less mushroom shaped. The best part is that it STAYS ON! I sleep like a wild banchee and this little sucker hangs in there. It doesn&#x27;t slide back or up, no more nights of broken sleep, because you feel it slipping off in the middle of the night and keep tugging at it. If you have relaxed hair this is best for set styles (roller sets, twist sets, etc.), It&#x27;s not  really snug enough to secure a wrap, but you could always get a mesh wrap with the velco and use this over it to cover the top of your hair. I can&#x27;t speak to the anti-breakage conditioner, but I base my hair and scalp with JBCO (Jamaican Black Cator Oil), Jojoba oil, and Almond oil at night (experimenting with stuff) and it absorbs everything pretty well and best of all prevents face leakage (when the oil makes it&#x27;s way down your hair edges), thus preventing breakout! Buy it!</li>
            <li> This bonnet works well. It smells great and stayed on all night. I have never owned a bonnet before and I typically use scarves. This is much gentler on my hair style. I am transitioning out of hair weaves and into wearing my natural hair so a good bonnet that stays on and does move my style is great for that. I would recommend it for natural or chemically processed hair.</li>
            <li> I received a black one, I was expecting the pictured item. Black is not even close. I don&#x27;t like wearing black to bed. In addition I haven&#x27;t noticed any improvement to my hair. On a positive note, it wasn&#x27;t too tight.</li>
            <li> This is one of the BEST satin hair bonnets, it does not come off during the night and it also fits my 5 year olds head without coming off during the night. It is not tight and its just comfortable.</li>
