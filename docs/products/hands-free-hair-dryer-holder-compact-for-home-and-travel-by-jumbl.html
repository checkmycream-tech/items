    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>I find that my travel sized hairdryer works best in this.</li>
            <li>excellent product.</li>
            <li>I suggest dampening the suction cups for the best grip, and for me, the product never moved or slipped.  </li>
            <li>Pressed on to my mirror and it holds my blow dryer perfectly</li>
            <li>I am a happy camper!  </li>
            <li>very good for its use..made hair drying process so easy..loving it..</li>
            <li>I suctioned this to my bathroom mirror and it worked great.  </li>
            <li>great price.  </li>
            <li>It is a great product.  </li>
            <li>This is a great help in drying and styling my hair since arthritis severely limits the range of motion in my shoulders.</li>
            <li>The product is great.  </li>
            <li>It works great.  </li>
            <li>This comes in very handy.</li>
            <li>I used a fairly lightweight travel-sized blower (Baby Liss)&lt;br /&gt;which</li>
            <li>I ordered this item because I didn&#x27;t want to pay $40 for the \\&quot;as seen on tv\\&quot; extendable arm that holds your hair dryer up, and I&#x27;m VERY glad I followed my gut.</li>
            <li>I am very pleased.</li>
            <li>This is an amazing product.</li>
            <li>Surprisingly it works more often than not, but the cups seem to come off the mirror/wall a lot and have to be restuck.&lt;br /&gt;Update</li>
            <li>Very strong hold-</li>
            <li>Next best thing to being able to use both arms!</li>
            <li>This has been a huge help to me!</li>
            <li>A HUGE YES from me!</li>
            <li>I hope the seller would notice this review and offer more..</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure if I had two arms, the adjustment would be easier, but if I had two arms I wouldn&#x27;t need this device.</li>
            <li>She never travels anywhere without it and the extra hand is priceless</li>
            <li>This one is way better, because I can move it from place to place, without taking counter space.  </li>
            <li>Ingenious product.</li>
            <li>i ordered 2 more for my sisters.</li>
            <li>Its perfect to blow out my hair to give it a salon look without the hassle of trying to hold the hair dryer at the same time.</li>
            <li>I love this thing because I am hair-styling impaired.  </li>
            <li>LOVE THIS PRODUCT - Arrived as scheduled,</li>
            <li>I stick it up on my mirror after showering  but am planning on attaching it to my wall if they ever get more in stock.</li>
            <li>Please put more in stock!I</li>
            <li>I thought this would be better as it is out of the way</li>
            <li>I cannot raise one of my arms to the top of my head.</li>
            <li>it makes life so easy:)</li>
            <li>I know I will be installing this in 3 more of my bath rooms, as soon as they become available.</li>
            <li>Best $10 bucks spent.</li>
            <li>This way, your dryer can be rotated around its vertical axis - so that you can easy adjust to your preference of distance from the wall etc..</li>
            <li>Easy to install, just not what i thought.</li>
            <li>It mounted easily and works fine</li>
            <li>I have found that it is best to take holder down between uses (I attach it to the mirror).  </li>
            <li>Suction will not work on a porous surface but did fine on a mirror or glass shower door.</li>
            <li>Perfect for my needs and little time.</li>
            <li>This products is cheap in every way</li>
            <li>This helps free them up.</li>
            <li>did precisely what it was supposed to, despite some of the&lt;br /&gt;troublesome</li>
            <li>It leaves both hands free to do your hear.</li>
            <li>I wish I had purchased this years ago, as it makes styling my below shoulder length hair super easy.</li>
            <li>Now after recovery, I still use this when I want a great looking salon style blow-out of my long hair.  </li>
            <li>It works ok as a holder, but not so much as a hands-free styler.  </li>
            <li>This hands free hair dryer is so useful</li>
            <li>Did internet search thinking someone had to create something like this for the &amp;#34;handicapped&amp;#34; and was pleased to find something portable and reasonably priced.  </li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m able to maneuver in front of it to do a decent job of my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Quick delivery</li>
            <li>This is by far the best $10 I&#x27;ve ever spent.</li>
            <li>This is also great for someone missing an arm or someone who does not have full use of both arms.</li>
            <li>I think the product is  fine, but I guess I didn&#x27;t really think it out.  </li>
            <li>worth every penny</li>
            <li>Simple and effective -</li>
            <li>but hey, totally worth for money..</li>
            <li>I discovered I could not use my hairblower because I could not lift my right arm.  </li>
            <li>hold it right up there on my mirror.  </li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t believe how easy it is to style my hair with my new hair dryer holder.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s been stuck to our mirror for 2 months and it holds a normal size hair dryer just fine.</li>
            <li>Beyond that, it&#x27;s a pretty nifty item and worth the $15 bucks.</li>
            <li>This simple, inexpensive little gadget was perfect for travel.&lt;br /&gt;It</li>
            <li>I bought this holder and it has really made drying and brushing my hair at the same time super easy!  </li>
            <li>Sometimes it would be nice if it held the blower straight out, but it&#x27;s a minor gripe.</li>
            <li>your head all around...to hit the hot air.  </li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m pretty cleaver and figure out ways to support it</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s exactly what we needed.</li>
            <li>We mounted it to the wall and it has made drying my hair so much easier!</li>
            <li>I searched all over the net for a hands free dryer holder and this one was exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li>It works great except that the pivoting mechanism is too weak to hold up a full-sized dryer.</li>
            <li>It works very well</li>
            <li>I have a stand for my hair dryer as well, and it was just so cluttery in my house taking up too much room.  </li>
            <li>Still this one is much handier</li>
            <li>It really did the trick.</li>
            <li>When it arrived, I looked at it and  really didn&#x27;t expect it to work that</li>
            <li>so I can&#x27;t say much.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li>I could never use a roll brush and dry my hair very easily at the same time.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;d highly recommend it for anyone with arm mobility problems.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>I tried sticking it to the tile (like in the photo) on my vanity top for a lateral angle, but not even 1 little suction cup would do anything but slide all over.  </li>
            <li>Well worth the low price!!!</li>
            <li>you gotta put it on the wall right next to your head and move all around.  </li>
            <li>My dryer tends to lean to the left or right</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ll use it in the new house.</li>
            <li>After several months the top suction cup finally popped off the mirror, but I just pushed it back.  </li>
            <li>It held my dryer (the same type as in the photo) and made it easy to dry my hair.  </li>
            <li>It will not hold a heavy dryer, but worked fine with a travel dryer.</li>
            <li>plus, you can&#x27;t mount it on the mirror because with the vanity there, its too far away.  </li>
            <li>It stuck fast to several mirrors</li>
            <li>I ended up purchasing a new smaller diameter dryer to work with a $10 product.</li>
            <li>You would need to mount it right that head level, but i didnt like how much less control i had.</li>
            <li>I have a bad shoulder and this is great for traveling.</li>
            <li>By the time I am done my hair is dry and ready for final styling touch ups.</li>
            <li>This little gadget does exactly what it was made for, hold my dryer.  </li>
            <li>Had a little problem setting it up but doesn&#x27;t hold my hair blower exactly in place</li>
            <li>I really like this little helper and bought a second one for a friend.</li>

            <li> Had a little problem setting it up but doesn&#x27;t hold my hair blower exactly in place</li>
            <li> I really like this little helper and bought a second one for a friend.</li>
            <li> It is definitely worth the few dollars I spent on it.</li>
            <li> &amp; I don&#x27;t know of anyone who just holds a blowdryer straight down to dry their hair.</li>
            <li> I  would HIGHLY recommend this product to anyone who is uncoordinated like me and can&#x27;t round brush their hair.</li>
            <li> It holds to the mirror really well with a small travel size dryer.</li>
            <li> I had to use extra long screws.</li>
            <li> I had hand surgery and needed something help me dry my hair using only one hand.  </li>
            <li> so I can only dry hair one handed.</li>
            <li> This simple little holder was a lifesaver for my thin, fine hair.  </li>
            <li> I still use my stand one from time to time, because sometimes I want to say sit at my computer and dry my hair and there is no mirror or tile to stick this to.  </li>
            <li> and it did not even move during the 40 minutes it takes me to dry my hair.  </li>
            <li> I had elbow surgery and couldn&#x27;t blow dry my hair.  </li>
            <li> It can only be used down as shown in the photo</li>
            <li> My blow dryer only fits in the holder pointed down.</li>
            <li> It takes a little getting used to as you move your head and brush instead of the dryer, but that only takes one or two uses.</li>
            <li> I just stuck it on mirror, inserted you hairblower, and I could then use my round brush with my left hand while drying.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not leaving the house with wet hair in subzero weather.</li>
            <li> but it did not fit my current dryer.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s absolutely no chance of using any other angle.</li>
            <li> Not sure if it could hold a bigger dryer.</li>
            <li> I had an inferior one before that was always falling, usually in the middle of the night, waking us.  </li>
            <li> With this, I can work with my round brush using two hands, so my relatively long hair doesn&#x27;t get tangled up.  </li>

            <li> Doest hold my hair dryer at all no matter how I try to get it in.  Would return but not worth the time or money.  Don&#x27;t waste your money. Get the handless hairdryer stand they work!</li>
            <li> Works but nut doesn&#x27;t hold</li>
            <li> broke my arm and went on vacation so this little gadget hellped a lot. It will not hold a heavy dryer, but worked fine with a travel dryer.Suction will not work on a porous surface but did fine on a mirror or glass shower door.</li>
            <li> not strong enought to hold my hair dryer :(</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t stick to the wall.</li>
            <li> I really like this little helper and bought a second one for a friend. I find that my travel sized hairdryer works best in this.</li>
            <li> It works great except that the pivoting mechanism is too weak to hold up a full-sized dryer. I solved this problem by grabbing a washcloth and wedging it beneath the unit&#x27;s arm when I need it to not point downward. I permanently mounted it onto drywall with the hardware that was enclosed, so the unit is not in danger of falling off the wall. It&#x27;s been a life-saver and has made drying my hair almost pleasurable in the morning. It is definitely worth the few dollars I spent on it.</li>
            <li> I had hand surgery and needed something help me dry my hair using only one hand.  I suctioned this to my bathroom mirror and it worked great.  Very strong hold-it never fell or slipped.</li>
            <li> Works great,gave me my independence back.</li>
            <li> The pictures/description did not indicate that it can be wall mounted. I mounted it on the wall with screws (I found a wall stud for one screw location) and it is excellent.&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t mount it vertically. You should mount it, with the slot at a 45 degree angle and not perpendicular. This way, your dryer can be rotated around its vertical axis - so that you can easy adjust to your preference of distance from the wall etc..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is unfortunate, that this product is currently unavailable. I hope the seller would notice this review and offer more.. I know I will be installing this in 3 more of my bath rooms, as soon as they become available.</li>
            <li> It works very well and I use it everyday!</li>
            <li> I had shoulder surgery and could not do my hair one handed. This little device was a Godsend. It&#x27;s simple, adheres to the mirror and I&#x27;m able to maneuver in front of it to do a decent job of my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I gave it four stars because the little nut that tightens the angle is difficult to turn and doesn&#x27;t stay tight. I&#x27;m sure if I had two arms, the adjustment would be easier, but if I had two arms I wouldn&#x27;t need this device. So consequently, I leave it in the down position and just move around underneath it. Sometimes it would be nice if it held the blower straight out, but it&#x27;s a minor gripe.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my now fiance and she loves it.  She never travels anywhere without it and the extra hand is priceless</li>
            <li> Best $10 bucks spent. Put in on my mirror. Salon looking blowouts in minutes.  Why didn&#x27;t I get this sooner?</li>
            <li> I have a stand for my hair dryer as well, and it was just so cluttery in my house taking up too much room.  This one is way better, because I can move it from place to place, without taking counter space.  I still use my stand one from time to time, because sometimes I want to say sit at my computer and dry my hair and there is no mirror or tile to stick this to.  Still this one is much handier and I&#x27;d get this over the stand any day.</li>
            <li> It works ok as a holder, but not so much as a hands-free styler.  Suction cups stick to glass but slide down when you put your hair dryer in it.  I ended up screwing it to the wall, which was difficult because I could not remove the suction cups. I had to use extra long screws.</li>
            <li> Ingenious product. Simple and convenient. I glued it to my mirror and stayed there. No more trouble holding the dryer on one hand and brushing my hair with the other one! worth every penny</li>
            <li> While recovering from a shoulder injury, I purchased this to help get to the areas of my head that I couldn&#x27;t reach. It really did the trick. I&#x27;d highly recommend it for anyone with arm mobility problems.</li>
            <li> Simple and effective - After I had shoulder surgery I discovered I could not use my hairblower because I could not lift my right arm.  This simple little holder was a lifesaver for my thin, fine hair.  I just stuck it on mirror, inserted you hairblower, and I could then use my round brush with my left hand while drying.  When I can use both arms again, I will move it from the mirror to the wall to use as a holder to keep it off the countertop.  Well worth the low price!!!</li>
            <li> I have a bad shoulder and this is great for traveling. It holds to the mirror really well with a small travel size dryer. Not sure if it could hold a bigger dryer. excellent product. Quick delivery</li>
            <li> This products is cheap in every way and I can&#x27;t use it because it can hardly hold up any hair dryer to let you use it</li>
            <li> I think the product is  fine, but I guess I didn&#x27;t really think it out.  It is stationary, so if the dryer isn&#x27;t moving, you are moving...your head all around...to hit the hot air.  plus, you can&#x27;t mount it on the mirror because with the vanity there, its too far away.  you gotta put it on the wall right next to your head and move all around.  I guess I thought I could put on my face while blow drying, but that&#x27;s not the case at all.</li>
            <li> This hands free hair dryer is so useful i ordered 2 more for my sisters. Its perfect to blow out my hair to give it a salon look without the hassle of trying to hold the hair dryer at the same time. I am grateful this was invented it makes life so easy:)</li>
            <li> This holder does hold a blowdryer but only in the downward position shown in the photo. The description says it can be adjusted up &amp; down but that&#x27;s not accurate. It can only be used down as shown in the photo &amp; I don&#x27;t know of anyone who just holds a blowdryer straight down to dry their hair. My blow dryer only fits in the holder pointed down. If I rotate it up, the blow dryer is stopped by the wall holding the holder. There&#x27;s absolutely no chance of using any other angle. I tried sticking it to the tile (like in the photo) on my vanity top for a lateral angle, but not even 1 little suction cup would do anything but slide all over.  I guess holes have to be drilled through the tile to use it like in the photo. That wouldn&#x27;t solve the rotation limitation problem. DIsapppointed!&lt;br /&gt;DID arrive packed well &amp; on time.</li>
            <li> This was a lifesaver for me.  I broke my wrist and not drying my hair is never an option!  This is one of those products that is simple but genius.  I suggest dampening the suction cups for the best grip, and for me, the product never moved or slipped.  It held my dryer (the same type as in the photo) and made it easy to dry my hair.  Enough said.  I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Junk.  I returned because it wouldn&#x27;t hold the weight of the hair dryer.</li>
            <li> This little gadget does exactly what it was made for, hold my dryer.  I had an inferior one before that was always falling, usually in the middle of the night, waking us.  As I am disabled, I need my rest &amp; I need something to hold my dryer.  This works so well, I got one for my mother, too.</li>
            <li> Surprisingly it works more often than not, but the cups seem to come off the mirror/wall a lot and have to be restuck.&lt;br /&gt;Update ; I had to take it down as it came down all too often :(. It didn&#x27;t hold for any reason that I can fathom :( !!!</li>
            <li> When it arrived, I looked at it and  really didn&#x27;t expect it to work that well.  I was WRONG.  I have a heavy, full-size, ionizing hairdryer, and the suction cups on this gizmo hold it right up there on my mirror.  There&#x27;s an adjustable angle wing nut and bolt that make it possible to adjust the angle of the dryer.  You may need a screwdriver to hold onto the bolt while you turn the wing nut to tighten it enough to hold your drier at the proper position.  No buggy, but be prepared.  I love this thing because I am hair-styling impaired.  With this, I can work with my round brush using two hands, so my relatively long hair doesn&#x27;t get tangled up.  For me, it was a well-spent $10.00.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used it yet so I can&#x27;t say much.  I&#x27;m waiting till we move and I&#x27;ll use it in the new house.</li>
            <li> LOVE THIS PRODUCT - Arrived as scheduled, great price.  I mounted it on the mirror and it did not even move during the 40 minutes it takes me to dry my hair.  It is a great product.  I can&#x27;t believe how easy it is to style my hair with my new hair dryer holder.  I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I was born with one hand. This product has been a godsend. I&#x27;m not leaving the house with wet hair in subzero weather.</li>
            <li> This comes in very handy. I have a hard time using both hands to round brush my hair. This helps free them up. Just remember to remove the hair dryer after using it. I forgot and it hit the floor in the middle of the night. Scared me to death!</li>
            <li> This simple, inexpensive little gadget was perfect for travel.&lt;br /&gt;It did precisely what it was supposed to, despite some of the&lt;br /&gt;troublesome negative reviews.  It stuck fast to several mirrors&lt;br /&gt;over the course of my trip and enabled me to style my hair&lt;br /&gt;easily.  I used a fairly lightweight travel-sized blower (Baby Liss)&lt;br /&gt;which it supported with ease.</li>
            <li> This product works well for me.  I have found that it is best to take holder down between uses (I attach it to the mirror).  It also comes with screws and anchors so that it can be attached to the wall.</li>
            <li> it does what it is suppose to.</li>
            <li> I have a disability so I can only dry hair one handed.I searched all over the net for a hands free dryer holder and this one was exactly what I was looking for.I stick it up on my mirror after showering  but am planning on attaching it to my wall if they ever get more in stock.Please put more in stock!I need another one to take with me on vacation!</li>
            <li> Works so well. I have it attached to the mirror while I apply makeup. By the time I am done my hair is dry and ready for final styling touch ups. Perfect for my needs and little time.</li>
            <li> Seems like it would work well enough with my larger hairdryer but when I put it up with the suction cups, it came down immediately. Couldn&#x27;t use it. Needed it for post surgery assistance.</li>
            <li> It holds my blow dryer but not as upright and sturdy as needed. My dryer tends to lean to the left or right and I have to constantly adjust it but I&#x27;m pretty cleaver and figure out ways to support it so I&#x27;ll keep it.</li>
            <li> Had a little problem setting it up but doesn&#x27;t hold my hair blower exactly in place</li>
            <li> Easy to install, just not what i thought. You would need to mount it right that head level, but i didnt like how much less control i had. I&#x27;ll stick to taping my dryer to my counter.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s been stuck to our mirror for 2 months and it holds a normal size hair dryer just fine. It&#x27;s exactly what we needed.</li>
            <li> I ordered this item because I didn&#x27;t want to pay $40 for the \\&quot;as seen on tv\\&quot; extendable arm that holds your hair dryer up, and I&#x27;m VERY glad I followed my gut. I suctioned this to my bathroom mirror, and now styling my hair is a breeze. I  would HIGHLY recommend this product to anyone who is uncoordinated like me and can&#x27;t round brush their hair. This is by far the best $10 I&#x27;ve ever spent.</li>
            <li> This is a great help in drying and styling my hair since arthritis severely limits the range of motion in my shoulders. It takes a little getting used to as you move your head and brush instead of the dryer, but that only takes one or two uses.</li>
            <li> I could never use a roll brush and dry my hair very easily at the same time.  I am a smaller frame and I have this issue with using any brush and dryer.  I bought this holder and it has really made drying and brushing my hair at the same time super easy!  It won&#x27;t fall off AT ALL!  I have mine stuck to a mirror in the hallway of my home.  I take the cord and plug it into the bathroom during use, then store it on the hook with the dryer.  I don&#x27;t even take the dryer down.  After several months the top suction cup finally popped off the mirror, but I just pushed it back.  It isn&#x27;t going anywhere.  I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> The product is great.  I had elbow surgery and couldn&#x27;t blow dry my hair.  Did internet search thinking someone had to create something like this for the &amp;#34;handicapped&amp;#34; and was pleased to find something portable and reasonably priced.  It works great.  Pressed on to my mirror and it holds my blow dryer perfectly and I can remove it after I am done.  Whoohoo!  I am a happy camper!  I can now style my hair with one hand.</li>
            <li> I had ordered this product before and accidently ordered a smaller version of the one I wanted.  It mounted easily and works fine even tho I would prefer a stronger drying force.</li>
            <li> very good for its use..made hair drying process so easy..loving it..the only problem is you cant adjust the height but hey, totally worth for money..</li>
            <li> I had one before that was a stand on the counter - it worked well for me as I have arthritis and also need a daily blow out. I thought this would be better as it is out of the way but it did not fit my current dryer. I ended up purchasing a new smaller diameter dryer to work with a $10 product.</li>
            <li> This is an amazing product. It leaves both hands free to do your hear. I have my on my mirror and it has not fallen off in the 2 months I have had this product. I am very pleased. This is also great for someone missing an arm or someone who does not have full use of both arms.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t bla the company but this item does not work. It falls off with the suction cups and can cause issues. Save your money.</li>
            <li> This has been a huge help to me! I cannot raise one of my arms to the top of my head. We mounted it to the wall and it has made drying my hair so much easier! Next best thing to being able to use both arms! A HUGE YES from me! Give it a try!</li>
            <li> I would&#x27;ve given this 5 stars if not for the design flaw.  If you mount with screws (which btw, mine did not come with, and should have), you must pull off one suction cup rendering it useless for future suction cupping.  Beyond that, it&#x27;s a pretty nifty item and worth the $15 bucks.</li>
            <li> Purchased this for during my recovery from shoulder surgery.  We used the anchors and screws to permanently attach this to the wall.  Now after recovery, I still use this when I want a great looking salon style blow-out of my long hair.  I wish I had purchased this years ago, as it makes styling my below shoulder length hair super easy.</li>
