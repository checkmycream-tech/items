            <li>smell, I don&#x27;t like using things that smell to strong ot smell like medicine</li>
            <li>It does make the fine lines softer and tightens up my pores.  </li>

            <li>The product goes on smoothly and is quickly absorbed into the skin.</li>
            <li>Love my soft glowing skin!!!</li>
            <li>I does have a light smell - not unpleasant - which disappears right after applying.</li>
            <li>I was also amazed at how quickly my order arrived.  </li>
            <li>For the price its seems to work super</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only used it for about 2 weeks now, but it has a nice light scent, and just two drops cover my face and neck.</li>
            <li>It is absorbed quickly and doesn&#x27;t leave any greasy residue.</li>
            <li>I have noticed a difference in the fine lines around my eyes and mouth and my skin feels much smoother</li>
            <li>I had heard about Vit. C serum from mother in law after I noticed her skin looked so fresh.  </li>
            <li>Wow I love this vitamin c serum, I been using it for a week already</li>
            <li>This product is definitely worth your money.</li>
            <li>sinks right in without leaving a film and feels good.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m looking for the right medicine which can help migraine for years.</li>
            <li>Easy to use, just few drops twice a day can give your skin a healthy and smooth texture.</li>
            <li>This is a nice formula that is easy to apply to the skin, but does not feel heavy.  </li>
            <li>I have only been using it for a week, but so far so good.</li>
            <li>As a single mom I can&#x27;t tell you how thrilled I am to find something that works</li>
            <li>Received order very fast, I have been using it for a week now</li>
            <li>It absorbs into the skin to make it feel soft and smooth.  </li>
            <li>I used it 2 times a day and it leaves my skin smooth and soft.  </li>
            <li>FEEL IT MEETS HIGHER THAN MY EXPECTATIONS &amp; I</li>
            <li>I tried this serum again a week or so later after a derma roller and my face had a better reaction.  </li>
            <li>and I have seen a very noticeable reduction in the lines around my eyes!</li>
            <li>My skin tone is lovely and even, my skin is plump, and my pores appear smaller.</li>
            <li>Probably it&#x27;s a good one for somebody with usual headache, but not for migraine.</li>
            <li>The dropper makes it easy to dispense only the amount you need.  </li>
            <li>Natural, not sticky and absorbs quickly.  </li>
            <li>It has a nice hydrating effect for my very dry and sensitive skin!  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this for a few weeks now, and have gotten many complements on my skin!  </li>
            <li>love my vitamin c serum really helps with the dry weather..</li>
            <li>I really like this Vitamin C serum.</li>
            <li>If it burns too much start with a lower percentage, 5%, and then work your way up.</li>
            <li>I really like this product.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t really have a lot of wrinkles</li>
            <li>Too soon to really tell if it&#x27;s making a difference.</li>
            <li>and I can feel the difference even when I put my makeup, thanks</li>
            <li>I really like this product.</li>
            <li>it seems to be doing very well.</li>
            <li>Love natural facial products.</li>
            <li>This serum is thicker than other serums I have used... more like a lotion.  </li>
            <li>Sunscreen or other products can go on top.  </li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t  used it long enough  for it to have any kind of effect, but  </li>
            <li>It comes in a nice amber bottle that seals tightly, I would recommend keeping it in the fridge or somewhere cool and dark to make sure it lasts as long as it can.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not a bad feeling, but different than a face cream feeling.</li>
            <li>Absorbed well after application and made my face feel smooth and tight almost immediately.</li>
            <li>It has no strong odors and is weightless and very easy to apply.</li>
            <li>Although i am certain it is too soon so see improvement, my yoga teacher actually commented on how fresh my complexion looked and asked what i was doing?  </li>
            <li>THIS PRODUCT GAVE ME NEW HOPEFUL RESULTS!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this for about a week and a half now, and I love it.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this .  </li>
            <li>Highly recommended for anyone who wants a natural supplement.</li>
            <li>the price is very reasonable---i was surprised at the thickness...</li>
            <li>I have use your products for a few months, great products, my skin looks and feels younger; you look younger than your siblings</li>
            <li>to feel that my face skin was dry in my checks,not smooth and not clear with my nose was very oily,this really affected on me.</li>
            <li>The small fine lines are smaller and it is even helping with those pesky squinting forehead lines and the laugh lines!  </li>
            <li>Love the way it makes my face feel, it&#x27;s so soft yet firm.</li>
            <li>I have tried other Vitamin C products and was not crazy about them, but I really like this!&lt;br</li>
            <li>and I been Liking it so far!</li>
            <li>Love this product, using it only a few days and can see so much difference in my skin tone and texture.</li>
            <li>haven&#x27;t been using long enough to see any results on the fine lines issue that I have yet</li>
            <li>My skin is considerably smoother with less fine lines.</li>
            <li>There are no adverse reactions and since this uses a more stable,gentler vitamin C derivative , there is no waiting time for the active to sink in and it will not oxidize as fast as other serums.</li>
            <li>so I tried this stuff out and my acne is all clear now.</li>
            <li>I like the fact that it is not heavy feeling.  </li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin and this serum</li>
            <li>and it makes my face really soft</li>
            <li>but so far haven&#x27;t noticed a difference.</li>
            <li>I just started using this product so I cannot give a long term review of it ; however, so far, my skin is taking to it very well.</li>
            <li>It burn a little, but subsided really quickly</li>
            <li>I was a little iffy when I first bought it but am now a return customer!</li>
            <li>Goes on smooth and a little goes a long way.  </li>
            <li>well, my face seems brighter in general after use and hasn&#x27;t had any averse affects on me as of yet.</li>
            <li>Love the feel, smell and the way it soothes my tired skin.  </li>
            <li>Love it non irritating</li>
            <li>I had a patch of super dry skin on my elbow, decided to put this serum on it, and in 3 days the rough patch was gone!</li>
            <li>However, I am pregnant and my skin may be acting differently than normal and so it&#x27;s hard to tell.</li>

            <li> In my opinion,after trying many vitamin C serums(some</li>
            <li> I love this serum.  </li>
            <li> I later learned that I shouldn&#x27;t have used it after a microdermabrasion and that it is also best to start with a lessor percentage and then work my way up.  </li>
            <li> and I was actually able to handle the 20%.  </li>
            <li> I love it.</li>

            <li> Love this stuff... cleaning up my sun damage:)</li>
            <li> If anything, it looks like it&#x27;s dying my skin out and giving me more wrinkles.</li>

            <li> So far i am happy with this purchase.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>

            <li> It is easy to use and it does well under my foundation for all day use.</li>
            <li> It wasn&#x27;t too strong a formula that it would make your break out or get irritated.</li>
            <li> smell, I don&#x27;t like using things that smell to strong ot smell like medicine</li>
            <li> It does make the fine lines softer and tightens up my pores.  </li>
            <li> I NOTICED A DIFFERENCE IN MY FINE LINES, WRINKLES, AND DEVELOPING CROWS FEET</li>
            <li> Have noticed a difference in fine lines and wrinkles.</li>

            <li> It doesn&#x27;t leave any stickiness on my face, which is important to me.</li>

            <li> It goes on smoothly and doesn&#x27;t leave a sticky residue like some do.</li>
            <li> Smooth transaction too.</li>

            <li> My skin is feeling great so far and believe it will only get better!</li>
            <li> worth every penny!</li>
            <li> BUT NOW I&#x27;M HAPPY whenever I touch my face with my hand and feel it softer and whenever I look at the mirror and see my face more clear and more bright and less oily,my face began to live again.&lt;br /&gt;by</li>
            <li> It goes on smoothly and dries quickly</li>
            <li> Love it, all purpose, fast shipping, will buy again</li>

            <li> The product goes on smoothly and is quickly absorbed into the skin.</li>
            <li> Love my soft glowing skin!!!</li>
            <li> I does have a light smell - not unpleasant - which disappears right after applying.</li>
            <li> I was also amazed at how quickly my order arrived.  </li>
            <li> For the price its seems to work super</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used it for about 2 weeks now, but it has a nice light scent, and just two drops cover my face and neck.</li>
            <li> It is absorbed quickly and doesn&#x27;t leave any greasy residue.</li>
            <li> I have noticed a difference in the fine lines around my eyes and mouth and my skin feels much smoother</li>
            <li> I had heard about Vit. C serum from mother in law after I noticed her skin looked so fresh.  </li>
            <li> Wow I love this vitamin c serum, I been using it for a week already</li>
            <li> This product is definitely worth your money.</li>
            <li> sinks right in without leaving a film and feels good.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m looking for the right medicine which can help migraine for years.</li>
            <li> Easy to use, just few drops twice a day can give your skin a healthy and smooth texture.</li>
            <li> This is a nice formula that is easy to apply to the skin, but does not feel heavy.  </li>
            <li> I have only been using it for a week, but so far so good.</li>
            <li> As a single mom I can&#x27;t tell you how thrilled I am to find something that works</li>
            <li> Received order very fast, I have been using it for a week now</li>
            <li> It absorbs into the skin to make it feel soft and smooth.  </li>
            <li> I used it 2 times a day and it leaves my skin smooth and soft.  </li>
            <li> FEEL IT MEETS HIGHER THAN MY EXPECTATIONS &amp; I</li>
            <li> I tried this serum again a week or so later after a derma roller and my face had a better reaction.  </li>
            <li> and I have seen a very noticeable reduction in the lines around my eyes!</li>
            <li> My skin tone is lovely and even, my skin is plump, and my pores appear smaller.</li>
            <li> Probably it&#x27;s a good one for somebody with usual headache, but not for migraine.</li>
            <li> The dropper makes it easy to dispense only the amount you need.  </li>
            <li> Natural, not sticky and absorbs quickly.  </li>
            <li> It has a nice hydrating effect for my very dry and sensitive skin!  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for a few weeks now, and have gotten many complements on my skin!  </li>
            <li> love my vitamin c serum really helps with the dry weather..</li>
            <li> I really like this Vitamin C serum.</li>
            <li> If it burns too much start with a lower percentage, 5%, and then work your way up.</li>
            <li> I really like this product.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really have a lot of wrinkles</li>
            <li> Too soon to really tell if it&#x27;s making a difference.</li>
            <li> and I can feel the difference even when I put my makeup, thanks</li>
            <li> I really like this product.</li>
            <li> it seems to be doing very well.</li>
            <li> Love natural facial products.</li>
            <li> This serum is thicker than other serums I have used... more like a lotion.  </li>
            <li> Sunscreen or other products can go on top.  </li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t  used it long enough  for it to have any kind of effect, but  </li>
            <li> It comes in a nice amber bottle that seals tightly, I would recommend keeping it in the fridge or somewhere cool and dark to make sure it lasts as long as it can.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not a bad feeling, but different than a face cream feeling.</li>
            <li> Absorbed well after application and made my face feel smooth and tight almost immediately.</li>
            <li> It has no strong odors and is weightless and very easy to apply.</li>
            <li> Although i am certain it is too soon so see improvement, my yoga teacher actually commented on how fresh my complexion looked and asked what i was doing?  </li>
            <li> THIS PRODUCT GAVE ME NEW HOPEFUL RESULTS!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for about a week and a half now, and I love it.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this .  </li>
            <li> Highly recommended for anyone who wants a natural supplement.</li>
            <li> the price is very reasonable---i was surprised at the thickness...</li>
            <li> I have use your products for a few months, great products, my skin looks and feels younger; you look younger than your siblings</li>
            <li> to feel that my face skin was dry in my checks,not smooth and not clear with my nose was very oily,this really affected on me.</li>
            <li> The small fine lines are smaller and it is even helping with those pesky squinting forehead lines and the laugh lines!  </li>
            <li> Love the way it makes my face feel, it&#x27;s so soft yet firm.</li>
            <li> I have tried other Vitamin C products and was not crazy about them, but I really like this!&lt;br</li>
            <li> and I been Liking it so far!</li>
            <li> Love this product, using it only a few days and can see so much difference in my skin tone and texture.</li>
            <li> haven&#x27;t been using long enough to see any results on the fine lines issue that I have yet</li>
            <li> My skin is considerably smoother with less fine lines.</li>
            <li> There are no adverse reactions and since this uses a more stable,gentler vitamin C derivative , there is no waiting time for the active to sink in and it will not oxidize as fast as other serums.</li>
            <li> so I tried this stuff out and my acne is all clear now.</li>
            <li> I like the fact that it is not heavy feeling.  </li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and this serum</li>
            <li> and it makes my face really soft</li>
            <li> but so far haven&#x27;t noticed a difference.</li>
            <li> I just started using this product so I cannot give a long term review of it ; however, so far, my skin is taking to it very well.</li>
            <li> It burn a little, but subsided really quickly</li>
            <li> I was a little iffy when I first bought it but am now a return customer!</li>
            <li> Goes on smooth and a little goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> well, my face seems brighter in general after use and hasn&#x27;t had any averse affects on me as of yet.</li>
            <li> Love the feel, smell and the way it soothes my tired skin.  </li>
            <li> Love it non irritating</li>
            <li> I had a patch of super dry skin on my elbow, decided to put this serum on it, and in 3 days the rough patch was gone!</li>
            <li> However, I am pregnant and my skin may be acting differently than normal and so it&#x27;s hard to tell.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used it long, but I can definitely feel (and see) a difference in my skin.</li>
            <li> It take a minute or so to dry and when it does I instantly get a tighter feeling to my skin.  </li>
            <li> I had oily and dry spots in different areas of my face, and this serum evened out my skin.</li>
            <li> face feels very soft after just a few days of use.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> look forward to the long term use and results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Plus</li>
            <li> IT IMPROVED MY SKINS PIGMENT AND ALSO HELPED WITH SOME MINOR DISCOLORATION SPOTS</li>
            <li> so far just getting to try the product for a few days</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say enough about it other than u have to try it and feel ,see the results for yourself.</li>
            <li> It burned a little, but I mixed it with calendula ointment to lesson the sting</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used it for a few days</li>
            <li> Helped with rough skin and wrinkles.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only been using this product for a few weeks, so can&#x27;t say that I&#x27;ve seen any changes to my skin yet.</li>
            <li> and I can tell a big difference in my complexion and my little wrinkles!</li>
            <li> the way the serum has a citrus scent which was high at the beginning and decreased after that and became light,I like it</li>
            <li> Bought 3 one for myself &amp; the other 2 for each one of my daughters....</li>
            <li> It has the recommended amount of vitamin C plus other ingredients I like.</li>
            <li> I BELIEVE IT WAS DUE TO THE VITAMIN C,</li>
            <li> I must say that I am a pretty skeptical shopper</li>
            <li> Have absolutely no complaints!</li>
            <li> Lightened a dark spot on my face.</li>
            <li> I wanted to use this because i have a dark spot about the size of a dime on my face and after using this Vitamin C i can tell that it is getting lighter after 4 weeks.</li>
            <li> but I will give things a try which can be a like, love, or hate relationship.  </li>
            <li> No more rough places on my skin.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t break me out, absorbs quickly, doesn&#x27;t smell bad and my acne scars are fading.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s due to this serum, but my dark spots seem to be fading!</li>
            <li> It just takes a little 2x a day.</li>
            <li> Smells a little funky but that&#x27;s just how VitC serums tend to be.</li>
            <li> I ordered this product a little over a week ago.  </li>
            <li> I could feel my face tighten a little after it dried.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It does not feel heavy on my face and that there is no oily residue.&lt;br /&gt;My</li>
            <li> I noticed an improvement few weeks after using it</li>
            <li> I am hoping some uneven tone/age spots will fade somewhat.  </li>
            <li> And the drying time is just a few minutes.</li>
            <li> Been using it for a few weeks</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for a few weeks now</li>
            <li> There is no strong perfume smell like some serums have.  </li>
            <li> My skin is incredibly dry and I am not sure if this serum has helped the dryness or made it worse.</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m not sure if it lessons them.</li>
            <li> I spent a lot of money on Murads anti aging and acne control and it made my skin worse</li>
            <li> At least for myself there was no need to dilute the serum and using it everyday causes no irritation.</li>
            <li> I do not have problem skin, just the usual aging signs of a 40 something.</li>
            <li> I stopped using my usual face lotions to see what this product would do for my skin.</li>
            <li> , I find it is a thick serum</li>
            <li> and my face hasn&#x27;t broken out in a rash like it did before.  </li>
            <li> non irritating &amp; non drying.  </li>
            <li> I like the way the product feels, but I&#x27;m not too crazy about the scent....</li>
            <li> and it wasn&#x27;t too bad.  </li>
            <li> Well i can tell you that i am really shocked and wish i would of taken pictures of before and after using Eva Naturals Vitamin C Serum.</li>
            <li> I HATE TO ADMIT</li>
            <li> Unfortunately!!!</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Bought 3 one for myself &amp; the other 2 for each one of my daughters....everyone is happy with this product &amp; seeing good results...thank you</li>
            <li> So far i am happy with this purchase.&lt;br /&gt;I used serum cover my face &amp; neck.&lt;br /&gt;It does not feel heavy on my face and that there is no oily residue.&lt;br /&gt;My face feels very soft after just a few days of use.&lt;br /&gt;I look forward to the long term use and results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Plus it smells great.</li>
            <li> Love it, all purpose, fast shipping, will buy again</li>
            <li> I really love this serum and I&#x27;m really happy with the result I got on my face after about 2 weeks of use.&lt;br /&gt;right now I&#x27;m over 30 and I started in the last year &amp;#34;especially after my pregnancy&amp;#34; to feel that my face skin was dry in my checks,not smooth and not clear with my nose was very oily,this really affected on me.BUT NOW I&#x27;M HAPPY whenever I touch my face with my hand and feel it softer and whenever I look at the mirror and see my face more clear and more bright and less oily,my face began to live again.&lt;br /&gt;by the way the serum has a citrus scent which was high at the beginning and decreased after that and became light,I like it&lt;br /&gt;I was very lucky to receive this serum discounted in exchange of my honest reveiw</li>
            <li> So far it is wonderful!  Love the feel, smell and the way it soothes my tired skin.  I have worn it under make-up and applied it at night before my moisturizer.  My skin is brighter (not pinkish/irritated though) and smoother.  I had heard about Vit. C serum from mother in law after I noticed her skin looked so fresh.  So I copied her and I am glad I did.  :)</li>
            <li> I love it! The smell and feel of the product is great. It doesn&#x27;t leave any stickiness on my face, which is important to me.</li>
            <li> I have tried other Vitamin C products and was not crazy about them, but I really like this!&lt;br /&gt;It does not sting, the smell is pleasant and it is not sticky.&lt;br /&gt;I might be hopeful, but I feel like my skin looks a bit clearer since I started using it!</li>
            <li> Love this product. I have worked as a Nat;l Acct. Manager in the cosmetic world and have to say this is the BEST! I can&#x27;t say enough about it other than u have to try it and feel ,see the results for yourself.</li>
            <li> I love this product. It makes my skin glow and feel great.&lt;br /&gt; Arrived on time and I will definitely purchase again.</li>
            <li> This serum is thicker than other serums I have used... more like a lotion.  It  goes on nicely,  sinks right in without leaving a film and feels good.  Sunscreen or other products can go on top.  The  citrus scent is sublime.  For male/female.  I haven&#x27;t  used it long enough  for it to have any kind of effect, but  Vit C serum  tends to prevent damage rather than correct.  However, should it make me beautiful,  I will give it five stars.  Anyway, I will reorder.</li>
            <li> Works. Lightened a dark spot on my face. Love it non irritating</li>
            <li> This face serum is amazing. I use it on my skin before applying foundation and it feels like my skin is so hydrated - a must living in Phoenix!</li>
            <li> The serum was a gift for my mom.  After two weeks of use, her face became brighter and her wrinkles are smoother!</li>
            <li> I love the way my skin feels the morning after I use this.  It does make the fine lines softer and tightens up my pores.  I also love that there are no perfume fragrances in this. I does have a light smell - not unpleasant - which disappears right after applying.</li>
            <li> The serum is easy to apply &amp; does not leave an oily feeling.  My complexion has cleared up since I&#x27;ve been using this product.  I was a little iffy when I first bought it but am now a return customer!</li>
            <li> This is a nice formula that is easy to apply to the skin, but does not feel heavy.  It absorbs into the skin to make it feel soft and smooth.  I like the fact that it is not heavy feeling.  The dropper makes it easy to dispense only the amount you need.  There is no strong perfume smell like some serums have.  I have sensitive skin and this serum did not cause any issues.</li>
            <li> This product has already improved my skin</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for a few weeks now, and have gotten many complements on my skin!  I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s due to this serum, but my dark spots seem to be fading!</li>
            <li> Probably it&#x27;s a good one for somebody with usual headache, but not for migraine. I&#x27;m looking for the right medicine which can help migraine for years. Just sumatriptan helps with migraine relieve! Unfortunately!!!</li>
            <li> I like the way the product feels, but I&#x27;m not too crazy about the scent.... I had a patch of super dry skin on my elbow, decided to put this serum on it, and in 3 days the rough patch was gone! Not what this product is for specifically, but it worked!</li>
            <li> Excellent product... prompt delivery !</li>
            <li> This works wonders. If you have a light bruise and rub some of this on it it will help it fade faster. It is also wonderful at brightening you skin tone and fading blemishes. This will be the 2nd bottle I have bought. Vitamin C is suppose to help with free radicals so its almost like magic in a bottle.</li>
            <li> Wow I love this vitamin c serum, I been using it for a week already and I start noticing some brown spots disappearing amazing! ! and also it doesn&#x27;t stings..I love that , I really recommend this serum it works! !!:-)</li>
            <li> If you want to have a brilliant and smooth skin, this is your product. Easy to use, just few drops twice a day can give your skin a healthy and smooth texture. I noticed an improvement few weeks after using it</li>
            <li> Love the fact that this product is all natural and was offered at a great price.  I also loved the quick delivery.</li>
            <li> i have been using in morning and evening as routine.  The fresh scent is wonderful.  Although i am certain it is too soon so see improvement, my yoga teacher actually commented on how fresh my complexion looked and asked what i was doing?  i know vitamin c in this strength will make a difference if used regularly.  I am hoping some uneven tone/age spots will fade somewhat.  the price is very reasonable---i was surprised at the thickness...it goes on easily and feels refreshing!</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for a couple of weeks. My face looks brighter.  I was worried about it making my face oily.. I have had no issues with break outs what so ever.  I haven&#x27;t noticed a huge difference in the lines in my  face yet. . But I&#x27;ll keep you updated.</li>
            <li> Great product; has a pleasant citrousy smell. Absorbed well after application and made my face feel smooth and tight almost immediately. Great bang for your buck and I like that it has hyaluronic acid in it as well. I&#x27;ve only used it for a few days so I can&#x27;t make a more detailed review, but I probably will buy from this company again.</li>
            <li> I really like this Vitamin C serum.It has the recommended amount of vitamin C plus other ingredients I like.It goes on smoothly and doesn&#x27;t leave a sticky residue like some do.I am very excited to be using this product as , so far,it is what feels best on my skin out of the many I have tried.I will come back in 30 days to update this review and am feeling good that I will see results.&lt;br /&gt;Edit* I am still very happy with this serum and I will be buying it again.In my opinion,after trying many vitamin C serums(some good,some horrible)I can say this is the one I like best.I am very glad to have found this company and will be using their line exclusively as you can&#x27;t get such great quality for the price anywhere else.As a single mom I can&#x27;t tell you how thrilled I am to find something that works and I can afford.I feel like doing a commercial for them , it&#x27;s that good! :)</li>
            <li> Great product! Helped with rough skin and wrinkles. Just bought a second bottle.</li>
            <li> I love this serum.  I used it 2 times a day and it leaves my skin smooth and soft.  I will be buying another bottle for sure!</li>
            <li> Very happy with the product! Feels great on my skin and the company is wonderful to work with.</li>
            <li> This is amazing stuff for a good deal. Love natural facial products.</li>
            <li> Feels light and smells great.  Smooth transaction too.</li>
            <li> I TRULY NOTICED A DIFFERENCE AFTER USING THIS PRODUCT. I BELIEVE IT WAS DUE TO THE VITAMIN C, AS ITS KNOWN TO HELP ANTI-AGING AND FIGHT FREE RADICALS IN THE SKIN. I NOTICED A DIFFERENCE IN MY FINE LINES, WRINKLES, AND DEVELOPING CROWS FEET I HATE TO ADMIT I&#x27;M STARTING TO NOTICE... THIS PRODUCT GAVE ME NEW HOPEFUL RESULTS! IT IMPROVED MY SKINS PIGMENT AND ALSO HELPED WITH SOME MINOR DISCOLORATION SPOTS I HAD THAT I NEVER KNEW I DID UNTIL AFTER I TRIED THIS PRODUCT. I RECIEVED THIS ITEM AT A DISCOUNTED PRICE FOR MY OPINION, AFTER RECIEVING THIS PRODUCT I TRULY FEEL IT MEETS HIGHER THAN MY EXPECTATIONS &amp; I WOULD RE-ORDER.</li>
            <li> The serum made it to my home very quickly!  I used it after a microdermabrasion and the burning sensation was unbearable for my hypersensitive eczema prone skin.  I later learned that I shouldn&#x27;t have used it after a microdermabrasion and that it is also best to start with a lessor percentage and then work my way up.  So I made my own dyi serum and then adjusted the dosage from there.  I tried this serum again a week or so later after a derma roller and my face had a better reaction.  It burned a little, but I mixed it with calendula ointment to lesson the sting and it wasn&#x27;t too bad.  This morning I tried the serum without the calendula ointment and I was actually able to handle the 20%.  It burn a little, but subsided really quickly and my face hasn&#x27;t broken out in a rash like it did before.  So I would say, test it in small spots first.  If it burns too much start with a lower percentage, 5%, and then work your way up.</li>
            <li> I love it. I haven&#x27;t used it long, but I can definitely feel (and see) a difference in my skin. It&#x27;s definitely a keeper.</li>
            <li> Been using this product for a while now and beginning to see results. My skin looks firmer and not as wrinkled. Would recommend this product!</li>
            <li> this is a great product and smells amazing fast shipping</li>
            <li> This Vitamin C serum is amazing!  Very easy to apply, smells wonderful and I have seen a very noticeable reduction in the lines around my eyes!</li>
            <li> Love the feeling Of it nice and soft</li>
            <li> I really like this product. It leaves me softer, smoother skin.  No more rough places on my skin. I&#x27;ve just recently noticed some mark spots under my eyes as well, which I will definitely be using this product on.</li>
            <li> Package arrived a day earlier than stated and was well packaged.  I love the product and am pleased with the way it feels on my skin.  I have noticed a difference in the fine lines around my eyes and mouth and my skin feels much smoother</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only been using this product for a few weeks, so can&#x27;t say that I&#x27;ve seen any changes to my skin yet. The product goes on smoothly and is quickly absorbed into the skin. Not greasy. Looking forward to good things.Will try to update in the future.</li>
            <li> This product is definitely worth your money. Highly recommended for anyone who wants a natural supplement.</li>
            <li> Well i can tell you that i am really shocked and wish i would of taken pictures of before and after using Eva Naturals Vitamin C Serum. But dang it i did not take a picture. I wanted to use this because i have a dark spot about the size of a dime on my face and after using this Vitamin C i can tell that it is getting lighter after 4 weeks. It just takes a little 2x a day. And the drying time is just a few minutes. The serum feels great and you can feel it tightening you skin on your face.I am hooked LOL and do recommend this product.</li>
            <li> oh my gosh, I bought this item for a 1.00. I&#x27;ve been using it for a week now, and I love the feeling it gives my face.. will definately be rebuying this...</li>
            <li> Feel it was as advertized</li>
            <li> I love this serum!  My skin feels wonderful...I use it in the morning and evening under my cream.  I love that it&#x27;s without the junk chemicals!</li>
            <li> Great product.  Natural, not sticky and absorbs quickly.  Wonderful on its own or under makeup.  Will buy this product again.</li>
            <li> Love the way it makes my face feel, it&#x27;s so soft yet firm. I don&#x27;t really have a lot of wrinkles so I&#x27;m not sure if it lessons them. But I noticed a big difference in the way my skin looks and feels. I could feel my face tighten a little after it dried. I will buy this again. And would recommend it to everyone.</li>
            <li> I love this serum! It is perfect for the summer heat, as it goes on smooth and is a light product.</li>
            <li> definitely need this in my daily skin routine.  great product &amp; price ~</li>
            <li> Just started using this product. My skin is feeling great so far and believe it will only get better! Has a great scent as well.</li>
            <li> Wonderful! I&#x27;ve been using this for about a week and a half now, and I love it. My skin tone is lovely and even, my skin is plump, and my pores appear smaller.</li>
            <li> This works great I would highly recommend this .  I will answer any questions you have with my experience with the product.</li>
            <li> Again, Eva Naturals found a way to create a client for life!  This soaks into my skin and smells delightful.  It has a nice hydrating effect for my very dry and sensitive skin!  Another keeper!</li>
            <li> I love this serum.  I have only used it about a week.  I was also amazed at how quickly my order arrived.  I just ordered another bottle to be sure I always have one on hand.</li>
            <li> Product arrived very quickly. Customer service for this product is outstanding! I have only been using it for a week, but so far so good.</li>
            <li> This stuff is GREAT! I spent a lot of money on Murads anti aging and acne control and it made my skin worse so I tried this stuff out and my acne is all clear now. Great stuff! Trashed the Murad!</li>
            <li> Yes I am very happy with it so far....thank you</li>
            <li> Great natural product by a company who cares.</li>
            <li> So far so good softer skin</li>
            <li> Oh I just love how this Vitamin C Serum tightens my skin , smells wonderful and is so light  and non greasy.  If you haven&#x27;t tried it now is the time !</li>
            <li> non irritating &amp; non drying.  Vitamin C sérum  over time has lightened  hyper pigmented skin patched&lt;br /&gt;well pleased with product . I am able to use this product with my glycol acid toner without problem</li>
            <li> Works great! worth every penny! would buy again!</li>
            <li> Smells a little funky but that&#x27;s just how VitC serums tend to be. For the price its seems to work super well, my face seems brighter in general after use and hasn&#x27;t had any averse affects on me as of yet. I know these serums take time to work so looking forward to what else this will do! At least for myself there was no need to dilute the serum and using it everyday causes no irritation. It comes in a nice amber bottle that seals tightly, I would recommend keeping it in the fridge or somewhere cool and dark to make sure it lasts as long as it can.</li>
            <li> Received order very fast, I have been using it for a week now and it makes my face really soft i love the way it feels. haven&#x27;t been using long enough to see any results on the fine lines issue that I have yet but when i do I will make sure to update my comment. I will continue to by from this seller they are great .</li>
            <li> a nice addition to the &amp;#34;war on aging&amp;#34;..inexpensive and it works.</li>
            <li> Love my soft glowing skin!!!</li>
            <li> Good service and quick delivery.  From everything i have read, Vitamin C serum is helpful for avoiding wrinkles.  Time will tell.</li>
            <li> Been using it for a few weeks and I been Liking it so far!</li>
            <li> Have noticed a difference in fine lines and wrinkles. Softer skin and a more even skin tone.</li>
            <li> I ordered this product a little over a week ago.  I must say that I am a pretty skeptical shopper but I will give things a try which can be a like, love, or hate relationship.  This product is a LOVE!  I have only been using it at night and I could tell a difference in my skins appearance and feel.  The small fine lines are smaller and it is even helping with those pesky squinting forehead lines and the laugh lines!  Will DEFINITELY buy again!</li>
            <li> Great company and awesome product</li>
            <li> just started using it.. so far i love it!!</li>
            <li> The Eva Naturals Vitamin C Serum is an amazing product! It does what it promises. My skin is considerably smoother with less fine lines. I love it!!</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t noticed a huge difference in my skin. However, I am pregnant and my skin may be acting differently than normal and so it&#x27;s hard to tell. My skin is incredibly dry and I am not sure if this serum has helped the dryness or made it worse. I was hoping the serum would help fade brown spots (sun spots) but so far haven&#x27;t noticed a difference.</li>
            <li> I love, really seems to brighten my skin to the point where even my hubby noticed, LOL</li>
            <li> I just started using this product so I cannot give a long term review of it ; however, so far, my skin is taking to it very well. There are no adverse reactions and since this uses a more stable,gentler vitamin C derivative , there is no waiting time for the active to sink in and it will not oxidize as fast as other serums.This serum seems well formulated . I am glad I selected it.</li>
            <li> I am loving this product! I&#x27;ve only used it for about 2 weeks now, but it has a nice light scent, and just two drops cover my face and neck. It leaves a tacky feeling until it dries. It&#x27;s not a bad feeling, but different than a face cream feeling. I have read that Vitamin C is so good for the face, and I am hoping for good things! Too soon to really tell if it&#x27;s making a difference.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for a few weeks now and I absolutely love it!  I use it morning and night prior to any moisturizer.  It goes on very smooth.  Is not greasy at all.  It take a minute or so to dry and when it does I instantly get a tighter feeling to my skin.  Yesterday I started using it on the back of my hands as well, it cant hurt!  I will be a repeat customer.</li>
            <li> This product it is better than the one I was using from Dr Oz, love it, I find it is a thick serum and I can feel the difference even when I put my makeup, thanks</li>
            <li> This stuff works wonders.</li>
            <li> It feels great on my skin.  It has a spray nozzle which is helpful rather than a dropper.  I use it on my hands feet and face where aging is showing.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve added this to my daily routine. I am noticing an improvement in the look and feel of my face. I do not have problem skin, just the usual aging signs of a 40 something. This is not miracle juice, I don&#x27;t look 20, but I look BETTER, and it makes me feel better. I am very happy I have it.</li>
            <li> I super love this serum. It doesn&#x27;t break me out, absorbs quickly, doesn&#x27;t smell bad and my acne scars are fading. My suggestion is to chill it in the refrigerator to last longer and prevent from oxidation.</li>
            <li> I have use your products for a few months, great products, my skin looks and feels younger; you look younger than your siblings</li>
            <li> I notice a difference already!</li>
            <li> Love this product, using it only a few days and can see so much difference in my skin tone and texture. Will be ordering again and again !</li>
            <li> Love this stuff... cleaning up my sun damage:)</li>
            <li> love my vitamin c serum really helps with the dry weather..</li>
            <li> I really like this product. It wasn&#x27;t too strong a formula that it would make your break out or get irritated. It has no strong odors and is weightless and very easy to apply. I would buy this after I run out.</li>
            <li> I see &amp; feel no difference in my skin after two weeks of use. If anything, it looks like it&#x27;s dying my skin out and giving me more wrinkles. I will probably purchase Skinceuticals vit C next time around.</li>
            <li> Love the way it makes my skin feel.  Goes on smooth and a little goes a long way.  Noticed results within a week.</li>
            <li> Wonderful product! Have absolutely no complaints!</li>
            <li> Love this!! I have been using it for about a week. Smells wonderful and makes my skin feel great. Has not caused any breakout either!!!</li>
            <li> Love the smell of this product and how it tightens the area around my eyes, neck and lips. It is easy to use and it does well under my foundation for all day use. Will consider using it in the future. Got a great deal on this product so decided to give it a try, can say I am not disappointed.</li>
            <li> Eva Natural Vitamin C Serum is perfect!  I love this product and would buy it again in a heartbeat.  It goes on smoothly and dries quickly so I can use a moisturizer after applying the Vitamin C.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff!  I&#x27;ve purchased several serums- they all work wonderfully!  I definitely notice a difference in the way my skin feels after using the vitamin C serum.</li>
            <li> nice product. make sure you shale well before using, then use just a drop or two to start!&lt;br /&gt;pleasant smell, I don&#x27;t like using things that smell to strong ot smell like medicine</li>
            <li> This is a great serum!! It is absorbed quickly and doesn&#x27;t leave any greasy residue. My skin looks and feels healthier!!</li>
            <li> My skin loves this Vitamin C Serum. I stopped using my usual face lotions to see what this product would do for my skin. I used it for two weeks every night. I had oily and dry spots in different areas of my face, and this serum evened out my skin. Overall, my skin felt softer and looked younger.  My skin looks and feels healthier. The serum has a pleasant light orange scent and absorbs quickly.</li>
            <li> This make my skin more supple and smooth.</li>
            <li> This is a awesome product.I wanted to post my rating so I could use it .I love this stuff and I can tell a big difference in my complexion and my little wrinkles!</li>
            <li> I have never looked younger my face looks and feels great</li>
            <li> so far just getting to try the product for a few days it seems to be doing very well. Some of the parts of this product are very good for the skin. I am so glad that i got and cant wait to have beautiful skin by the time summer comes.</li>
