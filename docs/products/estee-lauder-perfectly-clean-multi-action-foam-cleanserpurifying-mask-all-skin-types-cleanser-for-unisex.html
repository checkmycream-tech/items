            <li> Prefer the previous version.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s hard to tell what products are costing the freight, I wouldn&#x27;t have purchased, had I known.</li>
            <li> It has a faint smell but nothing bad and even though it is a bit pricier</li>

            <li> Gift for the wife and she loves it.&lt;br /&gt;Came as advertised.</li>
            <li> got ripped off on freight- it&#x27;s hard to tell what products are costing the freight, I wouldn&#x27;t have purchased, had I known.</li>
            <li> very nice，the next time to buy</li>
            <li> I love all Est&amp;eacute;e Lauder products and this one is awesome! Very gently removes daily grime. Does not dry your skin. Very subtle clean smell. Highly recommend it</li>
            <li> One of my favorite cleansers. It has a faint smell but nothing bad and even though it is a bit pricier I think it evens out in the end because you only need to use such a small amount to wash your face. It leaves my face feeling clean and bright without the dryness or tightness of other cleansers I&#x27;ve tried. I can&#x27;t speak for how well it removes makeup because I use an oil cleanser beforehand.</li>
            <li> Love this foaming face wash, use it every day to remove my makeup. Makes my skin feel very soft!!</li>
            <li> I love this cleanser.</li>
            <li> This product was changed. Prefer the previous version. Probably will not buy again. Just not that special.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.  Gets my face super clean, and a plus is that it&#x27;s non-stop for my super sensitive face.  Would purchase again.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good product and good service shipped.</li>
            <li> I ordered a regular size cleanser (150ml), however I received 5 x 30ml sample size one.</li>
            <li> Love this product.  Works great!</li>
            <li> Love the feel of this cleanser and love the smell!  Leaves my face so soft!</li>
