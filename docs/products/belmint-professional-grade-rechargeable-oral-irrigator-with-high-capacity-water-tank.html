            <li>Works great.</li>
            <li>Pulse is great for deeper and burst of water cleaning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This product works great.</li>
            <li>He says this works wonderfully, even better than the Waterpik we have at home.</li>
            <li>It worked fairly well for about 6 weeks, but then stopped working even after recharging.</li>
            <li>you have to fill it twice to get a good cleaning.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Fair for price, does the job.</li>

            <li>It would be good for anyone with dentures as well.</li>

            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>handy, works well</li>
            <li>Once charged, unplug the flosser, attach one of the two included nozzles and fill the tank with comfortably warm water.</li>
            <li>I use warm tap</li>
            <li>/&gt;After using my own water flosser for about three months, I was intrigued to see what this one looked like, so that I could consider having my husband use it.</li>
            <li>in all, I would recommend this based on my own testing of the product.</li>
            <li>The massaging function is really nice and helps reinvigorate a gumline that&#x27;s a bit bruised from over-brushing.</li>
            <li>All in all, a nice purchase for the money and a well-built machine that seems to keep up well with continued use.</li>
            <li>So far it&#x27;s working great!</li>
            <li>I also own the top selling [[asin:</li>
            <li>However, I found the pressure of the spray to be just okay.</li>
            <li>The Belmint unit is reliable, competitively priced, and delivers performance which is comparable to Panasonic&#x27;s current best seller.he advantage of the pulse mode.  </li>

            <li>Sometimes I refill it for a better cleaning.</li>
            <li>Better than Oral B</li>
            <li>Should have known better....</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, I am quite pleased with this and the results after a month or so of use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Works great and very affordable.</li>
            <li>so I was very excited to have the chance to try this flosser.&lt;br</li>
            <li>My teeth and gums are feeling pretty awesome, and it&#x27;s nice that it&#x27;s from something that is simple to assemble and use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sample provided by vendor.</li>
            <li>The reservoir can be detached and filled with water, or water can be poured into it through an opening of the top, which has a flip up cover.  </li>
            <li>Easy to us and to fill.</li>
            <li>It is easy to use and easy to understand.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Anyway, this is a nice device at a good price and it appears replacement nozzles may be purchased here on Amazon for this device from Toilet Tree Products.</li>
            <li>It was working fine</li>
            <li>I feel it making a difference and best of all, it&#x27;s less work on me to keep my teeth/mouth</li>
            <li>Otherwise, it  works  fine.</li>
            <li>Compact, easy to use, great value and terrific for kids with braces.</li>
            <li>Belmint unit is powered by a rechargeable battery, and while the unit has a large footprint, it is nice</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m giving it 5 stars because it&#x27;s easy to use, is quite powerful, looks nice sitting on my sink, and is much more reasonably priced than others I&#x27;ve shopped for.</li>
            <li>The charging light begins to blink when the battery needs to be recharged.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Light fur travel.</li>
            <li>Belmint unit is ergonomically designed to provide a comfortable grip, and convenient access to the control buttons.  </li>

            <li>I received a coupon to receive this item for free in order to evaluate it for my review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I see this one has nozzles you can buy that will fit it here on Amazon.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It is very powerful.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s quick and easy to do.</li>
            <li>and I was totally excited to get to try this [[ASIN:</li>
            <li>Its power to clean the gums and teeth is amazingTHey</li>
            <li>I use the normal and everything has been going great so far.  </li>
            <li>definitely feel this irrigator does a good job of cleaning the gums and between the teeth.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, I&#x27;m really quite pleased with the [[ASIN:</li>
            <li>/&gt;Out of the package, the unit is pretty easy to get setup and going.  </li>
            <li>causing  some bleeding,  even when turned  on &amp;#34;soft&amp;#34;,  so be  aware if your  gums  bleed easily  during flossing.</li>
            <li>Be prepared because the stream is very strong - even on the soft setting.</li>
            <li>That may have been because my previous pick had been a plug-in Waterpik with great pressure</li>
            <li>Best one ever used lots of power and battery last long time</li>
            <li>: I received a free or discounted sample for review, but a positive review was not asked for, promised or implied.</li>
            <li>While it had to be filled a couple of times with water in order to do a proper job of cleaning his whole mouth, he is very pleased with it.</li>
            <li>For the whole family, fantastic smiles üòÅüòÄ</li>
            <li>/&gt;Belmint graciously went out of their way to provide me with a sample of the latest version of their professional grade oral irrigator for evaluation.  </li>
            <li>A water flosser can&#x27;t replace actual flossing, but it certainly can be an effective supplemental tool for removing debris and plaque.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;You may not always be able to see the results, but a water flosser can be quite effective at cleaning hard to reach areas.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;You may not always be able to see the results, but a water flosser can be quite effective at cleaning hard to reach areas.  </li>
            <li>This oral irrigator is an attractive unit, white with a blue water reservoir.</li>
            <li>This Belmint Professional Grade Rechargeable Oral Irrigator works well and is easy to use.</li>
            <li>I do have sensitive gums and they bleed quite easily, so I have to use the softest setting and the highest setting</li>
            <li>floss pretty thoroughly</li>
            <li>that is larger and cost significantly more.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t be fooled by its outside stylish shape, it is a joke inside.  </li>
            <li>I love it only have been using it for 2 1/2 weeks</li>
            <li>The Belmint unit comes with two nozzles, and you can purchase more if you have a larger household.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The Belmint unit comes with two nozzles, and you can purchase more if you have a larger household.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I had been using a different brand, but I am glad I decided to try this one.</li>
            <li>Other than that, a nicely made product.</li>
            <li>A powerful jet of water can work particularly well at flushing the gums and metal braces, and getting at spaces under dental bridges.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It will be interesting to see how long it lasts.</li>
            <li>There is a charging light that blinks while charging and glows steady when charging is complete.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t been using this for very long, but for the time I&#x27;ve been using it I am pleased with it.</li>
            <li>So far so good, however should learn how to use for no have a mess.</li>
            <li>/&gt;This is a smart device for real users.</li>
            <li>And I like this flosser every bit as much as my WaterPik</li>
            <li>The flow rates of the two flossers are very comparable, with the Belmint having the advantage of the pulse mode.  </li>
            <li>so I really like this design feature.  </li>
            <li>very practical.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I really can&#x27;t recommend it.  </li>
            <li>It really cleans between my well.</li>
            <li>Get the real waterpik brand instead.</li>
            <li>Works very well.</li>
            <li>The soft setting is available for those with sensitive gums.  </li>
            <li>The soft setting is available for those with sensitive gums.  </li>
            <li>Was nice when it worked, but don&#x27;t waste your money on this!!&lt;br /&gt;Look</li>
            <li>/&gt;This actually has a larger reservoir than the one I am using, but has a condition mine doesn&#x27;t - you may NOT use any kind of mouthwash inside or it may damage it.</li>
            <li>I really don&#x27;t like flossing since the string tends to get caught on the edges of my older crowns, but do want to keep my teeth.</li>
            <li>So there is no way even to change and install and new batteries!</li>
            <li>/&gt;The suction tube is straight, and rests near the bottom of the reservoir, which creates some issues.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;The suction tube is straight, and rests near the bottom of the reservoir, which creates some issues.  </li>
            <li>but no way would i use it at work its too messy. :)</li>
            <li>can set it on a normal steady stream, a soft steady stream or a pulsing stream.</li>
            <li>The water reservoir holds enough water to get the job done, if you get right to it.</li>
            <li>I have a similar, rechargeable water flosser by WaterPik which I like very much</li>
            <li>even the soft is high powered).</li>
            <li>You just push one of the two included water picks onto the unit, push the &amp;#34;mode&amp;#34; button (normal, soft, pulse), and then push the &amp;#34;on/off&amp;#34; button.</li>
            <li>In use, the Belmint flosser has three modes, normal, soft and pulse.  </li>
            <li>Do not waste your money or time......</li>
            <li>/&gt;It takes about 8 hours to fully charge the batteries from completely depleted.</li>
            <li>That is a very practical recommendation, especially since we have non chlorinated well water making it always</li>
            <li>Let me start by saying that I have sensitive gums.</li>
            <li>Now, while I&#x27;m no dental professional, I can say that I FEEL the difference.</li>
            <li>When done, I adjust the position of the nozzle, and hit the outside of the teeth on the left side, and finish up with the inside of teeth on the right side.  </li>
            <li>When done, I adjust the position of the nozzle, and hit the outside of the teeth on the left side, and finish up with the inside of teeth on the right side.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Other than that, this operates the same, you put water in it, you push the buttons, and it sprays (from High to Highest -</li>
            <li>I will definitely stay with this brand and would highly recommend it for anyone who has dental implants.</li>
            <li>This  flosser/irrigator  seems  to work OK,  though it  might be little  rough on gums  </li>
            <li>Typically I start on the right side, shooting water on the outside surface of the teeth.  </li>
            <li>Typically I start on the right side, shooting water on the outside surface of the teeth.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;The more expensive flossers direct you to replace the nozzle every so often.  </li>
            <li>Oral irrigators can be a bit messy to use, and some basic precautions are required, but the benefits are well worth the effort.  </li>
            <li>Oral irrigators can be a bit messy to use, and some basic precautions are required, but the benefits are well worth the effort.  </li>
            <li>If you haven&#x27;t been using a water flosser, your gums may bleed a little the first week or so</li>
            <li>While the tank capacity is fairly large, it took me awhile to get the timing down</li>
            <li>The system holds just enough water to last for approximately one flossing (top and bottom row), while this could be bothersome, I personally don&#x27;t like to leave water setting in containers</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s a little large for travel</li>

            <li> Don&#x27;t be fooled by its outside stylish shape, it is a joke inside.  </li>
            <li> I love it only have been using it for 2 1/2 weeks</li>
            <li> The Belmint unit comes with two nozzles, and you can purchase more if you have a larger household.&lt;br</li>

            <li> I had been using a different brand, but I am glad I decided to try this one.</li>
            <li> Other than that, a nicely made product.</li>
            <li> A powerful jet of water can work particularly well at flushing the gums and metal braces, and getting at spaces under dental bridges.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It will be interesting to see how long it lasts.</li>
            <li> There is a charging light that blinks while charging and glows steady when charging is complete.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t been using this for very long, but for the time I&#x27;ve been using it I am pleased with it.</li>
            <li> So far so good, however should learn how to use for no have a mess.</li>
            <li> /&gt;This is a smart device for real users.</li>
            <li> And I like this flosser every bit as much as my WaterPik</li>
            <li> The flow rates of the two flossers are very comparable, with the Belmint having the advantage of the pulse mode.  </li>
            <li> so I really like this design feature.  </li>
            <li> very practical.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I really can&#x27;t recommend it.  </li>
            <li> It really cleans between my well.</li>
            <li> Get the real waterpik brand instead.</li>
            <li> Works very well.</li>
            <li> The soft setting is available for those with sensitive gums.  </li>

            <li> Was nice when it worked, but don&#x27;t waste your money on this!!&lt;br /&gt;Look</li>
            <li> /&gt;This actually has a larger reservoir than the one I am using, but has a condition mine doesn&#x27;t - you may NOT use any kind of mouthwash inside or it may damage it.</li>
            <li> I really don&#x27;t like flossing since the string tends to get caught on the edges of my older crowns, but do want to keep my teeth.</li>
            <li> So there is no way even to change and install and new batteries!</li>
            <li> /&gt;The suction tube is straight, and rests near the bottom of the reservoir, which creates some issues.  </li>

            <li> In use, the Belmint flosser has three modes, normal, soft and pulse.  </li>
            <li> Do not waste your money or time......</li>
            <li> /&gt;It takes about 8 hours to fully charge the batteries from completely depleted.</li>
            <li> That is a very practical recommendation, especially since we have non chlorinated well water making it always</li>
            <li> Let me start by saying that I have sensitive gums.</li>
            <li> Now, while I&#x27;m no dental professional, I can say that I FEEL the difference.</li>
            <li> When done, I adjust the position of the nozzle, and hit the outside of the teeth on the left side, and finish up with the inside of teeth on the right side.  </li>

            <li> I will definitely stay with this brand and would highly recommend it for anyone who has dental implants.</li>
            <li> This  flosser/irrigator  seems  to work OK,  though it  might be little  rough on gums  </li>

            <li> It worked fairly well for about 6 weeks, but then stopped working even after recharging.</li>
            <li> I like the product it is just tough to fill in the bathroom sink and the tank is too small you have to fill it twice to get a good cleaning.&lt;br /&gt;It is also messy since the water runs out of your mouth and down the container. I bought it to take it to work but no way would i use it at work its too messy. :)</li>
            <li> Purchased and recd January 2015. Device stopped working the end of April. Do not waste your money or time......Too hard to get a replacement and very difficult to contact about a warranty. DISAPPOINTED!!!!</li>
            <li> Fair for price, does the job.</li>
            <li> Excellent for the price....handy, works well</li>
            <li> I have a similar, rechargeable water flosser by WaterPik which I like very much but it&#x27;s a little large for travel so I was very excited to have the chance to try this flosser.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a couple of inches shorter than my WaterPik and the water tank is smaller. It takes up very little room on the bathroom counter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It takes about 8 hours to fully charge the batteries from completely depleted. There is a charging light that blinks while charging and glows steady when charging is complete. Once charged, unplug the flosser, attach one of the two included nozzles and fill the tank with comfortably warm water. (Cold water can trigger pain if you have sensitive teeth.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You can set it on a normal steady stream, a soft steady stream or a pulsing stream. Be prepared because the stream is very strong - even on the soft setting. If you haven&#x27;t been using a water flosser, your gums may bleed a little the first week or so but it will stop as soon as your gums become accustomed to it. Just like with regular floss.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I floss pretty thoroughly so I have to refill the water tank once in the middle of my flossing session but it&#x27;s quick and easy to do. And I like this flosser every bit as much as my WaterPik that is larger and cost significantly more. It removes food and particles from between my teeth just as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The battery life is quite good! The charging light begins to blink when the battery needs to be recharged.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have the newest version of this water flosser so I am hoping I don&#x27;t have the issue with short battery life that some other people encountered with the previous version. If I do, I will update this review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;NOTE: I received a free or discounted sample for review, but a positive review was not asked for, promised or implied.</li>
            <li> It is very powerful. The water pressure is very good. Its power to clean the gums and teeth is amazingTHey have 2 bay sink and hand washing sink provided with soap, paper towels and hot and cold running water.&lt;br /&gt;Provided with copuple of frigs with freezers.&lt;br /&gt;Serve Hot doga, pretzelles, hamburgers, coffee and beverages. Inspected when the kitchen was inactive.</li>
            <li> Got four months of use out it and then it went haywire. It was working fine and then one day I couldn&#x27;t turn it off. The next day it wouldn&#x27;t turn on. In my four months of use I loved its portability, I could stick it in my shaving kit and take it on the road. However, I found the pressure of the spray to be just okay. That may have been because my previous pick had been a plug-in Waterpik with great pressure</li>
            <li> When I purchased this item in January 2015, there were already customer comments say that the re-chargable battery would die in 3 months. I made a mistake to purchase it, then the battery died after three months.  I opened the box and found the re-chargeable batteries are soldered onto wires end to end! So there is no way even to change and install and new batteries! What a shameful shortcut made in manufacturing!  Don&#x27;t be fooled by its outside stylish shape, it is a joke inside.  Stay away from it!</li>
            <li> I love it only have been using it for 2 1/2 weeks and I already see great results.</li>
            <li> Easy to us and to fill.</li>
            <li> Unit is unwieldy  and hard to handle.</li>
            <li> So far it&#x27;s working great!</li>
            <li> Bought this for my husband for his trip to Ireland and Scotland with the grandchildren. He says this works wonderfully, even better than the Waterpik we have at home. While it had to be filled a couple of times with water in order to do a proper job of cleaning his whole mouth, he is very pleased with it.</li>
            <li> Love it!  Plenty of power. Good design. Light fur travel. Love it!</li>
            <li> A water flosser can&#x27;t replace actual flossing, but it certainly can be an effective supplemental tool for removing debris and plaque.  A powerful jet of water can work particularly well at flushing the gums and metal braces, and getting at spaces under dental bridges.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Belmint graciously went out of their way to provide me with a sample of the latest version of their professional grade oral irrigator for evaluation.  I also own the top selling [[asin: B0027LSEPS Panasonic EW-DJ10-A Water Flosser]], a similar product which is in the same price range.  This review will include some comparisons between the two flossers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Belmint unit is powered by a rechargeable battery, and while the unit has a large footprint, it is nice is that a separate recharging stand is not required.  You simply plug the included AC cord into a set of contacts on the handle.  Maximum recharge time is stated as 8 hours.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The water reservoir is a detachable blue plastic container that holds about 10 ounces.  The reservoir can be detached and filled with water, or water can be poured into it through an opening of the top, which has a flip up cover.  The unit is supposedly waterproof, but is not submersible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The controls are rather simple.  A round button on the handle controls the power, while an oval shaped button below is use to select either \\&quot;Normal\\&quot;, \\&quot;Soft\\&quot;, or \\&quot;Pulse\\&quot; mode.  The operating mode can be selected before the power is actually turned on.  There is a memory function, so when switched on, the irrigator will be in the same mode it was in when it was turned off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As each unit holds about the same amount of water, I measured the useable runtimes in the different modes.  The Belmint runs for about 42 seconds on \\&quot;Normal\\&quot;, 57 seconds on \\&quot;Soft\\&quot;, and 51 seconds on \\&quot;Pulse\\&quot;.  The Panasonic flosser runs for about 46 seconds on \\&quot;High\\&quot;, and 62 seconds on \\&quot;Low\\&quot;.  The flow rates of the two flossers are very comparable, with the Belmint having the advantage of the pulse mode.  The Belmint unit comes with two nozzles, and you can purchase more if you have a larger household.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Belmint unit is ergonomically designed to provide a comfortable grip, and convenient access to the control buttons.  An oddity is that the reservoir isn&#x27;t flush with the bottom of the handle, which makes it slightly unstable.  It&#x27;s no biggie, but just seems like a very strange design choice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use the irrigator on the pulse setting, and work on my teeth in sections, refilling the reservoir as required.  Typically I start on the right side, shooting water on the outside surface of the teeth.  Then move to the inside of the teeth on left side.  When done, I adjust the position of the nozzle, and hit the outside of the teeth on the left side, and finish up with the inside of teeth on the right side.  This process usually takes between two and three minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The suction tube is straight, and rests near the bottom of the reservoir, which creates some issues.  When you elevate the irrigator handle, water will flow only for a short time, until the level drops below the end of the suction tube.  To treat the back side of your lower front teeth, you will probably need to lean your chin way down.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You may not always be able to see the results, but a water flosser can be quite effective at cleaning hard to reach areas.  The soft setting is available for those with sensitive gums.  Oral irrigators can be a bit messy to use, and some basic precautions are required, but the benefits are well worth the effort.

            <li> This oral irrigator is an attractive unit, white with a blue water reservoir. It stands about 7 1/2 inches tall and 11inches when the pick is attached. The base is plenty wide, so it doesn&#x27;t tend to topple over at all. It can be filled by opening the small fill spout, but that is a bit slow. It&#x27;s a lot faster to slide the water reservoir down and fill it that way. I like that it doesn&#x27;t use batteries and instead is charged with the included wall adapter. But you can unplug the adapter cord to use it cordless. It&#x27;s very simple to operate. You just push one of the two included water picks onto the unit, push the &amp;#34;mode&amp;#34; button (normal, soft, pulse), and then push the &amp;#34;on/off&amp;#34; button. I only use the &amp;#34;soft&amp;#34; mode, as that is plenty strong.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I definitely feel this irrigator does a good job of cleaning the gums and between the teeth. It would be good for anyone with dentures as well. The water reservoir holds enough water to get the job done, if you get right to it. Sometimes I refill it for a better cleaning. I use warm tap water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The set comes with two water picks, each one with a different color band. It took very little time to charge. I&#x27;ve never used an oral irrigator before, so I can&#x27;t compare it with other brands. I&#x27;ve always wanted one, so I was very happy to receive this one in exchange for an honest review. I&#x27;m giving it 5 stars because it&#x27;s easy to use, is quite powerful, looks nice sitting on my sink, and is much more reasonably priced than others I&#x27;ve shopped for.</li>
            <li> not the item described - sent back</li>
            <li> Works great. Better than Oral B</li>
            <li> Well, what a disappointment. Used it only while traveling, so has been used less than 10 times. It broke two weeks ago so basically lasted 4 months/10 tries. Was nice when it worked, but don&#x27;t waste your money on this!!&lt;br /&gt;Look at the bad reviews. All broke down in a few months. Should have known better....</li>
            <li> I have always hated flossing, and for me the only way I have been able to floss is by using [[ASIN:B00763LZF8 Oral-B Floss Picks]].  Even still, they pinch, poke, cut and are often times just uncomfortable.  Ever since adopting a [[ASIN:B007ZN5ATQ Philips Sonicare Toothbrush]], I have been stoked about oral hygiene and I was totally excited to get to try this [[ASIN:B00RG83EMK Belmint Professional-Grade Water Flosser]].&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Out of the package, the unit is pretty easy to get setup and going.  I can fill the tank by either removing it and putting it under the faucet, or by lifting the lid on the back of the unit and filling it there.  The system holds just enough water to last for approximately one flossing (top and bottom row), while this could be bothersome, I personally don&#x27;t like to leave water setting in containers so I really like this design feature.  The unit is rechargeable with the included/removable wall adapter.  I much prefer an adapter over a base because it makes for easy travel, especially for longer vacations.  In use, the Belmint flosser has three modes, normal, soft and pulse.  I use the normal and everything has been going great so far.  Pulse is great for deeper and burst of water cleaning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I&#x27;m really quite pleased with the [[ASIN:B00RG83EMK Belmint Professional-Grade Water Flosser]].  I feel it making a difference and best of all, it&#x27;s less work on me to keep my teeth/mouth clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[Review Sample Provided For Review And Evaluation]</li>
            <li> Great item!!!!!! For the whole family, fantastic smiles üòÅüòÄ</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t been using this for very long, but for the time I&#x27;ve been using it I am pleased with it. It is easy to use and easy to understand. Out of the box all you need to do to get this up and running is to plug it in and let it charge. Once charged you just plug in one of the nozzle heads, of which there are two so you can either share your irrigator, or save one head for use as a replacement when needed, and then add water. That&#x27;s all it takes. I&#x27;ve only charged it once in the few days that I&#x27;ve been using it, but I&#x27;ll update on that later. My teeth and gums are feeling pretty awesome, and it&#x27;s nice that it&#x27;s from something that is simple to assemble and use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sample provided by vendor.</li>
            <li> Its a good item for the price.. Does the job</li>
            <li> I received a coupon to receive this item for free in order to evaluate it for my review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After using my own water flosser for about three months, I was intrigued to see what this one looked like, so that I could consider having my husband use it. Since he uses a hygiene tray (instead of sitting at the sink), I am always looking for things that work without being at the sink.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This actually has a larger reservoir than the one I am using, but has a condition mine doesn&#x27;t - you may NOT use any kind of mouthwash inside or it may damage it. (Mine actually came WITH mouthwash and recommended it). That isn&#x27;t a problem for me, but it is different.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It also recommends that you empty this and keep it dry between flossings so that bacteria doesn&#x27;t build up in the water. That is a very practical recommendation, especially since we have non chlorinated well water making it always a concern.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other than that, this operates the same, you put water in it, you push the buttons, and it sprays (from High to Highest - even the soft is high powered). In my case, my teeth are difficult to get with floss, so I find it very practical.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, I would recommend this based on my own testing of the product.</li>
            <li> This Belmint Professional Grade Rechargeable Oral Irrigator works well and is easy to use. I really don&#x27;t like flossing since the string tends to get caught on the edges of my older crowns, but do want to keep my teeth. This water flosser makes flossing effortless and it does a very good job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The unit is cordless and recharges overnight using the included detachable power cord. While the tank capacity is fairly large, it took me awhile to get the timing down so it wouldn&#x27;t run dry while using it. I do have sensitive gums and they bleed quite easily, so I have to use the softest setting and the highest setting actually caused me a lot of discomfort.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I am quite pleased with this and the results after a month or so of use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly Recommended!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CFH&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note: sample provided for reviewing purposes.</li>
            <li> Let me start by saying that I have sensitive gums. My dentist has long ago encouraged me to switch to super-soft toothbrushes and to floss with care.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I saw this Belmint water flosser (or oral irrigator) by a friend, I decided to take it for a spin. Now, while I&#x27;m no dental professional, I can say that I FEEL the difference. No more flossing with string that cuts into the gums, no more bleeding gumline, and no more running out of dental floss.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a smart device for real users. The massaging function is really nice and helps reinvigorate a gumline that&#x27;s a bit bruised from over-brushing. All in all, a nice purchase for the money and a well-built machine that seems to keep up well with continued use.</li>
            <li> Best one ever used lots of power and battery last long time</li>
            <li> The water comes out so hard, I can barely stand to use it.  The water splashes out of the mouth and makes my throat bleed.  I really can&#x27;t recommend it.  I wish that the soft option was actually softer and not just less hard.  I won&#x27;t even let my son try it.</li>
            <li> Did not keep a charge.</li>
            <li> So far so good, however should learn how to use for no have a mess.</li>
            <li> This  flosser/irrigator  seems  to work OK,  though it  might be little  rough on gums  causing  some bleeding,  even when turned  on &amp;#34;soft&amp;#34;,  so be  aware if your  gums  bleed easily  during flossing. That&#x27;s  why I  gave it  just 4  stars. Otherwise, it  works  fine.</li>
            <li> This product works great. Would have given 5 stars except it&#x27;s really hard to fill.</li>
            <li> I bought this unit because I had an Xtech device so similar it is obvious they were from the same manufacturer.  My problem with the Xtech was I couldn&#x27;t find replacement nozzles.  (the company saw my comment here on amazon and sent me two).  I see this one has nozzles you can buy that will fit it here on Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just like the Xtech, this one mentions no manufacturer in the instructions or where to get help or parts.  Does say made in China on the shipping box.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The more expensive flossers direct you to replace the nozzle every so often.  My guess is this one should too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, this is a nice device at a good price and it appears replacement nozzles may be purchased here on Amazon for this device from Toilet Tree Products.</li>
            <li> This is a perfect irrigator but I gave it 4 stars as I wish the tank was a bit bigger. It really cleans between my well. I have used it 5 times and the charge has not run out. It will be interesting to see how long it lasts.</li>
            <li> It broke within a few weeks of use. Couldn&#x27;t get it replaced. Get the real waterpik brand instead.</li>
            <li> waste of money.. poor quality, poor performance, difficult to remove  and reinstall  chamber for water... sooo happy to get a refund.. will buy WaterPik or another better quality flosser.</li>
            <li> Found no difference between the settings, stream of water way too hard. Returned it for money back as I just couldn&#x27;t use it. Other than that, a nicely made product.</li>
            <li> Compact, easy to use, great value and terrific for kids with braces.</li>
            <li> I had been using a different brand, but I am glad I decided to try this one. The water supply lasts longer and it holds a charge longer. I kept scraping my gums with the other one when I tried to rinse under tooth implants, but I don&#x27;t have that problem with this one. I will definitely stay with this brand and would highly recommend it for anyone who has dental implants.</li>
            <li> broke after 1 month use</li>
            <li> Well packaged. Works very well.</li>
            <li> Works great and very affordable. Cordless is the only way to go. My wife loves it.</li>
