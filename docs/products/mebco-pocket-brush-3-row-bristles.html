            <li>This really is the best teaser I have ever used.</li>
            <li>These get the tangles out without pulling hair and the fit nicely into a purse.</li>
            <li>Who needs a brush when you have one of these that does a better job and is easier to control.</li>
            <li>I love this comb/brush.</li>
            <li>Love these, I call them a \\&quot;crush\\&quot;, combination of a comb and a brush.</li>
            <li>so I love how it adds volume around the crown.</li>
            <li>so well I went and bought a couple more and gave them away to share the experience.  </li>
            <li>I love to use this comb to tease the crown of my hair</li>
            <li>I love these combs.  </li>
            <li>It works better that a comb, and is sturdier than the travel brushes.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Very cool.</li>
            <li>The product is good and was delivered in a very timely fashion.</li>
            <li>combs hair easily without pulling.</li>
            <li>but I just had to be sure they were clean before I used them.  </li>
            <li>Great for long hair.  </li>
            <li>These brushes are good products, they work equally well for my Wife and for combing out our dog&#x27;s face.  </li>
            <li>like so much, I may buy more for my family.</li>
            <li>Works good for regular brushing and helps with teasing the hair - which I need.</li>
            <li>I have fine straight hair</li>
            <li>Great little brush for the price.</li>
            <li>I love using this brush to tease and comb back.  </li>
            <li>but I like to use it to comb out sections of my hair before wrapping it around hot rollers as well.</li>
            <li>I am going to get a second one; love them.</li>
            <li>It gets a good &amp;#34;nest&amp;#34; going without destroying your hair.</li>
            <li>keep one in my purse and one in my bathroom drawer… I find that I use it more than my brush on my long hair.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It is such an easy comb to use on our kids.  </li>
            <li>It works well with really easy entangled hair-ends like 4C Afro hairs to untangle them before using the flat iron.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>You can easily lightly comb over the &amp;#34;nest&amp;#34; you&#x27;ve created using the same comb.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s really hair and not fur.  </li>
            <li>These are only about half the price of the Denman kind but is just as good if not better.</li>
            <li>I wish these were more readily available as they were very hard to find</li>
            <li>Love these little things.</li>
            <li>Wish I would have bought a few more combs to have scattered around the house, car, gym, purses and everywhere else I roam.</li>
            <li>Obviously I can&#x27;t live without one.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s hard to find a brush that won&#x27;t tangle the hell out of it, That&#x27;s why I when I saw these here, I bought three. :)</li>
            <li>This comb works well on my natural hair.</li>
            <li>Couldn&#x27;t find it for a long time and thanks to Amazon, here it is.</li>

            <li> and I now wonder what took me so long to use it.</li>
            <li> I bought the mebco pocket brush 3 row bristles thinking I was getting the reddish pink color in the picture, but I actually got a black one.  </li>
            <li> I have thin, straight hair</li>
            <li> Bought it a whule ago but never really used it.</li>
            <li> The other thing is the advertisment says 3 row bristles so</li>
            <li> That is my only complaint.  </li>
            <li> Could be a little beefier though.</li>
            <li> De-tangles faster than a brush and with less broken hairs.</li>
            <li> /&gt;They are hard to find in the stores, so ordered these from online.</li>

            <li> These get the tangles out without pulling hair and the fit nicely into a purse. I wish these were more readily available as they were very hard to find and I had owned one for years before I made this purchase. These last forever and they are great! Who needs a brush when you have one of these that does a better job and is easier to control.</li>
            <li> purchased the mebro pocket brush and have been very happy with comb.  combs hair easily without pulling. it was a good purchase.</li>
            <li> I love this comb/brush. Bought a bunch and put one each in the grandchildren&#x27;s stockings.  It&#x27;s a compact comb and brush that detangles and styles all at the same time.  I also carry one in my purse.  Couldn&#x27;t find it for a long time and thanks to Amazon, here it is.</li>
            <li> Love these, I call them a \\&quot;crush\\&quot;, combination of a comb and a brush. Could be a little beefier though.</li>
            <li> I cannot praise this comb enough.  It is such an easy comb to use on our kids.  Even the kids like to use them!!</li>
            <li> This comb works well on my natural hair. I use it to comb the ends when I put 2-strand twist. I don&#x27;t like that the white paint on the bristles is coming off in my hair as I comb it. The other thing is the advertisment says 3 row bristles so of course I thought I was getting 3 brushes, and it doesn&#x27;t help that its a picture of 4 brushes on the picture. I over-looked it and didn&#x27;t pay attention to the wording. I just want to advise you&#x27;re only getting 1 brush.</li>
            <li> I bought the mebco pocket brush 3 row bristles thinking I was getting the reddish pink color in the picture, but I actually got a black one.  That is my only complaint.  The product is good and was delivered in a very timely fashion.</li>

            <li> These brushes are good products, they work equally well for my Wife and for combing out our dog&#x27;s face.  Nice!</li>
            <li> I bought one of these in a beauty supply store once, I think, and I liked it so well I went and bought a couple more and gave them away to share the experience.  Recently my niece came to stay with me and begged for it so I hopped on Amazon to order another one. Obviously I can&#x27;t live without one. I love to use this comb to tease the crown of my hair but I like to use it to comb out sections of my hair before wrapping it around hot rollers as well. It&#x27;s great for travel. You can throw it in your bag and go and it will be all you need until you get home. Very cool.</li>
            <li> I love these combs.  I bought one years ago and wanted another one.  I use one in the shower to comb out my hair with conditioner and also for teasing.  Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> Wish I would have bought a few more combs to have scattered around the house, car, gym, purses and everywhere else I roam.</li>
            <li> Great little brush for the price.</li>
            <li> I bought two for my purses.  It works better that a comb, and is sturdier than the travel brushes.&lt;br /&gt;I like so much, I may buy more for my family.</li>
            <li> They are the only kind I&#x27;ll use, and it&#x27;s impossible to find them sometimes. I have thin, straight hair and it&#x27;s hard to find a brush that won&#x27;t tangle the hell out of it, That&#x27;s why I when I saw these here, I bought three. :)</li>
            <li> Great product and perfect for travel, in your purse and my car.  Works good for regular brushing and helps with teasing the hair - which I need.</li>
            <li> I like the three rowns of bristles on these brushes.  I ordered around five of them and put them in the washing machine.  I don&#x27;t recommend anyone doing this. It wasn&#x27;t a good idea but I just had to be sure they were clean before I used them.  Three bristles popped off on one pocket brush but I blame that on the wash cycle.</li>
            <li> These are only about half the price of the Denman kind but is just as good if not better. I am going to get a second one; love them.</li>
            <li> Bought it a whule ago but never really used it. I decided only now to try it and I now wonder what took me so long to use it. It works well with really easy entangled hair-ends like 4C Afro hairs to untangle them before using the flat iron. Hope they don&#x27;t discontinue it in the future! A must have.</li>
            <li> This really is the best teaser I have ever used. It gets a good &amp;#34;nest&amp;#34; going without destroying your hair. You can easily lightly comb over the &amp;#34;nest&amp;#34; you&#x27;ve created using the same comb. This is a must have in my beauty route.</li>
            <li> I used these to comb my Yorkie&#x27;s hair.  It&#x27;s really hair and not fur.  I like how these combs have a ball on the end of each tine so they don&#x27;t scratch.  They also work out knots well and don&#x27;t break hair.</li>
            <li> I bought 2 of these for my husband.He had them before and loves them,but since then we couldn&#x27;t find a store that sells them.He is really happy using them.</li>
            <li> Great for long hair.  De-tangles faster than a brush and with less broken hairs.</li>
            <li> Love these little things. They were stocking stuffers for the family one year.&lt;br /&gt;I keep one in my purse and one in my bathroom drawer… I find that I use it more than my brush on my long hair.&lt;br /&gt;They are hard to find in the stores, so ordered these from online.</li>
