            <li>I got this because the reviews were good, but when it&#x27;s gone, I won&#x27;t order it again.</li>
            <li>/&gt;This is a great body cream that I love to use.</li>
            <li>This is a very nice body cream, but not at the top of my list.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this lotion!</li>
            <li>When you first put the lotion on it smells WONDERFUL!</li>
            <li>I know I have said it before, but this scent is my favorite!</li>
            <li>This is amazing stuff.  </li>
            <li>The lotion is wonderful, too, very moisturizing.</li>
            <li>This is the BEST body/hand/face cream is you have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>This is true radiant healthy skin--and great for all over the body too.</li>
            <li>I loved how they were rich yet didn&#x27;t leave residue on my skin.</li>
            <li>Also ordered the cream for elnows, feet and knees :-)</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been looking for a safe, non-toxic lotion that I can use on my skin and baby&#x27;s.</li>
            <li>This is magic in a bottle</li>
            <li>Most beauty products are chemical laden and don&#x27;t even do anything--seriously.</li>
            <li>I love to put this on my face at night</li>
            <li>Nice lotion that feels great and makes my skin soft and moist.</li>
            <li>You will be amazed at how many toxins and known carcinogens are in the products that you are buying.</li>
            <li>It is one of the best smelling lotions I have gotten in a long time</li>
            <li>have loved this line since I first found it here on Amazon.</li>
            <li>The lotion is always smooth and refreshing, never sticky.</li>
            <li>Loved the smell, clean and crisp.</li>
            <li>When I woke up I could not believe that using a product of just fruits and natural oils ( zero chemicals, thus the name 100% pure) could make me look awesome.  </li>
            <li>This particular tube is a good size though.</li>
            <li>, I found a cream that has a light, pleasant (but all natural) scent that doesn&#x27;t linger.</li>
            <li>This lotion smells wonderfully just like green apple while in the bottle</li>
            <li>I really love this fresh scent and</li>
            <li>Hope you love this product line as much as me.</li>
            <li>The scent is light and fresh.</li>
            <li>My absolute favorite is sold here on Amazon, I also use it to remove my eye makeup</li>
            <li>Absorbs quickly.</li>
            <li>Plus this cream is super nourishing to my aging skin.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s just the right amount of scent (not too strong) and smells crisp, juicy, and fresh.  </li>
            <li>particular fragrance  is nice, light and natural smelling.  </li>
            <li>I just keep an eye on it, it drop below ten bucks pretty often and lasts a good while!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love that it is all natural, and I am not allergic to anything in it.  </li>
            <li>one smelled like fresh coffee with fresh, fresh apples.</li>
            <li>Just keep using it, remember that your skin needs a few days (or more!!)</li>
            <li>This scent is so crisp and pure!</li>
            <li>A good tip for dry folks, if you are concerned that this lotion isn&#x27;t rich enough.</li>
            <li>Each one is even better than the last!!</li>
            <li>The 100% pure lotion feels fantastic on the skin, and this company is fantastic for providing an organic, TRULY natural lotion that actually smells fantastic and is reasonably priced.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Smells like fresh green apples and lasts, plus the natural ingredients are good for your skin</li>
            <li>(my eyes are super sensitive.</li>
            <li>% Pure is organic and vegan, but I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll eat it any time</li>
            <li>Pure lotion is around, I&#x27;ll keep purchasing the product.</li>
            <li>I bought three creams from 100 Pure (Apple, Coconut, and Vanilla).</li>
            <li>Nothing from the 100% pure line has ever caused me the slightest bit of irritation.</li>
            <li>I have super sensitive skin, and this is as gentle as it gets.  </li>
            <li>This one is tied with white peach as my second favorite, while mangosteen remains my number one!</li>
            <li>Really smells like juicy apples.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t even get their selling -angle, because none of what I bought ever REALLY worked for me.  </li>
            <li>I like it, just not as much as Lemon, Almond, Vanilla, and Lavender.</li>
            <li>Many, many other brands will advertise \\&quot;organic\\&quot; and \\&quot;natural\\&quot; formulations, but they are not entirely organic and natural, they still contain chemicals and</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve bought quite a few 100% pure products and generally haven&#x27;t minded the aroma because it&#x27;s light and actually appealing.  </li>
            <li>The 100% pure body creams have aloe vera as their main ingredient.  </li>
            <li>100% pure lotion feels amazing, and after using it for a few days, your skin becomes so silky!</li>
            <li>Smell doesn&#x27;t last long, but it&#x27;s a nice lotion not to creamy but works well.&lt;br /&gt;Just</li>
            <li>cream is thick and white, it spreads easily and rubs into my skin nicely.  </li>
            <li>I read the ingredients and they are all real and high quality.</li>
            <li>At least I can give them a healthy start!</li>
            <li>I searched for natural body care products and came across the 100% pure line here.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The 100% pure brand also makes a makeup line that I have been trying, I can&#x27;t believe how lush the lipsticks are.</li>
            <li>Put some in your hand and mix in a little organic oil (grapeseed is my favorite, argan or almond).</li>
            <li>Fresh clean green smell.</li>
            <li>really love the green apple scent of this lotion.  </li>
            <li>(If you are using a normal grocery store/department store lotion, you are just soaking your skin in chemicals, which can affect how you feel and</li>
            <li>(I did try coconut oil, it seems to work fine for other people, but can break me out.)</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s hard to find an apple product that smells real and fresh, while the synthetic fragrances can never imitate the true apple odor.</li>
            <li>After years of having to use fragrance free products due to skin allergies/sensitivities etc.</li>
            <li>And it&#x27;s so ironic that the beauty industry uses chemicals to &amp;#34;try&amp;#34; and make us look like we are natural and have that natural look from nature.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Now some people have super dry skin, I know I do in the wintertime.</li>
            <li>the lotion makes my skin so soft!</li>
            <li>we always get natural or organic stuff and this lotion just makes your mouth water.</li>
            <li>It leaves my body feeling soft all day.  </li>
            <li>I use it in the morning and night--it stays on, but not heavy.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It has finally completely sunk in that NO CHEMICAL</li>
            <li>my skin is so soft and supple.</li>
            <li>It leaves my skin soft and glowing.</li>
            <li>\\&quot;100% Natural and USDA Certified Organic Grapeseed Oil\\&quot; by Nature Certified.</li>
            <li>I tried every lotion and body wash in the stores, even the sensitive skin, \\&quot;gentle\\&quot; lotions, and nothing helped.</li>
            <li>This lotion never itches, burns or irritates my sensitive skin, and never causes breakouts.</li>
            <li>Try this brand, the ingredients are all natural and organic.</li>
            <li>Even if you can&#x27;t make a huge overhaul on everything you use, start small.</li>
            <li>, edible;-)I havr purchased several other fragrances and more green apple.</li>
            <li>100% Pure Green Apple Nourishing Body Cream leaves my skin feeling soft and it smells great!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It smells like a NATURAL fresh green apple, not the fake, super sweet synthetic scent we are used to from our usual lotions.</li>
            <li>Little changes here and there can really make a difference in</li>

            <li> It smells like a NATURAL fresh green apple, not the fake, super sweet synthetic scent we are used to from our usual lotions.</li>
            <li> Little changes here and there can really make a difference in</li>
            <li> your overall health in the long run.)  </li>
            <li> I like thick body creams, and 100% Pure is just the right amount of thick.  </li>
            <li> My  only issue is the bottle wont stay closed.</li>
            <li> But, as far as I&#x27;m concerned, it doesn&#x27;t smell like green apples.  </li>
            <li> I guess I don&#x27;t care as long as it does the job.  </li>
            <li> As long as 100%</li>
            <li> But once the lovely apple smell begins to fade, and boy it fades fast, it leaves behind this weird rubbing alcohol scent.</li>
            <li> I use them on my little ones especially.</li>
            <li> I think the scent is a little strange.</li>
            <li> Unlike other organic products out there, these lotion don&#x27;t smell stale.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> to recover from the other chemical junk that you have probably been putting on it for years.</li>
            <li> Everything burned, and my skin was dry again a few minutes after application.</li>
            <li> The only negative thing I can say about this product line is that it&#x27;s pricey.  </li>
            <li> If you are using another brand, spend a few minutes googleing some of the ingredients in your other lotions and shower gels, even your makeup and conditioners!</li>
            <li> If you want a moisturizing lotion go for it, it if you want something that smells like green apple then leave it alone.  </li>
            <li> I purchased this because I was wanting a green apple scent but dislike perfumes.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s such a farce.  </li>
            <li> My skin is CRAZY soft now!</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t leave my skin feeling greasy or slick</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t usually like products with scent.  </li>
            <li> You can seriously smell the quality and richness of this grapeseed oil (and I have tried a few!),</li>
            <li> They were all thick, opaque, and creamy.</li>
            <li> And check the mascara remover your are using, chances are it&#x27;s just packed full of crap and chemicals!).</li>
            <li> Disappointing.</li>

            <li> Smell doesn&#x27;t last long, but it&#x27;s a nice lotion not to creamy but works well.&lt;br /&gt;Just wish the smell lasted longer .</li>
            <li> Great! Smells like fresh green apples and lasts, plus the natural ingredients are good for your skin, edible;-)I havr purchased several other fragrances and more green apple. Also ordered the cream for elnows, feet and knees :-)</li>
            <li> If you want a moisturizing lotion go for it, it if you want something that smells like green apple then leave it alone.  This lotion smells wonderfully just like green apple while in the bottle but once you rub it on your skin the scent is gone within 5 seconds.  I purchased this because I was wanting a green apple scent but dislike perfumes. I could&#x27;ve gotten 3 unscented &amp;#34;pure&amp;#34; body creams anwywhere for $13. This was a mistake on my part. I will not  purchase any &amp;#34;scented&amp;#34; lotions from this label after having  this experience unless I plan to leave it in the bottle with the cap off so I can actually tell that it has a scent.</li>
            <li> we always get natural or organic stuff and this lotion just makes your mouth water. It moisturizes well and has a medium consistency. My wife can&#x27;t get enough of it. Really smells like juicy apples.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for quite some time and been helping my skin making it feel enriched. Thank-you</li>
            <li> My  only issue is the bottle wont stay closed. Smells great. Non greasy. Absorbs quickly.</li>
            <li> 100% Pure Green Apple Nourishing Body Cream leaves my skin feeling soft and it smells great!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really love the green apple scent of this lotion.  It&#x27;s just the right amount of scent (not too strong) and smells crisp, juicy, and fresh.  It actually makes my mouth water!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cream is thick and white, it spreads easily and rubs into my skin nicely.  It leaves my body feeling soft all day.  I like thick body creams, and 100% Pure is just the right amount of thick.  It doesn&#x27;t leave my skin feeling greasy or slick either.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;100% Pure is organic and vegan, but I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll eat it any time soon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a great body cream that I love to use.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for a safe, non-toxic lotion that I can use on my skin and baby&#x27;s. This is perfect and the apple scent smells just like Granny Smith apples - not too strong and delicious!</li>
            <li> This is the BEST body/hand/face cream is you have sensitive skin. After years of having to use fragrance free products due to skin allergies/sensitivities etc., I found a cream that has a light, pleasant (but all natural) scent that doesn&#x27;t linger. Plus this cream is super nourishing to my aging skin.</li>
            <li> I like the ingredients and the texture of this cream.  But, as far as I&#x27;m concerned, it doesn&#x27;t smell like green apples.  I&#x27;ve bought quite a few 100% pure products and generally haven&#x27;t minded the aroma because it&#x27;s light and actually appealing.  I don&#x27;t usually like products with scent.  This cream however, doesn&#x27;t smell like its name.  I guess I don&#x27;t care as long as it does the job.  The only negative thing I can say about this product line is that it&#x27;s pricey.  This particular tube is a good size though.</li>
            <li> If you are a person who buys off informercials from the stars like I used to, to find that &amp;#34;thing&amp;#34;  this is it--this product line.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought this to replace my face cream actually, because I got a sample and tried it on my hands and put some on my face before bed since there wasn&#x27;t a lot in the sample.  When I woke up I could not believe that using a product of just fruits and natural oils ( zero chemicals, thus the name 100% pure) could make me look awesome.  This is amazing stuff.  I use it in the morning and night--it stays on, but not heavy.  This is true radiant healthy skin--and great for all over the body too. This is magic in a bottle and I haven&#x27;t even attempted to go further and buy facial formulas etc. yet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has finally completely sunk in that NO CHEMICAL can EVER do what nature can do.  And it&#x27;s so ironic that the beauty industry uses chemicals to &amp;#34;try&amp;#34; and make us look like we are natural and have that natural look from nature. It&#x27;s such a farce.  Most beauty products are chemical laden and don&#x27;t even do anything--seriously. I don&#x27;t even get their selling -angle, because none of what I bought ever REALLY worked for me.  I just used products, but never saw a difference.  They were just beauty routines I was doing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This particular fragrance  is nice, light and natural smelling.  Hope you love this product line as much as me.</li>
            <li> This smells like apple candy. I love to put this on my face at night and I wake up my skin is so soft and supple.</li>
            <li> Wonderful apple smell! It smells like granny smith apples, not fuji. I really love this fresh scent and the lotion makes my skin so soft!</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this lotion! I&#x27;ve been using it for about a year. The scent is light and fresh. It leaves my skin soft and glowing. I&#x27;m not exaggerating. As long as 100% Pure lotion is around, I&#x27;ll keep purchasing the product.</li>
            <li> Fresh clean green smell. Nice lotion that feels great and makes my skin soft and moist. What else is there? Perfect.</li>
            <li> This is a very nice body cream, but not at the top of my list. I like it, just not as much as Lemon, Almond, Vanilla, and Lavender. I think the scent is a little strange. I got this because the reviews were good, but when it&#x27;s gone, I won&#x27;t order it again. Just not up to my standards.</li>
            <li> This lotion does get the job done however, the biggest reason I bought it was for the smell. When you first put the lotion on it smells WONDERFUL! But once the lovely apple smell begins to fade, and boy it fades fast, it leaves behind this weird rubbing alcohol scent. Disappointing.</li>
            <li> I love that it is all natural, and I am not allergic to anything in it.  Loved the smell, clean and crisp. The lotion is wonderful, too, very moisturizing.</li>
            <li> I bought three creams from 100 Pure (Apple, Coconut, and Vanilla). I loved how they were rich yet didn&#x27;t leave residue on my skin. They were all thick, opaque, and creamy. I read the ingredients and they are all real and high quality. No synthetic fillers or any sort. Unlike other organic products out there, these lotion don&#x27;t smell stale.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This one smelled like fresh coffee with fresh, fresh apples. It&#x27;s hard to find an apple product that smells real and fresh, while the synthetic fragrances can never imitate the true apple odor. I am a fan!</li>
            <li> I received this as a gift. It is one of the best smelling lotions I have gotten in a long time</li>
            <li> This scent is so crisp and pure! It smells like a NATURAL fresh green apple, not the fake, super sweet synthetic scent we are used to from our usual lotions. This one is tied with white peach as my second favorite, while mangosteen remains my number one! The 100% pure body creams have aloe vera as their main ingredient.  I have super sensitive skin, and this is as gentle as it gets.  Nothing from the 100% pure line has ever caused me the slightest bit of irritation. The lotion is always smooth and refreshing, never sticky. (If you are using a normal grocery store/department store lotion, you are just soaking your skin in chemicals, which can affect how you feel and your overall health in the long run.)  The 100% pure lotion feels fantastic on the skin, and this company is fantastic for providing an organic, TRULY natural lotion that actually smells fantastic and is reasonably priced.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now some people have super dry skin, I know I do in the wintertime. A good tip for dry folks, if you are concerned that this lotion isn&#x27;t rich enough. Put some in your hand and mix in a little organic oil (grapeseed is my favorite, argan or almond). Rub your hands together and apply to your skin. (I did try coconut oil, it seems to work fine for other people, but can break me out.) My absolute favorite is sold here on Amazon, I also use it to remove my eye makeup (my eyes are super sensitive. And check the mascara remover your are using, chances are it&#x27;s just packed full of crap and chemicals!). You can seriously smell the quality and richness of this grapeseed oil (and I have tried a few!), \\&quot;100% Natural and USDA Certified Organic Grapeseed Oil\\&quot; by Nature Certified. I just keep an eye on it, it drop below ten bucks pretty often and lasts a good while!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So here&#x27;s what we already know...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have loved this line since I first found it here on Amazon. I have used \\&quot;mall brand\\&quot; lotions and body care products for years. My skin began savagely breaking out, and took forever to heal. I tried every lotion and body wash in the stores, even the sensitive skin, \\&quot;gentle\\&quot; lotions, and nothing helped. Everything burned, and my skin was dry again a few minutes after application. I searched for natural body care products and came across the 100% pure line here. This is one of the only two body care lines that I have found that actually has ALL (100%!)natural ingredients. Many, many other brands will advertise \\&quot;organic\\&quot; and \\&quot;natural\\&quot; formulations, but they are not entirely organic and natural, they still contain chemicals and carcinogens.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This 100% pure lotion feels amazing, and after using it for a few days, your skin becomes so silky! Just keep using it, remember that your skin needs a few days (or more!!) to recover from the other chemical junk that you have probably been putting on it for years. My skin is CRAZY soft now! This lotion never itches, burns or irritates my sensitive skin, and never causes breakouts. I know I have said it before, but this scent is my favorite! Each one is even better than the last!! It leaves my skin feeling great!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The 100% pure brand also makes a makeup line that I have been trying, I can&#x27;t believe how lush the lipsticks are. If you are using another brand, spend a few minutes googleing some of the ingredients in your other lotions and shower gels, even your makeup and conditioners! You will be amazed at how many toxins and known carcinogens are in the products that you are buying. Your skin is your biggest organ, and it absorbs what you put on it. Overloading your body with toxic chemicals (lotions, makeup, etc.) can affect your hormones, your energy levels and your health. Even if you can&#x27;t make a huge overhaul on everything you use, start small. Try this brand, the ingredients are all natural and organic. I use them on my little ones especially. At least I can give them a healthy start! Give this brand a chance, you won&#x27;t regret it! Little changes here and there can really make a difference in how you feel!e a difference in how you feel!</li>
