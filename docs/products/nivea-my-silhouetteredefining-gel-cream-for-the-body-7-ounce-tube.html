            <li>so i am too : ))</li>
            <li>so it was an okay buy</li>
            <li>However, my husband and I love its smell.</li>

            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>I love it</li>
            <li>I LOVE THIS PRODUCT I USE TO BUY IT AT CVS</li>
            <li>I LOVE</li>
            <li>so I am not 100% sure</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m just about finished my bottle and will definitealey be buying more.</li>
            <li>My shapes appears more softer.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s ok, did not notice any difference</li>
            <li>Feeling more positive about yourself translates into more confidence and that&#x27;s a good thing.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It makes my skin silky soft, and it smells great too.</li>
            <li>The smell is quite wonderful, it&#x27;s a green tea based cream</li>
            <li>It makes my skin feel really nice, smooth and soft.</li>
            <li>I might have seen been more positive about the results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s light and nor greasy but very moisturizing!!</li>
            <li>Have to make a habit of applying creams in order for them to have a full effect.  </li>
            <li>and I really didn&#x27;t think this would work because most products like this claim to work but don&#x27;t.</li>
            <li>It does evaporate or penetrates quickly however.</li>
            <li>BUT it makes me feel comfortably confident ready for anything ;)</li>
            <li>Not a miracle worker which is fine nothing really is.</li>
            <li>I cannot know for sure if it really redefines the area, but my skin is so much softer after using this.</li>
            <li>Nivea redefines my shape to where my figure looks better in my tight fitting clothes.</li>
            <li>This is a great product but you have to wait at least 4 weeks to see results.</li>
            <li>and they looked smooth, soft, and shiny.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m on my 3rd bottles and it seems like it didn&#x27;t work for me, but i was wondering how many bottles did you ladies use and it worked?</li>
            <li>I suspect without the photos which helped me be more objective</li>
            <li>IT&#x27;S PRETTY IMMEDIATE FOR ME</li>
            <li>I bought this when it first came out</li>
            <li>this really helped ALOT!</li>
            <li>:) as soon as i stopped using it, within days saw the cellulite come back</li>
            <li>Remember when something is too good to be true it usually is!  </li>
            <li>But...it&#x27;s a very small cost for great results.</li>
            <li>I put it on lower body and didn&#x27;t notice much difference at first.  </li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t really tell if its working or not, but it makes me feel better just to think that it might possibly be working, so I keep using since the price is reasonable.</li>
            <li>FOR WEARING CERTAIN CLOTHES BECAUSE IT DOES WORK .</li>
            <li>There really isn&#x27;t a smell to it at all.</li>
            <li>so you really can&#x27;t get away from it.</li>
            <li>and it works very well</li>
            <li>Though it did moisturize very well.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using it for about a month, and I have noticed that it really does work.</li>
            <li>The smell really stimulates my husband when we have intimate relationship.</li>
            <li>I am not a thin girl by any stretch of the imagination</li>
            <li>i receive this product today, and i really hope that it works after i use it.</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t really see any difference on my skin.</li>
            <li>Thanks so much</li>
            <li>but this stuff really does work.</li>
            <li>I saw a professional review of this item on another site and thought I would try one more time to see if a lotion could actually do what it promised.</li>
            <li>You MUST use it regularly for a month to get the full firming benefit and continuously thereafter.</li>
            <li>My skin is soft and much tighter.  </li>
            <li>I ran out of the tightning serum I normally use on my face</li>
            <li>But I really love it, I bought another bottle a few days ago.</li>
            <li>Much better results than those heavy lotions.</li>
            <li>Exercising is just plain better.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know if my silhouette has changed any, yet, but I am opening a new tube tomorrow.  </li>
            <li>Of course I stocked up via Amazon because this is one of the few items that really provide satiny, smooth skin without the sticky, greasy residue.</li>
            <li>it clearly says that it helps tighten your skin (it doesn&#x27;t even have the world &#x27;cellulite&#x27; in the title!</li>
            <li>WOW!  </li>
            <li>So far I&#x27;ve been using it for about 3weeks faithfully</li>
            <li>I like the smell of it and it leaves your skin soft but not so much as the other creams I have used from Nivea.</li>
            <li>This cream takes quite a long time to dry, but it&#x27;s working pretty well for the price.  </li>

            <li> This cream takes quite a long time to dry, but it&#x27;s working pretty well for the price.  </li>
            <li> I have been using the Nivea redefining gel-cream for a long time.</li>
            <li> leaves a strange odor as well.</li>
            <li> got ride of the dry skin spots on my arms.</li>
            <li> It is not oily but I do let it dry a bit before putting on clothes.</li>
            <li> third time i bought it, n used it continues , it doesn&#x27;t work, not worth my money.</li>
            <li> I was a little hesitant to put this all over my body, chosing only the \\&quot;problem\\&quot; areas, because the lotion seemed to be astringent.  </li>
            <li> It does not leave you feeling moisturized, and there is certainly no noticeable difference in cellulite or smoothness.</li>
            <li> But.. girls --I&#x27;m telling you -- try this for 4 weeks and you will see a difference - for such a small investment.</li>
            <li> For me, I would not buy it again or any other brand of hope in a tube.</li>
            <li> not worth the $$ you spend on it.</li>
            <li> THE BLOAT GOES DOWN</li>
            <li> Perhaps if your young and wafer thin and bothered by a few imperfections it may show some change.</li>
            <li> This product make my skin feel tight and refreshed..</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s almost like a green goo.  </li>
            <li> I used it everyday, twice a day and saw no results on my abdomen, thighs, or butt.</li>
            <li> product sucks,</li>
            <li> she is too lazy to exercise!..</li>
            <li> HARD TO FIND!  </li>
            <li> It wasn&#x27;t bad just not what I expected it to be.</li>
            <li> I was a bit skeptical but figured it would not hurt to try.  </li>
            <li> To avoid an expensive law suit the company agreed to pay $900,000 in restitution to people who bought the cream</li>
            <li> I was reading this story and was wondering of this fake cream was still being sold.</li>
            <li> ive had bad cellulite even though im thin all my life..</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this off and on through the years and am so sad this seems to be going away :(</li>
            <li> I was very skeptical.</li>
            <li> I was shocked</li>
            <li> Disappointed in this.</li>

    <ol>
            <li> The smell is quite wonderful, it&#x27;s a green tea based cream so I walk out smelling great and somewhat relaxed.</li>
            <li> Great product, does exactly what it says it will do, tightens and firms!! Would recommend to women over 40 specifically!</li>
            <li> This is a great product but you have to wait at least 4 weeks to see results. I was very skeptical. But...it&#x27;s a very small cost for great results. The consistency of the product is not like lotion it&#x27;s like gel and it&#x27;s kinda watery. There really isn&#x27;t a smell to it at all. It&#x27;s almost like a green goo.  I put it on lower body and didn&#x27;t notice much difference at first.  I used it for about 4 weeks as the bottle says instead of lotion.  After 4 weeks - I went to gym and noticed the backs of my thighs in the mirror and they looked smooth, soft, and shiny. WOW!  I&#x27;m 31 and run. But sometimes even when you excersize you can start to see the signs of aging and cellulite. It&#x27;s genetic so you really can&#x27;t get away from it. It creeped up on me -- a marathoner --ugh.  But.. girls --I&#x27;m telling you -- try this for 4 weeks and you will see a difference - for such a small investment.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if body type matters when using these products, but I&#x27;ve noticed cellulite and wanted help. I started exercising and needed something that would keep my skin&#x27;s elasticity in tact. I used it everyday, twice a day and saw no results on my abdomen, thighs, or butt.</li>
            <li> I ran out of the tightning serum I normally use on my face so I use My Silhouette on my face.  It works great!  My skin is soft and much tighter.  This works much better than anything else I&#x27;ve tried!</li>
            <li> i bought this lotion for my girlfriend.. she is too lazy to exercise!.. so she wanted this cream for firmer,smoother skin around her tummy,neck and legs..and it works very well,she is happy so i am too : ))</li>
            <li> I wont buy this again. It wasn&#x27;t bad just not what I expected it to be. I used it on my thighs, waist, and arms. I&#x27; saw no difference. Though it did moisturize very well. got ride of the dry skin spots on my arms. so it was an okay buy</li>
            <li> I LOVE this lotion!! I&#x27;ve been using it for about a month, and I have noticed that it really does work. The skin around my belly, hips, and thighs seems to be tighter. Just to let people know, it is NOT a cellulite lotion...it clearly says that it helps tighten your skin (it doesn&#x27;t even have the world &#x27;cellulite&#x27; in the title! HELLO!) But I really love it, I bought another bottle a few days ago. It makes my skin silky soft, and it smells great too.</li>
            <li> I do not think this product works as it claimed. However, my husband and I love its smell. The smell really stimulates my husband when we have intimate relationship. Therefore, I brought it for its wonderful smell!</li>
            <li> I was a little hesitant to put this all over my body, chosing only the \\&quot;problem\\&quot; areas, because the lotion seemed to be astringent.  After only 2 weeks my skin has the feel of satin.  Much better results than those heavy lotions. I don&#x27;t know if my silhouette has changed any, yet, but I am opening a new tube tomorrow.  I love this stuff.</li>
            <li> I have used this product on and off over the years and I can see some smoothness or I might even say some tightness of my skin when I use the product on a regular basis.  I am not a thin girl by any stretch of the imagination so I don&#x27;t expect miracles, but I can say that it does something good to my thighs, butt, lower backside love handles and under arms.</li>
            <li> i receive this product today, and i really hope that it works after i use it. to be honest, it&#x27;s really cheap here so i&#x27;m satisfied.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for two weeks and I just ordered 3 more tubes today. I cannot know for sure if it really redefines the area, but my skin is so much softer after using this.</li>
            <li> Earlier I bought one for my girl friend to try out and she said it just worked for her. She can see the result, therefore I bought another 2 bottles.</li>
            <li> I have been using the Nivea redefining gel-cream for a long time. It makes my skin feel really nice, smooth and soft. Not only did I notice a difference in the softness but also the tightness of my skin. It is not oily but I do let it dry a bit before putting on clothes. I love it most on my butt and thighs, it makes those areas feel tighter. It makes me feel confident and sexy.</li>
            <li> product sucks, third time i bought it, n used it continues , it doesn&#x27;t work, not worth my money. no lo compres.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m on my 3rd bottles and it seems like it didn&#x27;t work for me, but i was wondering how many bottles did you ladies use and it worked? Cause i&#x27;m still debating if i should order my 2nd package or not. So someone please reply back asap.  Thanks</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this off and on through the years and am so sad this seems to be going away :( Of course I stocked up via Amazon because this is one of the few items that really provide satiny, smooth skin without the sticky, greasy residue. You MUST use it regularly for a month to get the full firming benefit and continuously thereafter. I just like the way it makes my skin feel and the the compliments I receive. The scent smells nice and doesn&#x27;t \\&quot;fight\\&quot; with your perfume. I can&#x27;t tell you IF it firms the \\&quot;fluffy\\&quot; parts BUT it makes me feel comfortably confident ready for anything ;)</li>
            <li> I bought this cream when it was promoted as a cream that would reduce the appearance of cellulite bumps.  I was a bit skeptical but figured it would not hurt to try.  This gel-cream worked well as moisturizer.  I took pictures of the \\&quot;problem area\\&quot; once a week, and saw no noticeable visual improvement to cellulite areas in 4 week and 6 weeks. I suspect without the photos which helped me be more objective I might have seen been more positive about the results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Apparently, I was not alone in my experience. Nivea recently reached a settlement with Federal Trade Commission about overblown claims about this product.  To avoid an expensive law suit the company agreed to pay $900,000 in restitution to people who bought the cream (one needs to have saved the receipt to prove the purchase has been made, of course).  Nivea still sells creams that claim to reduce cellulite if they are applied regularly to thighs, low lower back area and stomach, but now as part of the settlement their web site contains a disclaimer \\&quot;This is not a weight or fat loss product.  No topical product has been shown to eliminate cellulite.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Placebo effect of the cream should not be totally dismissed. Feeling more positive about yourself translates into more confidence and that&#x27;s a good thing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ali Julia review</li>
            <li> Love this product it smells amazing feels great and is so good on the skin. Have to make a habit of applying creams in order for them to have a full effect.  Have to always use it. Not a miracle worker which is fine nothing really is.</li>
            <li> I try it until I ran out of it, it works good but not soo great. I like the smell of it and it leaves your skin soft but not so much as the other creams I have used from Nivea.</li>
            <li> I just ordered my 4th tube of this. I love it. I use it on my feet but also on my hands and lower legs/knees. It&#x27;s light and nor greasy but very moisturizing!! I love it and I&#x27;ll use it every where I need extra moisture without the greasy feeling!!!</li>
            <li> I LOVE THIS PRODUCT I USE TO BUY IT AT CVS BUT THEY NO LONGER SELL IT ANYWHERE. HARD TO FIND!  I&#x27;M IN GOOD SHAPE I JUST SEEM TO BLOAT UP AT MY LOWER STOMACH AND SIDES OF WAIST.  I RUB SOME ON MY STOMACH AND SIDES AND I CAN LOOK IN THE MIRROR AS THE BLOAT GOES DOWN IT&#x27;S PRETTY IMMEDIATE FOR ME I LOVE IT IT&#x27;S A MUST FOR WEARING CERTAIN CLOTHES BECAUSE IT DOES WORK . a+++++++</li>
            <li> It seams to work but I don&#x27;t use it regularly so I am not 100% sure</li>
            <li> doesn&#x27;t help. sticky. not worth the $$ you spend on it. leaves a strange odor as well. just gross. gross.</li>
            <li> I bought this when it first came out and I really didn&#x27;t think this would work because most products like this claim to work but don&#x27;t. So far I&#x27;ve been using it for about 3weeks faithfully and I have noticed the difference. I use it mon my thighs and waist as recomended 2X a day &amp; my thighs dont rub together anymore and I also excercise on my WII a couple times a week. I&#x27;m just about finished my bottle and will definitealey be buying more.</li>
            <li> Nivea redefines my shape to where my figure looks better in my tight fitting clothes. My shapes appears more softer.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t really see any difference on my skin. For me was another body lotion that didn&#x27;t deliver as promised. Wouldn&#x27;t buy again</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ok, did not notice any difference</li>
            <li> This gel is awesome. I use it twice daily plus I workout. It has done a great job and everyone has notice I have lost weight. Im not out of shape anyway I just want to keep myself tones up because Im 41 and refuse to let myself go. Thanks so much and I love it! NIVEA MY SILHUOTTE GEL!</li>
            <li> This cream takes quite a long time to dry, but it&#x27;s working pretty well for the price.  I would buy it again</li>
            <li> I was shocked but this stuff really does work. ive had bad cellulite even though im thin all my life..this really helped ALOT! :) as soon as i stopped using it, within days saw the cellulite come back</li>
            <li> I was reading this story and was wondering of this fake cream was still being sold. I guess so! Remember when something is too good to be true it usually is!  [....]</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in  love with this product, it&#x27;s Very nice! Works a lot!!!&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m gonna to  use more before this one!!!!</li>
            <li> just started using this product and don&#x27;t see any real true results but I will update it after three weeks to give it time to work and give a fair review</li>
            <li> I saw a professional review of this item on another site and thought I would try one more time to see if a lotion could actually do what it promised. Forget about it! This is a gel which is sticky going on. It does evaporate or penetrates quickly however. It does not leave you feeling moisturized, and there is certainly no noticeable difference in cellulite or smoothness. I bought 6 bottles to give it a fair chance. Perhaps if your young and wafer thin and bothered by a few imperfections it may show some change. For me, I would not buy it again or any other brand of hope in a tube.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re wanting it to tone your skin, I suggest you don&#x27;t hold your breath. It does work good as a moisturizer and has a very light non-intrusive scent.</li>
            <li> I used this gel cream religiously hoping SOMETHING would happen. Nope, nothing changed. Disappointed in this. Exercising is just plain better. I guess taking the easy way out is just not that great.</li>
            <li> This product make my skin feel tight and refreshed..Has a very nice smell and so easy to use..I plan on letting my Friends know about this product..&lt;br /&gt;Sandy&lt;br /&gt;Marysville,CA</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t really tell if its working or not, but it makes me feel better just to think that it might possibly be working, so I keep using since the price is reasonable.</li>
