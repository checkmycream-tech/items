            <li>It&#x27;s a fantastic deal.  </li>
            <li>It leaves your hair smooth and helps to repair split ends.</li>
            <li>Even my hair dresser was concerned and confirmed this weekend it was not my imagination.</li>
            <li>Well worth paying a bit more for this conditioner.</li>
            <li>This is a fantastic product.</li>
            <li>My stylist introduced me to this stuff when I got my first keratin treatment, and I love it.</li>
            <li>and it really tames it and makes it so much more manageable.</li>
            <li>It makes my hair much softer and more manageable.</li>

            <li>Great product makes my thin hair feel thicker</li>
            <li>but I actually really do like it</li>
            <li>Sure I still get a few strands here and there, but not like when I was using</li>
            <li>and once you pull the pump you can&#x27;t push it down to fit the cap over.</li>
            <li>I have a really dry scalp and it can be embarrassing if not treated with the right conditioner.</li>
            <li>I had the treatment professionally at a salon</li>
            <li>Now they are smooth and repaired my split ends after a few weeks.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used this keratin treatment on my natural hair for over a year now.</li>

            <li> love how it feels and my thick coarse hair.</li>
            <li> I am very disappointed my hair reacted this way because I really liked the way my hair looked at first.</li>
            <li> My ends used to be dry and \\&quot;crispy\\&quot; from using a flat iron.</li>
            <li> I have grey hair</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve noticed if i use other shampoos, it degrades the Keratin a lot quicker and my hair doesn&#x27;t feel or look the same.</li>
            <li> shipping is fast and the product is real and SOOO much less expensive than salon.</li>
            <li> My hair can be problematic - naturally wavy, so hard to straighten or curl.</li>
            <li> /&gt;After three months of losing at least 50% of my hair volume, I decided to stop using the GK shampoo and conditioner and go back to the products I had been using prior to the keratin treatment.</li>
            <li> And just a little applied to the ends goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use any other products.</li>
            <li> It moisturizers dry damaged hair without making it greasy or heavy.</li>
            <li> Sometimes I put a little on the ends of my wet hair after I shower--extra conditioning and the scent</li>
            <li> There is really no reason for it and a waste of plastic.</li>
            <li> It makes my hair silky without weighing it down.  </li>
            <li> a little goes a lot my hair feel</li>
            <li> I also color my hair and it helps to use the moisturizing so that it doesn&#x27;t get dried out.  </li>
            <li> Very heavy, my hair does not hold a curl...</li>
            <li> I was quite skeptical about buying the Keratin system online.  </li>
            <li> I gave -1 star because it comes with a useless cap</li>
            <li> He found nothing medically wrong.</li>

            <li> Very heavy, my hair does not hold a curl...love how it feels and my thick coarse hair.</li>
            <li> great!  Came packed very well and secure.</li>
            <li> One of the best conditioners you can use for your hair to help eliminate frizz and create shine. Love this product. Good seller!</li>
            <li> This keratin conditioner, in particular, leaves my hair super silky. It&#x27;s also easier to style hair if one uses a very good shampoo/conditioner containing keratin. I&#x27;ve found Global to be top-quality!</li>
            <li> Great product. My hair felt more naturally curly after use, but one drawback is it makes my fine hair feel greasy faster. So I rotate it around, and I love it. Fragrance is kind of unisex in my opinion.</li>
            <li> I was quite skeptical about buying the Keratin system online.  I had the treatment professionally at a salon and they used a different brand, but I wanted to try to see if I could do it at home to save time and money.  I bought the Keratin, then the shampoo and conditioner. I&#x27;ve noticed if i use other shampoos, it degrades the Keratin a lot quicker and my hair doesn&#x27;t feel or look the same.</li>
            <li> Great product is worth the money and does not strip hair and makes it healthier to grow. I just love it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this conditioner since my stylist recommended it. It makes my hair silky without weighing it down.  I was sure surprised to see how large this bottle is.  It&#x27;s a fantastic deal.  You get a lot for your money with this product.</li>
            <li> My friend recommended this, after a salon used it on her hair. The bottle is huge, and lasts forever, and the smell is wonderful. Sometimes I put a little on the ends of my wet hair after I shower--extra conditioning and the scent lasts a bit longer.</li>
            <li> I have grey hair and it really tames it and makes it so much more manageable. I also color my hair and it helps to use the moisturizing so that it doesn&#x27;t get dried out.  I have also used the balancing shampoo and conditioner as well.</li>
            <li> Excellent conditioner. Have ordered several times.</li>
            <li> Love it. Great product. I am using shampoo and conditioner from this brand and they are really great for keratin applied hairs.</li>
            <li> Great buy. Received quickly</li>
            <li> This is a great conditioning product. It leaves your hair smooth and helps to repair split ends.</li>
            <li> I got a sample size of this from GlossyBox. I have a really dry scalp and it can be embarrassing if not treated with the right conditioner. I have tried everything from T-Gel to Head and Shoulder. This came in a huge bottle - which i love for the price - and an easy to use pump. I no longer have those unattractive flakes on my scalp. My ends used to be dry and \\&quot;crispy\\&quot; from using a flat iron. Now they are smooth and repaired my split ends after a few weeks. It also smells delicious! I get compliments on the smell all the time plus my shower smells great after. I gave -1 star because it comes with a useless cap and once you pull the pump you can&#x27;t push it down to fit the cap over. There is really no reason for it and a waste of plastic. Maybe make the cap a bit bigger to cover when not being used? Not needed anyway so I just threw it away.</li>
            <li> I had received a keratin treatment on my hair about there months ago. It was great at first and I really liked the GK shampoo and conditioner. After a couple of weeks I noticed I was losing gobs of hair. Everytime I ran my finers through my hair i would get handfuls of strands. I went to my doctor who did a blood workup. He found nothing medically wrong. But my hair kept falling out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After three months of losing at least 50% of my hair volume, I decided to stop using the GK shampoo and conditioner and go back to the products I had been using prior to the keratin treatment. My hair stopped falling out that day. Sure I still get a few strands here and there, but not like when I was using GK.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I emailed Global Keratin to ask if they knew what was in their product to cause such a reaction, hoping there would be something to counteract the damage, but they never replied. I am very disappointed my hair reacted this way because I really liked the way my hair looked at first. Now I&#x27;m just hoping my hair grows back. Even my hair dresser was concerned and confirmed this weekend it was not my imagination. I had lost a massive amount of hair. Obviously everyone doesn&#x27;t have this reaction and I wish someone would explain why I did.</li>
            <li> My hair can be problematic - naturally wavy, so hard to straighten or curl. My stylist introduced me to this stuff when I got my first keratin treatment, and I love it. It makes my hair much softer and more manageable. And just a little applied to the ends goes a long way. I think this bottle will last me well over a year!</li>
            <li> i love love love Ive already ordered 3 times!! i am a serial conditioner and I have finally found my 1 and only! shipping is fast and the product is real and SOOO much less expensive than salon. will order again... and again and again</li>
            <li> Great product makes my thin hair feel thicker</li>
            <li> I love this conditioner it is the best I have used so far. a little goes a lot my hair feel so soft smelling great and it works perfect for the karetain treated hair.</li>
            <li> Well worth paying a bit more for this conditioner. Amazon always seems to have the best price for it and it works great. Only conditioner I use now. Leaves hair soft and strong</li>
            <li> My hair feels and looks so much better even after one wash. Big bottles with a pump. Very good price too for the size!</li>
            <li> Arrived quickly and loved the products-- Great service and it smooths even the toughest hair.&lt;br /&gt;I love the whole line of products</li>
            <li> This is a fantastic product. It moisturizers dry damaged hair without making it greasy or heavy. It&#x27;s the perfect compliment to the shampoo. I don&#x27;t use any other products.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this keratin treatment on my natural hair for over a year now. The conditioner is perfect for my 3C/4A hair and leaves it very manageable. If I ever stop using the treatment I will probably keep using this conditioner...its THAT good.</li>
            <li> ordered this product 2x from Amazon.. great product, not watered down and packaged properly.  I have had the gk treatment and this conditioner is a must. When the stylist recommended it I thought they just wanted me to buy their products but I actually really do like it</li>
            <li> This is a great keratin product for frizzy or keratin treated hair. i use the shampoo and conditioner and love them both.</li>
