            <li>It&#x27;s got this unmistakably &amp;#34;lime&amp;#34; scent to it, of course; nice and citrus-y on the &amp;#34;cooler&amp;#34; --</li>

            <li>great product, i use it for all products that i make, high quality and great service</li>
            <li>Love this amazing oil.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s definitely a strong scent... would recommend smelling it elsewhere if you are on the fence about &amp;#34;lime!&amp;#34; but I love it!</li>
            <li>I really love this scent.  </li>
            <li>I love this smell.</li>
            <li>and I love it</li>
            <li>I gave a five star rating because it smells like a delicious key lime pie!</li>
            <li>Just be sure to mix this with a carrier oil (I used almond) if you plan on using it for soap, lotions, etc.</li>
            <li>It isn&#x27;t a whole lot of oil, but the price and quality are great.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s clean and fresh, loving mixing it with Vanilla and Lavender too!</li>
            <li>Scent has longevity and is clean, spirited, and up lifting.  </li>
            <li>Smells like real limes, very potent, use sparingly</li>
            <li>Shipped quickly!  </li>
            <li>I love the smell it came quick</li>
            <li>Smells great mixed in with sea salt and coconut oil for a luxurious hand scrub</li>
            <li>But for now, I enjoy them rubbed into my skin.</li>
            <li>It cost more than some but worth it.</li>
            <li>This scent is crisp, and refreshing.</li>
            <li>I have used this brand essential oil before with good results would recommend and use this again.</li>
            <li>A good add for a summer personal blend.</li>
            <li>Shipped quickly</li>
            <li>mean, the quality is great, but the scent is too strong for my taste.</li>
            <li>I really do like this unique oil.</li>
            <li>More regular lime than key lime but still quote lovely!</li>
            <li>Very pure.</li>
            <li>You get their product catalog and a little guide with tips on what oils to use for what which I actually loved.</li>
            <li>I made some lip balm using beeswax, sweet almond oil and Keylime essential oil that smells fantastic.</li>
            <li>and I just made my first batch of salt scrub with this oil.  </li>
            <li>Fast shipping!</li>
            <li>Edens Garden is 100% pure , no additives, bases, fillers, or synthetics.</li>
            <li>Some other are bigger but not as strong of scent which means you use more</li>
            <li>very synthetic aroma.</li>
            <li>Very prompt shipping</li>
            <li>Thank you so much.</li>
            <li>However I wish it smelled like the real lime fruit.  </li>
            <li>really admire this potent little bottle.</li>
            <li>use my oil in an essential oil diffuser, but you can use this in so many different ways.</li>
            <li>Right on target for key lime lovers.  </li>
            <li>New business idea?</li>
            <li>It smells like key lime, but if you use it more than suggested, it kills the other scents.</li>
            <li>They do not last long on the skin, as with most essential oils.</li>
            <li>Not to mention the affordability this seller offers.  </li>
            <li>Key lime is one of the strongest smelling essential oils I have bought from Edens Garden, it smells just as expected, a sort of exotic yet still limey smell.</li>
            <li>I love citrus and tropical smells, so I am extra infatuated with this oil.</li>
            <li>have only used this a few times want to try making lotion bar and soap with it and or cleaning will report than with more indept report</li>
            <li>This is very different from most of the ones i usually get</li>
            <li>From all the oils I bought so far from Edens Garden, Key Lime is the one I like the least.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>refreshingly cool -- end of the citrus essential oil spectrum -- do you know what I mean?</li>

            <li> I take aromatherapy seriously</li>

            <li> Smells wonderful! My favorite scent!</li>
            <li> just started will update</li>
            <li> I made some lip balm using beeswax, sweet almond oil and Keylime essential oil that smells fantastic. I made it for me, but when people smell it - and feel it on their lips, they ask me to make them some, too! New business idea?</li>
            <li> The aroma of key lime is very sharp compared to lime (Citrus aurantifolia) and  very masculine. I really do like this unique oil.</li>
            <li> This scent is crisp, and refreshing. I purchased both this and the lime, curious of the difference. This has a sharper scent than the regular lime.</li>
            <li> I really love this scent.  Right on target for key lime lovers.  Not to mention the affordability this seller offers.  Thank you</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s got this unmistakably &amp;#34;lime&amp;#34; scent to it, of course; nice and citrus-y on the &amp;#34;cooler&amp;#34; -- refreshingly cool -- end of the citrus essential oil spectrum -- do you know what I mean? This oil also has a subtle, masculine base note to it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really admire this potent little bottle. I may end up making a cologne out of it and giving it to a friend.</li>
            <li> From all the oils I bought so far from Edens Garden, Key Lime is the one I like the least.&lt;br /&gt;I mean, the quality is great, but the scent is too strong for my taste. It smells like key lime, but if you use it more than suggested, it kills the other scents.</li>
            <li> very synthetic aroma.</li>
            <li> Very pure. I use it in my creams for skin! Works very good..</li>
            <li> Shipped quickly!  This oils are amazing!!!  Great product!!</li>
            <li> I love the smell it came quick and I just love it! I will order this one again and again&amp;#62;</li>
            <li> I love this smell. This is very different from most of the ones i usually get and I love it</li>
            <li> Smells great mixed in with sea salt and coconut oil for a luxurious hand scrub</li>
            <li> Shipped quickly and I just made my first batch of salt scrub with this oil.  Nice and fragrant citrus aroma.</li>
            <li> I love citrus and tropical smells, so I am extra infatuated with this oil. One day I will use these oils for soaps and lotions, when I have time... But for now, I enjoy them rubbed into my skin. They do not last long on the skin, as with most essential oils. so I will have to find something to extend it.</li>
            <li> Scent has longevity and is clean, spirited, and up lifting.  I would buy again and recommend to others to buy.</li>
            <li> few drops of this in some almond oil, and a massage and my baby is snoring- she adores this scent.</li>
            <li> I will continue to buy from Eden company. The quality of the scent is amazing. It cost more than some but worth it. Some other are bigger but not as strong of scent which means you use more</li>
            <li> great product, i use it for all products that i make, high quality and great service</li>
            <li> Received my essential oils today.  Very prompt shipping and they smell AMAZING!! Very pleased. Thank you so much. 5 stars.</li>
            <li> have only used this a few times want to try making lotion bar and soap with it and or cleaning will report than with more indept report I have used this brand essential oil before with good results would recommend and use this again.</li>
            <li> Lime with a kick. This is not your ordinary essential oil. Edens Garden is 100% pure , no additives, bases, fillers, or synthetics. I take aromatherapy seriously, I believe that scents can affect your mood/health/aura. Key Lime is known to ease emotional lows, relieve you when you are just mentally on the edge. Key lime can support and boost your immune system as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use my oil in an essential oil diffuser, but you can use this in so many different ways. It even comes with a booklet telling you how!</li>
            <li> It smell just like lime. Would buy again if I ever run out. I used this in my tropical foot soak. Would buy again. I have brought a kit from this vendor and it is great. No let downs yet and hopefully ever. No dilutions which is great (which means no carrier oils in E.O).</li>
            <li> I gave a five star rating because it smells like a delicious key lime pie! I use it alone or mix with other oils. My home smells delish! I would recommend it.</li>
            <li> Great. Product as described.</li>
            <li> Great Transaction, product of great quality, delivery was quick and experience was wonderful!</li>
            <li> Key lime is one of the strongest smelling essential oils I have bought from Edens Garden, it smells just as expected, a sort of exotic yet still limey smell. Only use a little if you plan on mixing it with other oils for a smell, as it is very overpowering.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s definitely a strong scent... would recommend smelling it elsewhere if you are on the fence about &amp;#34;lime!&amp;#34; but I love it! It&#x27;s clean and fresh, loving mixing it with Vanilla and Lavender too!</li>
            <li> Just what I needed for my sea salt scrubs!</li>
            <li> Love this amazing oil. It&#x27;s my go to &amp;#34;happy potion&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> I love this scent!! Smells just wonderful!</li>
            <li> wonderful sent! just like key lime pie. will be ordering again!</li>
            <li> Smells like real limes, very potent, use sparingly</li>
            <li> More regular lime than key lime but still quote lovely!</li>
            <li> Smells good, like lime-flavored candy. However I wish it smelled like the real lime fruit.  Fast shipping!</li>
            <li> This stuff smells great. I used it in raw african shea butter, Other butters and a few other items to make some lip balm and tattoo cream. Works great.</li>
            <li> Great scent. I decided to get this one and the vanilla to make bath bombs, and together they smell just like the candles from Bath and Body works! Just be sure to mix this with a carrier oil (I used almond) if you plan on using it for soap, lotions, etc. I made some great bath bombs with this. You get their product catalog and a little guide with tips on what oils to use for what which I actually loved. It isn&#x27;t a whole lot of oil, but the price and quality are great.</li>
            <li> This smells great, a very warm and comforting scent. A good add for a summer personal blend.</li>
            <li> This has a very pleasant odor - I really like it!</li>
            <li> Did not have the key lime scent I was going for.  I had to use Aura Cacia&#x27;s  Lime essential oil for my project.</li>
