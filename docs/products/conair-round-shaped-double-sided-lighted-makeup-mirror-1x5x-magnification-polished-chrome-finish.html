    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>its the best for makeup</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s been 2 years and still works great !</li>
            <li>Great Product!</li>
            <li>both mirrors are perfect.  </li>
            <li>This mirror would work great for someone with a table height vanity that you sit in front of.  </li>
            <li>Have been in use since I purchased it and works great..</li>
            <li>great.</li>
            <li>Works great</li>
            <li>This mirror is bright and the magnification is great.  </li>
            <li>The mirror itself (not the light) is actually really great, and the magnification side is awesome for brows.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s nice works great .</li>
            <li>All in all, a good product.  </li>
            <li>She loved it until she broke it.  </li>
            <li>And plus, incandescent lighting isn&#x27;t the best light to be doing your makeup in anyway.</li>
            <li>I can see all my runaway eye brow lashes that need plucking really good in it.</li>
            <li>The close up side is good though for plucking stray hairs.</li>
            <li>The light is very bright on there</li>
            <li>The light doesn&#x27;t glare, and it looks attractive on the counter.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The light is great</li>
            <li>but when it needs replaced I will probably go with another kind.</li>
            <li>If you could put the electrical option of this mirror with the adjustable mirror positioning of the battery powered mirror, you would then have the perfect product if it was reasonably priced.</li>
            <li>Got what I paid for, should have paid the $50 and gotten a nice one.</li>
            <li>She used it every am and liked it.  </li>
            <li>The bulb ran out after three months and quite honestly it is something we never think about replacing.  </li>
            <li>The one originally pictured would have been great if built as well (and delivered).</li>
            <li>I am plucking hairs out of the underside of my chin, not putting on eye makeup, and it would be very nice to be able to have both hands free.  </li>
            <li>It is nice to have a lighted mirror, and I love the magnification too.  </li>
            <li>it looks cute</li>
            <li>The pivot is maybe 5 degrees either way, so it can&#x27;t be used on a counter top if you are standing.    </li>
            <li>She doesn&#x27;t plug it in any more but uses magnifier side.  </li>
            <li>She also has a counter top, not seated vanity to use.</li>
            <li>I love that this one is plug in because my sister would probably let the batteries die and neglect to replace them.</li>
            <li>The light is nice, it&#x27;s not fancy</li>
            <li>I love how this mirror work</li>
            <li>The lighting is phenomenal, and I know she&#x27;ll love it and use it every time she puts on makeup.</li>
            <li>The brilliant chrome finish and handsome lines give this mirror a classic appeal that fits easily with any style ...</li>
            <li>$12 for a light bulb!  </li>
            <li>:)  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll spend $60 on an awesome mirror that puts out more light and only charges $5 for 2 light bulbs that I can order from Amazon thank you.</li>
            <li>The bulb burned out (and I don&#x27;t leave the light on more than 20 minutes because of the heat</li>
            <li>I honestly think it&#x27;s worth $10.99.</li>
            <li>mirror is good and it did put out a good amount of light, but it&#x27;s so low</li>
            <li>It is perfect for applying make-up, plucking eyebrows and other beauty practices that need a well lit magnified mirror.  </li>
            <li>I was happy with the fast shipping and the product in general  as soon as i plugged it in to see how bright the light was</li>
            <li>This is a great make-up mirror, especially for the price!  </li>
            <li>the light bulb just popped  </li>
            <li>Although the light is well constructed, I am giving it a one star because the description says that you can use AAA batteries as the power source but there is no place for batteries on the device, you have to use the power chord.</li>
            <li>The halo lighting around the perimeter of the mirror provides soft, glare-free lighting for optimum clarity.</li>
            <li>the bulb died I realized it was a special conair light bulb that I had to order from the website.  </li>
            <li>The light itself is bright enough, but since they are incandescent bulbs you have to worry about replacing them eventually.</li>
            <li>Works fine wish mirror swiveled to where it&#x27;s useful</li>
            <li>Gets hot within minutes with a strong burning smell</li>
            <li>It arrived quickly and well packaged, as advertised.   </li>
            <li>no se mueve y es super bajito, muy incomodo...</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very small, mirror doesn&#x27;t adjust and the light isn&#x27;t very bright.  </li>
            <li>I have to set it up on a tissue box to get it to be the height to even see in it when I am sitting down, but for a quick replacement, it&#x27;s been working great.  </li>
            <li>Worth 20 bucks</li>
            <li>However, the light gets EXTREMELY HOT within minutes of being turned on, and since it&#x27;s not a swivel mirror you have to turn it from the top to switch between the regular side and magnified side, causing you to burn your fingers.</li>
            <li>This is a decent light for the price.</li>
            <li>It also heats up super fast</li>
            <li>It fits very nice in small areas.</li>
            <li>The cord is a good length and has a little on and off switch.</li>
            <li>Great for those who has a hard time seeing.</li>
            <li>This was cheap, and nice for what I need it for, but it is not outstanding.  </li>
            <li>I will definitely research a lot more before I purchase another product.</li>
            <li>but it gets really hot.  </li>
            <li>The light gets quite hot for I am far sighted and have to get quite close to the magnified side for makeup placement.  </li>
            <li>Others we looked at were way higher.</li>
            <li>She was used to a much bigger mirror and thought this would be a hard adjustment, but she says it works great!</li>
            <li>because between blowdryers, curlers and an ever present fan, I really don&#x27;t have room for more things to plug into the bathroom.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The size is perfect; large enough to see what you are doing but small enough to make for easy storage.  </li>
            <li>The light gives off a glare and makes it hard to see into, and the reason I bought a magnifying mirror was to see better.</li>
            <li>I really like the stand and</li>
            <li>do wish I had been more careful in my selection and found one that was battery operated instead of electric....</li>
            <li>mirror will not adjust much, only fraction of a centimeter because the stand fits through a hole in the mirror itself rather than being on a swivel like a different Conair mirror I own.</li>
            <li>This is a nice little sized mirror with a clear and crisp reflection.  </li>
            <li>it is great and the light is just perfect, the only complaint I have on this mirror is the fact that the mirror is stationary on the base I would have perferred one that tilts.</li>
            <li>After only about 20 uses, the light is already dim and flickering and the replacement bulbs from Conair are almost as much as the whole purchase price of the mirror.</li>
            <li>No dead bulbs, doesn&#x27;t seem to get too hot.  </li>
            <li>She touched her inner wrist on the top part and it left a burn to leave a welt.  </li>
            <li>room was hot pink and to me, it didn&#x27;t put off enough light to change the lighting really.  </li>
            <li>Small.. Doesn&#x27;t rotate well.. It is OK for the money you get what you pay for... Catch it on sale</li>
            <li>She said it has good magnification and decent lighting; the only negative is that it doesn&#x27;t tilt very far back and forth.</li>
            <li>I thought I&#x27;d like the plug in feature, but it just turned out to be a pain to have to be near an outlet every time you do your makeup.</li>
            <li>I bought this speficially because I disliked having the chord and wanted it to be free standing.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend buying this over the similar mirrors that go for $50-$60.</li>
            <li>so I have to bend down and contort myself to get the right angle to see the hairs to pluck.  </li>
            <li>The size is very small and the light is too dim.</li>
            <li>This double-sided pedestal mirror offers regular and 5x magnification.</li>
            <li>The light on these things goes out way too quickly, and are near impossible to replace.</li>

            <li> The size is very small and the light is too dim.</li>
            <li> This double-sided pedestal mirror offers regular and 5x magnification.</li>
            <li> The light on these things goes out way too quickly, and are near impossible to replace.</li>
            <li> \\&quot;Nothing beats a professional lighted mirror to bring makeup application and other skin-care procedures to maximum polish.</li>
            <li> The only negative is that the bulb burns really hot.</li>
            <li> The product as now offered is not worth the money, although not due to quality of construction.</li>
            <li> Too small, not adjustable, light not adequate, magnification not adequate.</li>
            <li> Smaller than I expected.</li>
            <li> It operates with three AA batteries (not included) or with a plug-in adaptor whose cord measures 9 feet long.</li>
            <li> I know see I could purchase a similar mirror with a much larger pivot area for about $5 less.</li>
            <li> Regular mirror image on one side &amp; turns to magnified image on the other.</li>
            <li> i&#x27;ll just see how long this bulb lasts!!</li>
            <li> Mirror is a little smaller than I thought it wld be</li>
            <li> I thought it would be a little bigger.</li>
            <li> but I wish I could bend the mirror down a bit .</li>
            <li> I still use it every day, but I will typically just hold it with one hand.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It wouldn&#x27;t hurt if the base was weighted a bit, since the piece is a bit top heavy.</li>
            <li> I was expecting more the base is too short and is hard to use the mirrow doesn&#x27;t tilt up making it hard to find a place in the counter to view face without lifting it the mirrow with one hand.</li>
            <li> Considered a midsize mirror, it stands 11 inches tall, while the mirror itself measures a little less than 4-1/2 inches in diameter.</li>
            <li> The mirrors themselves work well with impressively little distortion from the magnified mirror.</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;ve had it for a little over a year.  </li>
            <li> Its less than a foot tall making it too short to see anything if your sitting at a table or desk, and the mirror doesn&#x27;t tilt, so it is basically useless unless I hold it up or prop it up on something else.</li>
            <li> Use these everyday for my makeup!</li>
            <li> Not many people have seated vanities anymore, they should keep this in mind when designing products.</li>
            <li> and it is small and</li>
            <li> Not very bright and 2shotr</li>
            <li> much smaller than described bad lighting</li>
            <li> I should have gotten the bigger size :(</li>
            <li> doesn&#x27;t adjust,that SUCKS!</li>
            <li> Mirror at a poor angle.</li>
            <li> Mirror hardly tilts making it somewhat inconvenient to use since I have to hold it in one hand when I&#x27;m using the magnified side.</li>
            <li> I am angry about this mirror.  </li>
            <li> sorry I can&#x27;t do it.  </li>
            <li> Not very happy :(</li>

            <li> Smaller than I expected. I should have gotten the bigger size :(</li>
            <li> I am angry about this mirror.  I have to pick it up and hold it with one hand to use it because it does not tilt.  Then the light is so dim as to be useless.  I am plucking hairs out of the underside of my chin, not putting on eye makeup, and it would be very nice to be able to have both hands free.  This is awful.  I wish I had saved the packing so I could send it back.  It would be overpriced at 50 cents.</li>
            <li> This was cheap, and nice for what I need it for, but it is not outstanding.  It doesn&#x27;t turn upwards nearly enough.  I have to set it up on a tissue box to get it to be the height to even see in it when I am sitting down, but for a quick replacement, it&#x27;s been working great.  No dead bulbs, doesn&#x27;t seem to get too hot.  I&#x27;ve gotten some use out of it.</li>
            <li> This is a great make-up mirror, especially for the price!  It is perfect for applying make-up, plucking eyebrows and other beauty practices that need a well lit magnified mirror.  The size is perfect; large enough to see what you are doing but small enough to make for easy storage.  I would highly recommend buying this over the similar mirrors that go for $50-$60.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s nice works great . However I wish I had known that the mirror does not tilt.  So I have to stack it on books to see my eyes and then apply the eyeliner and etc.</li>
            <li> Mirror is a little smaller than I thought it wld be but it fits and it looks cute I would order it again.</li>
            <li> This mirror is bright and the magnification is great.  It arrived quickly and well packaged, as advertised.   My only regret is that the mirror does not tilt.  This mirror would work great for someone with a table height vanity that you sit in front of.  I have a counter height sink in my bathroom so I have to bend down and contort myself to get the right angle to see the hairs to pluck.  All in all, a good product.  I just wish I&#x27;d thought about the angle/tilting thing.</li>
            <li> No me gusto para nada este espejo, la luz es muy pobre, la base no se mueve y es super bajito, muy incomodo...</li>
            <li> The product listed when I ordered it showed a gimbal mounted mirror. The lighting was powered by 3 batteries (not included) and the unit came with an external plug-in supply.    What I received was the item now pictured. The pivot is maybe 5 degrees either way, so it can&#x27;t be used on a counter top if you are standing.    No battery power either as it is now permanently corded. To use the concave mirror requires turning the entire thing so that the cord now sticks out towards the user.    The product as now offered is not worth the money, although not due to quality of construction. The issue is one of fundamental design. The one originally pictured would have been great if built as well (and delivered).</li>
            <li> Use these everyday for my makeup! I just wish it wouldve bought a bigger mirror</li>
            <li> its the best for makeup</li>
            <li> Bought this for my daughter for Christmas.  She touched her inner wrist on the top part and it left a burn to leave a welt.  I had already thrown the box away.  She doesn&#x27;t plug it in any more but uses magnifier side.  Will get her a different brand this Christmas; but would not recommend this on to anyone.</li>
            <li> Mirror hardly tilts making it somewhat inconvenient to use since I have to hold it in one hand when I&#x27;m using the magnified side. After only about 20 uses, the light is already dim and flickering and the replacement bulbs from Conair are almost as much as the whole purchase price of the mirror. The listing says it takes batteries, but the one I got does not and the cord is way too short for anywhere but my bathroom sink. The mirrors themselves work well with impressively little distortion from the magnified mirror. If Conair could combine those with an assembly that actually does what it&#x27;s supposed to, they might actually have something.</li>
            <li> Small.. Doesn&#x27;t rotate well.. It is OK for the money you get what you pay for... Catch it on sale</li>
            <li> I purchased this as a Christmas present for my mom. She said it has good magnification and decent lighting; the only negative is that it doesn&#x27;t tilt very far back and forth. She also has a counter top, not seated vanity to use. Not many people have seated vanities anymore, they should keep this in mind when designing products. I know see I could purchase a similar mirror with a much larger pivot area for about $5 less. I will definitely research a lot more before I purchase another product.</li>
            <li> The light gives off a glare and makes it hard to see into, and the reason I bought a magnifying mirror was to see better.</li>
            <li> The light on these things goes out way too quickly, and are near impossible to replace. I&#x27;ve gone though two. At this point, I just use them as mirrors. The stand is not tall enough as well. I find I have to put it atop a box to get the proper height. I still use it every day, but I will typically just hold it with one hand. Overall...I give it a solid meh.</li>
            <li> Have been in use since I purchased it and works great.. It&#x27;s been 2 years and still works great !</li>
            <li> Years ago had bought my daughter a lighted mirror when she went away for college.  She loved it until she broke it.  Thought this would be the same.  Not even close.  It&#x27;s very small, mirror doesn&#x27;t adjust and the light isn&#x27;t very bright.  Keep looking.  This isn&#x27;t what you want.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my aunt so that she could use it when she traveled in her RV. She was used to a much bigger mirror and thought this would be a hard adjustment, but she says it works great!</li>
            <li> I got this for my sister who requested a lighted magnifying mirror. I love that this one is plug in because my sister would probably let the batteries die and neglect to replace them. She loves it and uses it daily.</li>
            <li> Bought this mirror from target and returned it 3 days later and got an LED mirror by conair instead. The mirror itself (not the light) is actually really great, and the magnification side is awesome for brows. However, the light gets EXTREMELY HOT within minutes of being turned on, and since it&#x27;s not a swivel mirror you have to turn it from the top to switch between the regular side and magnified side, causing you to burn your fingers. The light itself is bright enough, but since they are incandescent bulbs you have to worry about replacing them eventually. And plus, incandescent lighting isn&#x27;t the best light to be doing your makeup in anyway. I thought I&#x27;d like the plug in feature, but it just turned out to be a pain to have to be near an outlet every time you do your makeup. Do yourself a favor and if you&#x27;re looking for a mirror the same size as this one, buy the white and chrome LED mirror by conair instead.</li>
            <li> I wish that it was taller, its only like a foot tall, you set it on the counter and you still have to lean over the counter to see when using it. The light is nice, it&#x27;s not fancy but it gets really hot.  Worth 20 bucks but when it needs replaced I will probably go with another kind.</li>
            <li> Not tall enough.  Mirror at a poor angle. I cannot even use this product.</li>
            <li> I was happy with the fast shipping and the product in general  as soon as i plugged it in to see how bright the light was ( and it was ) the light bulb just popped  now i have to take it apart and look for a similar bulb. great.</li>
            <li> I love how this mirror work it is great and the light is just perfect, the only complaint I have on this mirror is the fact that the mirror is stationary on the base I would have perferred one that tilts.</li>
            <li> It is nice to have a lighted mirror, and I love the magnification too.  Great Product!</li>
            <li> Works fine wish mirror swiveled to where it&#x27;s useful</li>
            <li> This mirror was just what I was looking for. Regular mirror image on one side &amp; turns to magnified image on the other. Lights up on both sides. Great for those who has a hard time seeing. Would recommend to others.</li>
            <li> I am very disappointed by this mirror. Its less than a foot tall making it too short to see anything if your sitting at a table or desk, and the mirror doesn&#x27;t tilt, so it is basically useless unless I hold it up or prop it up on something else. I&#x27;m going to send it back and I would not recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I bought this as a gift for my aunt. The lighting is phenomenal, and I know she&#x27;ll love it and use it every time she puts on makeup.</li>
            <li> much smaller than described bad lighting</li>
            <li> mirror will not adjust much, only fraction of a centimeter because the stand fits through a hole in the mirror itself rather than being on a swivel like a different Conair mirror I own. If you could put the electrical option of this mirror with the adjustable mirror positioning of the battery powered mirror, you would then have the perfect product if it was reasonably priced.</li>
            <li> I really like the stand and both mirrors are perfect.  The light gets quite hot for I am far sighted and have to get quite close to the magnified side for makeup placement.  So I end up turning it off after a bit.  Delivery was on time.</li>
            <li> Too small, not adjustable, light not adequate, magnification not adequate. Got what I paid for, should have paid the $50 and gotten a nice one.</li>
            <li> I just hated to admit that I needed help to get my eyeliner on in the morning!  This is a nice little sized mirror with a clear and crisp reflection.  The light doesn&#x27;t glare, and it looks attractive on the counter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do wish I had been more careful in my selection and found one that was battery operated instead of electric....because between blowdryers, curlers and an ever present fan, I really don&#x27;t have room for more things to plug into the bathroom.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It wouldn&#x27;t hurt if the base was weighted a bit, since the piece is a bit top heavy.</li>
            <li> I just received my lighted make-up mirror and i read the mixed reviews and it is small and doesn&#x27;t adjust,that SUCKS! It also heats up super fast i used it for 5 minutes today and it can burn you,Buyer BEWARE!&lt;br /&gt;But for the price you get what you pay for! I honestly think it&#x27;s worth $10.99. I will keep it because i have no desire to return it or pay MORE$.I would NOT recommend it though.  It works for tweezing brows and applying my make-up,i&#x27;ll just see how long this bulb lasts!!</li>
            <li> \\&quot;Nothing beats a professional lighted mirror to bring makeup application and other skin-care procedures to maximum polish. This double-sided pedestal mirror offers regular and 5x magnification. The halo lighting around the perimeter of the mirror provides soft, glare-free lighting for optimum clarity. Considered a midsize mirror, it stands 11 inches tall, while the mirror itself measures a little less than 4-1/2 inches in diameter. It operates with three AA batteries (not included) or with a plug-in adaptor whose cord measures 9 feet long. The brilliant chrome finish and handsome lines give this mirror a classic appeal that fits easily with any style ... \\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I need someone to tell me where the batteries go or is the product information incorrect?</li>
            <li> Works great I can see all my runaway eye brow lashes that need plucking really good in it. The ficture is sturdy.</li>
            <li> Needs to be taller.  I have to elevate it at the makeup table.  Looking for a taller electric conair mirror</li>
            <li> This mirror serves it&#x27;s purpose. It&#x27;s pretty small so I pack it in my suitcase for a girls&#x27; weekend. The cord is a good length and has a little on and off switch. The only negative is that the bulb burns really hot.</li>
            <li> Although the light is well constructed, I am giving it a one star because the description says that you can use AAA batteries as the power source but there is no place for batteries on the device, you have to use the power chord. I bought this speficially because I disliked having the chord and wanted it to be free standing. Product is not as advertized.</li>
            <li> I definitely didn&#x27;t realize when I ordered this product that the mirror doesn&#x27;t flip over to switch between views. The light is great but I wish I could bend the mirror down a bit .</li>
            <li> I bought this in August 2011 so I&#x27;ve had it for a little over a year.  The bulb burned out (and I don&#x27;t leave the light on more than 20 minutes because of the heat it generates)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The mirror is good and it did put out a good amount of light, but it&#x27;s so low I had to put a book under to raise it up to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When the bulb died I realized it was a special conair light bulb that I had to order from the website.  $12 for a light bulb!  No...sorry I can&#x27;t do it.  I&#x27;ll spend $60 on an awesome mirror that puts out more light and only charges $5 for 2 light bulbs that I can order from Amazon thank you.</li>
            <li> I thought it would be a little bigger. It fits very nice in small areas. The light is very bright on there</li>
            <li> I was expecting more the base is too short and is hard to use the mirrow doesn&#x27;t tilt up making it hard to find a place in the counter to view face without lifting it the mirrow with one hand. Leaving only one he and to apply your makeup or face mask. Not very happy :(</li>
            <li> Gets hot within minutes with a strong burning smell</li>
            <li> Helps me every morning.</li>
            <li> I ordered this for my daughter for Christmas.  She used it every am and liked it.  The bulb ran out after three months and quite honestly it is something we never think about replacing.  It has been in her room ever since then just for decoration because we forget to get a bulb when we go to the store.  :)  Looking back, I should&#x27;ve ordered several bulbs when placing the order so we wouldn&#x27;t have to remember to buy them when it burned out. I just didn&#x27;t plan on it burning out so soon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Her room was hot pink and to me, it didn&#x27;t put off enough light to change the lighting really.  The close up side is good though for plucking stray hairs.</li>
            <li> The size is very small and the light is too dim.</li>
            <li> Not very bright and 2shotr</li>
            <li> This is a decent light for the price. Others we looked at were way higher. Daughter likes it and says it works.</li>
