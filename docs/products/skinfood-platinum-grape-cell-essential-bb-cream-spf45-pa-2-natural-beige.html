            <li>and it provides great coverage.</li>
            <li>This BB Cream is great for the winter.  </li>
            <li>I am so happy today to find that Amazon carries this product now</li>

            <li>The packaging is gorgeous.</li>
            <li>Loved this bb cream.</li>
            <li>And now I decided to try this since I saw great review from many people.</li>
            <li>I really love this well-qualify product!</li>
            <li>This one is much closer to my skin tone, and if I apply some foundation in my shade over it it&#x27;s perfect.</li>
            <li>It goes on nicely and doesn&#x27;t get all oily on me.</li>
            <li>It glides on smoothly, very easy to blend, and it did not cling on to the side of my nose and chin.</li>
            <li>Love love love!</li>
            <li>Price is amazing too (most BB creams are more expensive!!!!).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love how it goes on</li>
            <li>It made my skin brighter and look more dewy but it didn&#x27;t have any coverage what so ever.</li>
            <li>I love this product, the color</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s perfect for Asian skin....</li>
            <li>I love this BB cream.</li>
            <li>Excellent coverage (medium), perfect for combination skin (cream consistancy is not overly creamy), lasts all day, contains a faint fragrance, which I love.</li>
            <li>My skin looks flawless with a tiny bit of satin finish.</li>
            <li>I love the fact that it cones with SPF 45.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s the perfect combo for me.&lt;br /&gt;Use tiny bit!</li>
            <li>/&gt;Another thing I love about this product is that it has SPF</li>
            <li>45.&lt;br /&gt;LOVE, LOVE, LOVE this product!!!&lt;br</li>
            <li>: Thank you Amazon for carrying this product :)</li>
            <li>Happy so far!</li>
            <li>Brought a Big smile to my face!!!!!</li>
            <li>The pump is easy to dispense the product out.</li>
            <li>I strongly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>This is very nice, I only use a tiny amount with my Garnier, the grape seed is good for skin tone and elasticity!</li>
            <li>It was too light for my skin color</li>
            <li>It feels light like I have no foundation on.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Initially I thought the BB cream looked too light</li>
            <li>I bought this BB Cream when another one I tried ended up being way too light for my skin.</li>
            <li>This is my first love bb cream,  it&#x27;s so smooth and evens out my skin tone.</li>
            <li>Been using it for 2months now and still in love with it like the first</li>
            <li>Luckily I didn&#x27;t</li>
            <li>This is my new favorite BB</li>
            <li>Instantly my skin looked amazing....</li>
            <li>but this one is my favorite so far.</li>
            <li>Consistency is just right.  </li>
            <li>Smells amazing, though a little strong.  </li>
            <li>You really don&#x27;t need much of this BB cream to get the smooth, glowing, luminous effect.&lt;br /&gt;The BB cream also lasts all day.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used many different BB creams</li>
            <li>Highly recommended!!</li>
            <li>/&gt;One day, about 6 months ago, I tried using this BB cream for the first time.</li>
            <li>glowing, smooth, soft, luminous.....</li>
            <li>I thought at first</li>
            <li>Thank you ;) xxx</li>
            <li>This is the first BB cream I ever used that did not cause me to break out.</li>
            <li>I really like this BB cream.  </li>
            <li>(price was much cheaper when I bought this in Korea; today&#x27;s amazon price $27.99--October 21, 2013).</li>
            <li>real well.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I really wanted to like it</li>
            <li>I wear a shade 2(.5 if we&#x27;re being honest here, not that they make it) in Urban Decay&#x27;s Naked foundation.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>I was very surprised by this product.</li>
            <li>Not too dark or light.  </li>
            <li>The coverage is amazing, a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin as well.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s been a wonder to me so far.</li>
            <li>I had small little red bumps that weren&#x27;t really noticeable and that you really couldn&#x27;t see if I wore foundation on top and so far I can see it is helping.</li>
            <li>I am Asian light skin yellow undertone, with oily skin, hyper-pigmentation, scar and uneven skin tone.</li>
            <li>just perfect!&lt;br /&gt;I am a 30-something year old Asian with medium-olive skin</li>

            <li> It doesn&#x27;t feel too heavy on.</li>
            <li> definately is a little on the thick side.  </li>
            <li> Also I ended up peeling around my nose and mouth area which was usual.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for a couple weeks now and the one thing I was afraid was that since I have sensitive skin I might react to it.</li>
            <li> I will use this in the Winter when it&#x27;s cold and use SkinFoods Aloe one in the Summer.</li>
            <li> I mean, all day!!!</li>
            <li> I hate the glossy glow because I have oily skin.</li>

            <li> I was very surprised by this product. It gives good coverage and also smells very nice. I&#x27;ve used many different BB creams but this one is my favorite so far. Best quality I found for the price. Highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> The best service I have ever seen. I really love this well-qualify product! I will choose this skin care line for a long time.</li>
            <li> Smells amazing, though a little strong.  Covers up all my blemishes with one pump</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never used a BB cream before, but after some of the reviews, I thought I&#x27;d try it out. I love how it goes on and it provides great coverage. It doesn&#x27;t feel too heavy on. Happy so far!</li>
            <li> It was too light for my skin color and I have a light/medium color. It made my skin brighter and look more dewy but it didn&#x27;t have any coverage what so ever. Also I ended up peeling around my nose and mouth area which was usual.</li>
            <li> This is very nice, I only use a tiny amount with my Garnier, the grape seed is good for skin tone and elasticity!</li>
            <li> This BB Cream is great for the winter.  I wouldn&#x27;t reccomend it for the summer if you spend a lot of time outside it definately is a little on the thick side.  I will use this in the Winter when it&#x27;s cold and use SkinFoods Aloe one in the Summer.</li>
            <li> I love this product, the color it&#x27;s perfect for Asian skin.... And feels good, not too greasy!</li>
            <li> I love this BB cream. Excellent coverage (medium), perfect for combination skin (cream consistancy is not overly creamy), lasts all day, contains a faint fragrance, which I love. I strongly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> This is the best BB cream I&#x27;ve ever used. I used Missha, Skin 79, Face Shop Aura CC, Skinfood Aloe, Skinfood Mushroom, Skinfood Agave Cactus. And now I decided to try this since I saw great review from many people. I am Asian light skin yellow undertone, with oily skin, hyper-pigmentation, scar and uneven skin tone. I have sensitive skin as well.&lt;br /&gt;I bought shade #2 online and it was shipped from Korea. The packaging is gorgeous. The pump is easy to dispense the product out. The coverage is amazing, a little goes a long way. It glides on smoothly, very easy to blend, and it did not cling on to the side of my nose and chin. I apply with finger dotting it all over the face and use stippling brush to blend. My skin looks flawless with a tiny bit of satin finish. I hate the glossy glow because I have oily skin. It feels light like I have no foundation on. I dust some powder at the end to set it and spay mist after blushing and contouring.&lt;br /&gt;After 10 hours, my skin is still flawless! This is my new favorite BB and I will not change. Highly recommended!!</li>
            <li> I really like this BB cream.  Not too dark or light.  Consistency is just right.  I love the fact that it cones with SPF 45.&lt;br /&gt;I think I will be using this all the time.  Delivery took 2 wks or so, but it is expected since it is coming from Korea.</li>
            <li> I discovered this BB cream when I was visiting Korea. The shop I was at, was running a promotion---received extras with the purchase.&lt;br /&gt;So anyways, I bought this BB cream  thinking if I didn&#x27;t like it, at least I didn&#x27;t pay too much for it (price was much cheaper when I bought this in Korea; today&#x27;s amazon price $27.99--October 21, 2013). I never used BB cream before I bought SkinFood Platinum Grape Cell Essential BB cream. I was using Laura Mercier/Chanel/Nars products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One day, about 6 months ago, I tried using this BB cream for the first time. I just used a teeny tiny bit of it.&lt;br /&gt;OMG! Instantly my skin looked amazing....glowing, smooth, soft, luminous.....just perfect!&lt;br /&gt;I am a 30-something year old Asian with medium-olive skin complexion.&lt;br /&gt;Initially I thought the BB cream looked too light but once I put it on, it actually blends in with my skin color real well.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve gotten tons of compliments on my skin complexion since I started using this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use this BB cream over Perricone MD Face Finishing Moisturizer. it&#x27;s the perfect combo for me.&lt;br /&gt;Use tiny bit! You really don&#x27;t need much of this BB cream to get the smooth, glowing, luminous effect.&lt;br /&gt;The BB cream also lasts all day. I mean, all day!!! Amazing.&lt;br /&gt;Another thing I love about this product is that it has SPF 45.&lt;br /&gt;LOVE, LOVE, LOVE this product!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Amazon did not offer this product about 2 - 3 months ago when I looked for it. You would have to order it from a Korean vendor. I am so happy today to find that Amazon carries this product now I just ordered a bottle today. Price is amazing too (most BB creams are more expensive!!!!).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been recommending this product to my girlfriends and I&#x27;d definitely would recommend this to everyone else looking for BB cream!!&lt;br /&gt;Outstanding product!&lt;br /&gt;note: Thank you Amazon for carrying this product :)</li>
            <li> I bought this product. I really wanted to like it but I look ghostlike after applying it. I am NW 35 in mac.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for a couple weeks now and the one thing I was afraid was that since I have sensitive skin I might react to it. Luckily I didn&#x27;t and it&#x27;s been a wonder to me so far. I had small little red bumps that weren&#x27;t really noticeable and that you really couldn&#x27;t see if I wore foundation on top and so far I can see it is helping. It is starting to clear and the smell isn&#x27;t too bad.</li>
            <li> Loved this bb cream. I thought at first i wasnt gonna like it coz it was a little bit darker than my skin tone. But when applied finishing powder the result is amazing😀</li>
            <li> This is my first love bb cream,  it&#x27;s so smooth and evens out my skin tone. Love love love! Because I didn&#x27;t want to run out,  I bought 2more bottle extra. Been using it for 2months now and still in love with it like the first time.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you!</li>
            <li> I bought this BB Cream when another one I tried ended up being way too light for my skin. This one is much closer to my skin tone, and if I apply some foundation in my shade over it it&#x27;s perfect. It goes on nicely and doesn&#x27;t get all oily on me. I wear a shade 2(.5 if we&#x27;re being honest here, not that they make it) in Urban Decay&#x27;s Naked foundation.</li>
            <li> Received this bb cream today!!! Brought a Big smile to my face!!!!! Cant wait to try it,  just love the packaging itself!!! Great service and &amp;iacute;tem in Perfect condition! Thank you ;) xxx</li>
            <li> This is the first BB cream I ever used that did not cause me to break out.</li>
