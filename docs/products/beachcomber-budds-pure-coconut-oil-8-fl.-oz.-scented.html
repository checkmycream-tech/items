            <li>I use it daily as my moisturizer and it leaves my skin soft and silky and does not leave it oily.</li>

            <li> I like it, but I was hoping to use it at home, and that&#x27;s difficult, because I have to microwave it for 10-15 seconds to liquify it prior to use. I think it&#x27;s meant to be used at the beach and around the pool, where it will stay in liquid form.&lt;br /&gt;Other than that, I love that it&#x27;s natural, and it smells great &amp; really moisturizes my skin without staying greasy.</li>
            <li> Amazing Coconut Oil, One of my favorite addictions. My skin has never been so silky smooth.&lt;br /&gt; I ordered 2 and they came in a box all wrapped up with a nice Thank You note:)&lt;br /&gt;I Love Fantastic Customer Service :)</li>
            <li> love love love the scent of this coconut oil - it&#x27;s the best!  I use it daily as my moisturizer and it leaves my skin soft and silky and does not leave it oily.</li>
            <li> Best coconut oil ever! I keep it in the shower so it warms up then use during or after showering.</li>
