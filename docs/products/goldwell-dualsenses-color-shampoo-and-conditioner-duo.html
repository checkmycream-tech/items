            <li>My hairdresser uses goldwell hair color on my hair,  which is very safe, not like other chemically loaded products (paul mitchell and likes).</li>
            <li>Fast shipping!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m pretty dissapointed.</li>
            <li>Obviously the price was much better.  </li>
            <li>The shampoo and conditioner do exactly what they say which is keep my colored hair from fading and detangle my hair.</li>
            <li>I love this shampoo and conditioner, and they sell for double at Ulta.  </li>

            <li>The cream  rinse was very watery and doesn&#x27;t help with tangles at all.</li>
            <li>Fast delivery.</li>
            <li>My hair is really thriving with this product, and I highly recommend to anyone with color treated hair.  </li>
            <li>My hair normally tangles really easily and takes a long time to comb out -</li>
            <li>The shampoo is fantastic, but I agree with other reviewers that the conditioner doesn&#x27;t seem very thick, and also doesn&#x27;t do a great job detangling.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product</li>
            <li>It was such a pain trying to get the right one.</li>
            <li>I purchased shampoo and the conditioner at the same time for the first time ever.</li>
            <li>My hair is soft and not frizzy anymore, YAY!</li>
            <li>But from the first time I used the conditioner I felt like it wasn&#x27;t the same product.  </li>
            <li>It leaves my hair clean without feeling weighed down.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know if it is old or what (no expiration date).</li>
            <li>feel like my hair is now really soft and silky</li>
            <li>I have to use more then usual to feel like its actually working.</li>
            <li>so I tried it and was amazed, no more cheap shampoo for us,</li>
            <li>very stressed and dry hair</li>
            <li>it says it is for colored hair, I do not have colored hair, but just a lot of natural red hair which can get wild...</li>
            <li>Soft hair and lasting color.</li>
            <li>I understand that this is a professional product, and that the core ingredients are likely better than anything you could buy at a drugstore, but the manufacturers make this pro product so thin that it is being sold at likely a massive profit margin.  </li>
            <li>Bought it the first time through my hair dresser and couldn&#x27;t find it any where else a little cheaper.</li>
            <li>I bought this product on line for the first time after using the store/ salon product that is identical for a few years.  </li>

            <li> Soft hair and lasting color.</li>
            <li> I understand that this is a professional product, and that the core ingredients are likely better than anything you could buy at a drugstore, but the manufacturers make this pro product so thin that it is being sold at likely a massive profit margin.  </li>
            <li> Bought it the first time through my hair dresser and couldn&#x27;t find it any where else a little cheaper.</li>
            <li> I bought this product on line for the first time after using the store/ salon product that is identical for a few years.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;d much rather have bought a bottle 1/4 of the size for 4 times the price and used very little each time.</li>
            <li> I am not sure, but the liquid for this product is very watering.  </li>
            <li> and I loved them, but were a little expensive due to the size for the price.</li>
            <li> my daughters also had same problem with dry scalp after using.</li>
            <li> Other Goldwell product liquid I bought from the salon thick and smell fresh.  </li>
            <li> Left my hair feeling very dry.</li>
            <li> In fact it feels dry and tangled.</li>
            <li> Would not  buy again, zero moisturizer, leaves me hair dry and unmanageable.</li>
            <li> Dry&#x27;s out your scalp after about a week.</li>
            <li> I have to wash my hair everyday and this shampoo does not dull my color or weigh it down.</li>
            <li> It was not thick enough for my hair and was very hard to brush the hair afterwards.  </li>
            <li> doesn&#x27;t weight your hair down and my highlights last longer.</li>
            <li> This wasn&#x27;t a cheap product, so tht is what makes me really unhappy.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t appreciate being taken advantage of and being sold a product with so much water to thin it out.</li>
            <li> The shampoo has worked as expected.  </li>
            <li> A little conditioner goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve seen no difference with this product than any other salon product, and once gone</li>
            <li> I have tried at least 30 different brands!!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never had any professional or drugstore shampoo or conditioner product come out so thin.  </li>
            <li> I was originally thinking I was imagining that the conditioner was bad, but after now reading the reviews I see that I was not.  </li>
            <li> My hair is so tangled that I add a little bit of my heavy duty conditioner to the Goldwell conditioning detangled.</li>
            <li> not for my hair.. but still used it .. dried my hair.</li>
            <li> Dried out my hair.  </li>
            <li> Not sure product was &amp;#34;real&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li> but after a couple of shampoos my hair looked dull and thinner.</li>
            <li> Every morning I woke up feeling my hair dull and puffy.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think I would purchase this item again and possibly returning it. :(</li>
            <li> She KNEW how thin it was.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a game changer.</li>
            <li> I am still amazed by the dramatic difference this shampoo makes in the texture of my hair.</li>
            <li> The review that said it was watery -- either they are writing on the wrong product or their salon is doing something funky with the product - the shampoo is very thick.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t detangle my hair which is very frustrating.</li>
            <li> Would not recomend to my worst enemy and so expensive.</li>
            <li> Disappointed this time.  :-(</li>
            <li> I was very disappointing in this product.</li>
            <li> I hate this shampoo and conditioner.</li>
            <li> I Hate this shampoo</li>
            <li> I used to buy this product from a hair salon ; for some reason , the conditioner from this set which I bought this time through Amazon has a terrible smell .... like gasoline .... :(</li>
            <li> I am disappointed!</li>
            <li> Very disappointed.</li>

            <li> I use this in combination with gold well hair color and styling products. The smell is great. The conditioner is very light yet deep and soft. The price is unbeatable. This same size sells for about double the price at the salon.</li>
            <li> Just as described. Fast shipping!</li>
            <li> I hate this shampoo and conditioner. It left my hair so knotty. Would not recomend to my worst enemy and so expensive.</li>
            <li> Smells amazing...leaves my hair softer and shinier thant the Aveda products I had been using, can&#x27;t beat the price.</li>
            <li> I love the Goldwell Color Rich Shampoo and Conditioner.  It smells great and makes my hair incredibly soft.  The review that said it was watery -- either they are writing on the wrong product or their salon is doing something funky with the product - the shampoo is very thick.  The conditioner is pretty thin, but I promise - it works great!  My hair normally tangles really easily and takes a long time to comb out - but this conditioner is a miracle worker.  I&#x27;ve even had 2 people stay at my house and before they left they both made me take them to the salon so that they could buy this shampoo and conditioner (which is $43 for the set at the salon, so this is a great price!).</li>
            <li> The only products I use on my colored hair, I am a return buyer.  Price was right.  Shipping was quick.</li>
            <li> Works great, well pleased</li>
            <li> I purchased shampoo and the conditioner at the same time for the first time ever. I first came accross this product at my salon and liked the smell after my hair was done, so I decided to purchase it. The shampoo seemes to be drying my hair a lot, where in the salon it did not seem the same way. Also, the conditioner is too watery and would fall off of my heands before reaching to my hair. It was not thick enough for my hair and was very hard to brush the hair afterwards.  I don&#x27;t think I would purchase this item again and possibly returning it. :(</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think this product was genuine. It didn&#x27;t smell or perform like the same product i purchased from my salon. Threw it out after 3-5 washes. Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> I am not sure, but the liquid for this product is very watering.  Other Goldwell product liquid I bought from the salon thick and smell fresh.  Not with this one I bought online.  I am disappointed!</li>
            <li> I understand that this is a professional product, and that the core ingredients are likely better than anything you could buy at a drugstore, but the manufacturers make this pro product so thin that it is being sold at likely a massive profit margin.  It smells great, but the shampoo is honestly like water.  I&#x27;ve never had any professional or drugstore shampoo or conditioner product come out so thin.  It will actually fall off your hand as you tip it over to get it on your hair, and falls onto the shower floor (which creates another problem, but that safety issue is for another day).  My stylists advice?  Don&#x27;t use too much, you&#x27;ll just waste it.  She KNEW how thin it was.  This wasn&#x27;t a cheap product, so tht is what makes me really unhappy.  I&#x27;ve seen no difference with this product than any other salon product, and once gone will never purchase it again.  I don&#x27;t appreciate being taken advantage of and being sold a product with so much water to thin it out. I&#x27;d much rather have bought a bottle 1/4 of the size for 4 times the price and used very little each time.</li>
            <li> Love this shampoo &amp; conditioner.  Big savings on amazon</li>
            <li> great product. love the smell of both shampoo and conditioner.Makes my hair really silky and maneagable.  Will surely buy again.</li>
            <li> I purchased 10 oz bottles at a salon for $14/bottle and I loved them, but were a little expensive due to the size for the price. I found these large bottles on Amazon for a great price and I was so excited! This is the best shampoo and conditioner I have found for my hair. I have tried at least 30 different brands!!! It was such a pain trying to get the right one. I love these and will continue to use them forever :) My hair is soft and not frizzy anymore, YAY!</li>
            <li> Pros:  Love the scent. It&#x27;s lightweight.  Hair feels clean. Con:  doesn&#x27;t make my red color last longer. I still haven&#x27;t found a product that does that.</li>
            <li> I like the shampoo but the conditioner doesn&#x27;t seem to condition even using ALOT. It doesn&#x27;t detangle my hair which is very frustrating. I have used Goldwell products including conditioner and have not had this problem...I don&#x27;t know if it is old or what (no expiration date). Anyways I would not recommend buying the duo bc of the conditioner. However to end on a positive note they do smell very good!</li>
            <li> Love this shampoo! I bought it on the recommendation of my stylist and I am so glad I did! Soft hair and lasting color.</li>
            <li> Love this Shampoo and Conditioner! Will be ordering again!!!</li>
            <li> I love that shampoo smells awesome and does not thin out hair</li>
            <li> My Wife loves this stuff for her color treated hair.  the bottles last a couple of months and does a great job; leaves hair silky and healthy feeling.</li>
            <li> Not for me.  Thought I liked it the first time I used but after a couple of shampoos my hair looked dull and thinner.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this since my daughter worked at a high end salon and couldn&#x27;t be more satisfied.  Amazon definitely has the best pricing since I no longer get her discount!</li>
            <li> This stuff is great for color treated hair. The price is so much better than getting it at the hair salon, not to mention with Prime, it is to me in 2 days!</li>
            <li> Very nice product. My hairdresser uses goldwell hair color on my hair,  which is very safe, not like other chemically loaded products (paul mitchell and likes). This shampoo and conditioner help me keep the color bright for two months between coloring and not have it fade away. I don&amp;#34;t care for the scent, which smells like peaches. But what are you going to do... the product is worth it</li>
            <li> Left my hair feeling very dry. I definitely would not recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I love this shampoo and the price I paid was a true bargain. I am very happy to have it.</li>
            <li> not for my hair.. but still used it .. dried my hair.</li>
            <li> I have colored hair and swim. I needed something to help protect my hair between colorings and to reduce the frequency in which I have to color my hair.</li>
            <li> Really helps the color from fading. Makes your hair silky and easy to style. I have used it for years and it never disappoints!</li>
            <li> Excellent product, very pleased</li>
            <li> I was told that the item was received quickly.  I still have yet to actually see the item because it was shipped to a friend.</li>
            <li> I love this product.  Make my hair feel smooth and silky.</li>
            <li> Every morning I woke up feeling my hair dull and puffy. But I no longer feel this way since I use this product.&lt;br /&gt;I feel like my hair is now really soft and silky haha..&lt;br /&gt;Definitely recommend this product to normal to oily hair :)</li>
            <li> Wonderful product.  Great price!</li>
            <li> Goldwell at this prize - unbeatable! I have always used it, bought at my hair salon. It&#x27;s a wonderful product, what more can I say!</li>
            <li> This shampoo smells amazing, but it has sulfate which is a HUGE no for colored hair. I am very disappointed and will be returning. It dulled my hair so much, I could smell the color product being stripped from my hair.</li>
            <li> I was very disappointing in this product. I have bought this shampoo and conditioner locally and loved it. The cream  rinse was very watery and doesn&#x27;t help with tangles at all. This product is also non returnable. The company needs to change this product.</li>
            <li> Love this product. I dye my hair red and using both the shampoo and conditioner helps it stay longer. Price for both is a steal compared to what I would pay for smaller bottles at my salon. Love it!</li>
            <li> I love the smell, and I love what my hair feels like when I use it. Have not been able to find this in salons.</li>
            <li> Goldwell products are worth the price. The color treated shampoo and conditioner keep hair looking like it was just colored at the salon. Definitely worth the price.</li>
            <li> This shampoo and conditioner is very watery and although smells great does not get my hair clean or get the knots out. I don&#x27;t feel like this is actual goldwell product. I&#x27;m pretty dissapointed.</li>
            <li> The shampoo is fantastic, but I agree with other reviewers that the conditioner doesn&#x27;t seem very thick, and also doesn&#x27;t do a great job detangling.  In the future, I will continue to purchase the shampoo, but go with a different conditioner.</li>
            <li> Dried out my hair.  Not sure product was &amp;#34;real&amp;#34;.  I have loved every other Goldwell product purchased at a salon.  Disappointed this time.  :-(</li>
            <li> Best packaging job EVER to eliminate product from spilling during shipping!!!  Will order again when product gets low!!!  Favorite shampoo and conditioner, smells fantastic and leaves hair fresh &amp; clean with no damaging effects :)</li>
            <li> I was introduced to this hair product in Germany.&lt;br /&gt;With very stressed and dry hair this is the greatest product I&#x27;ve ever used.&lt;br /&gt;Also a great deal, this lasts and lasts and lasts.&lt;br /&gt;Try it, you&#x27;ll love it.</li>
            <li> Super price and very fast delivery.</li>
            <li> The best shampoo/conditioner ever!</li>
            <li> This Goldwell product was recommended to me by my hair stylist. I&#x27;ve been using it for the past year and have experienced good results with my highlighted hair.</li>
            <li> I bought this product on line for the first time after using the store/ salon product that is identical for a few years.  Obviously the price was much better.  But from the first time I used the conditioner I felt like it wasn&#x27;t the same product.  My hair never feels conditioned after use.  In fact it feels dry and tangled. The shampoo has worked as expected.  I was originally thinking I was imagining that the conditioner was bad, but after now reading the reviews I see that I was not.  I felt compelled to write this review .  I will not purchase this product online again.</li>
            <li> The best products ever.  Great for your color treated hair with no residue or drying out.</li>
            <li> The best hair products for color treated hair I have tried!</li>
            <li> Compared to my salon&#x27;s pricing, this was definitely a better value.  It seemed to be the same stuff, too.  The shampoo itself makes my oily hair feel a little like straw, but definitely clean, and the conditioner is great.</li>
            <li> I am still amazed by the dramatic difference this shampoo makes in the texture of my hair.It&#x27;s a game changer.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t smell like the product that was used on me in the salon and it does not detangle at all.Would not buy again.</li>
            <li> If you have color treated hair this is the best product out there</li>
            <li> Smells great! Really enjoy the shampoo- it has a rich lather and makes my hair feel nice and clean.&lt;br /&gt;Not so impressed with the conditioner- it seemed like it was lacking in the moisturizing/conditioning department and seemed thinner in it&#x27;s consistency, rather than the thicker conditioners I&#x27;m used to using. I have to use more then usual to feel like its actually working.</li>
            <li> Love this shampoo and conditioner! Does not build up and smells great. A little conditioner goes a long way.</li>
            <li> this shampoo and conditioner is the best. doesn&#x27;t weight your hair down and my highlights last longer. love it!</li>
            <li> Great deal on a great product!</li>
            <li> This shampoo and conditioner make my hair so soft and smooth and it smells awesome!! I highly recommend this product</li>
            <li> Gold well products were recommended to me by my stylist. I haven&#x27;t used anything else since that time. It leaves my hair clean without feeling weighed down. It also seems to extend the time between coloring appointments.</li>
            <li> Would not  buy again, zero moisturizer, leaves me hair dry and unmanageable. Only good thing is it smells good.</li>
            <li> Dry&#x27;s out your scalp after about a week. I Hate this shampoo my daughters also had same problem with dry scalp after using.</li>
            <li> Great shampoo! Fast delivery.</li>
            <li> Great for color treated hair.  Very good price.</li>
            <li> My hair is really thriving with this product, and I highly recommend to anyone with color treated hair.  Try it!</li>
            <li> I has used this shampoo/conditioner combo for 2 years now.  It smells great and has helped make my hair healthier.</li>
            <li> I used to buy this product from a hair salon ; for some reason , the conditioner from this set which I bought this time through Amazon has a terrible smell .... like gasoline .... :( not buying again online !</li>
            <li> went to see our daughter in law... a fashion hair stylist on the east coast.  this is what she had in her shower so I tried it and was amazed, no more cheap shampoo for us, I purchased these when we returned to west coast.... best shampoo and cream rinse ever... it says it is for colored hair, I do not have colored hair, but just a lot of natural red hair which can get wild... this shampoo and rinse tames my hair so nicely, I am stuck on this brand</li>
            <li> my hair has never been so healthy!</li>
            <li> Great stuff! Want to buy more soon!</li>
            <li> Good but not as good as I expected.  For the price, I was expecting more.  I may not buy it again,</li>
            <li> I absolutely love these products. The price is definitely right and work so well. The shampoo and conditioner do exactly what they say which is keep my colored hair from fading and detangle my hair. My hair is so tangled that I add a little bit of my heavy duty conditioner to the Goldwell conditioning detangled. Great products!</li>
            <li> I love this shampoo and conditioner, and they sell for double at Ulta.  Great deal.</li>
            <li> I love this product. Bought it the first time through my hair dresser and couldn&#x27;t find it any where else a little cheaper. Got it for a good price on amazon as usual.  Will be ordering more as I run out.</li>
            <li> I have to wash my hair everyday and this shampoo does not dull my color or weigh it down. Love it.</li>
