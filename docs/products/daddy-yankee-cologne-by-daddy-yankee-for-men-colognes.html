            <li>I love the smell of this.</li>
            <li>I love the smell</li>
            <li>It was after I showed it to my brother, that i found out it is a pretty good cologne.  </li>
            <li>It is pretty good cologne</li>
            <li>My friend bought this product and the first time I smelled it, I loved it.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;d suggest this to women who love their man to smell manly and strong.</li>
            <li>good quality and fast shipment</li>
            <li>Other than the \\&quot;peppery\\&quot; scent to it, it smells GREAT, the best part is, only one spray is needed!</li>
            <li>Also a huge fan of his music.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Guess that&#x27;s why it&#x27;s so cheap.</li>
            <li>Great scent if your a younger person!</li>
            <li>This is not the original scent.</li>
            <li>Pretty strong, but not too strong.</li>
            <li>I recommend this to anyone who wants to give it as a Christmas gift or any gift trust me they will love it</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a big fan of daddy yankee and that colonge smell good</li>
            <li>The product is mild yet manly and good for everyday wear and evening when you don&#x27;t want an overpowering scent.  </li>
            <li>i always wants to have the daddy yankee fragrance, is just really cool the price</li>
            <li>Smells great however is not very long lasting, would still buy again for a date but not something you want for a night on the town</li>
            <li>the first thing that my girlfriend told me the day i first used DY was mmm</li>
            <li>If you have used Daddy Yankee before then you would recommend it to your friends or love one&#x27;s as a fall back scent when gift shopping.  </li>
            <li>Always remember that initial spray or dab test can be overwhelming till you wait about a minute and recheck the scent.&lt;br</li>
            <li>For about $30 you could get Tous In Heaven or Mont Blanc Individual which I think are of a better quality.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m sure it won&#x27;t be my last year!</li>
            <li>If you are young (like in high school) and don&#x27;t want to spend the money on a more expensive cologne this is very good.  </li>
            <li>new item for my collection!!</li>
            <li>and the size is really affordable</li>
            <li>Thanks for reading my opinion.</li>
            <li>he used the whole bottle with no problem</li>
            <li>thanks</li>
            <li>what a nice smell, long lasting cologne.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Recently started my junior year in high school, and so far EVERY girl I&#x27;ve talked to absolutely loves it!</li>
            <li>It is so smart to buy direct and save on the middle man.  </li>

            <li> It is so smart to buy direct and save on the middle man.  </li>
            <li> Only problem is it doesn&#x27;t last as long as oil based colognes.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had 3 bottles of this cologne before and this one smells like it&#x27;s old or watered down.</li>
            <li> The Daddy Yankee eau de toilet spray a bit \\&quot;peppery\\&quot; or \\&quot;spicy\\&quot; for my taste</li>
            <li> and i had been looking for his fragance for a long time!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not crazy expensive either</li>
            <li> I bought this based on the other reviews for the items.  </li>
            <li> and I paid less than what I usually pay at gordmans.product</li>
            <li> I was a bit skeptical before to order this cologne, after I read all the reviews I decided to give it a try.</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I found locating the product was difficult until I came across it through Amazon.com.  </li>
            <li> she gets crazy</li>
            <li> Terrible product.</li>

            <li> I was a bit skeptical before to order this cologne, after I read all the reviews I decided to give it a try. OMG !! what a nice smell, long lasting cologne. I recommend it to everyone, it is not an overpowering fragrance at all it is just what I was looking for.</li>
            <li> The Daddy Yankee eau de toilet spray a bit \\&quot;peppery\\&quot; or \\&quot;spicy\\&quot; for my taste but my husband LOVES it. I can&#x27;t wait to surprise him with it on his birthday. Other than the \\&quot;peppery\\&quot; scent to it, it smells GREAT, the best part is, only one spray is needed! Pretty strong, but not too strong. I have an allergy to most perfumes and colognes, but this one I don&#x27;t have an allergic reaction to. I&#x27;d suggest this to women who love their man to smell manly and strong.</li>
            <li> Daddy Yankee should not put his brand name on this product. You can get a better fragrance for $ 2 on the street. Terrible product.</li>
            <li> i always wants to have the daddy yankee fragrance, is just really cool the price and the size is really affordable</li>
