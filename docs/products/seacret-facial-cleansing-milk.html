            <li>and it just makes my skin feel so good.</li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>I love this product!  </li>
            <li>but this is still nice</li>
            <li>This is the best facial cleansing product I have ever purchased.</li>

            <li>I absolutely love this product.</li>
            <li>Leave it on to soak :)</li>
            <li>I love this product for my skin.</li>
            <li>However after purchasing I found a more affordable price athttp://www.seacretdirect.com/jadecker/en/us/products/shop?special&#x3D;1&amp;CustomerType&#x3D;1</li>
            <li>Product arrived as promised and Is in perfect condition in spite of its long journey.</li>
            <li>love it, because while most skin products leaves your skin feeling heavily moisturized, oily, and greasy -- I was very impressed that this product didn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li>suggest to combine it with the Seacret Toner, acne wash, and moisturizer for a full effect on a nice and clean face.</li>
            <li>(It easily wiped off my smokey-eye makeup and all that foundation I had used).</li>
            <li>I actually love the Seacret Product so much that I now get amazing discounts on them myself:</li>
            <li>Cotton swab still had huge amount of makeup on it.</li>
            <li>So silky and smooth.</li>
            <li>It really does a nice job of getting all my makeup off</li>
            <li>The skin feels clean and smooth, doesn&#x27;t feel like you are applying cleanser.</li>
            <li>I like to use this product after having used the mineral rich magnetic mask, my skin looks smooth and clean.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not a gimmick because when I stay indoors for weeks the cotton ball is clean.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m uncertain about whether I like this product as my skin doesn&#x27;t feel as clean as when I use the mud soap.  </li>
            <li>Just when you thought your face was clean</li>
            <li>It leave your face moist and clean.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s light but effective and leaves your face super soft and supple.  </li>
            <li>I  always use toner after cleansing and the cotton pad is always full of residue makeup.  </li>
            <li>I love this cleanser - it is so moisturizing and gentle on my face.</li>
            <li>Love love love this product and the whole line actually!</li>
            <li>Quick shipping</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s really light, you feel your face clean, fresh and super soft!</li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s definitely worth the price.&lt;br</li>
            <li>This product is so nice that it will be the only make-up remover you will ever need.</li>
            <li>But, after being captured at the mall, I didn&#x27;t want to pay their prices and this was just right for me.  </li>
            <li>This cleansing milk really moisturizes your face well and gets a LOT of the dirt, makeup, and grime off of your face after a long day and good sleep.</li>
            <li>This facial cleansing milk works great for my skin type and leaves it feeling refreshed, not dry and without any break outs.</li>
            <li>Gently removes all makeup easily including mascara leaving your skin feeling soft and thoroughly clean.</li>
            <li>It just leaves your skin feeling fresh, clean, soft, and powdery-like, while being moisturized!</li>
            <li>My acne cleared up pretty quickly, and it&#x27;s much cheaper than any prescription or paid program</li>
            <li>when i first began using it, i got alot of compliments on how well my face looked</li>
            <li>I will be getting more in the future.</li>
            <li>I like the deep cleanser better</li>
            <li>Skin feels soft and clean.</li>
            <li>LESS THAN a quarter size amount is all you really need to cover an entire face &amp; neck, which makes it great because you&#x27;ll run out less quickly, which over time can become more cost efficient.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t really help with me acne, and</li>
            <li>for removing makeup, it does really well too.</li>
            <li>Decided to double check to see how clean my skin really was.</li>
            <li>My skin is a combination between oily and dry, most moisturizers make my skin oily and tend to make me break out.&lt;br /&gt;Using this product makes me never break out, keeps my skin soft and never makes my skin oily.&lt;br</li>
            <li>this item is very milky, in fact i find myself rinsing my face off with water afterwards to clear the residue it leaves on, i think i will continue to use my biore when this runs out.</li>
            <li>Even after washing my face with my normal face cleaner and do this after my shower...</li>
            <li>use this as a moisturizer after washing my face, and I love how this moisturizes my face without it feeling heavy or greasy..</li>
            <li>I normally have combination skin.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve purchased a lot of over the counter facial moisturizers in my lifetime and have not found anything worth purchasing than when I found this product.</li>
            <li>Not only is it sold at a good price, but you get more product for your money than you would from other products that are sold in those tiny little jars.</li>
            <li>In fact it&#x27;s the complete opposite.&lt;br /&gt;Like</li>
            <li>I use a small cotton ball and squirt some milk onto it, then dabbing it at the four corners of my face and lightly rub it around in circular motions.</li>
            <li>The texture is the same, but the ability to remove makeup and clean thoroughly is definitely missing with this product.  </li>
            <li>This takes off makeup, any foundation or powder foundation like Bare Essentials, and does not irritate me.</li>
    </ol>

I use a small cotton ball and squirt some milk onto it, then dabbing it at the four corners of my face and lightly rub it around in circular motions. I gradually see the cotton ball become dirty and it&#x27;s amazing! It&#x27;s not a gimmick because when I stay indoors for weeks the cotton ball is clean. Put some on your neck too, don&#x27;t forget.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I suggest to combine it with the Seacret Toner, acne wash, and moisturizer for a full effect on a nice and clean face.

            <li> Smells good. Didn&#x27;t really help with me acne, and but does moisturizers it well. My son likes the soap!! Quick shipping</li>
            <li> Even after washing my face with my normal face cleaner and do this after my shower... There&#x27;s dirt on my cotton ball!! Awesome awesome</li>
            <li> Good product. Would buy again.</li>
            <li> As I always loved this product this is my 4th bottles now.</li>
            <li> love this face wash.  You rub it in and no rinsing.</li>
            <li> My skin is a combination between oily and dry, most moisturizers make my skin oily and tend to make me break out.&lt;br /&gt;Using this product makes me never break out, keeps my skin soft and never makes my skin oily.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s definitely worth the price.&lt;br /&gt;After i use my facial cleanser and toner, i pat my face with this product. Do not rinse after applied.&lt;br /&gt;Usually i wash my face twice a day, so this bottle lasts for at least 3/4 months.&lt;br /&gt;If you have acne/oily/dry skin this is perfect for you!</li>
            <li> This stuff is very good for aging skin and the price on here is great..  I will be getting more in the future.</li>
            <li> This product is so nice that it will be the only make-up remover you will ever need. So silky and smooth. Also A must have.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product. After reading reviews, I was a bit skeptical about the wonders of this product, but after using it, it completely changed my mind.&lt;br /&gt;I use this as a moisturizer after washing my face, and I love how this moisturizes my face without it feeling heavy or greasy.. In fact it&#x27;s the complete opposite.&lt;br /&gt;Like the other reviews say, DO NOT wash your face after applying this. Leave it on to soak :)&lt;br /&gt;As for removing makeup, it does really well too. (It easily wiped off my smokey-eye makeup and all that foundation I had used). Wasn&#x27;t to keen on leaving it on after, so I washed my face and reapplied another layer for moisture.</li>
            <li> I love this product for my skin. However after purchasing I found a more affordable price athttp://www.seacretdirect.com/jadecker/en/us/products/shop?special&#x3D;1&amp;CustomerType&#x3D;1</li>
            <li> you dont use water but my acne has cleared up since using this.</li>
            <li> Love love love this product and the whole line actually! I found out that I could be a distributor of this product line! Email me to find out how (wiztalent01@gmail.com)</li>
            <li> Cleansed face following directions. Decided to double check to see how clean my skin really was. Whoa!  Was I ever disappointed. Cotton swab still had huge amount of makeup on it. Disgusted with false proclamations of how clean skin would be if I used it. Thumbs down.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m uncertain about whether I like this product as my skin doesn&#x27;t feel as clean as when I use the mud soap.  I cleanse my skin in the shower and wash off, however it feels like there is still some product left on my skin.  Probably if you use toner it will remove any residue.  Not sure if I will buy this product again.</li>
            <li> You will absolutely LOVE THIS PRODUCT!!!  It is a cleanser that you use to remove even the most stubborn mascarra!!!  You simply, wipe cleanser on, wisk away dirt, oil, make up, and sweat!!  You DO NOT RINSE CLEANSER OFF!!!  IT WISK AWAYS ALL THE DAYS DIRT/MAKE UP... AND LEAVES YOUR SKIN WITH THE ESSENTIAL MOISTURE!!!</li>
            <li> Awesome product.  Just when you thought your face was clean it will really show you&#x27;re really wrong.  It leave your face moist and clean.  Love it!</li>
            <li> I normally have combination skin. This facial cleansing milk works great for my skin type and leaves it feeling refreshed, not dry and without any break outs.</li>

But, after being captured at the mall, I didn&#x27;t want to pay their prices and this was just right for me.  Product arrived as promised and Is in perfect condition in spite of its long journey.</li>
            <li> I used this product as soon I got it. It&#x27;s really light, you feel your face clean, fresh and super soft! I recomment this product!!!</li>
            <li> Was really hoping this would be a less expensive alternative to the costly Premier Dead Sea facial cleansing milk.  Unfortunately, that was not the case.

LESS THAN a quarter size amount is all you really need to cover an entire face &amp; neck, which makes it great because you&#x27;ll run out less quickly, which over time can become more cost efficient.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product is usually sold side-by-side with the Seacret Mineral-Rich Refining Toner. Once cleansed with the toner, you are to then cleanse with this Seacret Facial Cleansing Milk (which is meant to be left on) after using the toner. One can either use it following the toner or used alone as a cleansing moisturizer that you \\&quot;leave on\\&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love it, because while most skin products leaves your skin feeling heavily moisturized, oily, and greasy -- I was very impressed that this product didn&#x27;t. It just leaves your skin feeling fresh, clean, soft, and powdery-like, while being moisturized! I actually love the Seacret Product so much that I now get amazing discounts on them myself: http://www.seacretdirect.com/MelodyBon&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And YOU can too!</li>
