            <li>These combs are the best ever</li>
            <li>My husband&#x27;s favorite comb!!!  </li>
            <li>This product is very good for me.</li>
            <li>comb, good brand name, well made, and a great deal for the money.  </li>
            <li>They are of great quality and slide smoothly through the hair.  </li>
            <li>They are well made, good finish, and comb well most any length or coarseness of hair.  </li>
            <li>Very strong.</li>
            <li>I have used Ace combs for many years.  </li>
            <li>Supposedly nylon, it seems more like the plastic combs of yore.</li>
            <li>You cannot do better than this for price and quality.  </li>
            <li>Buy a lot of them, they break easily.</li>
            <li>Enjoy.</li>
            <li>This is not as sturdy as the original Ace comb, it&#x27;s a cheap copy.</li>
            <li>These combs are nothing like the original Ace combs.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been buying them my whole life, and they have always been easy on your head - not this one!</li>
            <li>This is a great little comb that is goes through the washer and dryer repeatedly and comes out strong with no broken teeth.  </li>
            <li>I want a good pocket comb with the teeth being the same and one that will last.  </li>
            <li>These combs are about a buck each, are indestructible have large teeth</li>
            <li>When I spoke with the seller he was very apologetic and did not charge me for the remainder of combs that were sent.  </li>
            <li>This comb is very light-weight.  </li>
            <li>Amazon photo of the product package shows USA flag at bottom right, this is what the old US made package had.  </li>
            <li>THIS IS NOT THE REAL ACE CLASSIC COMB.</li>
            <li>Yes, but they are minor - it is not quite as gentle on the scalp as you might imagine, but it doesn&#x27;t scratch you or hurt and given its plastic structure, it will likely break before the rubber combs would have - so I bought a package with several of them as the design still beats most others available on the market.    </li>
            <li>and I was looking for the good old hard rubber Ace combs of yesteryear.  </li>
            <li>A classic grooming aid that my husband loves.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>They will last for a while, but they are NOT unbreakable, and usually cost about 2 to 3 times more than they are worth.  </li>
            <li>I found \\&quot;Ace\\&quot; combs on the Internet and also learned the company had new ownership.  </li>
            <li>Would the old style make me happier - of course.  </li>
            <li>In replacing an old comb that began loosing its teeth, I couldn&#x27;t find in-store replacements.  </li>
            <li>So, until someone makes something better, I&#x27;ll be spending a couple bucks a month to have a comb that fits in my pocket and that I can get through my thick head of hair.</li>
            <li>Still using these, but wish the old-style hard rubber combs were still available.  </li>
            <li>The combs you will receive are the cheaper version, the word Ace in the upper right  and the model of the comb with the sharp, brittle tines.</li>
            <li>Ace men&#x27;s combs used to be made of a flexible rubber type material that would give to the bend of your butt when you sat down without breaking any of the teeth-- not any more-- they make of typical plastic and the darned thing is constantly breaking teeth.  </li>
            <li>THE ORIGINAL WAS MADE OF HARD RUBBER &amp; WOULD LAST FOR EVER.</li>
            <li>The ones I received are made in PRC with no US Flag and ACE logo is in silver on left of comb not center in gold, see photo.</li>
            <li>THE FIRST COMB I USED HAD TEETH MISSING IN A WEEK</li>

            <li> THE FIRST COMB I USED HAD TEETH MISSING IN A WEEK</li>
            <li> Since they used to last so long, I hadn&#x27;t bought one in years.  </li>
            <li> They&#x27;re like seven inches long and NOT five ...</li>
            <li> As other reviewers have said; likely not made from hard rubber and the teeth are sharper oval shape on the ends that contact your scalp, not blunt rectangular shape like the old US made ones were.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m afraid that the teeth will easily break out.  </li>
            <li> Update about a year &amp; a half later.  </li>
            <li> The Ace comb described and pictured on the website has the word Ace in the center and represents the model of the comb that has softer tines that will not scratch your scalp.</li>
            <li> These are also ~2/3 as thick as old US made ACE.  </li>
            <li> Their teeth are so sharp you might as well comb your hair with knives.</li>
            <li> In short, I purchased replacements through Amazon to find the comb teeth are abrasive to the scalp and the combs are quite thin and manufactured with something other than the old hard rubber.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s physical dimensions are virtually identical, but the material is no longer hard rubber, but of plastic.  </li>
            <li> before buying this, I bought a $9.95 (single) comb on Amazon, that had too small teeth.</li>
            <li> Worse the teeth are so sharp that they actually snag your hair and</li>
            <li> no smooth combing through your hair.  </li>
            <li> did have a little problem with the initial order in that the wrong quantity was wrong.  </li>
            <li> Not good.</li>
            <li> This is a piece of crap--</li>
            <li> These are pieces of crap--</li>
            <li> Very disappointed!  </li>

            <li> Another reviewer hit this one on the head.  I&#x27;m a 50-something guy and I was looking for the good old hard rubber Ace combs of yesteryear.  This is not the same product.  I think it is likely the only product they sell like this today though.  It&#x27;s physical dimensions are virtually identical, but the material is no longer hard rubber, but of plastic.  Would the old style make me happier - of course.  Does this one have any drawbacks?  Yes, but they are minor - it is not quite as gentle on the scalp as you might imagine, but it doesn&#x27;t scratch you or hurt and given its plastic structure, it will likely break before the rubber combs would have - so I bought a package with several of them as the design still beats most others available on the market.    Update about a year &amp; a half later.  Still using these, but wish the old-style hard rubber combs were still available.  These combs rarely last over a month in my back pocket as they&#x27;ll get bent around my wallet &amp; break.  So, until someone makes something better, I&#x27;ll be spending a couple bucks a month to have a comb that fits in my pocket and that I can get through my thick head of hair.</li>
            <li> My husband&#x27;s favorite comb!!!  It is sturdy and works well on his thinning hair.</li>
            <li> These combs are the best ever and you can no longer find them in stores.  They are of great quality and slide smoothly through the hair.  The six pack means I&#x27;ll not run out any time soon.</li>
            <li> Not good. They broke as soon as I got in my car. Not the ACE quality that we used to get.</li>
            <li> Do not order this product. What you will receive is not what is pictured The Ace comb described and pictured on the website has the word Ace in the center and represents the model of the comb that has softer tines that will not scratch your scalp. The combs you will receive are the cheaper version, the word Ace in the upper right  and the model of the comb with the sharp, brittle tines. Definitely deceptive advertising.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re like seven inches long and NOT five ...definitely NOT what&#x27;s pictured.</li>
            <li> Amazon photo of the product package shows USA flag at bottom right, this is what the old US made package had.  The ones I received are made in PRC with no US Flag and ACE logo is in silver on left of comb not center in gold, see photo. As other reviewers have said; likely not made from hard rubber and the teeth are sharper oval shape on the ends that contact your scalp, not blunt rectangular shape like the old US made ones were. These are also ~2/3 as thick as old US made ACE.  Damn shame.</li>
            <li> This is a piece of crap-- Ace men&#x27;s combs used to be made of a flexible rubber type material that would give to the bend of your butt when you sat down without breaking any of the teeth-- not any more-- they make of typical plastic and the darned thing is constantly breaking teeth.  Worse the teeth are so sharp that they actually snag your hair and scalp-- no smooth combing through your hair.  These are pieces of crap-- I&#x27;m not every buying them again!!</li>
            <li> These combs are nothing like the original Ace combs. Their teeth are so sharp you might as well comb your hair with knives. Ouch! I don&#x27;t even want to give them away. They&#x27;re trash!</li>
            <li> This is a great little comb that is goes through the washer and dryer repeatedly and comes out strong with no broken teeth.  It is the only comb my husband will use.&lt;br /&gt;We did have a little problem with the initial order in that the wrong quantity was wrong.  When I spoke with the seller he was very apologetic and did not charge me for the remainder of combs that were sent.  I would order from him again.</li>
            <li> I have used Ace combs for many years.  Since they used to last so long, I hadn&#x27;t bought one in years.  In replacing an old comb that began loosing its teeth, I couldn&#x27;t find in-store replacements.  I found \\&quot;Ace\\&quot; combs on the Internet and also learned the company had new ownership.  In short, I purchased replacements through Amazon to find the comb teeth are abrasive to the scalp and the combs are quite thin and manufactured with something other than the old hard rubber.</li>
            <li> THIS IS NOT THE REAL ACE CLASSIC COMB. THE ORIGINAL WAS MADE OF HARD RUBBER &amp; WOULD LAST FOR EVER. THE FIRST COMB I USED HAD TEETH MISSING IN A WEEK</li>
            <li> This comb is very light-weight.  I&#x27;m afraid that the teeth will easily break out.  Supposedly nylon, it seems more like the plastic combs of yore.</li>
            <li> I bought a pack of these to put in my motorcycle gear to comb my hair after using my helmet.</li>
            <li> I have been using these same combs for years.  They go for about $2.29 per comb at Walmart.  They will last for a while, but they are NOT unbreakable, and usually cost about 2 to 3 times more than they are worth.  This deal give you a package of them for about $1 each.  You cannot do better than this for price and quality.  They are well made, good finish, and comb well most any length or coarseness of hair.  The only problem will be if you have to carry them in your pocket: they are not unbreakable.&lt;br /&gt;Good comb, good brand name, well made, and a great deal for the money.  Enjoy.</li>
            <li> I want a good pocket comb with the teeth being the same and one that will last.  This product is very good for me.</li>
            <li> A classic grooming aid that my husband loves. I hope they never discontinue them</li>
            <li> I should have given 1 star!  Very disappointed!  I didn&#x27;t know that ACE made combs like everyone else.  I&#x27;ve been buying them my whole life, and they have always been easy on your head - not this one!</li>
            <li> Very strong. I like this style of comb and purchased these for spares. I have used this type of comb for years and the teeth do not break. Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> before buying this, I bought a $9.95 (single) comb on Amazon, that had too small teeth. These combs are about a buck each, are indestructible have large teeth and you can see they are durable.</li>
            <li> This is not as sturdy as the original Ace comb, it&#x27;s a cheap copy. Buy a lot of them, they break easily.</li>
