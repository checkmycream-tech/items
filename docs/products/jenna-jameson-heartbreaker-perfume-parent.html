            <li> Smells sexy and provocative.</li>
            <li> Awesome! I bought this as a gift for a picky person and she loved it!</li>
            <li> I was first introduced to this scent when a friend bought it and I fell in love.  I just ordered mine (although I found it for half price on ebay) and I&#x27;ve been wearing it ever since.  This is a very spicy, and warm scent.  When I wear it I feel sexy and I know I smell that way too. Everyone has commented on how great it smells and my boyfriend really likes it.  I also love the bottle, It&#x27;s so beautiful to look at and comes with a removeable charm with Jenna&#x27;s signature on the back.  The charm is very heavy so I took it off and am using it as a key chain, which to me is a plus.  I definately recommend this product to anyone looking for a very spicy and sexy scent.</li>

            <li> I bought this as a gift and it&#x27;s new owner loves it, she always says something about saddle wood after notes I personally wasn&#x27;t a fan of it but very cute bottle you can take the broken heart off and use it as a key chain!</li>
            <li> I love this perfume!!! I couldn&#x27;t believe my eyes when I saw it was on sale for $7!!! From $50 to $7, I had to rack up!!! I only bought 4 boxes though and now I see they&#x27;ve sold out </li>
            <li> excellent,will buy again</li>
            <li> I ordered this on a whim.  I wasn&#x27;t specifically shopping for perfume but was looking for a gift for my mother&#x27;s birthday and thought, &amp;#34;Hmm, maybe I should try a new scent.&amp;#34;  When I told my sister, her response was, &amp;#34;Why?  Are you trying to smell like a porn star?&amp;#34;  My answer is this - &amp;#34;If this is what porn stars smell like, sign me up!&amp;#34;  I love this scent.  Not too over the top, sophisticated and understated.  The bottle is a substantial weight, too, with cute heavy metal hearts.  I love to wear this and people do stop me to ask what I have on.  The price was right, the smell is lovely, and I am completely happy.</li>
            <li> I ordered this on the recommendation of someone else, and I have no regrets! First and foremost, the bottle is stunning! I love the red, and the charm is adorable!
