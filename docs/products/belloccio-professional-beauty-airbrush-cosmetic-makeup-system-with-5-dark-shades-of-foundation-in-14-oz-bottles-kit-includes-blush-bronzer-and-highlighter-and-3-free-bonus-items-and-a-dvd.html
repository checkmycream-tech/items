            <li>Just an excellent product!!!!!</li>
            <li>the coverage was not as flawless or easy to apply as the video</li>
            <li>Everything was good but the deoderent burns under my arms</li>
            <li>you&#x27;re good</li>
            <li>I love this item, great investment</li>
            <li>While it worked it did a nice job with applying the make up , so maybe it was just a faulty set.</li>
            <li>Upon opening the package, everything but the most important part of the machine the AIRBRUSH!</li>
            <li>the most and bronzed  🙌🙌🙌🙌🙌🙌🙌🙌🙌🙌🙌🙌🙌🙌🙌🙌🙌👏👏👏</li>
            <li>I love the airbrush and</li>
            <li>Ok I&#x27;ve had this machine for quite some time now</li>
            <li>It was easy to use and very light</li>
            <li>I really do enjoy applying the makeup to my face.</li>
            <li>how the make-up goes on smooth.</li>
            <li>yes you need to clean the airbrush from time to time</li>
            <li>Amazon&#x27;s response was quick.</li>
            <li>and yes you will need to practice with the airbrush to move quickly.</li>
            <li>They gave a full refund right away.</li>
            <li>The refund process was fast and easy I will say.</li>
            <li>This machine was my first airbrush experience.</li>
            <li>but first the gun broke, ( spring part) after a week.  </li>
            <li>This is exactly the thing you are looking for.&lt;br</li>

            <li>But it did come professionally packed.</li>
            <li>its a nice product my only complaint is the air brush gun it kept clogging and would not spay correctly.</li>
            <li>First it wouldnt turn off unless you physically unplug it and a few days later stopped working all together.  </li>

            <li> No airbrush so can&#x27;t try the product not a happy consumer</li>
            <li> This machine was my first airbrush experience. I really do enjoy applying the makeup to my face. I found that the most difficult part for me was breaking the machine down and cleaning it....</li>
            <li> It is very wet looking wasn&#x27;t satisfied at all will be returning it back</li>
            <li> I chose this rating because I did not get an opportunity to use the product because it came incomplete. It had everything as advertised except for the actual airbrush nozzle (which is a very necessary part of the machine). The description on Amazon as well as the packaging states the airbrush was included. Upon opening the package, everything but the most important part of the machine the AIRBRUSH! Amazon&#x27;s response was quick. They gave a full refund right away. I recently returned the purchase. Have not decided if I want to try that company again or try another airbrush brand.</li>
            <li> It was easy to use and very light I used it for the blush the most and bronzed  🙌🙌🙌🙌🙌🙌🙌🙌🙌🙌🙌🙌🙌🙌🙌🙌🙌👏👏👏👏👏love so much</li>
            <li> the color was to dark, I guess I needed the next one up from dark. I love the airbrush and how the make-up goes on smooth.</li>
            <li> the coverage was not as flawless or easy to apply as the video</li>
            <li> WORKS BEAUTIFULLY, EXCEPT FOR THE COLOURS BEING A LITTLE TOO DARK FOR MY COMPLEXION NO COMPLAIN AT ALL, WILL HAVE TO JUST SEND FOR A LIGHTER SHADE ARRIVE ON TIME,  PERFECTO</li>
            <li> I just gotten this item and I event use it yet but I will let you know how it works for me and maybe it can for you too.</li>
            <li> THE MAKEUP GOES ON VERY WET, TOOK MORE THAN 10 MINUTES TO DRY.  IT TOOK 40+DROPS TO COVER MY FACE, AS SOON AS I WENT OUTSIDE, THE MAKEUP STARTED TO RUN.</li>
            <li> Just an excellent product!!!!!</li>
            <li> NONE OF THE COLORS MATCHED MY SKIN</li>
            <li> Have not had a chance to use this equipment yet. But it did come professionally packed. Everything was included. Can&#x27;t wait to use it.</li>
            <li> I read the reviews and maybe mine was defective but first the gun broke, ( spring part) after a week.  2 weeks later compressor stopped working.  First it wouldnt turn off unless you physically unplug it and a few days later stopped working all together.  While it worked it did a nice job with applying the make up , so maybe it was just a faulty set.</li>
            <li> its a nice product my only complaint is the air brush gun it kept clogging and would not spay correctly.</li>
            <li> Everything was good but the deoderent burns under my arms</li>
            <li> Ok I&#x27;ve had this machine for quite some time now and I have thrown out all other foundations.&lt;br /&gt; I swear by Belloccio&#x27;s entire line of products!  (except the tanner spray, obviously! LOL)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Matching my shade of brown has always been difficult when buying makeup plus as soon as I find one I like it get&#x27;s discontinued!&lt;br /&gt;So after searching for my next temporary foundation #5,999 I came across Belloccio and watched/read all I could find. Having never tried airbrush i was skeptical but desperation took over and I made the purchase.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;OMG. Why didn&#x27;t I know about this thing 5/10/15 years ago?!&lt;br /&gt;This little machine has cut my makeup time in half not to mention the makeup lasts ALL DAY.&lt;br /&gt;My skin is super oily and on hot days when I notice any shine I simply use a blotting sheet and it&#x27;s DONE.&lt;br /&gt;If you are not he fence about this machine, don&#x27;t be. This is exactly the thing you are looking for.&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re good you can also apply your blush and eyeshadow with this one unit and you&#x27;re fav colors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So yes it&#x27;s pricey, yes you need to clean the airbrush from time to time and yes you will need to practice with the airbrush to move quickly. However, you&#x27;ll never use sponges/wedges again, your makeup will be applied in a cleaner way and you will LOVE the high quality results that last all day long...nighttime too if you&#x27;re careful about it!</li>
            <li> I love this item, great investment</li>
            <li> I was very disappointed that this didn&#x27;t give me the results I was hoping for. The product was too thin and the gun didn&#x27;t spray evenly. The refund process was fast and easy I will say.</li>
