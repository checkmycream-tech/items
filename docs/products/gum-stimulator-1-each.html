            <li>This is a great device and works very well.  </li>
            <li>I have been using Butler G-U-M Stimulator for more than three years, my dentist recommended it to prevent gum diseases and to improve my oral care.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used this tool for many years.</li>
            <li>I LOVE the gum stimulator; it really works GREAT</li>
            <li>I am completely satisfied with the product and recommend to others.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using the Butler G-U-M Stimulator for several months and it works perfectly for the job it was designed to do.</li>
            <li>I used to be able to buy toothbrushes with those pointed rubber things at the end.</li>
            <li>This is the next best thing.</li>
            <li>It easily removes food stuck in the gaps between teeth.</li>
            <li>I would prefer they sell a softer tip for this reason, but overall it is great quality and better than the tips attached to GUM toothbrushes, and easier to use.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Really love how clean this helps make my mouth feel.</li>
            <li>It makes a huge difference.  </li>
            <li>Looked all over our area for this gum stimulator which I&#x27;d originally received a number of years ago from our dentist.  </li>
            <li>My teeth feel really clean now.</li>
            <li>and I get more out with this thing because it goes around the whole tooth not just in between.  </li>
            <li>it does what supposed to do thanks so much ,I fell better</li>
            <li>Just don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s right, so had to give the item a 1-Star</li>
            <li>I am unaware of a better gum stimulater.</li>
            <li>It is an essential part of my self-dentalcare routine for keeping my gums healthy.</li>
            <li>Glad I finally got it.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I signed it because I really needed this particular item!  </li>
            <li>How much can you say about a gum stimulator.</li>
            <li>Works very well.</li>
            <li>My dentist wants me to use a gum stimulator.</li>
            <li>So far I love it and will continue to use it in my daily routine.</li>
            <li>At first, it appears to be quite time consuming but after doing it for a while, it becomes pretty fast and not a big deal anymore, just like flossing.</li>
            <li>But after using this for several months every night, my teeth did not bleed for the first time ever during dental cleaning.</li>
            <li>GOES FAR IN HELPING</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not one to sign up for anything that requires prep, so this is not used as frequently as I would like.</li>
            <li>I really like it a lot enough to use it every day.</li>
            <li>All three would have fit in the same package used to ship each one individually and the overall charge would have been about the same as the charge for one; BUT I had to sign an agreement saying I understood and agreed to the separate charges...</li>
            <li>If you don&#x27;t want to take the time to warm it up, the tip can be a little stiff and sharp.</li>

            <li> This tool is really great for a quick &amp;#34;flossing&amp;#34; when you don&#x27;t quite have the time to floss. It easily removes food stuck in the gaps between teeth. I wish it came it other finishes so it would be easier to tell mine apart from my husband&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> This is a great device and works very well.  Refills aren&#x27;t too pricey wither.  I am unaware of a better gum stimulater.</li>
            <li> Great product that helps to improve the healthiness of your gums and teeth. Great way to remove tarter from your gum-line.</li>
            <li> Arrived quickly, works great!</li>
            <li> PERFECT PRODUCT FOR MAINTAINING HEALTHY GUMS - FOR SENIOR CITIZENS - VERY HARD TO FIND IN ANY LOCAL STORE - THESE ARRIVED IN TWO DAYS - DAILY USE GOES FAR IN HELPING YOU KEEP YOUR TEETH - YOUR CHOICE.</li>
            <li> I have been using Butler G-U-M Stimulator for more than three years, my dentist recommended it to prevent gum diseases and to improve my oral care. So far I love it and will continue to use it in my daily routine.</li>
            <li> How much can you say about a gum stimulator. The handle is sturdy metal and the tip is sufficient in size. If you don&#x27;t want to take the time to warm it up, the tip can be a little stiff and sharp. I&#x27;m not one to sign up for anything that requires prep, so this is not used as frequently as I would like. I would prefer they sell a softer tip for this reason, but overall it is great quality and better than the tips attached to GUM toothbrushes, and easier to use.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this tool for many years. It is excellent for massaging the gums between the teeth. It is an essential part of my self-dentalcare routine for keeping my gums healthy. I have had gingivitis in the past, but no more. I bought this one to keep in my travel toiletry bag. It is impossible to find in any local store, so ordering it on-line is the only way.</li>
            <li> I hate flossing but I do it anyway.  I actually should say, I &amp;#34;hated&amp;#34; flossing.  The time it takes annoys me and it seems like my gums still bled everytime anyway.  Now I floss, use this to stimulate my gums and then brush.  This tool is awesome.  My gums like it.  They aren&#x27;t bleeding now and I get more out with this thing because it goes around the whole tooth not just in between.  I really like it a lot enough to use it every day. I actually look forward to using it.  My teeth feel really clean now.</li>
            <li> Hard to find this tool in local stores.  Perfect for getting in between my teeth and around the gum line.</li>
            <li> Looked all over our area for this gum stimulator which I&#x27;d originally received a number of years ago from our dentist.  But, I couldn&#x27;t find it anywhere and they no longer had a source for the item.  I checked Amazon.com and found it.  I LOVE the gum stimulator; it really works GREAT and I wanted to give it a 5-Star.  However, I did not because of the company policy of charging SEPARATE shipping &amp; handling fees for each item.  I ordered three small, different  dental items of this size.  All three would have fit in the same package used to ship each one individually and the overall charge would have been about the same as the charge for one; BUT I had to sign an agreement saying I understood and agreed to the separate charges...I signed it because I really needed this particular item!  Just don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s right, so had to give the item a 1-Star since there doesn&#x27;t seem to be a place to rate shipping &amp; handling!</li>
            <li> Just had to write - the dentist who prefers other methods of cleaning apparently doesn&#x27;t understand that this product is for stimulating gums, toughening them up, increasing circulation. It&#x27;s for gum disease. &lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s not for cavities and it&#x27;s not a substitute for dental floss. &lt;br /&gt;Not intended to be.</li>
            <li> The Butler Gum stimulator is an excellent tool for dislodging food particles that are stuck inside the gums.  I use it as a regular part of my dental care.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re on this page, you&#x27;re probably already taking care of your gums.  Good for you!&lt;br /&gt;My only complaint is that it&#x27;s hard to make the replacement heads stay on well.</li>
            <li> I bought this gum stimulator because I was getting braces. The thing works likes a charm. I use it every time I brush my teeth. The stimulator gets the hard places to reach in the mouth. I would recommend this product to anyone getting or has braces.</li>
            <li> I am a water color painter and I use for applying a product called Frisket to my paintings.  Works very well.</li>
            <li> Too hard--not a rubber tip, hard plastic.</li>
            <li> Take the time to master the art of sliding these tips along your gum line; my gums are healthier, my breath in the morning is sweeter and there is no bleeding when i brush</li>
            <li> Does the job. Came in great condition</li>
            <li> The Gum Stimulators go with the refills. Just what my dentist asked me to use. Thank you.</li>
            <li> I just received this today, and I love it!  It makes a huge difference.  I will continue to use and buy replacement heads.</li>
            <li> I bought this as a spare, it isn&#x27;t too bad, but the tip is really hard compared to the other one I have.</li>
            <li> I used to bleed quite a lot during dental cleaning and my gum line is slowing receding. But after using this for several months every night, my teeth did not bleed for the first time ever during dental cleaning. The hygienist also said there is improvement in gum health. Only after using this do I realize the amount of food residue left behind even with regular brushing and flossing. At first, it appears to be quite time consuming but after doing it for a while, it becomes pretty fast and not a big deal anymore, just like flossing. I think everyone should try this and see for themselves.</li>
            <li> This was hard to find locally. Glad I finally got it.&lt;br /&gt;Really love how clean this helps make my mouth feel.</li>
            <li> I ordered this product because it is so hard to find in stores.  I am completely satisfied with the product and recommend to others.</li>

            <li> My dentist wants me to use a gum stimulator. I used to be able to buy toothbrushes with those pointed rubber things at the end. But that seems to be history. This is the next best thing.</li>
            <li> I like it, for getting into those hard to reach spots. It gets around the gum line which I like</li>
            <li> The tips do not stay as tightly set in the Stimulator as in the past and comes out of too much pressure is applied. Not a problem in the past.</li>
