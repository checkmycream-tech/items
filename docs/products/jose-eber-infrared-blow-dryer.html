            <li>The post said they weren&#x27;t sure about the long-term used of infrared heat in a blow dryer.  </li>
            <li>you are better off going to Cosmo proff or</li>
            <li>&#x3D;)</li>
            <li>My wife absolutely love this blow dryer.</li>
            <li>but I appreciate the fact that the noise it makes is more of a &amp;#34;whoosh&amp;#34; instead of a &amp;#34;whine&amp;#34;...</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t used many blow dryers</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m in love with this one.  </li>
            <li>I might start blow drying my hair more often.</li>
            <li>I am really enjoying my blow dryer.  </li>
            <li>Love It.</li>
            <li>I really don&#x27;t like hair dryers all that much, but I&#x27;m very happy with this one.</li>
            <li>Quality seems good, it&#x27;s very quiet.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I got a good price on it otherwise would have been very dissappointed</li>
            <li>OMG all the reviews are sooo true!</li>
            <li>It got one star knocked off because it can be easy to bump the buttons accidentally.</li>
            <li>My hair is easy to manage</li>
            <li>Also, because it&#x27;s not as hot, I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it for non-hair purposes like Jamberry nails or any kind of craft activity.</li>
            <li>and I end up with fine frizzy-straight hair.</li>
            <li>Makes a huge difference.  </li>
            <li>but my hair is silky and frizz free</li>
            <li>I liked her dryer so much I had to buy one for myself.</li>
            <li>The Solaride had a gentle low blower setting that worked perfectly for me, but I could not find a U.S. source that carried that product.</li>
            <li>As far as the blow dryer goes, I loved it when I got it.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s more like a strong wind sound than a high pitched motor sound like most hair dryers.</li>
            <li>so I&#x27;m still not sure I&#x27;d spend this kind of money on a hair dryer myself, but I am happy to have gotten one as a gift.</li>
            <li>I returned the original unit and am waiting to receive the replacement product, which I hope will fill my needs.</li>
            <li>excellent product, dries hair quickly, relatively quiet, less frizz, nice shine,  </li>
            <li>When I asked at Ulta what was so special about this hair dryer I was told, &amp;#34;nothing, air is air.&amp;#34; Went home and thought about it</li>
            <li>I like it a lot, but probably wouldn&#x27;t pay full price for another one.</li>
            <li>I thought maybe all the hype over this dryer might actually be true, but it wasn&#x27;t for me.</li>
            <li>If it were not for that problem, the dryer would be great (other than the weight).  </li>
            <li>Great product so far, dries hair quickly an makes it so soft and shiny.</li>
            <li>Dries quickly.</li>
            <li>I have very fine naturally curly hair and the lowest blower setting on the Jose Eber hair dryer is much too strong for my hair type.  </li>
            <li>If you like your hair to  be  blown dry in a hurry, this is a good tool.</li>
            <li>Red light is great for your hair this blow dryer is future forward!!</li>
            <li>Definately worth the investment.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s worth every penny.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s so powerful.</li>
            <li>It blows the curls right out</li>
            <li>This hair dryer doesn&#x27;t damage your hair and you get a blowout that looks like you walked right out of the salon.</li>
            <li>and it straightens perfectly w/o drying out my ends in half the time of my traditional dryer.</li>
            <li>I have beautiful one thick hair.</li>
            <li>that it dries hair super fast.  </li>
            <li>Dries hair super fast.</li>
            <li>and this dryer dried my hair so quickly it was like magic and my hair is as smooth as silk.  </li>
            <li>Drys hair very fast and isn&#x27;t hot like ceramic dryers.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s not as hot as the cheaper hair dryers.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;The first time I used it, there was a learning curve.</li>
            <li>My only con comment is that it is heavier than most dryers.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t feel as hot, either.</li>
            <li>I think others should be aware.</li>
            <li>Makes my hair so smooth and soft.  </li>
            <li>So much better than the standard blow dryers.</li>

            <li>it is much more powerful than the brands you can purchase in your local stores, but not as powerful as some of the high end professional blow dryers you can buy online.</li>
            <li>Thanks so much!</li>
            <li>the first day she went to work after using it, someone asked her how she got her hair to shine so much.</li>
            <li>My hair was so full of static and super dry after only 2 or 3 uses!  </li>
            <li>It dries it fast, and does NOT burn your hair.</li>
            <li>The pros: it&#x27;s powerful but not too loud.</li>
            <li>On a side note, my hair is somewhat thinning and this blow dryer gives my hair much needed volume and it feels so much smoother since I&#x27;ve been using it.  </li>
            <li>I have really curly hair</li>
            <li>so be gentle with your Jose drier</li>
            <li>and it will be gentle with your hair.</li>
            <li>It really Does reduce frizz.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s extremely powerful but not heavy like this infrared dryer.</li>
            <li>Its fast and helps with frizz.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s super powerful and can dry my shoulder length hair in 7 min, and it comes out sleek and shiny.  </li>
            <li>My wife paid full price at a local mall and she hides it from me when we argue so</li>
            <li>Overall, I think it&#x27;s worth what I paid ($97), but I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s a real breakthrough in technology.</li>
            <li>When I was using full heat, it dried so quickly that it became tangled</li>
            <li>I have long, super fine hair, and this does dry it faster</li>
            <li>Especially if you take time to clip your hair and do it in sections with a round brush (my hair is thick and naturally wavy), gives you a beautiful healthy shine.</li>
            <li>It also smooths my hair a little better.</li>
            <li>The heat element provides a soft gentle heat.</li>
            <li>And for me, the most unfortunate part is that a quick dry does not equate to frizz free hair.</li>
            <li>It does not blow dry my hair good not satisfied</li>
            <li>So, if you want super dry, tangly hair, this is the dryer for you!</li>
            <li>The nozzle flies off all the time and is extremely hot to put back on.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a little hefty, but an easy  workout I suppose.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s okay, but it is VERY heavy.....</li>
            <li>i love it soo much, plus i dry my hair in half time</li>
            <li>It is heavy, though, so not the kind I&#x27;d want to tote to the gym or pool, and the controls are kind of awkwardly placed.  </li>
            <li>I bought the Jose Eber to replace a 760 watt Solaride 21 Professional far infrared hair dryer after the switch stopped working.</li>
            <li>I contacted the Jose Eber seller, Top Tier Beauty, through Amazon with my complaint.</li>
            <li>My heir is soft</li>
            <li>I only wash my hair twice a week (normally), but it was as if the over drying was making it ultra oily.  </li>
            <li>A little pricey but so far worth it.</li>
            <li>I have thick hair that fizzes easily</li>
            <li>They explained that a diffuser attachment to soften the effect of the blower was not available and suggested an exchange for the Jose Eber Quick Shine infrared blow dryer, which is a smaller and lighter unit.</li>
            <li>It dried my hair super fast and definitively cut down on the frizz.</li>
            <li>I bought this less than a year ago (9 months to be exact) from Amazon, the seller was AVEYOU Beauty Boutique, and I paid $150.</li>
            <li>I normally blow dry my hair twice a year b/c of the breakage I would see in my sink from the heat</li>
            <li>I was a little skeptical since my other hair dryer was more powerful, but it took about 20% off the drying time of my very think hair.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s worth the money to dry my hair in half the time.</li>
            <li>It does dry my thick, curly hair very quickly and almost eliminates the need for a straightener -- almost.  </li>
            <li>The only problem is that once your hair starts to get dry, the high setting can blow a rat&#x27;s nest in your hair, so start high and then bring it down to the lower setting.</li>
            <li>Incidentally, this resulted in accidentally pushing down the &amp;#34;cool&amp;#34; button for a long time which didn&#x27;t help my hair dry quickly.</li>

            <li> So, if you want super dry, tangly hair, this is the dryer for you!</li>
            <li> The nozzle flies off all the time and is extremely hot to put back on.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little hefty, but an easy  workout I suppose.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s okay, but it is VERY heavy.....</li>
            <li> i love it soo much, plus i dry my hair in half time</li>
            <li> It is heavy, though, so not the kind I&#x27;d want to tote to the gym or pool, and the controls are kind of awkwardly placed.  </li>
            <li> I bought the Jose Eber to replace a 760 watt Solaride 21 Professional far infrared hair dryer after the switch stopped working.</li>
            <li> I contacted the Jose Eber seller, Top Tier Beauty, through Amazon with my complaint.</li>
            <li> My heir is soft</li>
            <li> I only wash my hair twice a week (normally), but it was as if the over drying was making it ultra oily.  </li>
            <li> A little pricey but so far worth it.</li>
            <li> I have thick hair that fizzes easily</li>
            <li> They explained that a diffuser attachment to soften the effect of the blower was not available and suggested an exchange for the Jose Eber Quick Shine infrared blow dryer, which is a smaller and lighter unit.</li>
            <li> It dried my hair super fast and definitively cut down on the frizz.</li>
            <li> I bought this less than a year ago (9 months to be exact) from Amazon, the seller was AVEYOU Beauty Boutique, and I paid $150.</li>
            <li> I normally blow dry my hair twice a year b/c of the breakage I would see in my sink from the heat</li>
            <li> I was a little skeptical since my other hair dryer was more powerful, but it took about 20% off the drying time of my very think hair.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s worth the money to dry my hair in half the time.</li>
            <li> It does dry my thick, curly hair very quickly and almost eliminates the need for a straightener -- almost.  </li>
            <li> The only problem is that once your hair starts to get dry, the high setting can blow a rat&#x27;s nest in your hair, so start high and then bring it down to the lower setting.</li>
            <li> Incidentally, this resulted in accidentally pushing down the &amp;#34;cool&amp;#34; button for a long time which didn&#x27;t help my hair dry quickly.</li>
            <li> The noise it makes doesn&#x27;t seem to be as excessively loud as other dryers I&#x27;ve used, and I like how sturdy it feels.</li>
            <li> Another thing is that it put out so much wind that it tangled my hair like crazy, making it a super pain to brush.  </li>
            <li> I have naturally wavy hair and use a dryer and a round brush to straighten it daily.</li>
            <li> in all, once I got the hang of using it, I definitely noticed a difference in the softness and sleekness of my hair when dry!</li>
            <li> I have always purchased cheap hair dryers from drug stores or places like KMart, so I was really skeptical about this when I got one as a gift.  </li>
            <li> She timed how long it took to dry her hair</li>
            <li> I tried this dryer and timed how long it would take to dry my hair</li>
            <li> : it definitely dries faster than any other dryer I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> I have dropped other blow dryers from head height to solid surfaces and never had one break.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not even considering buying any other driers... 5 BIG STARS!</li>
            <li> Here in the South drying hair in the summer can be a sweltering experience but the Jose Eber Infrared Blow Dryer reduces the time it takes to dry your hair and the heat from the dryer.</li>
            <li> Even though it comes with a lifetime (limited) warranty.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s definitely above average, but it&#x27;s not a miracle worker.</li>
            <li> I have thick wavy hair and live in Arizona</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s on the expensive side, but well worth it.</li>
            <li> Women who have used it claim that they didn&#x27;t have to use a flat iron once they dried their hair with it.</li>
            <li> Not exactly what I expected in drying.  </li>
            <li> but there was completely no hair the sink!!!!</li>
            <li> Also, it seems to not heat up quite as much as other dryers I&#x27;ve used, which I also like.</li>
            <li> i don&#x27;t know if any other blow dryer do what this does</li>
            <li> I feel funny saying that about a dryer, but it has some design elements that make it difficult to use.</li>
            <li> This hair dryer is unlike any other you have ever used.</li>
            <li> I regretfully have to say that my hair is no shinier or smoother than it is with any other hair dryer.</li>
            <li> then any other hair dryer as advertised.</li>
            <li> At first I was skeptical with the purchase because it wouldn&#x27;t allow me to track my purchase</li>
            <li> , only drawback dryer is very heavy</li>
            <li> This does dry my hair a little faster so cuts down some of the heat.  </li>
            <li> Other than being a little heavy due to the glass lining of this hair dryer, it does dry quicker with the infrared heat.  </li>
            <li> My hair is thick and coarse and it worked well.</li>
            <li> I have to hold the heat button down with a lot of pressure to keep it lit.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not a review writer, typically.</li>
            <li> Dries in half the time.</li>
            <li> So not true.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s not as heavy as the other reviews described (maybe I&#x27;m used to heavy dryers??)</li>
            <li> so you have to grip it tightly.</li>
            <li> but it heavy for a hair dryer.</li>
            <li> It is too heavy, and it burns your hair.</li>
            <li> I have long and very thick hair</li>
            <li> Dries hair quickly, but can only use medium power or hair will tangle into horrible knots.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been in this game almost as long as Jose himself.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know the logistics of this, but something about the infrared turns my usual frizzy hair into sleekness....</li>
            <li> It only applies to authorized dealers and even then I&#x27;m not sure you could get a human being to assist you with said warranty. :(</li>
            <li> It is very heavy</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t go hardly a day without a washing.  </li>
            <li> For instance, you might bump the on/off switch to on, and when you plug it in it immediately starts up and sucks up a nearby towel or your hair.</li>
            <li> My daughter can now blow dry her hair without any conditioner and her shines like crazy.</li>
            <li> All I care about it cutting down my drying time.</li>
            <li> Tired of using your wife&#x27;s hair dryer?  </li>
            <li> Inside is made of thin plastic and was shattered from a fall on the floor after a week of use and could not be repaired.</li>
            <li> I hate the feeling of wet hair</li>
            <li> Cons, it is heavy and the controls are in a very awkward  place.</li>
            <li> So, be wary of that.</li>
            <li> Sorry.</li>
            <li> The cons: as another reviewer mentioned the buttons are in an awkward position and I find myself accidentally turning it off.</li>
            <li> So it is very awkward to use.  </li>
            <li> I have no issues with Amazon or AVEYOU, however Jose Eber&#x27;s customer service is atrocious!</li>
            <li> This is the absolutely worst hair dryer I have ever purchased.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Great hair dryer.  Dries hair quickly, but can only use medium power or hair will tangle into horrible knots.  Does leave hair smoother than a traditional hairdryer.  Definately worth the investment.</li>
            <li> Great hair dryer! I really don&#x27;t like hair dryers all that much, but I&#x27;m very happy with this one. The noise it makes doesn&#x27;t seem to be as excessively loud as other dryers I&#x27;ve used, and I like how sturdy it feels. Also, it seems to not heat up quite as much as other dryers I&#x27;ve used, which I also like. It got one star knocked off because it can be easy to bump the buttons accidentally. For instance, you might bump the on/off switch to on, and when you plug it in it immediately starts up and sucks up a nearby towel or your hair. So, be wary of that. Otherwise, a great product.</li>
            <li> Mailed in a timely manner. Love the product!</li>
            <li> I have always purchased cheap hair dryers from drug stores or places like KMart, so I was really skeptical about this when I got one as a gift.  I have long, super fine hair, and this does dry it faster and it&#x27;s not as hot as the cheaper hair dryers.  I hate the feeling of wet hair so I use it a lot.  It is heavy, though, so not the kind I&#x27;d want to tote to the gym or pool, and the controls are kind of awkwardly placed.  Also, because it&#x27;s not as hot, I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it for non-hair purposes like Jamberry nails or any kind of craft activity. My hair is easy to manage so I&#x27;m still not sure I&#x27;d spend this kind of money on a hair dryer myself, but I am happy to have gotten one as a gift.</li>
            <li> I have very fine naturally curly hair and the lowest blower setting on the Jose Eber hair dryer is much too strong for my hair type.  It blows the curls right out and I end up with fine frizzy-straight hair. I bought the Jose Eber to replace a 760 watt Solaride 21 Professional far infrared hair dryer after the switch stopped working. The Solaride had a gentle low blower setting that worked perfectly for me, but I could not find a U.S. source that carried that product. I contacted the Jose Eber seller, Top Tier Beauty, through Amazon with my complaint. They explained that a diffuser attachment to soften the effect of the blower was not available and suggested an exchange for the Jose Eber Quick Shine infrared blow dryer, which is a smaller and lighter unit. I returned the original unit and am waiting to receive the replacement product, which I hope will fill my needs.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been buying this blow dryer for my father. This is my fourth one. He uses it for his skin alergy and it works very good. The thing is when he dropped it, it broke to pieces. Overall I am satistied!!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s okay, but it is VERY heavy.....plus, I&#x27;m not convinced that it was not &#x27;refurbished.&#x27;  Already the infrared feature is not working.  I have to hold the heat button down with a lot of pressure to keep it lit.  So it is very awkward to use.  If it were not for that problem, the dryer would be great (other than the weight).  It does dry my thick, curly hair very quickly and almost eliminates the need for a straightener -- almost.  If not for the defect, I would have given it 4 stars.  If not for the weight - 5 stars!</li>
            <li> This is the best blow dryer I&#x27;ve had. The only problem is that once your hair starts to get dry, the high setting can blow a rat&#x27;s nest in your hair, so start high and then bring it down to the lower setting. You&#x27;ll love this product.</li>
            <li> I purchased this dryer based on a post on The Beauty Department website.  The post said they weren&#x27;t sure about the long-term used of infrared heat in a blow dryer.  Well, I couldn&#x27;t even take short-term use of it.  My hair was so full of static and super dry after only 2 or 3 uses!  I only wash my hair twice a week (normally), but it was as if the over drying was making it ultra oily.  I couldn&#x27;t go hardly a day without a washing.  Another thing is that it put out so much wind that it tangled my hair like crazy, making it a super pain to brush.  Nothing about this dryer worked except that it dries hair super fast.  So, if you want super dry, tangly hair, this is the dryer for you!</li>
            <li> When I asked at Ulta what was so special about this hair dryer I was told, &amp;#34;nothing, air is air.&amp;#34; Went home and thought about it bought it online. So not true. This hair dryer doesn&#x27;t damage your hair and you get a blowout that looks like you walked right out of the salon. I&#x27;ve had mine now for over 2 years and try taking it away from me I dare you! I have beautiful one thick hair. It dries it fast, and does NOT burn your hair. I&#x27;m telling you, this hair dryer is amazing. I can&#x27;t rave enough about it. Especially if you take time to clip your hair and do it in sections with a round brush (my hair is thick and naturally wavy), gives you a beautiful healthy shine. This hair dryer is amazing!</li>
            <li> I thought this hair dryer is the best well Im returning it . It does not blow dry my hair good not satisfied I would not recommend this product to any one . you are better off going to Cosmo proff or even TJmaxx they have good blow dryers. then you have spend money on this product back.</li>
            <li> YES! Excellent product!</li>
            <li> Quality seems good, it&#x27;s very quiet.&lt;br /&gt;I no longer leave the room when my wife dries her hair.&lt;br /&gt;Our hair does feel different (with infrared) than with our traditional dryer.</li>
            <li> I used the blow dryer elsewhere and ordered one for myself. It was a great price and a great item.</li>
            <li> Works great. Dries quickly.</li>
            <li> excellent product, dries hair quickly, relatively quiet, less frizz, nice shine,  great having 2 nozzles to choose from, only drawback dryer is very heavy</li>
            <li> OMG all the reviews are sooo true! i don&#x27;t know if any other blow dryer do what this does but my hair is silky and frizz free &#x3D;) i love it soo much, plus i dry my hair in half time</li>
            <li> I have naturally wavy hair and use a dryer and a round brush to straighten it daily. Recently I moved to a humid climate and needed something to fight the humidity. I came across a review that recommended this dryer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first time I used it, there was a learning curve. I feel funny saying that about a dryer, but it has some design elements that make it difficult to use. It is very heavy so you have to grip it tightly. Incidentally, this resulted in accidentally pushing down the &amp;#34;cool&amp;#34; button for a long time which didn&#x27;t help my hair dry quickly. When I was using full heat, it dried so quickly that it became tangled and I had to stop repeatedly to brush it out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, once I got the hang of using it, I definitely noticed a difference in the softness and sleekness of my hair when dry! I only paid $50 for mine. I like it a lot, but probably wouldn&#x27;t pay full price for another one.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great dryer. Drys hair very fast and isn&#x27;t hot like ceramic dryers. Here in the South drying hair in the summer can be a sweltering experience but the Jose Eber Infrared Blow Dryer reduces the time it takes to dry your hair and the heat from the dryer. My only con comment is that it is heavier than most dryers. I have become use to the weight but it heavy for a hair dryer.</li>
            <li> This hair dryer is unlike any other you have ever used. It is gentler on your hair, yet dries it faster. It doesn&#x27;t feel as hot, either. Women who have used it claim that they didn&#x27;t have to use a flat iron once they dried their hair with it.</li>
            <li> Keeping this as a second blow dryer for my guest bathroom.  . it is much more powerful than the brands you can purchase in your local stores, but not as powerful as some of the high end professional blow dryers you can buy online. If you like your hair to  be  blown dry in a hurry, this is a good tool.</li>
            <li> Item as described. My wife absolutely love this blow dryer. She timed how long it took to dry her hair and it was 7 minutes. Jose Eber was even suggested on the ellen show.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s definitely above average, but it&#x27;s not a miracle worker. The pros: it&#x27;s powerful but not too loud. I can&#x27;t say it&#x27;s quiet but I appreciate the fact that the noise it makes is more of a &amp;#34;whoosh&amp;#34; instead of a &amp;#34;whine&amp;#34;...it&#x27;s more like a strong wind sound than a high pitched motor sound like most hair dryers. Another pro: it definitely dries faster than any other dryer I&#x27;ve used. The cons: as another reviewer mentioned the buttons are in an awkward position and I find myself accidentally turning it off. And for me, the most unfortunate part is that a quick dry does not equate to frizz free hair. I regretfully have to say that my hair is no shinier or smoother than it is with any other hair dryer. Overall, I think it&#x27;s worth what I paid ($97), but I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s a real breakthrough in technology.</li>
            <li> This is the absolutely worst hair dryer I have ever purchased. It is too heavy, and it burns your hair.</li>
            <li> Red light is great for your hair this blow dryer is future forward!!</li>
            <li> Love this blow dryer!!  The best one I have ever had.</li>
            <li> Tired of using your wife&#x27;s hair dryer?  My wife has had her hair dryer for 6 months and she loves it.  I liked her dryer so much I had to buy one for myself. It&#x27;s relatively quiet and a bit pricey, so we hope it will last a while.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think this hair dyer is any cooler then any other hair dryer as advertised.I have thick wavy hair and live in Arizona so by the time I finish drying my hair I need another shower! This does dry my hair a little faster so cuts down some of the heat.  It also smooths my hair a little better. The nozzle flies off all the time and is extremely hot to put back on.  I got a good price on it otherwise would have been very dissappointed</li>
            <li> Great Item Best Dryer! Great Seller! Thanks so much!</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used many blow dryers but I&#x27;m in love with this one.  My wife paid full price at a local mall and she hides it from me when we argue so I didn&#x27;t hesitate to buy my own.  It&#x27;s worth every penny.  I don&#x27;t know how I lived without one.  On a side note, my hair is somewhat thinning and this blow dryer gives my hair much needed volume and it feels so much smoother since I&#x27;ve been using it.  Get one while you can!</li>
            <li> Great product so far, dries hair quickly an makes it so soft and shiny. A little pricey but so far worth it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s worth the money to dry my hair in half the time.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know the logistics of this, but something about the infrared turns my usual frizzy hair into sleekness....I&#x27;m hooked.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not a review writer, typically. That being said with the amount of money I paid for this I think others should be aware. I bought this less than a year ago (9 months to be exact) from Amazon, the seller was AVEYOU Beauty Boutique, and I paid $150. I have no issues with Amazon or AVEYOU, however Jose Eber&#x27;s customer service is atrocious! I have tried to contact customer service twice with no response. All I want to know is if AVEYOU is an authorized dealer. Anyway, on customer service alone I would  not purchase from Jose Eber again, -5 stars.  As far as the blow dryer goes, I loved it when I got it. It dried my hair super fast and definitively cut down on the frizz. 5 stars there. Cons, it is heavy and the controls are in a very awkward  place. It took me a week or two to get used to it so as to not change settings while in use, 2 stars.&lt;br /&gt;Two weeks ago it fell off my counter, I broke the fall with my knee, it hit a rug and something inside shattered into a million pieces.I have dropped other blow dryers from head height to solid surfaces and never had one break.&lt;br /&gt;So, all in all between customer service and the fragility of this blow dryer I would pass. Even though it comes with a lifetime (limited) warranty. It only applies to authorized dealers and even then I&#x27;m not sure you could get a human being to assist you with said warranty. :(</li>
            <li> At first I was skeptical with the purchase because it wouldn&#x27;t allow me to track my purchase but surprisingly it delivered on time....It works great and it&#x27;s not as heavy as the other reviews described (maybe I&#x27;m used to heavy dryers??) I have really curly hair and it straightens perfectly w/o drying out my ends in half the time of my traditional dryer. I normally blow dry my hair twice a year b/c of the breakage I would see in my sink from the heat but there was completely no hair the sink!!!! My heir is soft I might start blow drying my hair more often.</li>
            <li> You probably guessed I&#x27;m a hairdresser. I&#x27;ve been in this game almost as long as Jose himself. I don&#x27;t go for gimmicks, I&#x27;ve seen plenty of newfangled gadgetry in my 30 years of hairdressing. This is the best hair drier I&#x27;ve ever used. It&#x27;s a little hefty, but an easy  workout I suppose. The heat element provides a soft gentle heat. However, be forewarned it is encased in glass so be gentle with your Jose drier and it will be gentle with your hair. It really Does reduce frizz. I&#x27;m not even considering buying any other driers... 5 BIG STARS!</li>
            <li> This is by far the best blow dryer I have ever used.  I have thick hair that fizzes easily and this dryer dried my hair so quickly it was like magic and my hair is as smooth as silk.  No kidding!</li>
            <li> Not exactly what I expected in drying.  Wish I had purchased an ionized dryer instead.  I would not recommend this product to anyone. Sorry.</li>
            <li> I am really enjoying my blow dryer.  It drys faster and makes my hair feel very smooth and healthy.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you Jose for creating a blessing for women.</li>
            <li> I love it!  Makes my hair so smooth and soft.  Makes a huge difference.  So much better than the standard blow dryers.</li>
            <li> Other than being a little heavy due to the glass lining of this hair dryer, it does dry quicker with the infrared heat.  It doesn&#x27;t get too hot either.  My hair is thick and coarse and it worked well.</li>
            <li> This is the best blow dryer!  It&#x27;s super powerful and can dry my shoulder length hair in 7 min, and it comes out sleek and shiny.  Great product.</li>
            <li> My daughter can now blow dry her hair without any conditioner and her shines like crazy. The bonus of it being gentler on her hair is just a bonus. The shine in her hair is so noticeable, the first day she went to work after using it, someone asked her how she got her hair to shine so much.</li>
            <li> I thought maybe all the hype over this dryer might actually be true, but it wasn&#x27;t for me. All I care about it cutting down my drying time. I have long and very thick hair so it seems to take forever. I tried this dryer and timed how long it would take to dry my hair and it ended up being the same amount of time with a dryer I recently bought at the grocery store for $30. I got the Conair Infiniti Pro dryer and I like it a lot. It&#x27;s extremely powerful but not heavy like this infrared dryer.</li>
            <li> Dries hair super fast. Almost have to use the medium setting it&#x27;s so powerful. It&#x27;s on the expensive side, but well worth it.</li>
            <li> Love It.Dries in half the time.Hair smoother and shinier.</li>
            <li> Drys well.  Its fast and helps with frizz.  However it is Extremely Fragile. Inside is made of thin plastic and was shattered from a fall on the floor after a week of use and could not be repaired.</li>
            <li> Works as described. I was a little skeptical since my other hair dryer was more powerful, but it took about 20% off the drying time of my very think hair.</li>
            <li> Best hair dryer I&#x27;ve ever had!  EVER!</li>
