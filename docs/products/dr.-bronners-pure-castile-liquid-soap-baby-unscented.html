            <li>Still love that it is organic</li>
            <li>I love this stuff.  </li>
            <li>I love how this soap can be used in so any products</li>
            <li>Dr. Bonners&#x27;s Castile soaps are top quality.  </li>
            <li>body, I use Dr. Bronner&#x27;s eucalyptus soap bar as its more cost efficient.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>but I love this product.</li>
            <li>My favorite way to use it is in the laundry.  </li>
            <li>you will love it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update:  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used this soap many times.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love using this product for all three reasons</li>
            <li>- none of them being my favorite because they&#x27;re all tied.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have been using this product for more than 3 years.</li>
            <li>: I would recommend Baby-Mild versus Lavender &amp; Peppermint (ones I have tried) as body wash, since I find them more drying.</li>
            <li>Love this product. :)</li>
            <li>Our family is phasing out chemicals and toxins in our home, so this is a perfect alternative to regular shampoo and body wash.  </li>

            <li>Maybe this would work better since its unscented</li>

            <li>Fantastic results!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve also tried about 1/8 cup on a load of towels and that seemed to work better</li>
            <li>I guess I will be using my remainder as dish soap and use my favorite body wash as hand soap till baby</li>
            <li>I guess I will be using my remainder as dish soap and use my favorite body wash as hand soap till baby</li>
            <li>This soap continues to be our favorite for our baby.</li>
            <li>I started looking into what I could use in my home that I would feel safe giving to my toddler to use daily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>but this used to be my favorite.</li>
            <li>and I love the smell.</li>
            <li>I also love what this company stands for, I love the labeling and using the label to inform their customers about GMOs.  </li>
            <li>I love that there is no scent</li>
            <li>It has a lovely lather.</li>
            <li>We are enjoying the soap.</li>
            <li>-- they are safe and your house hold and your body  </li>
            <li>What more could you ask for in a baby soap? :)</li>
            <li>Love the smell.</li>
            <li>My skin has never looked better and I&#x27;ve used everything from philosophy to perricone md.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s truly a magic soap.</li>
            <li>so I&#x27;m glad I like the product.</li>
            <li>Love that there is no scent and leaves no itchy skin.</li>
            <li>Nice price, multi-purpose chemical free soap.  </li>
            <li>I love this liquid soap from Dr. Bromner&#x27;s.</li>
            <li>is the cheat sheet!  : )&lt;</li>
            <li>Love the all in one option with kids.  </li>
            <li>This is probably my favorite of the Dr. Bronner soaps (I&#x27;ve tried peppermint, lavender, citrus orange, and tea tree).  </li>
            <li>I love this soap.</li>
            <li>I love Dr. Bronners castile soap.</li>
            <li>Very nice pure soap.</li>
            <li>It lathers great &amp; it makes me feel fresh &amp; clean.  </li>
            <li>Very pleased with this gentle and effective soap,</li>
            <li>I use this mostly for making my own body wash although I have switched to the baby mild formula for that.  </li>
            <li>This is a good mild and chemical free soap for baby skin.  </li>
            <li>It leaves his skin and coat very clean and shiny and moisturizes.</li>
            <li>I feel very clean.</li>
            <li>This soap is wonderful for sensitive skin no scent and a big 32 oz bottle great for cleaning cpap equipment</li>
            <li>Organic might have its edge and neigher patent creater nor catagory, looks good for after searching at first query.</li>
            <li>Overall, a very good product and I will be repurchasing when I run out (probably in bulk :) ).</li>
            <li>I am happy that it is non toxic and uses healthy natural ingredients, that I can pronounce.</li>
            <li>I love using Dr. Bronner&#x27;s Castile Liquid Soap because it is a great natural product that works.</li>
            <li>I ordered the baby mild and received rose..</li>
            <li>any more than this would make it to strong and cause cramps.</li>
            <li>Yes, it does make water white, but one of the best soaps available.</li>
            <li>I have been very satisfied with this liquid version of olive oil soap since I bought my first bottle of it more than two years ago.</li>
            <li>A wonderful product that works very well made by an ethical company.</li>
            <li>This was a great price and arrived super fast!</li>
            <li>My windows have never been so clean!</li>
            <li>Totally clean!</li>
            <li>even more so that is completely free of any scent.  </li>
            <li>and it is a great so far.</li>
            <li>and I thought I&#x27;d get the most general one to start with, and I&#x27;m happy with my choice.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s totally safe and free of harmful chemicals and dyes.</li>
            <li>My baby has sensitive skin and this works great.</li>
            <li>I cannot say enough good things about this stuff!  </li>
            <li>after a lot of research finally got this body wash and its great, just love the way it smells and cleans my baby</li>
            <li>and you have a very mild hand soap.</li>
            <li>It suds up easily and washes off easily</li>
            <li>The unscented kind is even more gentle.</li>
            <li>very mild, I use it for body and hair.</li>
            <li>It is very very mild  - which is what I like about it  --</li>
            <li>I have NEVER felt more clean in my life.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had 1 bottle for close to 5 months now, and its still going strong.</li>
            <li>I assumed that it was because this soap was really strong and it was so drying.  </li>
            <li>and it comes in contact with something strong, like alcohol</li>
            <li>However, I love the feel and smell of peppermint specially in summer as a body wash.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Fill the foam dispenser 3/4 full with water top off with a tablespoon or so of soap.</li>
            <li>Suds up great, feels clean, soft on skin and odorless</li>
            <li>and I was very pleased to find this version of his useful, economical, liquid soap.  </li>
            <li>I love the baby mild because I can use it in eye cleanser creams and it does not sting your eyes.  </li>
            <li>Super gentle, all natural and the best soap you can treat your body too.</li>
            <li>it is so nice to be able to breathe and to not have to shun my dogs!e to Soft Soap).</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also great to wash up your pits and such in between showers.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m perplexed with how to write this review.</li>
            <li>Maybe soap free?  </li>
            <li>It leaves your skin feeling smooth.</li>
            <li>Fantastic price too.</li>
            <li>I know maybe to make it tear free it takes chemicals.</li>
            <li>I bought to make my own cleaning products and really like.  </li>
            <li>This product is great, however I should have known WholeFoods sells it for $11.99 for same size (32oz.)</li>
            <li>It is great for a window cleaner mixed with vinegar and water.</li>
            <li>I then wash my face with this soap and a puff (a sponge that is covered with a smooth cloth) --- even in a 10X mirror, I do not see any traces of makeup.</li>
            <li>It also rinses very quickly and leaves both hair and fur totally clean.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s nice and gentle to use in my kid&#x27;s bath routine</li>
            <li>This soap is great for use in the backcountry while backpacking especially the unscented version when in bear country.  </li>
            <li>This soap is fantastic.  </li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re looking for a chemical free product without chemical causing irritants, this product is for you</li>
            <li>Plus I did not see suds during the wash (important for HE</li>
            <li>But I kept using it because EWG gave it such great ratings.  </li>
            <li>But I kept using it because EWG gave it such great ratings.  </li>
            <li>They did not advertise it as being tear free so this is no fault of the company, but I would not advertise it as \\&quot;baby mild\\&quot; either.</li>
            <li>Product is not tear free.</li>
            <li>it make my skin feels smooth</li>
            <li>overall great product for a baby shampoo</li>
            <li>I love how I can actually pronounce and know what the ingredients are in this product, as well as how the ingredients are organic, fair trade, and biodegradable.</li>
            <li>let me tell you, this is far superior to the harshness of dial.</li>
            <li>It is good for making a natural shampoo.</li>
            <li>The soap works great, but you really have to dig in order to find out how to use it because the label is absolutely 100% unhelpful.</li>
            <li>smells super clean, can use this for just about anything!  </li>
            <li>and we have struggled to find the right soap and creams - we love this for her bath time.</li>
            <li>The Baby mild feels great on the skin and since it has more olive oil in it I don&#x27;t seem as dry when I use it.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know how I made it through the first four decades of my life without Dr. Bronner&#x27;s Castile soap!!</li>
            <li>Nice soap rinses clean and doesn&#x27;t have too much perfume.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this to anyone with ANY kind of skin condition.</li>
            <li>This soap has many uses and is very gentle.</li>
            <li>I have enjoyed using it in many different products and love its versatility.</li>
            <li>I originally bought this as part of an ingredient list for hair shampoo.</li>
            <li>It creates a rich lather.  </li>
            <li>This is a throwback to the original Dr. Bronner</li>
            <li>Lathers richly, and no fragrance.</li>
            <li>I was weary at first because this is a type of soap that has like 18 or more uses</li>
            <li>But those are the only shortcomings I&#x27;ve found, so I&#x27;m sticking with it :^)</li>
            <li>I was not disappointed.  </li>
            <li>I does a great job of cleaning your hands and is not full of poison like most soaps today.</li>
            <li>If you want a plain, mild liquid soap, this is wonderful.  </li>
            <li>I always thought it was just something about the dogs, because I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ve ever purchased the same shampoo more than a couple of times, and sometimes I&#x27;ve even had to use my own shampoo on them.</li>
            <li>Believe me, I&#x27;m really a clean freak and, while I like to save money, I will not sacrifice cleanliness for frugality.&lt;br</li>
            <li>soap is indeed unscented so all I get is clean hands and no allergic reactions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and I also use it to clean with.</li>
            <li>All it takes in a squirt in the wash and everything comes out wonderfully clean.  </li>
            <li>Leaves rinse practically clean.</li>
            <li>so I cannot review it&#x27;s ability to clean everything</li>
            <li>and it doesn&#x27;t take a huge amount for adequate sudsing and washing.  </li>
            <li>I use it on my niece and nephew to keep them clean with out hurting them.</li>
            <li>The only thing I wish I did was get a scented kind :-)</li>
            <li>It leaves my hair with a clean (but not a &#x27;stripped of oil&#x27;) feel.</li>
            <li>This soap rinses away cleanly and works well for us.  </li>
            <li>and you get our felling clean.</li>
            <li>I use all of the dr bronner&#x27;s soaps  - I use them to clean with -- everything with the sal suds  --  </li>
            <li>If you will be adding your own essential oils be sure to use glass or PET containers</li>
            <li>Also, it does leave a residue when you use it to clean, which is another reason why I like to dilute it.</li>
            <li>It works well to clean</li>
            <li>Also use the peppermint or tea tree for making creamy liquid cleanser to clean the bathroom and the kitchen sink.  </li>
            <li>Makes my skin really soft and I love the smell!</li>
            <li>I still didn&#x27;t notice anything special about this product.</li>
            <li>Takes the tangles right out!  </li>
            <li>Safe, natural and earth friendly!</li>
            <li>It is awesome to clean soap scum on fiberglass tubs.  </li>
            <li>My son&#x27;s skin feels clean and soft after a bath and this has also been a nice cleansing soap for his cradle cap.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s amazing and my baby loves it on his sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>her skin immediately turned bright red, after drying her off, her skin looked like she had got burnt.</li>
            <li>solved.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note: This was drying my skin out when I was using it FULL STRENGTH and peppermint scented.</li>
            <li>solved.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note: This was drying my skin out when I was using it FULL STRENGTH and peppermint scented.</li>
            <li>I use it for making my own shampoo (combined with water and a natural detergent).</li>
            <li>I really wish it would have made the body wash suds up more</li>
            <li>but overall it cleans well and does a good job.</li>
            <li>(I got the unscented, baby mild version) and clean.</li>
            <li>Good to use with essential oils.  </li>
            <li>I have been using Bronner&#x27;s Liquid Soap for over 30 years and it is quite true that I am never without it.</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t clean the leaves of our citrus as quickly and thoroughly as U-Tube video said it would</li>
            <li>I may purchase the lavender scent for my own clothes when I run out of my old detergent</li>
            <li>/&gt;It is very liquid-y, I&#x27;m used to using more shower gels / creamy soaps, so that was a bit of a change.  </li>
            <li>that sweet baby smell is not masked by unnatural fragrance.  </li>
            <li>When you use it to wash your hair it does leave it your hair really &amp;#34;tangled&amp;#34; feeling so make sure you use conditioner (I like the Bronner&#x27;s brand hair rinse, it smells like citrus)</li>
            <li>They actually refunded me fairly quickly without my intervention which is good, BUT read on and be warned:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love love this soap and it does not dry out my skin.</li>
            <li>True castile uses mostly olive oil with water(it&#x27;s 4th on the list of ingredients in this product) but, the main ingredient, besides water, is coconut oil.</li>
            <li>It seemed like alot to pay for only 32oz originally, but it&#x27;s so strong that I have to dilute it to use it, so I really get more out of it than most 32oz containers of soap.</li>
            <li>I love this stuff, its natural, scent free</li>
            <li>Love how many different things can be made with this soap and of course the quality!</li>
            <li>kind)&lt;br /&gt;- 1/2 cup Super Washing Soda&lt;</li>
            <li>Great all natural product, but too drying for my sensitive baby&#x27;s eczema&lt;</li>
            <li>Organic, mild, fragrance-free.</li>
            <li>It is simply a mild soap.</li>
            <li>This soap is extremely mild but can even be used to wash dishes or clothes.</li>
            <li>It is so mild that you can make hair shampoo out of it.</li>
            <li>It is amazingly mild, so those with sensitivities would do well to try this out.</li>
            <li>Mild on the skin and no smell or fragrance.  </li>
            <li>so I used 1/4 cup baby mild in a load of my darks.</li>
            <li>It gets the best possible rating by EWG and cleaned my clothes as well as regular laundry detergent (but no chemical smell!)</li>
            <li>got the baby mild soap, because I couldn&#x27;t decide between the smells</li>
            <li>This soap was my attempt to find something &amp;#34;chemical free&amp;#34; and mild.</li>
            <li>-  cleans mildly  </li>
            <li>I would recommend it to people that  want mild soap.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve since found a pump to replace the cap and that has helped tremendously with the build up.</li>
            <li>and if you have children who will be using the product make sure you are using safe amounts and types of essential oils.</li>
            <li>Well the baby mild was also drying out my skin.  </li>
            <li>Recommend it most highly and always have.</li>
            <li>Overall, it does clean fairly well, but it leaves my hands feeling funny</li>
            <li>However, it is not tear free, so be aware of that if you are purchasing it for use with a baby.</li>
            <li>This is NOT a tear-free formula, but I&#x27;ve never had an issue as long as I rinse the suds from his hands fairly</li>
            <li>also love Dr Bronners for use on a new tattoo or piercing.</li>
            <li>My new favorite is the Hemp Almond soap they make</li>
            <li>If you are looking to exit the supermarket with less chemicals and toxic crud, this is a great product.  </li>
            <li>I also love that I can use it for pretty much anything from shampoo, body wash, baby soap, hand soap, to washing toys, cleaning, and I have a friend that even uses it on her pet.</li>
            <li>I use it on my two year old and my newborn, both of whom have sensitive skin, and it does the job nicely!  </li>
            <li>It is very mild and gentle on their skin though.</li>
            <li>Exactly what I was looking for!  </li>
            <li>It is such a versatile product with so many uses!</li>
            <li>Thanks!!</li>
            <li>The first 2 words are Dilute!</li>
            <li>but if I mix this with a little anti bacterial dish soap it works great for a hand soap.</li>
            <li>Well with how hard our water is here in Phoenix, it&#x27;s made my hair incredibly waxy.</li>
            <li>I liked the no scent as I am allergic to other soaps with strong scents.</li>
            <li>This soap is amazing for several reasons:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve read review after review that says this stuff is amazing for drealocks, so I bought a giant bottle of it.</li>
            <li>This product is detergent free and gentle on the skin.</li>
            <li>(yet has a distinct soapy smell to it).</li>
            <li>I add my own essential oils depending on what product I am making.</li>
            <li>I wish it were tear free but its better than regular shampoo</li>
            <li>with years of usage and by adding unscented lubriderm into the mix, i have always had soft, healthy skin.</li>
            <li>&#x27;s the recipes that I have found success with.</li>
            <li>I have soft water and still use vinegar on most cycles because I like to have my sheets/etc</li>
            <li>I have soft water and still use vinegar on most cycles because I like to have my sheets/etc</li>
            <li>It was worth every penny I paid for it.</li>
            <li>I make my own foaming hand soap - 1 part castile soap, 7 parts H20 (I use filtered water, others have recommended distilled water), and essential oils -</li>
            <li>I love the fact that it is natural without any chemicals in it</li>
            <li>I have recently started making some of my own shampoo and cleaning supplies.  </li>
            <li>The soap is good, but the price I paid is almost twice as much as what my local grocery store charges!</li>
            <li>So far the hemp almond is better in that regard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have been taking my ways back to the olden days (that rhymes), and making my own shampoo, face wash, etc.  </li>
            <li>We recived the product before we were told, made our own handmade soap last night.</li>
            <li>it works far better than i thought it would.</li>
            <li>It is nice to only have to take one product in your pack.</li>
            <li>i love this product my skin feels much better after i started to use this product and this product has encouraged me to try other products from the dr bronner&#x27;s brand</li>
            <li>This is safe and a better choice than other soaps with all of the additional chemicals.</li>
            <li>for my laundry, I&#x27;m going to go back to using Earth Friendly Products ECOS detergent, which EWG still rated better than a lot of traditional detergents, it gets the clothes clean, it rinses clean, and I can buy it at Costco.s really strong</li>
            <li>cleans quickly and does exactly what it says it does.</li>
            <li>It gets the clothes really clean and is much better for the environment than regular laundry</li>
            <li>It gets the clothes really clean and is much better for the environment than regular laundry</li>
            <li>right?</li>
            <li>right?</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s right.</li>
            <li>/&gt;the price is also right.</li>
            <li>Gentle enough to be an excellent shampoo, strong enough so that only about 4 drops will clean your hands.  </li>
            <li>Great for people with dry or sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I use it in several of my homemade recipes: hand soap, mild baby body wash and shampoo, fabric stain remover and appliance and granite surface cleaner, but it can be used for so much more.</li>
            <li>But the product label &amp;#34;sucks.&amp;#34; Label font is too small to read creating great difficulty in finding/reading product information.</li>
            <li>Being a Christian family it really makes me like the product even more!</li>
            <li>but I certainly will use the Baby Mild for all my baby laundry.</li>
            <li>It leaves hair nice and mild, though using hair conditioner with it is highly recommended for extra smoothness.</li>
            <li>I use this soap to clean pretty much anything.  </li>
            <li>for my laundry, I&#x27;m going to go back to using Earth Friendly Products ECOS detergent, which EWG still rated better than a lot of traditional detergents, it gets the clothes clean, it rinses clean, and I can buy it at Costco.</li>
            <li>The baby mild is gentle and moisturizing to these &amp;#34;wounds.&amp;#34;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I used this for two years in japan, I like this very much.</li>
            <li>This soap is very gentle</li>
            <li>He&#x27;s never had any problems and it&#x27;s very gentle on hair and skin.</li>
            <li>Very gentle.</li>
            <li>I use it for my daughters and it is so very gentle on their skin.  </li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s cheap compared to most other quality soaps.  </li>
            <li>This is great for those who are sensitive to chemicals found in other shampoos.  </li>
            <li>It seems counterintuitive to use a soap made from oils to remove oil from my skin but it works like a charm and my skin is more clear and vibrant than ever and no longer gets oily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I think it&#x27;s a wonderful product and a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t know any better, thought it was supposed to smell that way, but my sister confirmed there&#x27;s something not right.</li>
            <li>i am disabled and this item make a good mixture for  a bag enema and is mild and really helps those with bowel cleaning who can&#x27;t do it on their own due to disabilities.</li>
            <li>I went ahead and tried diluting it, though, first at about 5:1 (water:Bronner&#x27;s)</li>
            <li>Only soap I&#x27;ll use for my son, has so many alternative uses as well.</li>
            <li>Where in gods name has this junk been hiding my whole life??!</li>
            <li>Also, this soap is worth the price because it lasts since you don&#x27;t need that much.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s my first time trying anything like this</li>
            <li>Use it for making many different home products.  </li>
            <li>Works very well to prepare foamy soap!</li>
            <li>We soak them in this with some hot while for a while and then use a microwave steamer.  </li>
            <li>This is my first time ever trying Br Bronner Castile soap</li>
            <li>Use more vinegar if a larger load.</li>
            <li>Use more vinegar if a larger load.</li>
            <li>I got this for my gentle skinned babies!</li>
            <li>It lathers very well and makes them smell just like a baby would!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so glad I had only purchasedone online before I found it at Wholefoods.</li>
            <li>I use this soap for many different things.</li>
            <li>Will be back for more...</li>
            <li>This is the second organic soap I&#x27;ve tried and I have to say I am pleased.  </li>
            <li>Was exactly what I ordered and could not find any where else</li>
            <li>There is no fake fragrance.</li>
            <li>On top of it, I only have to condition my hair</li>
            <li>Was looking for something scentless, natural, non-irritating and this fit the bill</li>
            <li>Fast shipping !</li>
            <li>Even for a group, a couple ounces ought to last a week or more.  </li>
            <li>I love Dr. Bronner&#x27;s Castile soap, especially the liquid (organic) type.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure this works as well as the traditional peppermint Bronners, but it seems lacking.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m looking to eliminate as many chemicals as possible around my family.</li>
            <li>Also, for this particular scent (baby mild aloe) would be it has virtually  no scent (which I think it is not supposed to</li>
            <li>I bought this product to make body wash and it does exactly what it is supposed to.  </li>
            <li>but I don&#x27;t remember the name of the exact website</li>
            <li>check google if your interested)</li>
            <li>This is the first time I purchased Castile soap after a friend recommended it.  </li>
            <li>, my face and body feels smooth and soft.</li>
            <li>This is my personal favorite of the soaps for body care  --</li>
            <li>i am very please with my purchase and will buy again!</li>
            <li>It really lasts quite a while so the price is worth it.</li>
            <li>This was my first castle soap purchase.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s like water when you first pour it.  </li>
            <li>Rather than put it in my kids&#x27; bath, I tried to mix it with some essential oils so that I might be able to use it for myself.</li>
            <li>Since I discovered I am allergic to formaldehyde and its many cousins in personal care products</li>
            <li>In the summer time it is very good since you shower a few times a day since it does not dry your skin.</li>
            <li>Great for winter less drying of hands because there are no harsh chemicals.</li>
            <li>I make a lot of my own body washes and hand soaps and use this and other oils.</li>
            <li>Would be great for oily hair and it works well to remove leave-in oil treatments that otherwise make you look like a drowned rat the next day.</li>
            <li>And while it is unscented, there is a slight clean smell to it :)</li>
            <li>So far I have: clean dishes, used it as a body wash and a shave gel, a hand soap and a face cleaner.</li>
            <li>I add a bit more if it&#x27;s a big load or something very soiled.</li>
            <li>I add a bit more if it&#x27;s a big load or something very soiled.</li>
            <li>Good laundry product, tho more expensive than in the stores.</li>
            <li>This soap is great for anyone with sensitive skin, and a few drops in water works wonders on linoleum or vinyl flooring.</li>
            <li>It is very gentle and cleans very thoroughly.</li>
            <li>really prefer a product that comes ready to roll!</li>
            <li>I rarely need to use products other than, this soap, baking soda, or vinegar and love not having any chemicals around my baby.</li>
            <li>I love that the ingredient list is not a mile long.</li>
            <li>this is the best soap I have found and it will last a long long time.</li>
            <li>This is great mixed with baking soda to get at hard to clean things like stovetops and counters.</li>
            <li>My guess is that the reason my own shampoo doesn&#x27;t noticeably affect my asthma is because, well, I have almost infinitely less hair than my dogs do.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I use this product to make my own dishwashing detergent (along with lemon juice, water, and vinegar) in order to use less chemicals in our home and make it a safer place for our children.  </li>
            <li>Love using this in diluted form for hand washing in the winter when my hands get so dry.  </li>
            <li>time-- was actually full of soap and not half air.</li>
            <li>Personally I am too used to the strong peppermint soap.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m very happy I&#x27;ve switched soaps, as (1) it will be much cheaper, since I use less, and I&#x27;ve been using less lotion etc throughout the day (2)</li>
            <li>(If you wanted to know: bon-fire &amp;#34;white&amp;#34; ash from &amp;#34;hard&amp;#34; wood, pour distilled water over, collect the water &amp;#34;lye&amp;#34;, let sit until strong enough to mix with olive oil, done.)&lt;br /&gt;But</li>
            <li>This site, [...], sells pure castile soap with just olive oil and water, which is what pure castile soap is so I might try that.</li>
            <li>just pure stuff</li>
            <li>What can you say about pure soap?</li>
            <li>It is pure castile soap.  </li>
            <li>It is all organic and pure and contains no chemicals</li>
            <li>NEW use!!</li>
            <li>aside from all the preachy new age junk written on the bottle, its a good product.</li>
            <li>I love the product, but the cap had come loose in the box and coated the bottle and the orange oil I had received with it.</li>
            <li>the really dry and really oily combination is much more even with fewer breakouts (I am still using tea tree oil in a toner form).  </li>
            <li>I add 5/6 of water and about 1/6 of the liquid soap and my whole family has pure soap without the chemicals.</li>
            <li>I like the fact that it is organic and pure, but I will be looking for another soap, both for my kids and for myself that is pure but can still be mixed nicely with my essential oils.</li>
            <li>It gets make up off SO fast.</li>
            <li>I really like this soap</li>
            <li>really don&#x27;t know where to go from here.  </li>
            <li>and I really like it.  </li>
            <li>After about a week of stopping use and switching back to an oil free gentle facewash my skin is much calmer and</li>
            <li>Use it whole strength and a dish scrubby sponge and POOF</li>
            <li>consistency is going to be very watery</li>
            <li>very soft.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>consistency is going to be very watery</li>
            <li>very soft.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I tried this out A LOT sooner Highly recommended!</li>
            <li>You can really tell the difference in this organic soap compared to the chemical soaps.</li>
            <li>and it works really well</li>
            <li>although I don&#x27;t really like the smell of it</li>
            <li>This is a gentle, thorough soap.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t realize how much of an allergic reaction I was having to the soaps and shampoos I&#x27;ve tried until I used this.</li>
            <li>Shipping was fast.</li>
            <li>Works really well in my liquid soaps.</li>
            <li>and since it is milder and has no scent, it really works out well.  </li>
            <li>Just remember to add water or whatever to it, do not not use straight.</li>
            <li>That means you don&#x27;t need to take much at all along with you in your pack.  </li>
            <li>It also works very well as a shampoo for my dog with hyper-sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I read on a message board to try this, and it works and removes makeup very well.  </li>
            <li>I used this to make a foaming &amp;#34;all purpose wash&amp;#34; and I am very</li>
            <li>It was just like baby soap but very liquefied.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s gentle.  </li>
            <li>(I filled up my regular HE detergent measuring cup to the line designated for an HE wash).  </li>
            <li>Gentle on skin and has HUNDREDS of uses from laundry soap to shampoo.</li>
            <li>gentle gentle  </li>
            <li>It works really well.  </li>
            <li>and I don&#x27;t need to use as much lotion throughout the day as I was using before.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It really doesn&#x27;t smell like anything, which I prefer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Its really helped to use a loofa, and</li>
            <li>Thanks, Amazon!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I appreciate that there are real alternatives to mass produced chemically laden garbage out there.  </li>
            <li>and it really cleans.</li>
            <li>I absolutely recommend this to parents for their kids.  </li>
            <li>I really like using unscented products and this one fits the bill.</li>
            <li>I really don&#x27;t like the smell and find it distracting.  </li>
            <li>once you see that when you dilute it , you end up with just as much soap as you would with any normal chemical soap , and what do you know , its organic ;)</li>
            <li>good stuff, but leaves a soap scum on everything.</li>
            <li>But, over all, it leaves your skin soft, clean and coming from someone like myself whom is fragrance/chemical sensitive -</li>
            <li>I will still try to use the rest of my bottle to make a kitchen and bathroom cleaner, so maybe it will work better for other purposes.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not drying the way so many other hand soaps are.</li>
            <li>I find that one pump is enough to thoroughly clean hands and it keeps me from accidentally using 5 &#x27;servings&#x27; of soap at a time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I find that one pump is enough to thoroughly clean hands and it keeps me from accidentally using 5 &#x27;servings&#x27; of soap at a time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>A tiny bit foams up nicely to clean while in the shower.</li>
            <li>I use it especially on silicon body implements when I want to clean something but don&#x27;t want it to erode from the cleaning solution that I am using.</li>
            <li>My white towels and socks got clean</li>
            <li>I personally use the Natural/Unscented kind, only because my skin is very sensitive.</li>
            <li>Without a doubt, the most ridiculous product label I&#x27;ve ever seen, and not consumer friendly.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s soft and luscious and cleans very, very well with just one pump.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love love love that don&#x27;t have to worry about weird chemicals being on me or my children&#x27;s skin!!</li>
            <li>It is great for that, costs less then the store bought F &amp; V wash, and has absolutely no odor.  </li>
            <li>It leaves my hair feeling very clean and it&#x27;s easy to make a variety of shampoos with this, just add a few drops of whatever essential oil you prefer and some Aragan or jojoba oil</li>
            <li>I think Dr. Bronner&#x27;s is a fine brand - just find it hard to understand why they wouldn&#x27;t try to make their baby soap tear free.  </li>
            <li>I was using it full strength for months before I finally figured it out.</li>
            <li>Even though my first will last for a long time, I want to be sure to have a spare in case (you know how it is) they run out or for some reason stop carrying it here on amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>So many laundry detergents that are \\&quot;green \\&quot; really don&#x27;t work very well and</li>
            <li>It is a vital ingredient to make the exact soaps that you desire for your home.</li>
            <li>I spent an easy 200 dollars on soaps,lotions and anything I can find that would donate to helping my skin issues..</li>
            <li>Actually, I wouldn&#x27;t go back even if it cost more...</li>
            <li>Actually, I wouldn&#x27;t go back even if it cost more...</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve always bought regular cleaners, \\&quot;free and clear\\&quot; detergents, and sensitive skin body wash (which never worked well).</li>
            <li>Add Super Washing Soda, stir constantly</li>
            <li>Add Super Washing Soda, stir constantly</li>
            <li>To top it off, there are stars next to some ingredients such as olive oil, that state \\&quot;None remains after saponifying oils into soap and</li>
            <li>This is a main ingredient.  </li>
            <li>I use for cleaning vegetables mainly.  </li>
            <li>Is my main body soap</li>
            <li>Based on my trials, it appears that using the amount of Dr. Bronner&#x27;s that one would normally use with regular HE detergent is the way to go.&lt;br /&gt;I also have been using Dr Bronnr&#x27;s peppermint for hand soap while pregnant.</li>
            <li>On time and product was packed tightly with peanuts for safe shipping.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>I tried this out A LOT sooner Highly recommended!ot and boil</li>
            <li>Would highly recommend and rate this item.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product and will use it the rest of my life.</li>
            <li>and I recommend it highly.</li>
            <li>I read that you could use Dr. Bronners in a high efficiency (HE)  washing machine.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>I can highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>(ones I have tried)  for oily face with large pores and adult acne.&lt;br /&gt;2-</li>
            <li>and this makes my hair sooo soft and shiny!!</li>
            <li>Great product works wonderfully only downfall is the smell  and do not mix with vinegar as it converts back to oils and does not clean at all</li>
            <li>This has been the base for many homemade cosmetics and has done wonderful with my very dry skin and ezcema.</li>
            <li>The coolest thing about this product to me is that its so gentle that I can use it in my recipe to make homemade baby wipes for my son and have had no problems at all no diaper rashes at all, its natural as can be</li>
            <li>On the up side- it appears to be a gentle cleanser &amp; baby&#x27;s hair is soft.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t dry my skin at all and leaves me feeling clean.</li>
            <li>I really like how nontoxic and natural Dr. Bronner&#x27;s is.</li>
            <li>And I feel like when I get out of the shower my skin is a bit dryer than normal</li>
            <li>I found out after my daughter complained and I tested it in my own eyes.</li>
            <li>(i never used hot water to bathe her, only lukewarm or cool, simply because her skin is very sensitive)</li>
            <li>It lathers great, using very little of it, and cleans without all the added &#x27;stuff&#x27; other shampoos have in their bottles.</li>
            <li>I have had 2 dogs for 5 years now, and EVERY time I&#x27;ve bathed them (twice a month)I have had an asthma attack when they started to dry and had to stay away from them for a full 24 hours after the bath.</li>
            <li>although I&#x27;ve only used it for face / body wash, I keep reading about all of the other uses for it, and will probably start using it more often once I run out of other items (dishwashing soap, laundry, etc), so it will be really nice to have to only buy one product and use it for everything.</li>
            <li>it can be diluted at different ratios for lots of different purposes or used full strength to take care of a really robust cleaning task.</li>
            <li>Non toxic which is my new life style.</li>
            <li>I really wanted to love this product after reading all the reviews, but after using as a face/body wash with a little tea trea oil for 4 months i recently found that coconut oil highly comedogenic(pore clogging).  </li>
            <li>clean up messes in my house with this soap as well, works well on counters, sinks, stove, etc.</li>
            <li>Nice alternative to all the harsh chemicals in regular soaps.</li>
            <li>Very soft on hands, doesn&#x27;t leave any residue.</li>
            <li>Are use this soap on my dog who is very sensitive to any types of shampoo.</li>
            <li>I am very sensitive to soap, which can give me an itchy rash.</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li>It is very natural,</li>
            <li>It is pretty drying on my skin if I use it often enough</li>
            <li>Wow!</li>
            <li>Excited to experiment with other uses for it.</li>
            <li>I originally started using it as a facial cleanser; however, now I am also using it as a body wash and shampoo (occasionally).</li>
            <li>i was looking for a natural shampoo with no smell and as long as the advertising is true re natural ingredients then this will work for me.</li>
            <li>A safe shampoo for small kids.</li>
            <li>This is my first time using Castile soap and I will probably never go back!</li>
            <li>I had switched to the baby mild from the tea tree one because my skin was getting too dry!  </li>
            <li>No rash and makes her hair so soft!  </li>
            <li>We live in an apt and use HE washers so a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li>I am african american with non relaxed hair and this works great as a shampoo alternative (mixed with olive oil and a little honey).</li>
            <li>Old product is new again.  </li>
            <li>I am using the Mild Baby Organic Castile liquid soap for shampoo, body wash, face wash, and hand soap, as well as a liquid cleanser for the house (use it like dish soap) for counters, sinks, tubs,  and floors etc.  </li>
            <li>I liked this product, but it tends to leave your hands a little dry.  </li>
            <li>Bottle was huge and will last a very long</li>
            <li>it dried his skin out a little, so I diluted it in a sports water bottle for the next time and had great results.</li>
            <li>I bought this because it was clear and uncomplicated.</li>
            <li>It makes my skin soft without the excess perfumes &amp; I do not feel greasy at all.  </li>
            <li>All Natural and Organic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>All Natural and Organic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I tried everything, soft brush, olive oil, combs and nothing worked to get rid of cradle cap.  </li>
            <li>, I use an old baby shampoo foam bottle, i fill it up 1/4 with castile</li>
            <li>far as the soap goes</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s gentle enough that I use it on my newborn, and I also use it while making homemade soaps.</li>
            <li>By this time, my son was already two years old (we&#x27;d faithfully used California Baby up until that point) and he was use to soap getting near his eyes and it being \\&quot;okay\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li>I like this soap because it is all natural and organic.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m surprised at home</li>
            <li>how well it really does for this purpose, but I never knew that with the standard store brand F &amp; V wash either.</li>
            <li>I have a 4 month old and instead of buying baby laundry soap</li>
            <li>i also have sensitive skin when it comes to laundry detergents and body washes.</li>
            <li>Really sensitive.</li>
            <li>2 one-gallon containers to store the detergent in (I recycled an old vinegar jug +</li>
            <li>My family&#x27;s skin feels so soft after using this soap.</li>
            <li>Random acne (mostly back),hand eczema,little bumps all over my upper arms and more recently folliculitus on my torso.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very concentrated so this bottle will last you for months.  </li>
            <li>Everything in it is natural.</li>
            <li>Sensitive skin reacts well to it.</li>
            <li>I have extremely sensitive skin -</li>
            <li>My boys have sensitive skin</li>
            <li>Plus it&#x27;s natural and cruelty</li>
            <li>I also use it to make a gentle face cleaner by doing something similar with the addition of 1/2 tsp baking soda.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s gentle enough to use on my eyelash extensions.</li>
            <li>This size will last forever and it is now my chosen soap for my whole family.</li>
            <li>pleased.&lt;br /&gt;It is used as a hand soap, body and hair wash for my 21 month old son.&lt;br /&gt;Just</li>
            <li>used an old foaming hand soap dispenser.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t use it anywhere else on my body, since it will sting sensitive areas.</li>
            <li>No way did i want that near my baby.</li>
            <li>did discover that the 1/4 cup was too much for my HE, in that it did not rinse totally out of the clothes.  </li>
            <li>Also, initially it does seem very pricy, but for also every use, you are diluting it.</li>
            <li>, I got this because I have a sensitive inflamed scalp.</li>
            <li>I have to say, as far as liquids go, this is awesome!&lt;br /&gt;Bought a DollarTree foaming dispenser (poured out the petro-chemical soap then washed the bottle)</li>
            <li>-- I don&#x27;t have any young children  </li>
            <li>I use this for myself and my 2 yr old.</li>
            <li>When I had a baby, it seemed natural to use their unscented soap for him.  </li>
            <li>Plus, my 3 year old likes to</li>
            <li>Like because has no harsh chemicals to worry about.  </li>
            <li>You don&#x27;t really notice the soapy film that builds up on you from regular body wash until you have made some body wash with this stuff.  </li>
            <li>But I can buy much cheaper at my local health food store now.</li>
            <li>My kids tend to be sensitive to ALL shampoos, soaps, laundry detergents.  </li>
            <li>I pour this castile soap into recycled pump containers and add a few drops of my favorite essential oils</li>
            <li>Since this one is unscented, you can add a few drops of essential oil for fragrance :)</li>
            <li>My only complaint is that it makes my daughter&#x27;s hair feel kind of tangly when I wash it out.</li>
            <li>I have been on a mission to eliminate harsh chemicals from my life and after starting to use this soap in a variety of recipes I make sure I ALWAYS have some on hand.  </li>
            <li>You can get Dr. Bronner&#x27;s at many different places, but Amazon seems to be the way to go if you want to pay less!</li>
            <li>The product can be used for many other purposes which I am open to try.&lt;br /&gt;1- Facial Cleanser: I would recommend Peppermint versus Lavender &amp; Baby-Mild  </li>
            <li>A little bit goes a long way, and it makes me happy that I&#x27;m not putting chemicals all over the things my little kids use.</li>
            <li>After spending 15min reading this entire (ridiculous) label, all that that was stated was &amp;#34;Delute&amp;#34; and so I conducted my own tests finding a satisfactory dilution ratio.</li>
            <li>I make my own foaming hand soap with this, essential oils &amp; water - a little of this goes a long way!</li>
            <li>I spent year trying different acne scrubs and face washes full of chemicals to reduce the oil that built up on my face.</li>
            <li>I had such high hopes for this soap.  </li>
            <li>If I have honeydew grit on the leaves, I rinse the next day using a high pressure setting.</li>
            <li>have eczema, dry skin, oily skin, hypersensitivity to: dry air, moist air, scented anything, and pretty much anything not</li>
            <li>that Johnsons has, but nothing healthy is going to, thats a fragrance that is not good for their skin, so I didn&#x27;t deduct for that.</li>
            <li>and my skin finally feels normal again.</li>
            <li>The first time I used it (1T or so on a wet rag)</li>
            <li>great!&lt;br /&gt;The dispenser really helps not get too much or too little.</li>
            <li>I love that it&#x27;s all natural without the harsh chemicals that other shampoos/cleaners/washes have.</li>
            <li>Since it IS plain, you can add fragrances, essential oils, and other fun items to create a unique soap.</li>
            <li>My 1.5 year old son has bad eczema and this soap works great for him.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Bottom line: highly (very) recommended especially when mixed 90/10 with water in a foam dispenser.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this if you have sensitive dry skin.</li>
            <li>For so many organic oils all combined together to create a universal soap , where exactly can you go wrong?</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;ve never used it before be aware that it&#x27;s not like other soaps</li>
            <li>On rare occasion, there is sometimes a little bit of eucalyptus that gets in the produce on the line from their eucalyptus soap.  </li>
            <li>or maybe there was something more serious internally that was causing my skin to freak out.</li>
            <li>I currently am using it for hand soap with a few drops of lavender oil, and I can tell it isn&#x27;t regular soap because instead of leaving your hands soft and slippery, it leave them more squeaky and dry.</li>
            <li>Some have smelled really nice but dried my skin, and one left me feeling moisturized but not clean.</li>
            <li>Can be used a general purpose cleaner, in homemade dog</li>
            <li>I also use it to wash my &amp;#34;unmentionables&amp;#34; in the washer on the delicate cycle, as I can&#x27;t tolerate even the fragrance free laundry detergent.  </li>
            <li>Usually the color is a light yellow</li>
            <li>His skin is so sensitive, its the only thing that works for him.</li>
            <li>I would recommend it to anyone who has sensitive skin human or canine.</li>
            <li>Works just as well as commercial, chemical laden soaps with all natural ingredients.</li>
            <li>my skin is back to soft and</li>
            <li>it does burn your skin (especially if you have sensitive skin)</li>
            <li>Just a few drops works so well as baby&#x27;s first bath and her skin is so soft and supple.</li>
            <li>(I used 15 drops of peppermint for just a faint smell, but I can&#x27;t really smell it - may use a tiny but more next time)&lt;br</li>
            <li>(I used 15 drops of peppermint for just a faint smell, but I can&#x27;t really smell it - may use a tiny but more next time)&lt;br</li>
            <li>It is really runny, even before diluting it, so I got a foaming soap pump (as recommended by other reviewers</li>
            <li>It is really runny, even before diluting it, so I got a foaming soap pump (as recommended by other reviewers</li>
            <li>They now make a lot of other products besides soap and their organic coconut oil for example is very good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>you are not there for any of the three delivery attempts, be prepared to have your hands tied behind your back and NOT be able to get your item.</li>
            <li>I have occasionally had trouble getting the 32oz size, but it has always come quickly from the various sellers.</li>
            <li>This soap doea not dry out my skin or irritate my skin.</li>
            <li>Secret to cleanliness.. good for people who do not like heavy scents.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>It cleans well, doesn&#x27;t bother his very sensitive skin, and doesn&#x27;t dry his skin out.</li>
            <li>I use Dr. Bronners for making multiple cleaning supplies (hand soap, general cleaner).</li>
            <li>/&gt;Apparently (according to Dr. Bronner&#x27;s website) you&#x27;re supposed to dilute this soap pretty heavily.</li>
            <li>The only thing I don&#x27;t like is that her hair smells a little funny.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin that&#x27;s on the dry side</li>
            <li>I am not super into the whole organic scene</li>
            <li>Does not dry out your skin like traditional soaps.  </li>
            <li>The only downside would be it does burn your eyes so be careful if you use it on your face and despite what many people say, not good in a DIY shampoo.</li>
            <li>but really, what goes on your body goes in your body, and for LESS money than I was spending on chemical laden soaps/body washes/beauty bars, there is no way I will ever go back.</li>

            <li>My skin gets very dry and its sensitive.</li>
            <li>I searched long and hard for a true organic shampoo for my family to use.</li>

            <li> I have been using this product for more than 3 years.</li>
            <li> : I would recommend Baby-Mild versus Lavender &amp; Peppermint (ones I have tried) as body wash, since I find them more drying.</li>
            <li> Love this product. :)</li>

            <li> is the cheat sheet!  : )&lt;</li>
            <li> Love the all in one option with kids.  </li>
            <li> This is probably my favorite of the Dr. Bronner soaps (I&#x27;ve tried peppermint, lavender, citrus orange, and tea tree).  </li>
            <li> I love this soap.</li>
            <li> I love Dr. Bronners castile soap.</li>

            <li> Very pleased with this gentle and effective soap,</li>

            <li> This is a good mild and chemical free soap for baby skin.  </li>
            <li> It leaves his skin and coat very clean and shiny and moisturizes.</li>
            <li> I feel very clean.</li>
            <li> This soap is wonderful for sensitive skin no scent and a big 32 oz bottle great for cleaning cpap equipment</li>
            <li> Organic might have its edge and neigher patent creater nor catagory, looks good for after searching at first query.</li>
            <li> Overall, a very good product and I will be repurchasing when I run out (probably in bulk :) ).</li>
            <li> I am happy that it is non toxic and uses healthy natural ingredients, that I can pronounce.</li>
            <li> I love using Dr. Bronner&#x27;s Castile Liquid Soap because it is a great natural product that works.</li>
            <li> I ordered the baby mild and received rose..</li>
            <li> any more than this would make it to strong and cause cramps.</li>
            <li> Yes, it does make water white, but one of the best soaps available.</li>
            <li> I have been very satisfied with this liquid version of olive oil soap since I bought my first bottle of it more than two years ago.</li>
            <li> A wonderful product that works very well made by an ethical company.</li>
            <li> This was a great price and arrived super fast!</li>

            <li> Totally clean!</li>
            <li> even more so that is completely free of any scent.  </li>
            <li> and it is a great so far.</li>
            <li> and I thought I&#x27;d get the most general one to start with, and I&#x27;m happy with my choice.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s totally safe and free of harmful chemicals and dyes.</li>
            <li> My baby has sensitive skin and this works great.</li>
            <li> I cannot say enough good things about this stuff!  </li>
            <li> after a lot of research finally got this body wash and its great, just love the way it smells and cleans my baby</li>
            <li> and you have a very mild hand soap.</li>
            <li> It suds up easily and washes off easily</li>
            <li> The unscented kind is even more gentle.</li>
            <li> very mild, I use it for body and hair.</li>
            <li> It is very very mild  - which is what I like about it  --</li>
            <li> I have NEVER felt more clean in my life.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had 1 bottle for close to 5 months now, and its still going strong.</li>
            <li> I assumed that it was because this soap was really strong and it was so drying.  </li>
            <li> and it comes in contact with something strong, like alcohol</li>
            <li> However, I love the feel and smell of peppermint specially in summer as a body wash.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Fill the foam dispenser 3/4 full with water top off with a tablespoon or so of soap.</li>
            <li> Suds up great, feels clean, soft on skin and odorless</li>
            <li> and I was very pleased to find this version of his useful, economical, liquid soap.  </li>
            <li> I love the baby mild because I can use it in eye cleanser creams and it does not sting your eyes.  </li>
            <li> Super gentle, all natural and the best soap you can treat your body too.</li>
            <li> it is so nice to be able to breathe and to not have to shun my dogs!e to Soft Soap).</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also great to wash up your pits and such in between showers.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m perplexed with how to write this review.</li>
            <li> Maybe soap free?  </li>
            <li> It leaves your skin feeling smooth.</li>
            <li> Fantastic price too.</li>
            <li> I know maybe to make it tear free it takes chemicals.</li>
            <li> I bought to make my own cleaning products and really like.  </li>
            <li> This product is great, however I should have known WholeFoods sells it for $11.99 for same size (32oz.)</li>
            <li> It is great for a window cleaner mixed with vinegar and water.</li>
            <li> I then wash my face with this soap and a puff (a sponge that is covered with a smooth cloth) --- even in a 10X mirror, I do not see any traces of makeup.</li>
            <li> It also rinses very quickly and leaves both hair and fur totally clean.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s nice and gentle to use in my kid&#x27;s bath routine</li>
            <li> This soap is great for use in the backcountry while backpacking especially the unscented version when in bear country.  </li>
            <li> This soap is fantastic.  </li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re looking for a chemical free product without chemical causing irritants, this product is for you</li>
            <li> Plus I did not see suds during the wash (important for HE</li>
            <li> But I kept using it because EWG gave it such great ratings.  </li>
            <li> But I kept using it because EWG gave it such great ratings.  </li>
            <li> They did not advertise it as being tear free so this is no fault of the company, but I would not advertise it as \\&quot;baby mild\\&quot; either.</li>
            <li> Product is not tear free.</li>
            <li> it make my skin feels smooth</li>
            <li> overall great product for a baby shampoo</li>
            <li> I love how I can actually pronounce and know what the ingredients are in this product, as well as how the ingredients are organic, fair trade, and biodegradable.</li>
            <li> let me tell you, this is far superior to the harshness of dial.</li>
            <li> It is good for making a natural shampoo.</li>
            <li> The soap works great, but you really have to dig in order to find out how to use it because the label is absolutely 100% unhelpful.</li>
            <li> smells super clean, can use this for just about anything!  </li>
            <li> and we have struggled to find the right soap and creams - we love this for her bath time.</li>
            <li> The Baby mild feels great on the skin and since it has more olive oil in it I don&#x27;t seem as dry when I use it.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know how I made it through the first four decades of my life without Dr. Bronner&#x27;s Castile soap!!</li>
            <li> Nice soap rinses clean and doesn&#x27;t have too much perfume.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this to anyone with ANY kind of skin condition.</li>
            <li> This soap has many uses and is very gentle.</li>
            <li> I have enjoyed using it in many different products and love its versatility.</li>
            <li> I originally bought this as part of an ingredient list for hair shampoo.</li>
            <li> It creates a rich lather.  </li>
            <li> This is a throwback to the original Dr. Bronner</li>
            <li> Lathers richly, and no fragrance.</li>
            <li> I was weary at first because this is a type of soap that has like 18 or more uses</li>
            <li> But those are the only shortcomings I&#x27;ve found, so I&#x27;m sticking with it :^)</li>
            <li> I was not disappointed.  </li>
            <li> I does a great job of cleaning your hands and is not full of poison like most soaps today.</li>
            <li> If you want a plain, mild liquid soap, this is wonderful.  </li>
            <li> I always thought it was just something about the dogs, because I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ve ever purchased the same shampoo more than a couple of times, and sometimes I&#x27;ve even had to use my own shampoo on them.</li>
            <li> Believe me, I&#x27;m really a clean freak and, while I like to save money, I will not sacrifice cleanliness for frugality.&lt;br</li>
            <li> soap is indeed unscented so all I get is clean hands and no allergic reactions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and I also use it to clean with.</li>
            <li> All it takes in a squirt in the wash and everything comes out wonderfully clean.  </li>
            <li> Leaves rinse practically clean.</li>
            <li> so I cannot review it&#x27;s ability to clean everything</li>
            <li> and it doesn&#x27;t take a huge amount for adequate sudsing and washing.  </li>
            <li> I use it on my niece and nephew to keep them clean with out hurting them.</li>
            <li> The only thing I wish I did was get a scented kind :-)</li>
            <li> It leaves my hair with a clean (but not a &#x27;stripped of oil&#x27;) feel.</li>
            <li> This soap rinses away cleanly and works well for us.  </li>
            <li> and you get our felling clean.</li>
            <li> I use all of the dr bronner&#x27;s soaps  - I use them to clean with -- everything with the sal suds  --  </li>
            <li> If you will be adding your own essential oils be sure to use glass or PET containers</li>
            <li> Also, it does leave a residue when you use it to clean, which is another reason why I like to dilute it.</li>
            <li> It works well to clean</li>
            <li> Also use the peppermint or tea tree for making creamy liquid cleanser to clean the bathroom and the kitchen sink.  </li>
            <li> Makes my skin really soft and I love the smell!</li>
            <li> I still didn&#x27;t notice anything special about this product.</li>
            <li> Takes the tangles right out!  </li>
            <li> Safe, natural and earth friendly!</li>
            <li> It is awesome to clean soap scum on fiberglass tubs.  </li>
            <li> My son&#x27;s skin feels clean and soft after a bath and this has also been a nice cleansing soap for his cradle cap.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s amazing and my baby loves it on his sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> her skin immediately turned bright red, after drying her off, her skin looked like she had got burnt.</li>
            <li> solved.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note: This was drying my skin out when I was using it FULL STRENGTH and peppermint scented.</li>
            <li> solved.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note: This was drying my skin out when I was using it FULL STRENGTH and peppermint scented.</li>
            <li> I use it for making my own shampoo (combined with water and a natural detergent).</li>
            <li> I really wish it would have made the body wash suds up more</li>
            <li> but overall it cleans well and does a good job.</li>
            <li> (I got the unscented, baby mild version) and clean.</li>
            <li> Good to use with essential oils.  </li>
            <li> I have been using Bronner&#x27;s Liquid Soap for over 30 years and it is quite true that I am never without it.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t clean the leaves of our citrus as quickly and thoroughly as U-Tube video said it would</li>
            <li> I may purchase the lavender scent for my own clothes when I run out of my old detergent</li>
            <li> /&gt;It is very liquid-y, I&#x27;m used to using more shower gels / creamy soaps, so that was a bit of a change.  </li>
            <li> that sweet baby smell is not masked by unnatural fragrance.  </li>
            <li> When you use it to wash your hair it does leave it your hair really &amp;#34;tangled&amp;#34; feeling so make sure you use conditioner (I like the Bronner&#x27;s brand hair rinse, it smells like citrus)</li>
            <li> They actually refunded me fairly quickly without my intervention which is good, BUT read on and be warned:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I love love this soap and it does not dry out my skin.</li>
            <li> True castile uses mostly olive oil with water(it&#x27;s 4th on the list of ingredients in this product) but, the main ingredient, besides water, is coconut oil.</li>
            <li> It seemed like alot to pay for only 32oz originally, but it&#x27;s so strong that I have to dilute it to use it, so I really get more out of it than most 32oz containers of soap.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff, its natural, scent free</li>
            <li> Love how many different things can be made with this soap and of course the quality!</li>
            <li> kind)&lt;br /&gt;- 1/2 cup Super Washing Soda&lt;</li>
            <li> Great all natural product, but too drying for my sensitive baby&#x27;s eczema&lt;</li>
            <li> Organic, mild, fragrance-free.</li>
            <li> It is simply a mild soap.</li>
            <li> This soap is extremely mild but can even be used to wash dishes or clothes.</li>
            <li> It is so mild that you can make hair shampoo out of it.</li>
            <li> It is amazingly mild, so those with sensitivities would do well to try this out.</li>
            <li> Mild on the skin and no smell or fragrance.  </li>
            <li> so I used 1/4 cup baby mild in a load of my darks.</li>
            <li> It gets the best possible rating by EWG and cleaned my clothes as well as regular laundry detergent (but no chemical smell!)</li>
            <li> got the baby mild soap, because I couldn&#x27;t decide between the smells</li>
            <li> This soap was my attempt to find something &amp;#34;chemical free&amp;#34; and mild.</li>
            <li> -  cleans mildly  </li>
            <li> I would recommend it to people that  want mild soap.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve since found a pump to replace the cap and that has helped tremendously with the build up.</li>
            <li> and if you have children who will be using the product make sure you are using safe amounts and types of essential oils.</li>
            <li> Well the baby mild was also drying out my skin.  </li>
            <li> Recommend it most highly and always have.</li>
            <li> Overall, it does clean fairly well, but it leaves my hands feeling funny</li>
            <li> However, it is not tear free, so be aware of that if you are purchasing it for use with a baby.</li>
            <li> This is NOT a tear-free formula, but I&#x27;ve never had an issue as long as I rinse the suds from his hands fairly</li>
            <li> also love Dr Bronners for use on a new tattoo or piercing.</li>
            <li> My new favorite is the Hemp Almond soap they make</li>
            <li> If you are looking to exit the supermarket with less chemicals and toxic crud, this is a great product.  </li>
            <li> I also love that I can use it for pretty much anything from shampoo, body wash, baby soap, hand soap, to washing toys, cleaning, and I have a friend that even uses it on her pet.</li>
            <li> I use it on my two year old and my newborn, both of whom have sensitive skin, and it does the job nicely!  </li>
            <li> It is very mild and gentle on their skin though.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I was looking for!  </li>
            <li> It is such a versatile product with so many uses!</li>
            <li> Thanks!!</li>
            <li> The first 2 words are Dilute!</li>
            <li> but if I mix this with a little anti bacterial dish soap it works great for a hand soap.</li>
            <li> Well with how hard our water is here in Phoenix, it&#x27;s made my hair incredibly waxy.</li>
            <li> I liked the no scent as I am allergic to other soaps with strong scents.</li>
            <li> This soap is amazing for several reasons:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve read review after review that says this stuff is amazing for drealocks, so I bought a giant bottle of it.</li>
            <li> This product is detergent free and gentle on the skin.</li>
            <li> (yet has a distinct soapy smell to it).</li>
            <li> I add my own essential oils depending on what product I am making.</li>
            <li> I wish it were tear free but its better than regular shampoo</li>
            <li> with years of usage and by adding unscented lubriderm into the mix, i have always had soft, healthy skin.</li>
            <li> &#x27;s the recipes that I have found success with.</li>
            <li> I have soft water and still use vinegar on most cycles because I like to have my sheets/etc</li>
            <li> I have soft water and still use vinegar on most cycles because I like to have my sheets/etc</li>
            <li> It was worth every penny I paid for it.</li>
            <li> I make my own foaming hand soap - 1 part castile soap, 7 parts H20 (I use filtered water, others have recommended distilled water), and essential oils -</li>
            <li> I love the fact that it is natural without any chemicals in it</li>
            <li> I have recently started making some of my own shampoo and cleaning supplies.  </li>
            <li> The soap is good, but the price I paid is almost twice as much as what my local grocery store charges!</li>
            <li> So far the hemp almond is better in that regard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have been taking my ways back to the olden days (that rhymes), and making my own shampoo, face wash, etc.  </li>
            <li> We recived the product before we were told, made our own handmade soap last night.</li>
            <li> it works far better than i thought it would.</li>
            <li> It is nice to only have to take one product in your pack.</li>
            <li> i love this product my skin feels much better after i started to use this product and this product has encouraged me to try other products from the dr bronner&#x27;s brand</li>
            <li> This is safe and a better choice than other soaps with all of the additional chemicals.</li>
            <li> for my laundry, I&#x27;m going to go back to using Earth Friendly Products ECOS detergent, which EWG still rated better than a lot of traditional detergents, it gets the clothes clean, it rinses clean, and I can buy it at Costco.s really strong</li>
            <li> cleans quickly and does exactly what it says it does.</li>
            <li> It gets the clothes really clean and is much better for the environment than regular laundry</li>
            <li> It gets the clothes really clean and is much better for the environment than regular laundry</li>
            <li> right?</li>
            <li> right?</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s right.</li>
            <li> /&gt;the price is also right.</li>
            <li> Gentle enough to be an excellent shampoo, strong enough so that only about 4 drops will clean your hands.  </li>
            <li> Great for people with dry or sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I use it in several of my homemade recipes: hand soap, mild baby body wash and shampoo, fabric stain remover and appliance and granite surface cleaner, but it can be used for so much more.</li>
            <li> But the product label &amp;#34;sucks.&amp;#34; Label font is too small to read creating great difficulty in finding/reading product information.</li>
            <li> Being a Christian family it really makes me like the product even more!</li>
            <li> but I certainly will use the Baby Mild for all my baby laundry.</li>
            <li> It leaves hair nice and mild, though using hair conditioner with it is highly recommended for extra smoothness.</li>
            <li> I use this soap to clean pretty much anything.  </li>
            <li> for my laundry, I&#x27;m going to go back to using Earth Friendly Products ECOS detergent, which EWG still rated better than a lot of traditional detergents, it gets the clothes clean, it rinses clean, and I can buy it at Costco.</li>
            <li> The baby mild is gentle and moisturizing to these &amp;#34;wounds.&amp;#34;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I used this for two years in japan, I like this very much.</li>
            <li> This soap is very gentle</li>
            <li> He&#x27;s never had any problems and it&#x27;s very gentle on hair and skin.</li>
            <li> Very gentle.</li>
            <li> I use it for my daughters and it is so very gentle on their skin.  </li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s cheap compared to most other quality soaps.  </li>
            <li> This is great for those who are sensitive to chemicals found in other shampoos.  </li>
            <li> It seems counterintuitive to use a soap made from oils to remove oil from my skin but it works like a charm and my skin is more clear and vibrant than ever and no longer gets oily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I think it&#x27;s a wonderful product and a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t know any better, thought it was supposed to smell that way, but my sister confirmed there&#x27;s something not right.</li>
            <li> i am disabled and this item make a good mixture for  a bag enema and is mild and really helps those with bowel cleaning who can&#x27;t do it on their own due to disabilities.</li>
            <li> I went ahead and tried diluting it, though, first at about 5:1 (water:Bronner&#x27;s)</li>
            <li> Only soap I&#x27;ll use for my son, has so many alternative uses as well.</li>
            <li> Where in gods name has this junk been hiding my whole life??!</li>
            <li> Also, this soap is worth the price because it lasts since you don&#x27;t need that much.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s my first time trying anything like this</li>
            <li> Use it for making many different home products.  </li>
            <li> Works very well to prepare foamy soap!</li>
            <li> We soak them in this with some hot while for a while and then use a microwave steamer.  </li>
            <li> This is my first time ever trying Br Bronner Castile soap</li>
            <li> Use more vinegar if a larger load.</li>
            <li> Use more vinegar if a larger load.</li>
            <li> I got this for my gentle skinned babies!</li>
            <li> It lathers very well and makes them smell just like a baby would!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so glad I had only purchasedone online before I found it at Wholefoods.</li>
            <li> I use this soap for many different things.</li>
            <li> Will be back for more...</li>
            <li> This is the second organic soap I&#x27;ve tried and I have to say I am pleased.  </li>
            <li> Was exactly what I ordered and could not find any where else</li>
            <li> There is no fake fragrance.</li>
            <li> On top of it, I only have to condition my hair</li>
            <li> Was looking for something scentless, natural, non-irritating and this fit the bill</li>
            <li> Fast shipping !</li>
            <li> Even for a group, a couple ounces ought to last a week or more.  </li>
            <li> I love Dr. Bronner&#x27;s Castile soap, especially the liquid (organic) type.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure this works as well as the traditional peppermint Bronners, but it seems lacking.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m looking to eliminate as many chemicals as possible around my family.</li>
            <li> Also, for this particular scent (baby mild aloe) would be it has virtually  no scent (which I think it is not supposed to</li>
            <li> I bought this product to make body wash and it does exactly what it is supposed to.  </li>
            <li> but I don&#x27;t remember the name of the exact website</li>
            <li> check google if your interested)</li>
            <li> This is the first time I purchased Castile soap after a friend recommended it.  </li>
            <li> , my face and body feels smooth and soft.</li>
            <li> This is my personal favorite of the soaps for body care  --</li>
            <li> i am very please with my purchase and will buy again!</li>
            <li> It really lasts quite a while so the price is worth it.</li>
            <li> This was my first castle soap purchase.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s like water when you first pour it.  </li>
            <li> Rather than put it in my kids&#x27; bath, I tried to mix it with some essential oils so that I might be able to use it for myself.</li>
            <li> Since I discovered I am allergic to formaldehyde and its many cousins in personal care products</li>
            <li> In the summer time it is very good since you shower a few times a day since it does not dry your skin.</li>
            <li> Great for winter less drying of hands because there are no harsh chemicals.</li>
            <li> I make a lot of my own body washes and hand soaps and use this and other oils.</li>
            <li> Would be great for oily hair and it works well to remove leave-in oil treatments that otherwise make you look like a drowned rat the next day.</li>
            <li> And while it is unscented, there is a slight clean smell to it :)</li>
            <li> So far I have: clean dishes, used it as a body wash and a shave gel, a hand soap and a face cleaner.</li>
            <li> I add a bit more if it&#x27;s a big load or something very soiled.</li>
            <li> I add a bit more if it&#x27;s a big load or something very soiled.</li>
            <li> Good laundry product, tho more expensive than in the stores.</li>
            <li> This soap is great for anyone with sensitive skin, and a few drops in water works wonders on linoleum or vinyl flooring.</li>
            <li> It is very gentle and cleans very thoroughly.</li>
            <li> really prefer a product that comes ready to roll!</li>
            <li> I rarely need to use products other than, this soap, baking soda, or vinegar and love not having any chemicals around my baby.</li>
            <li> I love that the ingredient list is not a mile long.</li>
            <li> this is the best soap I have found and it will last a long long time.</li>
            <li> This is great mixed with baking soda to get at hard to clean things like stovetops and counters.</li>
            <li> My guess is that the reason my own shampoo doesn&#x27;t noticeably affect my asthma is because, well, I have almost infinitely less hair than my dogs do.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I use this product to make my own dishwashing detergent (along with lemon juice, water, and vinegar) in order to use less chemicals in our home and make it a safer place for our children.  </li>
            <li> Love using this in diluted form for hand washing in the winter when my hands get so dry.  </li>
            <li> time-- was actually full of soap and not half air.</li>
            <li> Personally I am too used to the strong peppermint soap.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m very happy I&#x27;ve switched soaps, as (1) it will be much cheaper, since I use less, and I&#x27;ve been using less lotion etc throughout the day (2)</li>
            <li> (If you wanted to know: bon-fire &amp;#34;white&amp;#34; ash from &amp;#34;hard&amp;#34; wood, pour distilled water over, collect the water &amp;#34;lye&amp;#34;, let sit until strong enough to mix with olive oil, done.)&lt;br /&gt;But</li>
            <li> This site, [...], sells pure castile soap with just olive oil and water, which is what pure castile soap is so I might try that.</li>
            <li> just pure stuff</li>
            <li> What can you say about pure soap?</li>
            <li> It is pure castile soap.  </li>
            <li> It is all organic and pure and contains no chemicals</li>
            <li> NEW use!!</li>
            <li> aside from all the preachy new age junk written on the bottle, its a good product.</li>
            <li> I love the product, but the cap had come loose in the box and coated the bottle and the orange oil I had received with it.</li>
            <li> the really dry and really oily combination is much more even with fewer breakouts (I am still using tea tree oil in a toner form).  </li>
            <li> I add 5/6 of water and about 1/6 of the liquid soap and my whole family has pure soap without the chemicals.</li>
            <li> I like the fact that it is organic and pure, but I will be looking for another soap, both for my kids and for myself that is pure but can still be mixed nicely with my essential oils.</li>
            <li> It gets make up off SO fast.</li>
            <li> I really like this soap</li>
            <li> really don&#x27;t know where to go from here.  </li>
            <li> and I really like it.  </li>
            <li> After about a week of stopping use and switching back to an oil free gentle facewash my skin is much calmer and</li>
            <li> Use it whole strength and a dish scrubby sponge and POOF</li>
            <li> consistency is going to be very watery</li>
            <li> very soft.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> consistency is going to be very watery</li>
            <li> very soft.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I tried this out A LOT sooner Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> You can really tell the difference in this organic soap compared to the chemical soaps.</li>
            <li> and it works really well</li>
            <li> although I don&#x27;t really like the smell of it</li>
            <li> This is a gentle, thorough soap.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t realize how much of an allergic reaction I was having to the soaps and shampoos I&#x27;ve tried until I used this.</li>
            <li> Shipping was fast.</li>
            <li> Works really well in my liquid soaps.</li>
            <li> and since it is milder and has no scent, it really works out well.  </li>
            <li> Just remember to add water or whatever to it, do not not use straight.</li>
            <li> That means you don&#x27;t need to take much at all along with you in your pack.  </li>
            <li> It also works very well as a shampoo for my dog with hyper-sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I read on a message board to try this, and it works and removes makeup very well.  </li>
            <li> I used this to make a foaming &amp;#34;all purpose wash&amp;#34; and I am very</li>
            <li> It was just like baby soap but very liquefied.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s gentle.  </li>
            <li> (I filled up my regular HE detergent measuring cup to the line designated for an HE wash).  </li>
            <li> Gentle on skin and has HUNDREDS of uses from laundry soap to shampoo.</li>
            <li> gentle gentle  </li>
            <li> It works really well.  </li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t need to use as much lotion throughout the day as I was using before.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It really doesn&#x27;t smell like anything, which I prefer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Its really helped to use a loofa, and</li>
            <li> Thanks, Amazon!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I appreciate that there are real alternatives to mass produced chemically laden garbage out there.  </li>
            <li> and it really cleans.</li>
            <li> I absolutely recommend this to parents for their kids.  </li>
            <li> I really like using unscented products and this one fits the bill.</li>
            <li> I really don&#x27;t like the smell and find it distracting.  </li>
            <li> once you see that when you dilute it , you end up with just as much soap as you would with any normal chemical soap , and what do you know , its organic ;)</li>
            <li> good stuff, but leaves a soap scum on everything.</li>
            <li> But, over all, it leaves your skin soft, clean and coming from someone like myself whom is fragrance/chemical sensitive -</li>
            <li> I will still try to use the rest of my bottle to make a kitchen and bathroom cleaner, so maybe it will work better for other purposes.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not drying the way so many other hand soaps are.</li>
            <li> I find that one pump is enough to thoroughly clean hands and it keeps me from accidentally using 5 &#x27;servings&#x27; of soap at a time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I find that one pump is enough to thoroughly clean hands and it keeps me from accidentally using 5 &#x27;servings&#x27; of soap at a time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> A tiny bit foams up nicely to clean while in the shower.</li>
            <li> I use it especially on silicon body implements when I want to clean something but don&#x27;t want it to erode from the cleaning solution that I am using.</li>
            <li> My white towels and socks got clean</li>
            <li> I personally use the Natural/Unscented kind, only because my skin is very sensitive.</li>
            <li> Without a doubt, the most ridiculous product label I&#x27;ve ever seen, and not consumer friendly.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s soft and luscious and cleans very, very well with just one pump.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I love love love that don&#x27;t have to worry about weird chemicals being on me or my children&#x27;s skin!!</li>
            <li> It is great for that, costs less then the store bought F &amp; V wash, and has absolutely no odor.  </li>
            <li> It leaves my hair feeling very clean and it&#x27;s easy to make a variety of shampoos with this, just add a few drops of whatever essential oil you prefer and some Aragan or jojoba oil</li>
            <li> I think Dr. Bronner&#x27;s is a fine brand - just find it hard to understand why they wouldn&#x27;t try to make their baby soap tear free.  </li>
            <li> I was using it full strength for months before I finally figured it out.</li>
            <li> Even though my first will last for a long time, I want to be sure to have a spare in case (you know how it is) they run out or for some reason stop carrying it here on amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> So many laundry detergents that are \\&quot;green \\&quot; really don&#x27;t work very well and</li>
            <li> It is a vital ingredient to make the exact soaps that you desire for your home.</li>
            <li> I spent an easy 200 dollars on soaps,lotions and anything I can find that would donate to helping my skin issues..</li>
            <li> Actually, I wouldn&#x27;t go back even if it cost more...</li>
            <li> Actually, I wouldn&#x27;t go back even if it cost more...</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve always bought regular cleaners, \\&quot;free and clear\\&quot; detergents, and sensitive skin body wash (which never worked well).</li>
            <li> Add Super Washing Soda, stir constantly</li>
            <li> Add Super Washing Soda, stir constantly</li>
            <li> To top it off, there are stars next to some ingredients such as olive oil, that state \\&quot;None remains after saponifying oils into soap and</li>
            <li> This is a main ingredient.  </li>
            <li> I use for cleaning vegetables mainly.  </li>
            <li> Is my main body soap</li>
            <li> Based on my trials, it appears that using the amount of Dr. Bronner&#x27;s that one would normally use with regular HE detergent is the way to go.&lt;br /&gt;I also have been using Dr Bronnr&#x27;s peppermint for hand soap while pregnant.</li>
            <li> On time and product was packed tightly with peanuts for safe shipping.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I tried this out A LOT sooner Highly recommended!ot and boil</li>
            <li> Would highly recommend and rate this item.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product and will use it the rest of my life.</li>
            <li> and I recommend it highly.</li>
            <li> I read that you could use Dr. Bronners in a high efficiency (HE)  washing machine.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I can highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> (ones I have tried)  for oily face with large pores and adult acne.&lt;br /&gt;2-</li>
            <li> and this makes my hair sooo soft and shiny!!</li>
            <li> Great product works wonderfully only downfall is the smell  and do not mix with vinegar as it converts back to oils and does not clean at all</li>
            <li> This has been the base for many homemade cosmetics and has done wonderful with my very dry skin and ezcema.</li>
            <li> The coolest thing about this product to me is that its so gentle that I can use it in my recipe to make homemade baby wipes for my son and have had no problems at all no diaper rashes at all, its natural as can be</li>
            <li> On the up side- it appears to be a gentle cleanser &amp; baby&#x27;s hair is soft.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t dry my skin at all and leaves me feeling clean.</li>
            <li> I really like how nontoxic and natural Dr. Bronner&#x27;s is.</li>
            <li> And I feel like when I get out of the shower my skin is a bit dryer than normal</li>
            <li> I found out after my daughter complained and I tested it in my own eyes.</li>
            <li> (i never used hot water to bathe her, only lukewarm or cool, simply because her skin is very sensitive)</li>
            <li> It lathers great, using very little of it, and cleans without all the added &#x27;stuff&#x27; other shampoos have in their bottles.</li>
            <li> I have had 2 dogs for 5 years now, and EVERY time I&#x27;ve bathed them (twice a month)I have had an asthma attack when they started to dry and had to stay away from them for a full 24 hours after the bath.</li>
            <li> although I&#x27;ve only used it for face / body wash, I keep reading about all of the other uses for it, and will probably start using it more often once I run out of other items (dishwashing soap, laundry, etc), so it will be really nice to have to only buy one product and use it for everything.</li>
            <li> it can be diluted at different ratios for lots of different purposes or used full strength to take care of a really robust cleaning task.</li>
            <li> Non toxic which is my new life style.</li>
            <li> I really wanted to love this product after reading all the reviews, but after using as a face/body wash with a little tea trea oil for 4 months i recently found that coconut oil highly comedogenic(pore clogging).  </li>
            <li> clean up messes in my house with this soap as well, works well on counters, sinks, stove, etc.</li>
            <li> Nice alternative to all the harsh chemicals in regular soaps.</li>
            <li> Very soft on hands, doesn&#x27;t leave any residue.</li>
            <li> Are use this soap on my dog who is very sensitive to any types of shampoo.</li>
            <li> I am very sensitive to soap, which can give me an itchy rash.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li> It is very natural,</li>
            <li> It is pretty drying on my skin if I use it often enough</li>
            <li> Wow!</li>
            <li> Excited to experiment with other uses for it.</li>
            <li> I originally started using it as a facial cleanser; however, now I am also using it as a body wash and shampoo (occasionally).</li>
            <li> i was looking for a natural shampoo with no smell and as long as the advertising is true re natural ingredients then this will work for me.</li>
            <li> A safe shampoo for small kids.</li>
            <li> This is my first time using Castile soap and I will probably never go back!</li>
            <li> I had switched to the baby mild from the tea tree one because my skin was getting too dry!  </li>
            <li> No rash and makes her hair so soft!  </li>
            <li> We live in an apt and use HE washers so a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I am african american with non relaxed hair and this works great as a shampoo alternative (mixed with olive oil and a little honey).</li>
            <li> Old product is new again.  </li>
            <li> I am using the Mild Baby Organic Castile liquid soap for shampoo, body wash, face wash, and hand soap, as well as a liquid cleanser for the house (use it like dish soap) for counters, sinks, tubs,  and floors etc.  </li>
            <li> I liked this product, but it tends to leave your hands a little dry.  </li>
            <li> Bottle was huge and will last a very long</li>
            <li> it dried his skin out a little, so I diluted it in a sports water bottle for the next time and had great results.</li>
            <li> I bought this because it was clear and uncomplicated.</li>
            <li> It makes my skin soft without the excess perfumes &amp; I do not feel greasy at all.  </li>
            <li> All Natural and Organic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> All Natural and Organic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I tried everything, soft brush, olive oil, combs and nothing worked to get rid of cradle cap.  </li>
            <li> , I use an old baby shampoo foam bottle, i fill it up 1/4 with castile</li>
            <li> far as the soap goes</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s gentle enough that I use it on my newborn, and I also use it while making homemade soaps.</li>
            <li> By this time, my son was already two years old (we&#x27;d faithfully used California Baby up until that point) and he was use to soap getting near his eyes and it being \\&quot;okay\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li> I like this soap because it is all natural and organic.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m surprised at home</li>
            <li> how well it really does for this purpose, but I never knew that with the standard store brand F &amp; V wash either.</li>
            <li> I have a 4 month old and instead of buying baby laundry soap</li>
            <li> i also have sensitive skin when it comes to laundry detergents and body washes.</li>
            <li> Really sensitive.</li>
            <li> 2 one-gallon containers to store the detergent in (I recycled an old vinegar jug +</li>
            <li> My family&#x27;s skin feels so soft after using this soap.</li>
            <li> Random acne (mostly back),hand eczema,little bumps all over my upper arms and more recently folliculitus on my torso.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very concentrated so this bottle will last you for months.  </li>
            <li> Everything in it is natural.</li>
            <li> Sensitive skin reacts well to it.</li>
            <li> I have extremely sensitive skin -</li>
            <li> My boys have sensitive skin</li>
            <li> Plus it&#x27;s natural and cruelty</li>
            <li> I also use it to make a gentle face cleaner by doing something similar with the addition of 1/2 tsp baking soda.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s gentle enough to use on my eyelash extensions.</li>
            <li> This size will last forever and it is now my chosen soap for my whole family.</li>
            <li> pleased.&lt;br /&gt;It is used as a hand soap, body and hair wash for my 21 month old son.&lt;br /&gt;Just</li>
            <li> used an old foaming hand soap dispenser.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use it anywhere else on my body, since it will sting sensitive areas.</li>
            <li> No way did i want that near my baby.</li>
            <li> did discover that the 1/4 cup was too much for my HE, in that it did not rinse totally out of the clothes.  </li>
            <li> Also, initially it does seem very pricy, but for also every use, you are diluting it.</li>
            <li> , I got this because I have a sensitive inflamed scalp.</li>
            <li> I have to say, as far as liquids go, this is awesome!&lt;br /&gt;Bought a DollarTree foaming dispenser (poured out the petro-chemical soap then washed the bottle)</li>
            <li> -- I don&#x27;t have any young children  </li>
            <li> I use this for myself and my 2 yr old.</li>
            <li> When I had a baby, it seemed natural to use their unscented soap for him.  </li>
            <li> Plus, my 3 year old likes to</li>
            <li> Like because has no harsh chemicals to worry about.  </li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t really notice the soapy film that builds up on you from regular body wash until you have made some body wash with this stuff.  </li>
            <li> But I can buy much cheaper at my local health food store now.</li>
            <li> My kids tend to be sensitive to ALL shampoos, soaps, laundry detergents.  </li>
            <li> I pour this castile soap into recycled pump containers and add a few drops of my favorite essential oils</li>
            <li> Since this one is unscented, you can add a few drops of essential oil for fragrance :)</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that it makes my daughter&#x27;s hair feel kind of tangly when I wash it out.</li>
            <li> I have been on a mission to eliminate harsh chemicals from my life and after starting to use this soap in a variety of recipes I make sure I ALWAYS have some on hand.  </li>
            <li> You can get Dr. Bronner&#x27;s at many different places, but Amazon seems to be the way to go if you want to pay less!</li>
            <li> The product can be used for many other purposes which I am open to try.&lt;br /&gt;1- Facial Cleanser: I would recommend Peppermint versus Lavender &amp; Baby-Mild  </li>
            <li> A little bit goes a long way, and it makes me happy that I&#x27;m not putting chemicals all over the things my little kids use.</li>
            <li> After spending 15min reading this entire (ridiculous) label, all that that was stated was &amp;#34;Delute&amp;#34; and so I conducted my own tests finding a satisfactory dilution ratio.</li>
            <li> I make my own foaming hand soap with this, essential oils &amp; water - a little of this goes a long way!</li>
            <li> I spent year trying different acne scrubs and face washes full of chemicals to reduce the oil that built up on my face.</li>
            <li> I had such high hopes for this soap.  </li>
            <li> If I have honeydew grit on the leaves, I rinse the next day using a high pressure setting.</li>
            <li> have eczema, dry skin, oily skin, hypersensitivity to: dry air, moist air, scented anything, and pretty much anything not</li>
            <li> that Johnsons has, but nothing healthy is going to, thats a fragrance that is not good for their skin, so I didn&#x27;t deduct for that.</li>
            <li> and my skin finally feels normal again.</li>
            <li> The first time I used it (1T or so on a wet rag)</li>
            <li> great!&lt;br /&gt;The dispenser really helps not get too much or too little.</li>
            <li> I love that it&#x27;s all natural without the harsh chemicals that other shampoos/cleaners/washes have.</li>
            <li> Since it IS plain, you can add fragrances, essential oils, and other fun items to create a unique soap.</li>
            <li> My 1.5 year old son has bad eczema and this soap works great for him.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Bottom line: highly (very) recommended especially when mixed 90/10 with water in a foam dispenser.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this if you have sensitive dry skin.</li>
            <li> For so many organic oils all combined together to create a universal soap , where exactly can you go wrong?</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;ve never used it before be aware that it&#x27;s not like other soaps</li>
            <li> On rare occasion, there is sometimes a little bit of eucalyptus that gets in the produce on the line from their eucalyptus soap.  </li>
            <li> or maybe there was something more serious internally that was causing my skin to freak out.</li>
            <li> I currently am using it for hand soap with a few drops of lavender oil, and I can tell it isn&#x27;t regular soap because instead of leaving your hands soft and slippery, it leave them more squeaky and dry.</li>
            <li> Some have smelled really nice but dried my skin, and one left me feeling moisturized but not clean.</li>
            <li> Can be used a general purpose cleaner, in homemade dog</li>
            <li> I also use it to wash my &amp;#34;unmentionables&amp;#34; in the washer on the delicate cycle, as I can&#x27;t tolerate even the fragrance free laundry detergent.  </li>
            <li> Usually the color is a light yellow</li>
            <li> His skin is so sensitive, its the only thing that works for him.</li>
            <li> I would recommend it to anyone who has sensitive skin human or canine.</li>
            <li> Works just as well as commercial, chemical laden soaps with all natural ingredients.</li>
            <li> my skin is back to soft and</li>
            <li> it does burn your skin (especially if you have sensitive skin)</li>
            <li> Just a few drops works so well as baby&#x27;s first bath and her skin is so soft and supple.</li>
            <li> (I used 15 drops of peppermint for just a faint smell, but I can&#x27;t really smell it - may use a tiny but more next time)&lt;br</li>

            <li> It is really runny, even before diluting it, so I got a foaming soap pump (as recommended by other reviewers</li>

            <li> They now make a lot of other products besides soap and their organic coconut oil for example is very good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> you are not there for any of the three delivery attempts, be prepared to have your hands tied behind your back and NOT be able to get your item.</li>
            <li> I have occasionally had trouble getting the 32oz size, but it has always come quickly from the various sellers.</li>
            <li> This soap doea not dry out my skin or irritate my skin.</li>
            <li> Secret to cleanliness.. good for people who do not like heavy scents.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> It cleans well, doesn&#x27;t bother his very sensitive skin, and doesn&#x27;t dry his skin out.</li>
            <li> I use Dr. Bronners for making multiple cleaning supplies (hand soap, general cleaner).</li>
            <li> /&gt;Apparently (according to Dr. Bronner&#x27;s website) you&#x27;re supposed to dilute this soap pretty heavily.</li>
            <li> The only thing I don&#x27;t like is that her hair smells a little funny.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin that&#x27;s on the dry side</li>
            <li> I am not super into the whole organic scene</li>
            <li> Does not dry out your skin like traditional soaps.  </li>
            <li> The only downside would be it does burn your eyes so be careful if you use it on your face and despite what many people say, not good in a DIY shampoo.</li>
            <li> but really, what goes on your body goes in your body, and for LESS money than I was spending on chemical laden soaps/body washes/beauty bars, there is no way I will ever go back.</li>

            <li> My skin gets very dry and its sensitive.</li>
            <li> I searched long and hard for a true organic shampoo for my family to use.</li>
            <li> Not a strong smell, lathers very well.</li>
            <li> I have used it in so many different things and you can hardly tell any is missing out of the bottle!</li>
            <li> I found all of the recipes for what I personally use at a blog called My Merry Messy Life (search for it - highly recommended).</li>
            <li> Unscented, gentle on baby&#x27;s skin, and a little goes a long way!</li>
            <li> There are not many brands out there that are truly pure like this one.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m left with an all natural, organic cleanser for much less than I&#x27;d pay anywhere else.  </li>
            <li> No distinct smell, I wash my baby with this soap and we have no problems so far</li>
            <li> Organic and free of nasty chemicals you will find in most commercial soaps.</li>
            <li> As for using it for a baby soap, I&#x27;m not sure that I would straight from the bottle for fear of drying out my baby.</li>
            <li> Will order over and over and have been telling anyone who would stand still long enough to hear it, to buy it!</li>
            <li> A big bottle lasts sooooo long.</li>
            <li> This bottle will last a long time.</li>
            <li> I use this hand soap all the time and it last a long time.</li>
            <li> Long story short after learning about all the junk that I use in my every day life (consumable goods like soaps, baby washes, cosmetics, shampoos etc etc etc)</li>
            <li> I think it is going to last a long time</li>
            <li> A tiny bit goes a long way!</li>
            <li> That is less than I used to spend for the economy sized refill jugs of Equate hand soap (comparable to Soft Soap).</li>
            <li> Has a gross smell that follows you around and make skin dry.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried LOTS of different soaps and body washes over the years to combat severely dry skin.</li>
            <li> (I used to use Dove extra moisture wash), however I&#x27;ve now noticed after a month that throughout the day my skin doesn&#x27;t get as dry</li>
            <li> I was hugging, brushing , and actually sniffing them the same day with absolutely no problem</li>
            <li> The unscented soap is recommended for anyone with sensitive skin or for anyone looking for a soap base to make their own hair and body wash.</li>
            <li> I wish I had bothered to try a scented version first because it&#x27;s a little bland</li>
            <li> so we are unable to use most soaps from other places.</li>
            <li> It requires very little soap to wash from head to toe, making me feel clean and refreshed, without the usual chemical and residues weighing on my skin.  </li>
            <li> It really doesn&#x27;t suds at all, but we have hard water so that may be part of it.</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t had it long</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve known of Dr. Bronner&#x27;s for a long time, but I just assumed that Castile Soap would be too drying for any of my applications.</li>
            <li> I use it in my long hair too.  </li>
            <li> I plan on using this soap for a long time</li>
            <li> As a side note- the label has a lot of strange rant like writing all over it.</li>
            <li> It was not much lost but enough to coat some of the bottle.</li>
            <li> It lasts a long time as well!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also</li>
            <li> This soap lasts a long time.  </li>
            <li> (I think I use perhaps 1/2 to one capful on a wet wash cloth for my entire body now)</li>
            <li> No matter how \\&quot;Natural\\&quot; of a product I find, someone gets a minor rash.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been a long time user of Dr. Bronner&#x27;s Soaps.</li>
            <li> So clearly I&#x27;m not going to be using this as baby laundry detergent.  </li>
            <li> So clearly I&#x27;m not going to be using this as baby laundry detergent.  </li>
            <li> The worst soap ever, the smell of this soap cancel out any strong lotion you apply to your skin an hour after you smell like cheap unsented soap and no lotion.</li>
            <li> No more oily face,my back acne I suffered with for years is 95% gone,I never get tiny white heads anymore,arm bumps,hand eczema &#x3D; gone.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll never go back to any other soaps after using this, you can use this for shampoo also (I do).</li>
            <li> I have long, straight, thin hair that is not to oily, about in the middle</li>
            <li> i plan to add it to other things for usage later like aloe from plants i grow myself.  </li>
            <li> I had noticed that when I was home a lot and not at work (such as on weekends) my hands would get a little red.  </li>
            <li> (very long and lots of it)</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s the product or what, but it&#x27;s very drying to my face and makes my skin feel tight and weird like cheap soap.</li>
            <li> so you might have to add something to it if you&#x27;re using it on hair or dry skin.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t dry your skin out, either.  </li>
            <li> but I would mousturize if your skin is dry.</li>
            <li> and so far have made foaming hand soap that keeps my poor old hands moistened.  </li>
            <li> No wonder my skin was all dry!</li>
            <li> Less if it&#x27;s a smaller load.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also</li>
            <li> Less if it&#x27;s a smaller load.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also</li>
            <li> I found this at my local health food store for less than $11.</li>
            <li> I would recommend the soap, but only give 4 stars since it can be purchased for less from WholeFoods (if you have one nearby).  </li>
            <li> I had read to use 1/3 to 1/2 cup in a regular washer and half that in an HE</li>
            <li> My face has started breaking out less (even though I was washing it twice a day with acne specific wash).  </li>
            <li> extremely versatile product and goes a long way.</li>
            <li> used to add also a little coconut oil but left chunks in it and had no patience to melt</li>
            <li> It is the only soap I will use on my little one</li>
            <li> It only takes a little bit.</li>
            <li> I add a little essential oil to compliment the season</li>
            <li> This soap was worse for me than other store soaps that are scented and full of harsh ingredients.</li>
            <li> It does not mix well for my general housecleaner recipe, not sure why.  </li>
            <li> Product was as expected.</li>
            <li> but it took a few shampoos of regular shampoo to get this junk out of my hair.</li>
            <li> and my years spent with it is a testimony of it&#x27;s quality.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m going to try and buy some for my mom since she has cancer and needs to stay away from putting harsh chemicals on her body as much as possible.</li>
            <li> The foaming hand soap container helps make the soap last longer, not as much wasted soap and ecomnomical to use.</li>
            <li> It definitely cleans the hair but you will have to do some conditioning so its not all dried out.</li>
            <li> All I need is a few drops and the soap totally foams up.  </li>
            <li> Wanted to like this product but between the rants on the bottle and the rancid smell after being open just a few weeks I am not a fan.</li>
            <li> Total waste of money.</li>
            <li> I use this for my bath soap, in all our foaming hand soap dispensers, and will use it on my baby when he&#x27;s born (just be careful to keep it out of his eyes).  </li>
            <li> I also use it for washing produce (says you can brush your teeth with it, so why not?), and I use it for cleaning the tub, sinks and toilets.</li>
            <li> My toddler is an itchy mess all winter long</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t have any scent and a little goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> Use it homemade products and a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> , I use it as shower soap, a little goes a long way</li>
            <li> A little goes a LONG way.  </li>
            <li> Just remember a little goes a long way, so dilute it 50/50.</li>
            <li> a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way, too.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> A little goes a LONG way, i cut it to 25% soap and 75% water (at the strongest).</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only bought a couple of bottles of this castile soap at stores but this one has a slight green tinge.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t wait to try other scents.</li>
            <li> Just buy this and throw all other fancy soaps in the trash.</li>
            <li> A few drops go a long way at bath time on a baby wash cloth and we use it for body and hair.</li>
            <li> They are a company that I wish other companies would imitate.</li>
            <li> Used other &#x27;flavors&#x27; before but like the unscented version.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s scentless, and painless (the peppermint can be a bit painful in certain sensitive areas).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> A little of the water-like soap goes a real long way.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s not really pure castile soap!</li>
            <li> , I will never use conventional soap again.</li>
            <li> I water this down in empty bottles, half soap and half water.  </li>
            <li> Hate that I wasted a lot of my DoTerra essential oils (which isn&#x27;t cheap) trying to mask the smell.</li>
            <li> Not nearly as useful as I was led to believe.  </li>
            <li> Also, my daughter has thick naturally curly hair, and I don&#x27;t want to use harsh chemicals on her hair, but she doesn&#x27;t need tangles!  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately to have no smell it would have to be just plain water ;)</li>
            <li> And here for my body I was squirting out at least a half cup several times on my scrubbie sponge!</li>
            <li> but, as soon as he sees the soap he breaks down, screams and begs us to \\&quot;put it</li>
            <li> Maybe the soap now comes pre-watered down?</li>
            <li> So it spills down your hand.</li>
            <li> Every month or so I would head down to bath and body works and grab a month supply of their foaming hand soaps because...</li>
            <li> (BUT if you use it correctly.. you do need to water this down if your using as a clenser/soap.</li>
            <li> However, when I used Dr. Bronner&#x27;s, NO ASTHMA even though I&#x27;ve generally been needing my inhaler a lot lately!</li>
            <li> I started making organic shampoo and body wash with this product,along with a few other ingredients.</li>
            <li> I like that its organic and not as harsh on the environment as other soaps (3)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d like a thicker &amp; less watery product.</li>
            <li> scent is a bit odd, as is the writing all over the bottle.</li>
            <li> The entire label is covered with inappropriate and (irrelevant to the product) religious messages.</li>
            <li> they are the less they work.</li>
            <li> with a small dab on a wet paper</li>
            <li> Dilute by half and add a few drops of Castor oil</li>
            <li> I use it in our hand soap dispenser (diluted), a little spoonful in my baby&#x27;s wipe juice, and as part of a household cleaner I mix up.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little drying</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;ve ever struggled to breathe, you&#x27;ll understand why I think this is some sort of little miracle.</li>
            <li> I feel it&#x27;s a little drying on my skin but its nontoxic.</li>
            <li> just a very small amount goes a long way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My little girls wash with it, too.  </li>
            <li> I also use it alone as a body wash with just a little on my body sponge.</li>
            <li> I got a little travel bottle to decant into and that bottle (3oz travel size) typically lasts about a month!  </li>
            <li> after having done several loads of laundry with it, I have discovered that the slightest bit of residue left on the laundry makes my skin itch like crazy.  </li>
            <li> after having done several loads of laundry with it, I have discovered that the slightest bit of residue left on the laundry makes my skin itch like crazy.  </li>
            <li> but I use coconut oil everyday</li>
            <li> Dr. Bronner&#x27;s website says to put just a few drops, undiluted, on a washcloth, but I&#x27;ve found that it doesn&#x27;t lather well for me that way</li>

            <li> add a few drops or organic orange EO&lt;br /&gt;A</li>
            <li> few drops of rosemary EO (you can do vanilla if you want,</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t feel all dried out after using it.  </li>
            <li> but this has a hint of green that makes me wonder if it&#x27;s been sitting in a warehouse forever...</li>
            <li> Waste</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve wasted a lot of money over the years on products that never worked well.</li>
            <li> Again, credit goes to My Merry Messy Life - search for her site for a plethora of comments and suggestions on how to make these recipes your own.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;DR.</li>
            <li> I mix a few ozs of this soap with a few ozs of neem oil in a miracle grow sprayer.</li>
            <li> You can add a few drops of oil to the mix to even it out, but&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d</li>
            <li> It took a few washings with another shampoo to get it out.</li>
            <li> i use it everyday</li>
            <li> Then I happened upon  the blog &#x27;going green&#x27; by Lisa Bronner and read her cheat sheet.  </li>
            <li> i didnt want to waste the product</li>
            <li> He has bad eczema and it cleared right up.</li>
            <li> It is very heavy and weighed my hair down.</li>
            <li> Not sure if the lid was not on tight or what.</li>
            <li> When we received, it had leaked all through the packaging, what a mess!</li>
            <li> Slightly Less Expensive Than Regular Soap</li>
            <li> Makes me mad that they filled up every inch of space on the label to tell us about some weird religion.</li>
            <li> No More Asthma Problems After Washing Dogs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve also used it in the shower this winter, it foams volumes and no more chapped skin.</li>
            <li> usually finish the shampoo in a couple of weeks</li>
            <li> I got it to use on backpacking trips but ended up using it as my everyday shower soap!</li>
            <li> Let&#x27;s just say over the past 3 weeks EVERYTHING has cleared up.</li>
            <li> No more itching</li>
            <li> I like the quality of the ingredients, but not sure how I&#x27;m going to use this product.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t be put off my the weird religious rantings all over the label.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if the fault lies with the manufacturer or the company I purchased it from, but I purchased it from Hi-Tech Products (</li>
            <li> It does leave a very slight residue but again it may be from our hard water.</li>
            <li> Not sure if it is because we have hard water or what, but</li>
            <li> use 1/2 cup per load of vinegar in the rinse cycle if you have hard water.</li>
            <li> use 1/2 cup per load of vinegar in the rinse cycle if you have hard water.</li>
            <li> And it&#x27;s been suggested to add vinegar to the mix to compensate for the hard water, but I don&#x27;t want my hair smelling like vinegar.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> but it leaves a little film behind</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a sucker for the liquid scented soaps from Bath &amp; Body Works, but they get expensive--and I don&#x27;t know what is in them.  </li>
            <li> I was shunned somewhere for almost getting a baby in the eyes with the baby powder, this is why common soap should not be seen under hemp inclusion.</li>
            <li> and then I can turn around and use it in a spray bottle in my shower to remove shower scum and mold in my shower and use it to remove rust stains on my silverware and bathroom counter tops.</li>
            <li> but this one doesn&#x27;t affect me in negative ways.</li>
            <li> and this dried my skin out so bad and made it itchy and red.</li>
            <li> This product has HEMP in it a commonly used term for high-growing varieties of the Cannabis plant.</li>
            <li> I was getting all kinds of bumps (looked like chicken skin) on the back of my legs...</li>
            <li> It turned out that it shouldn&#x27;t be runny like water, but thick.</li>
            <li> I mean, crazy-absurd sensitive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Even if you think its so expensive, its really not considering that you have to dilute it with water for just about everything you use it for!</li>
            <li> And I mean everything.</li>
            <li> -- You use a very small amount when using  </li>
            <li> Anyway - this is not a good soap for babies/toddlers that might be squirmy and might end up with soap in the eyes.</li>
            <li> not good for hair-</li>
            <li> I used this a few times but it is extremely difficult to keep out of his eyes and it does burn his eyes.</li>
            <li> If you don&#x27;t dilute the soap it can possibly have serious chemical reactions which is dangerous!</li>
            <li> But it was icky!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been suffering with some weird skin conditions for the past 3 years now.</li>
            <li> One bottle lasts our family of three for at least a year!</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, I still can&#x27;t get past that oily smell.</li>
            <li> Not happy and unsure who to contact.</li>
            <li> Which is so frustrating...</li>
            <li> but I didn&#x27;t expect miracles, just going for not making it any worse.</li>
            <li> I am addicted to these soaps.</li>
            <li> Not happy with the smell.</li>
            <li> I purchased Dr. Bronners baby-mild soap because I wanted a shampoo/body wash for my newborn that was cleansing without being harsh and having crazy chemicals.  </li>
            <li> my poor baby.</li>
            <li> oh, and the smell was not pleasant at all!</li>
            <li> Not sure if the unscented is supposed to smell bad,</li>
            <li> If you do, then you are weird.</li>
            <li> I feel I can never go wrong with Dr. Bronner.  </li>
            <li> Its too expensive to use as dish soap</li>
            <li> I wish it wasn&#x27;t so expensive</li>
            <li> Silly of me.</li>
            <li> you cannot really go wrong</li>
            <li> Totally useless label.</li>
            <li> I used to use purity and it was so expensive.  </li>
            <li> bronner&#x27;s baby can&#x27;t go wrong all one all one</li>
            <li> after getting a body piercing as a teenager, i followed the piercers instructions and used dial soap with very poor results.</li>
            <li> Castile soap is very thin</li>
            <li> I bought this to use in a variety of ways, but I find that the dilutions make the soap very thin - almost a water consistency.  </li>
            <li> After a few times of accidentally getting into his eyes - he&#x27;s now SO fearful of bath time.  </li>
            <li> There has been skeptic of Johnson &amp; Johnson, views having fear of the dirty head.</li>
            <li> The website allowed you to search products and rated them based on their toxicity and explained how dangerous each chemical ingredient in your chosen item was.. (forgive me</li>
            <li> /&gt;Can&#x27;t go wrong!</li>
            <li> WRONG!</li>
            <li> My son has really bad eczema</li>
            <li> i&#x27;m goin broke using this stuff but too bad i need it.</li>
            <li> The oils in this product make it bad for dishes and glass cleaner.</li>
            <li> the smallest amount of irritation will make my face look like a bad sunburn.</li>
            <li> Like oil gone bad.</li>
            <li> , matter of fact it feels like a really bad sunburn.</li>
            <li> But when it does go in my poor daughters eye it is a horrible experience.</li>

            <li> Never have I been disappointed with anything I have tried.</li>
            <li> I have used this diluted on very dirty children.</li>
            <li> I rated this item with 4 stars instead of 5 because of the stupid label.</li>
            <li> I use it as a base in all of my homemade soaps and body washes.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> What is there to say?  Dr Bronner&#x27;s is the best.  I use it in our hand soap dispenser (diluted), a little spoonful in my baby&#x27;s wipe juice, and as part of a household cleaner I mix up.  It&#x27;s also great to wash up your pits and such in between showers.</li>
            <li> The only body wash I have used for four years  Does not leave residue on the skin  I put some in a bottle for hand wash  Good stuff</li>
            <li> Got here the day before it said it would be. Great product! Will be ordering again.</li>
            <li> Love this product for making my Liquid soap!</li>
            <li> Used this to make my own shampoo and hand soap. It is a very important ingredient in the recipe!</li>
            <li> I love this!  It makes my skin soft without the excess perfumes &amp; I do not feel greasy at all.  It lathers great &amp; it makes me feel fresh &amp; clean.  I love it!</li>
            <li> His skin is so sensitive, its the only thing that works for him. Love it and smells heavenly.  My baby loves it too.</li>
            <li> I will never buy another soap again.  I use this for everything!!!  It&#x27;s a little drying but I use coconut oil everyday so I haven&#x27;t had any issues.  Love love love!</li>
            <li> I am currently in the process of riding my bathroom or all chemicals and toxins so I have decided to make my own shampoo and I absolutely love Dr. Bonner&#x27;s Castile Soap! It leaves my hair feeling very clean and it&#x27;s easy to make a variety of shampoos with this, just add a few drops of whatever essential oil you prefer and some Aragan or jojoba oil and you&#x27;re good to go!</li>
            <li> Yes, it does make water white, but one of the best soaps available. No distinct smell, I wash my baby with this soap and we have no problems so far</li>
            <li> Product was as expected.</li>
            <li> Very soft on hands, doesn&#x27;t leave any residue.</li>
            <li> This soap is amazing for several reasons:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. No More Asthma Problems After Washing Dogs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am blown away... 1000 stars! I have had 2 dogs for 5 years now, and EVERY time I&#x27;ve bathed them (twice a month)I have had an asthma attack when they started to dry and had to stay away from them for a full 24 hours after the bath. I always thought it was just something about the dogs, because I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ve ever purchased the same shampoo more than a couple of times, and sometimes I&#x27;ve even had to use my own shampoo on them. However, when I used Dr. Bronner&#x27;s, NO ASTHMA even though I&#x27;ve generally been needing my inhaler a lot lately! I was hugging, brushing , and actually sniffing them the same day with absolutely no problem (I had not used my inhaler before or after the bath). If you&#x27;ve ever struggled to breathe, you&#x27;ll understand why I think this is some sort of little miracle. My guess is that the reason my own shampoo doesn&#x27;t noticeably affect my asthma is because, well, I have almost infinitely less hair than my dogs do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. Slightly Less Expensive Than Regular Soap... You&#x27;re Supposed To Dilute It.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Apparently (according to Dr. Bronner&#x27;s website) you&#x27;re supposed to dilute this soap pretty heavily. I was using it full strength for months before I finally figured it out. Oops. When I finally started reading that you&#x27;re supposed to dilute it I actually thought it sounded gross and unhygienic. I went ahead and tried diluting it, though, first at about 5:1 (water:Bronner&#x27;s) and then when that worked super well, 9:1 (didn&#x27;t measure exactly), which still works superbly. Believe me, I&#x27;m really a clean freak and, while I like to save money, I will not sacrifice cleanliness for frugality.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Diluting this size container to that strength provides 2.5 gallons of soap for 15 dollars (or whatever you paid for the quart of concentrate). That is less than I used to spend for the economy sized refill jugs of Equate hand soap (comparable to Soft Soap). It is really runny, even before diluting it, so I got a foaming soap pump (as recommended by other reviewers - thanks!)and I find that one pump is enough to thoroughly clean hands and it keeps me from accidentally using 5 &#x27;servings&#x27; of soap at a time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3. You Can Use It In The Shower - Really.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re using this on your hands there&#x27;s no reason you can&#x27;t use it on the rest of your body, right? Just dilute to the strength you find to be appropriate, put it in a foaming pump bottle, and go. Dr. Bronner&#x27;s website says to put just a few drops, undiluted, on a washcloth, but I&#x27;ve found that it doesn&#x27;t lather well for me that way and there doesn&#x27;t seem to be \\&quot;enough\\&quot; to spread it properly. Foaming pump. Problem solved.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note: This was drying my skin out when I was using it FULL STRENGTH and peppermint scented. I think my skin will become balanced again, though, now that I&#x27;m diluting and scent free.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4. All Natural and Organic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not someone who is on a warpath to make everything that enters my home all natural/organic... but really, what goes on your body goes in your body, and for LESS money than I was spending on chemical laden soaps/body washes/beauty bars, there is no way I will ever go back. Actually, I wouldn&#x27;t go back even if it cost more... it is so nice to be able to breathe and to not have to shun my dogs!e to Soft Soap).

            <li> I am not a connoisseur of castile or any soaps, and this  is my 1st experience with castile soap. It seems to be a good soap and do the job a soaps supposed to do.</li>
            <li> Great lightweight body wash and it exfoliates the skin as well</li>
            <li> Only soap I&#x27;ll use for my son, has so many alternative uses as well. Can be used a general purpose cleaner, in homemade dog shampoo(works wonders for dandruff in combo with coconut oil), dish soap, veggie wash, hand and face soap. extremely versatile product and goes a long way.</li>
            <li> Ummmm. Hello to the only soap I will ever ever use ever for the rest of my life. Like...whaaat?! Where in gods name has this junk been hiding my whole life??! Y&#x27;all. It&#x27;s the best feeling of clean my face and body has EVER felt. It gets make up off SO fast. And this big ol&#x27; bottle lasts forevssss. It literally is the king of soaps. Just do it, you won&#x27;t regret it. If you do, then you are weird.</li>
            <li> I use it for making my own shampoo (combined with water and a natural detergent). Works well with no noticeable residue or smell.</li>
            <li> I feel I can never go wrong with Dr. Bronner.  Arrived on time.</li>
            <li> Nice alternative to all the harsh chemicals in regular soaps.</li>
            <li> I used this for two years in japan, I like this very much. It is nice production. I will continuously using this one. Thank you!</li>
            <li> Making my own shampoo with this soap. It makes my hair so nice.</li>
            <li> I use this soap for making my shampoo. It&#x27;s unscented so I can add whatever fragrance I like at the time. It works well and the seller shipped it in no time at all!!</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t had it long and so far have made foaming hand soap that keeps my poor old hands moistened.  I&#x27;ve also used it in the shower this winter, it foams volumes and no more chapped skin.</li>
            <li> I tried everything, soft brush, olive oil, combs and nothing worked to get rid of cradle cap.  This stuff is great.  You don&#x27;t have to leave it on baby&#x27;s head any longer than it takes to lather it up.  It doesn&#x27;t have any scent and a little goes a long way.  I imagine I will have this bottle until my son is 15.  :)</li>
            <li> I have been using this soap as my baby wash and shampoo since he was 6 months or so.&lt;br /&gt;What I do is, I use an old baby shampoo foam bottle, i fill it up 1/4 with castile soap.&lt;br /&gt;I add a few drops or organic orange EO&lt;br /&gt;A few drops of rosemary EO (you can do vanilla if you want, instead).&lt;br /&gt;I add 1/2 teaspoon of vegetable glycerine&lt;br /&gt;Add 1 teaspoon or so of calendula infused oil&lt;br /&gt;Fill up the rest of the bottle with tap water.&lt;br /&gt;I usually finish the shampoo in a couple of weeks and it doesnt go bad.&lt;br /&gt;I used to add also a little coconut oil but left chunks in it and had no patience to melt it.&lt;br /&gt;This is how I use it.&lt;br /&gt;To be honest, I did try using it on my own hair and I didn&#x27;t like how it felt but for some reason it works on my (now) toddler.</li>
            <li> Excellent product that I&#x27;ve been using for years.  Very pleased with this gentle and effective soap, even more so that is completely free of any scent.  On rare occasion, there is sometimes a little bit of eucalyptus that gets in the produce on the line from their eucalyptus soap.  Otherwise, very happy with this</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m perplexed with how to write this review. I gave the product 5 stars because it is the best soap ever, however this is shipped from The Vitamin Shoppe and I had some problems with my order. They actually refunded me fairly quickly without my intervention which is good, BUT read on and be warned:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When you get an order from The Vitamin Shoppe they send it via UPS under an explicit contract that you, THE CUSTOMER, THE BUYER OF THE ITEM, are NOT allowed to pick it up from UPS, should you be somewhere else during delivery (uhh, like at work????!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are not there for any of the three delivery attempts, be prepared to have your hands tied behind your back and NOT be able to get your item. It will be shipped BACK to the Vitamin Shoppe, and their customer support put me on hold for an hour before I hung up. This is what the UPS support told me: They cannot allow me to pick it up because it is specific to the contract between UPS and Vitamin Shoppe that the items CANNOT be held for pick up. That&#x27;s right. It&#x27;s YOUR ITEM, YOU PAYED FOR IT, yet you can&#x27;t pick YOUR PROPERTY up because of a contract between the DELIVERER and THE PERSON YOU BOUGHT IT FROM.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All I can say is THANK GOD they automatically gave me a refund :) Just be warned about this folks. Do NOT order from the Vitamin Shoppe unless you KNOW that someone will be there at delivery. Have it delivered to work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As far as the soap goes it&#x27;s AWESOME! The soap is the best soap ever, and baby mild is the best one. It&#x27;s scentless, and painless (the peppermint can be a bit painful in certain sensitive areas).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Baby Mild is awesome. Also Lavender is good too, and this soap can be used for ANYTHING. not just showering etc.</li>
            <li> I used this product in a body wash recipe.  I really wish it would have made the body wash suds up more but overall it cleans well and does a good job.</li>
            <li> I really like this soap, it&#x27;s gentle enough that I use it on my newborn, and I also use it while making homemade soaps. Also have some in a foam dispenser in the bathroom. Will definitely order again.</li>
            <li> I had such high hopes for this soap.  We were using California Baby soap but, they changed their ingredients and we decided to jump ship and try this.  By this time, my son was already two years old (we&#x27;d faithfully used California Baby up until that point) and he was use to soap getting near his eyes and it being \\&quot;okay\\&quot;.  Dr. Bronners has made bath time unbearable.  After a few times of accidentally getting into his eyes - he&#x27;s now SO fearful of bath time.  We can coach him into the tub but, as soon as he sees the soap he breaks down, screams and begs us to \\&quot;put it back!\\&quot;&#x3D;/  I used some on my face and it BURNS your eyes like crazy!!  I would be scared too if I were him.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really don&#x27;t know where to go from here.  Maybe soap free?  I don&#x27;t want to go back to California Baby because of their standards and practices.  I think Dr. Bronner&#x27;s is a fine brand - just find it hard to understand why they wouldn&#x27;t try to make their baby soap tear free.  Maybe they can&#x27;t?  Anyway - this is not a good soap for babies/toddlers that might be squirmy and might end up with soap in the eyes. But, over all, it leaves your skin soft, clean and coming from someone like myself whom is fragrance/chemical sensitive - it&#x27;s IS unscented. A good buy for adults, but in my opinion, miss marketed as a \\&quot;baby\\&quot; soap.</li>
            <li> Used with distilled water, almond oil, witch hazel, and lime essential oil for reusable facial wipes. Wonderful soap!</li>
            <li> I like this soap! Nice soap rinses clean and doesn&#x27;t have too much perfume. It leaves your skin feeling smooth.</li>
            <li> I bought this because it was clear and uncomplicated. I got it to use in my Umbra Birdie Foaming Soap Pump (http://www.amazon.com/Umbra-Birdie-Foaming-Soap-White/dp/B0070U20KQ/ref&#x3D;sr_1_6?ie&#x3D;UTF8&amp;qid&#x3D;1340633391&amp;sr&#x3D;8-6&amp;keywords&#x3D;umbra+pump) and it&#x27;s perfect! I use a total of 300mL solution of which only 30mL is this soap. The rest is water and together they produce the most heavenly foam. It&#x27;s soft and luscious and cleans very, very well with just one pump.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The soap is indeed unscented so all I get is clean hands and no allergic reactions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m sure this is a great soap for all applications but I will limit my review to my wonderful experience with the foam dispenser. In fact, I&#x27;ve just ordered another bottle! Even though my first will last for a long time, I want to be sure to have a spare in case (you know how it is) they run out or for some reason stop carrying it here on amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line: highly (very) recommended especially when mixed 90/10 with water in a foam dispenser.</li>
            <li> Love it! I use it to make DIY shampoo and body wash and it is a great so far. Nothing to complain.</li>
            <li> Great product, awesome company.  We use several of their products in our house.  Would recommend to anyone.</li>
            <li> Are use this soap on my dog who is very sensitive to any types of shampoo. It leaves his skin and coat very clean and shiny and moisturizes. I would recommend it to anyone who has sensitive skin human or canine.</li>
            <li> It is the only soap I will use on my little one and I also use it to clean with. It is wonderful and safe!</li>
            <li> I like this soap because it is all natural and organic.  I&#x27;m a sucker for the liquid scented soaps from Bath &amp; Body Works, but they get expensive--and I don&#x27;t know what is in them.  I pour this castile soap into recycled pump containers and add a few drops of my favorite essential oils and I get a great smelling soap.  It lasts a lot longer than the B&amp;BW containers too.  Highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I love how I can actually pronounce and know what the ingredients are in this product, as well as how the ingredients are organic, fair trade, and biodegradable. This is a great base for my liquid soaps (hand or body) and various shampoo recipes. Also, this soap is worth the price because it lasts since you don&#x27;t need that much.</li>
            <li> I like it, because even hospital use it, the only thing I don&#x27;t like is after wash, the bottle has soothing white on it, my husband always use vinegar water to rinse the bottles.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s my first time trying anything like this so I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s the product or what, but it&#x27;s very drying to my face and makes my skin feel tight and weird like cheap soap.</li>
            <li> Lid came lose in shipping and carrier left it in the rain w/o plastic.  Replaced without question immediately.  Great for washing your horse&#x27;s legs before applying sweat wraps.  Thank you!</li>
            <li> Great product and works wonderfully in my home-made makeup remover!</li>
            <li> This soap is great.  It ranks so low on the SkinDeep database and one bottle goes a looong way when you put it in a foaming dispenser.  I feel good about using toxin-free baby products.</li>
            <li> I wish I had bothered to try a scented version first because it&#x27;s a little bland (yet has a distinct soapy smell to it). This bottle will last forever though. I use it to wash my face sometimes and it&#x27;s great as a body wash and soap for cleaning the house. I use it for the tub and floors. It is pretty drying on my skin if I use it often enough but it&#x27;s a great product.</li>
            <li> Great soap. I&#x27;ve been using it to wash my hands and even the dishes. It&#x27;s great for the environment too!</li>
            <li> There has been skeptic of Johnson &amp; Johnson, views having fear of the dirty head. I believe that having been dropped on my head here, fostering a fond sense of using soap digging latently until now. Care for the surrounding and yeah baby powder might of done that in the mix, I hope so. |Keeping you informed, Amazon users| Note: Organic might have its edge and neigher patent creater nor catagory, looks good for after searching at first query. I was shunned somewhere for almost getting a baby in the eyes with the baby powder, this is why common soap should not be seen under hemp inclusion. Wounld prefer cucuumber to rosemary in the organic brands.</li>
            <li> Dr Bronners is the best in my opinion</li>
            <li> This has been the base for many homemade cosmetics and has done wonderful with my very dry skin and ezcema. I have enjoyed using it in many different products and love its versatility. I can&#x27;t wait to try other scents.</li>
            <li> Love this soap!  Use it for making many different home products.  This is an excellent price for this as well!</li>
            <li> Works very well to prepare foamy soap!</li>
            <li> Tried to use as a hair shampoo. It is very heavy and weighed my hair down. I do not like this product. I ended up using in my washer along with my regular degerent, as suggested on the internet. I still didn&#x27;t notice anything special about this product.</li>
            <li> Unscented liquid castile soap I bought to make my facial cleanser with.  A gentile organic cleanser.  I don&#x27;t feel all dried out after using it.  I also bought it in the almond scent.</li>
            <li> Wow! Is all I can say about this product! I&#x27;ve always heard great things about this but never wanted to try it because of the cost. I decided to give in and try it and I don&#x27;t regret it a bit. I&#x27;m using this for everything now. The coolest thing about this product to me is that its so gentle that I can use it in my recipe to make homemade baby wipes for my son and have had no problems at all no diaper rashes at all, its natural as can be and then I can turn around and use it in a spray bottle in my shower to remove shower scum and mold in my shower and use it to remove rust stains on my silverware and bathroom counter tops. I&#x27;m eager to try out the almond scented one. This stuff is just simply amazing!!!Love it love it!</li>
            <li> This is great Castile soap.  They are not all created equal!  It lathers well and is not drying to the skin.  I use it to make shampoo, body wash, hand soap, car wash, floor cleaner, etc.  I add my own essential oils depending on what product I am making.</li>
            <li> During my youth, my aunt told me about olive oil soap, and taught me how good it is. I have been very satisfied with this liquid version of olive oil soap since I bought my first bottle of it more than two years ago. I recommend it to everyone; especially for use as a body wash.</li>
            <li> Great product. I diluted it for hand soap and cleaning products</li>
            <li> This stuff is great.  I am very sensitive to soap, which can give me an itchy rash. For years I used Basis soap but I finally started to react to it too. I don&#x27;t have any problem with this Dr. Bronner&#x27;s.  I use it both for bathing and shaving.</li>
            <li> This soap is very gentle and I really like it.  I am allergic to just about every soap but this one doesn&#x27;t affect me in negative ways.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only bought a couple of bottles of this castile soap at stores but this one has a slight green tinge. Usually the color is a light yellow but this has a hint of green that makes me wonder if it&#x27;s been sitting in a warehouse forever...</li>
            <li> Used it to make homemade face wash. Excited to experiment with other uses for it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m surprised at home much I love this. There is no smell as all. My son has really bad eczema and this is the soap we use. He&#x27;s never had any problems and it&#x27;s very gentle on hair and skin.</li>
            <li> I really wanted to love this product after reading all the reviews, but after using as a face/body wash with a little tea trea oil for 4 months i recently found that coconut oil highly comedogenic(pore clogging).  So i would not recommend as a face wash for people with sensitvie and acne prone skin.  After about a week of stopping use and switching back to an oil free gentle facewash my skin is much calmer and the really dry and really oily combination is much more even with fewer breakouts (I am still using tea tree oil in a toner form).  I will still try to use the rest of my bottle to make a kitchen and bathroom cleaner, so maybe it will work better for other purposes.  Still love that it is organic and I hope to get rid of the chemical irritants in cleaning products.</li>
            <li> The worst soap ever, the smell of this soap cancel out any strong lotion you apply to your skin an hour after you smell like cheap unsented soap and no lotion. was embarrassing in public.</li>
            <li> I like to use it since it does not have any chemicals, the smell is not so nice but you could add any essential oils to your liking</li>
            <li> Perfect for sensitive skin and babies, Bronners never disappoints.</li>
            <li> I originally bought this as part of an ingredient list for hair shampoo. Upon receiving it, I realized all the ingredients were already in this soap-no need to add anything. It lathers great, using very little of it, and cleans without all the added &#x27;stuff&#x27; other shampoos have in their bottles. It leaves hair nice and mild, though using hair conditioner with it is highly recommended for extra smoothness.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff.  I&#x27;ve been hemming and hawwing about which soap to get and finally landed on this one.  Go for it.  Don&#x27;t hold back.  Bronner knows his stuff.</li>
            <li> We have been using this, at the recommendation of our pediatrician, to wash bottles in.  We soak them in this with some hot while for a while and then use a microwave steamer.  I have occasionally had trouble getting the 32oz size, but it has always come quickly from the various sellers.</li>
            <li> When we received, it had leaked all through the packaging, what a mess! Not sure if the lid was not on tight or what. But it was icky!</li>
            <li> I love how this soap can be used in so any products</li>
            <li> i&#x27;m goin broke using this stuff but too bad i need it.</li>
            <li> What is withthe hype of this stuff. It is definitely not unscented. Has a gross smell that follows you around and make skin dry. Waste</li>
            <li> This is my first time ever trying Br Bronner Castile soap and I am in love! I have used it in so many different things and you can hardly tell any is missing out of the bottle! Love Love Love it!</li>
            <li> Great for making shampoo and body wash!</li>
            <li> My toddler is an itchy mess all winter long and we have struggled to find the right soap and creams - we love this for her bath time. It has helped to reduce her eczema flare ups.  We have also started using it on our newborn son.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff, its natural, scent free (I got the unscented, baby mild version) and clean. I got it to use on backpacking trips but ended up using it as my everyday shower soap! I got a little travel bottle to decant into and that bottle (3oz travel size) typically lasts about a month!  Fantastic price too.</li>
            <li> I use this as my babe&#x27;s diaper wipe solution and for her bath. It&#x27;s great and have never had a problem with it. It really doesn&#x27;t suds at all, but we have hard water so that may be part of it. It does leave a very slight residue but again it may be from our hard water.</li>
            <li> I got this to use (diluted) as a fruit and vegetable wash.  It is great for that, costs less then the store bought F &amp; V wash, and has absolutely no odor.  I have no idea how well it really does for this purpose, but I never knew that with the standard store brand F &amp; V wash either.</li>
            <li> I know maybe to make it tear free it takes chemicals. But when it does go in my poor daughters eye it is a horrible experience.</li>
            <li> Works great without asl the extra chemicals</li>
            <li> Dr. Bonners&#x27;s Castile soaps are top quality.  I love the baby mild because I can use it in eye cleanser creams and it does not sting your eyes.  This product is so versatile. From cleaners to face care and everywhere in between.  I make all my cleaning products and facial care products along with insecticides and repellents!  This is a MUST have for your DIY cabinet!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend this product for ALL, from DIY to caring for a baby!  Safe, natural and earth friendly!</li>
            <li> This is the greatest alternative to shower gels and bar soaps! I dilute about 1/3 with water and use with a foaming soap pump. Since this one is unscented, you can add a few drops of essential oil for fragrance :)</li>
            <li> Its too expensive to use as dish soap so I use this for hand soap.&lt;br /&gt;For body, I use Dr. Bronner&#x27;s eucalyptus soap bar as its more cost efficient.&lt;br /&gt;I wish they could sell cheeper...</li>
            <li> I wish it wasn&#x27;t so expensive but I love this product. I buy the baby unscented because I used the peppermint kind and it burned my lady parts.</li>
            <li> I use this soap to clean pretty much anything.  My favorite way to use it is in the laundry.  I have a 4 month old and instead of buying baby laundry soap I water this down in empty bottles, half soap and half water.  All it takes in a squirt in the wash and everything comes out wonderfully clean.  Not just baby clothes but also stinky, dirty man clothes too! (hubby works in costruction) We live in an apt and use HE washers so a little goes a long way. Buy this stuff...you will love it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update:  NEW use!! It is awesome to clean soap scum on fiberglass tubs.  Use it whole strength and a dish scrubby sponge and POOF it&#x27;s off! Fantastic!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*Note~ People have been posting how this product is not unscented.  For a product to be labled unscented it can&#x27;t have any added fragrances.  It does however have a smell. What you are smelling are the cleaning ingredients. Unfortunately to have no smell it would have to be just plain water ;)</li>
            <li> great for filling soap dispensers for kitchen or bath</li>
            <li> I bought to make my own cleaning products and really like.  But I was just grocery shopping and noticed the same size bottle at Publix for $12.99</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this soap many times. I&#x27;ve used it in recipes for homemade hand soap, and also used it during bath time for my kids. Very mild but effective!</li>
            <li> Love how many different things can be made with this soap and of course the quality!</li>
            <li> I love this stuff! It only takes a little bit. I wish it were tear free but its better than regular shampoo</li>
            <li> after getting a body piercing as a teenager, i followed the piercers instructions and used dial soap with very poor results. that&#x27;s not recommended nowadays, but this was the 90s. i decided to do an internet search and found a piercing shop&#x27;s website that recommended dr. bronner&#x27;s baby castile. i figured, why not give it a shot. let me tell you, this is far superior to the harshness of dial. over the years, i&#x27;ve recommended it to all of my body modded friends. i also have sensitive skin when it comes to laundry detergents and body washes. (but not metal, thank god) i get rashes and my navel piercing, even healed, definitely does NOT react well to scented body washes. with years of usage and by adding unscented lubriderm into the mix, i have always had soft, healthy skin. i cannot recommend this soap enough.</li>
            <li> This stuff has changed my cleaning and bathing routine! I personally use the Natural/Unscented kind, only because my skin is very sensitive. Really sensitive. I mean, crazy-absurd sensitive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use Dr. Bronner&#x27;s Castile Soaps as laundry soap, body wash, and hand soap in my home. I found all of the recipes for what I personally use at a blog called My Merry Messy Life (search for it - highly recommended). I absolutely love using this product for all three reasons - none of them being my favorite because they&#x27;re all tied.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And I&#x27;ve never, ever made my own \\&quot;anything\\&quot; before.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve always bought regular cleaners, \\&quot;free and clear\\&quot; detergents, and sensitive skin body wash (which never worked well). I&#x27;ve known of Dr. Bronner&#x27;s for a long time, but I just assumed that Castile Soap would be too drying for any of my applications. Silly of me. I&#x27;ve wasted a lot of money over the years on products that never worked well. The amount of money I could have saved!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here&#x27;s the recipes that I have found success with. Again, credit goes to My Merry Messy Life - search for her site for a plethora of comments and suggestions on how to make these recipes your own.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;DR.

            <li> I use this stuff for everything it seems like! You can get Dr. Bronner&#x27;s at many different places, but Amazon seems to be the way to go if you want to pay less!</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for more than 3 years. I originally started using it as a facial cleanser; however, now I am also using it as a body wash and shampoo (occasionally). The product can be used for many other purposes which I am open to try.&lt;br /&gt;1- Facial Cleanser: I would recommend Peppermint versus Lavender &amp; Baby-Mild  (ones I have tried)  for oily face with large pores and adult acne.&lt;br /&gt;2- Body Wash: I would recommend Baby-Mild versus Lavender &amp; Peppermint (ones I have tried) as body wash, since I find them more drying. However, I love the feel and smell of peppermint specially in summer as a body wash.&lt;br /&gt;3- Shampoo: I would recommend Baby-Mild versus Lavender &amp; Peppermint (ones I have tried) for curly/dry hair. I would recommend adding coconut milk/olive oil to the soap if you intend to use it as a shampoo.</li>
            <li> Purchased this item and after 1 use, removed my infant daughters stubborn cradle cap. Would highly recommend and rate this item.</li>
            <li> I got this for my gentle skinned babies! It&#x27;s wonderful and easy on the skin! I love how inexpensive it is, too! Great buy and wonderful for kiddos with skin issues.</li>
            <li> If you want a plain, mild liquid soap, this is wonderful.  It creates a rich lather.  It&#x27;s also great for those who like to craft their own bath products.  Since it IS plain, you can add fragrances, essential oils, and other fun items to create a unique soap.</li>
            <li> I have eczema. My skin gets very dry and its sensitive. This soap doea not dry out my skin or irritate my skin. It is good for making a natural shampoo. I am african american with non relaxed hair and this works great as a shampoo alternative (mixed with olive oil and a little honey).</li>
            <li> My family&#x27;s skin feels so soft after using this soap. I love love love that don&#x27;t have to worry about weird chemicals being on me or my children&#x27;s skin!! This is a great company/product, I am a customer for life!!</li>
            <li> I mix a few ozs of this soap with a few ozs of neem oil in a miracle grow sprayer. If I have honeydew grit on the leaves, I rinse the next day using a high pressure setting. Leaves rinse practically clean. Both products are nature and organic so the birds and beneficial insects like bees and worms aren&#x27;t disturbed. Just kills the parasites living on the roses, trees,and bushes. It&#x27;s a good feeling not have to worry about wildlife, or my pets.</li>
            <li> I love this soap! I use it as a base in all of my homemade soaps and body washes. Castile soap is very thin so you will probably want to get a thickener for it.</li>
            <li> This soap is amazing. It is unscented, so perfect for a variety of uses. Dr. bronners is Eco friendly and wonderful for your skin. No chemicals whatsoever, I purchased this soap and made bubble bath for my children as well as foaming pump soaps for the kitchen and bathrooms. Everything turned out awesome. Love this product. :)</li>
            <li> A versatile soap I use in shampoos and for cleaning. Non toxic which is my new life style. Will order over and over and have been telling anyone who would stand still long enough to hear it, to buy it!</li>
            <li> Perfect for almost everything!</li>
            <li> Good laundry product, tho more expensive than in the stores.</li>
            <li> I use this to make my own baby shampoo/wash as well as household cleaners.  I love that it&#x27;s all natural without the harsh chemicals that other shampoos/cleaners/washes have.</li>
            <li> I use this soap for my shampoo, for my laundry detergent , my body wash , for mopping the floors, even my hand soap! And this baby soap , i use it especially for giving my dogs a bath ! It lathers very well and makes them smell just like a baby would! But even then  there are infinite numbers of things this soap can be used for which make it even better than amazing! I will continue to support Dr. Bronners until the day i die and mark my words! For so many organic oils all combined together to create a universal soap , where exactly can you go wrong? Even if you think its so expensive, its really not considering that you have to dilute it with water for just about everything you use it for! If you don&#x27;t dilute the soap it can possibly have serious chemical reactions which is dangerous! So dont forget to dillute , and once you see that when you dilute it , you end up with just as much soap as you would with any normal chemical soap , and what do you know , its organic ;)</li>
            <li> Love Dr. Bronner&#x27;s stuff!  Our family is phasing out chemicals and toxins in our home, so this is a perfect alternative to regular shampoo and body wash.  No parabens, sulfates, chemicals etc.  My 1.5 year old son has bad eczema and this soap works great for him.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been suffering with some weird skin conditions for the past 3 years now. Random acne (mostly back),hand eczema,little bumps all over my upper arms and more recently folliculitus on my torso. At first,I thought I was allergic to a food or maybe there was something more serious internally that was causing my skin to freak out. I spent an easy 200 dollars on soaps,lotions and anything I can find that would donate to helping my skin issues..nothing worked. I heard about this from a wonderful hippie friend of mine and decided to give it a shot because I loved the ingredients. Let&#x27;s just say over the past 3 weeks EVERYTHING has cleared up. No more oily face,my back acne I suffered with for years is 95% gone,I never get tiny white heads anymore,arm bumps,hand eczema &#x3D; gone. No more itching and my skin finally feels normal again. It was obviously something in synthetic soap and body washes that my skin didn&#x27;t agree with. I highly recommend this to anyone with ANY kind of skin condition. It&#x27;s very concentrated so this bottle will last you for months.  Just buy this and throw all other fancy soaps in the trash. I wish I can give this 100 stars because it saved me a lot of money and stress.</li>
            <li> I used this as a base for homemade shampoo and it worked like a dream. A lot easier than trying to make liquid Castile soap from hardened bars. Everything in it is natural. It was worth every penny I paid for it.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know how I made it through the first four decades of my life without Dr. Bronner&#x27;s Castile soap!! I make my own foaming hand soap - 1 part castile soap, 7 parts H20 (I use filtered water, others have recommended distilled water), and essential oils - I use 5-10 drops of Tea Tree and anything else I want - my favorites are sandalwood, patchouli, and sage.</li>
            <li> This product is great, however I should have known WholeFoods sells it for $11.99 for same size (32oz.) and I bought this from amazon for almost $17! I&#x27;m so glad I had only purchasedone online before I found it at Wholefoods.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll never go back to any other soaps after using this, you can use this for shampoo also (I do).</li>
            <li> We bought this to make our own soap and it has been working great.  We are saving a lot of money not having to buy soap from stores and by making it ourselves we can dilute it properly to make it last even longer.</li>
            <li> Good to use with essential oils.  Very gentle.</li>
            <li> I use this to make my own household cleaners. It is great for a window cleaner mixed with vinegar and water. My windows have never been so clean!</li>
            <li> I love this stuff....I make a lot of my own body washes and hand soaps and use this and other oils. It works great. I have heard that some people use it to wash their hair....but I don&#x27;t. I wash my hair with aloe vera and coconut milk. Rinse with vinegar and water.</li>
            <li> I purchased Dr. Bronners as an ingredient to make my own baby wipes and it works wonderfully! I&#x27;m happy to be wiping my son&#x27;s bum with something so clean and free of chemicals!</li>
            <li> I found this at my local health food store for less than $11. It is no doubt an awesome product, but you can find it cheaper!</li>
            <li> On time and product was packed tightly with peanuts for safe shipping. Bottle was huge and will last a very long time-- was actually full of soap and not half air. Good deal for the money. Hope this works with dermatitis.</li>
            <li> Dr. Bronners always lives up to its reputation. Great value, Great soap, Can easily add scent of preference with essential oils or fragrance oils.</li>
            <li> Great all natural product, but too drying for my sensitive baby&#x27;s eczema&lt;br /&gt;prone skin. You can add a few drops of oil to the mix to even it out, but&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d really prefer a product that comes ready to roll!</li>
            <li> This soap suds up really great. A tiny bit goes a long way! it can be diluted at different ratios for lots of different purposes or used full strength to take care of a really robust cleaning task.</li>
            <li> I use this soap for many different things. It is a wonderful product for sensitive skin! I will be reordering when I run out!</li>
            <li> I like the quality of the ingredients, but not sure how I&#x27;m going to use this product.  It does not mix well for my general housecleaner recipe, not sure why.  The oils in this product make it bad for dishes and glass cleaner. I don&#x27;t like it for shampoo, so now I don&#x27;t know what I&#x27;m going to do with it.  I prefer EarthsBest chamomile soap for the shower.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff - it doesn&#x27;t hurt my daughter&#x27;s eyes and smells wonderful. You can really tell the difference in this organic soap compared to the chemical soaps.</li>
            <li> I love this soap. So many uses.</li>
            <li> Love it for everything!</li>
            <li> What can I say, I love Dr. Bronners.  You can use this stuff on everything.  I love the baby version - there is literally no smell what so ever. I was expecting baby scented, nope nothing.  I only use this as soap for the baby so I cannot review it&#x27;s ability to clean everything but it&#x27;s Dr. Bronners you cannot really go wrong</li>
            <li> Neither my husband nor I are babies, nor do we have children in the house. This soap is great for anyone with sensitive skin, and a few drops in water works wonders on linoleum or vinyl flooring.</li>
            <li> Wonderful soap great for body and shampoo, super mild, just leaves you fresh and clean with out a ton of fragrance.</li>
            <li> Scent free and makes great foaming soap for handwash, bodywash and cleaners.</li>
            <li> I started making organic shampoo and body wash with this product,along with a few other ingredients. I&#x27;m amazed at just how good it really is,and how much better my skin looks and feels,but you have to see for yourself.5 stars all the way! Will be back for more...</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s always too liquid, but I mix it with another Dr. Bronner&#x27;s soap that is more expensive.</li>
            <li> Good stuff and it doesn&#x27;t take a huge amount for adequate sudsing and washing.  Rinses off well.  Would definitely recommend.</li>
            <li> This is great mixed with baking soda to get at hard to clean things like stovetops and counters. I rarely need to use products other than, this soap, baking soda, or vinegar and love not having any chemicals around my baby.</li>
            <li> Love castile soaps.  Does not dry out your skin like traditional soaps.  I use it in my long hair too.  I just have to use a cr&amp;egrave;me rinse so my hair doesn&#x27;t feel too oily and tangled.  If I use a rinse, my hair turns out shiny and nice!!</li>
            <li> This is the The only soap we use for baby since birth. Organic, mild, fragrance-free. A few drops go a long way at bath time on a baby wash cloth and we use it for body and hair. It&#x27;s not tear-free (which just means they add an analgesic to the baby soap). We also use this in a foaming soap dispenser for hand and toy washing. A big bottle lasts sooooo long. Great buy!</li>
            <li> I use this with lavender oil, tree tree oil, and olive oil with my cloth wipes. It&#x27;s amazing and my baby loves it on his sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I love this soap and buy this type because it&#x27;s unscented and you can use it in any DIY recipes that include a scent of its own. Am never without this product. Amazon has it at a good price.</li>
            <li> great buy and helps make awesome homemade baby wipes!</li>
            <li> Product as described, am using it to make my own laundry detergent, shower gel, and hand soap.  Will buy this product (and use this seller) again.</li>
            <li> The soap works great, but you really have to dig in order to find out how to use it because the label is absolutely 100% unhelpful. Makes me mad that they filled up every inch of space on the label to tell us about some weird religion. Totally useless label. Might as well have left it blank. Sheesh. I rated this item with 4 stars instead of 5 because of the stupid label. Copy and paste this link into your search bar for helpful tips on diluting and uses:&lt;br /&gt;[...]</li>
            <li> This is the second organic soap I&#x27;ve tried and I have to say I am pleased.  It requires very little soap to wash from head to toe, making me feel clean and refreshed, without the usual chemical and residues weighing on my skin.  This bottle will last a long time.</li>
            <li> I love Dr. Bronners, I use it to make body wash and face wash. Don&#x27;t be put off my the weird religious rantings all over the label. This is a throwback to the original Dr. Bronner</li>
            <li> I am using this as baby wash and also in my cloth wipes solution. I love the fact that it is natural without any chemicals in it and it works really well although I don&#x27;t really like the smell of it but I it doesn&#x27;t bother me either. On babys skin you can&#x27;t feel it. I definitely recomend this if you don&#x27;t want to use any chemicals on your baby&#x27;s skin</li>
            <li> I use this soap for making household cleaners and also baby wipes. A little bit goes a long way, and it makes me happy that I&#x27;m not putting chemicals all over the things my little kids use. Glad I bought it.</li>
            <li> Dr. B is the B O M B!</li>
            <li> Good size for the price.</li>
            <li> Cleans so well. Sensitive skin reacts well to it. I use it on my niece and nephew to keep them clean with out hurting them.</li>
            <li> Lathers richly, and no fragrance. Perfect for sensitive skin!</li>
            <li> Great for DIY skin care products</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve read review after review that says this stuff is amazing for drealocks, so I bought a giant bottle of it. I am diluting it with 20% soap, 80% water to use for shampoo. Well with how hard our water is here in Phoenix, it&#x27;s made my hair incredibly waxy. It doesn&#x27;t wash out! I have read 5% soap and 95% water is what you need to shoot for. And it&#x27;s been suggested to add vinegar to the mix to compensate for the hard water, but I don&#x27;t want my hair smelling like vinegar.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll probably use the rest of it for hand soap but it took a few shampoos of regular shampoo to get this junk out of my hair.</li>
            <li> Awesome stuff ... I use it for so many things ... The only thing I wish I did was get a scented kind :-)</li>
            <li> This is a gentle, thorough soap. I have extremely sensitive skin - the smallest amount of irritation will make my face look like a bad sunburn. This works wonders in cleaning my skin thoroughly of all traces of makeup without inflaming my skin. I use DHC Olive Oil to dissolve my makeup. I then wash my face with this soap and a puff (a sponge that is covered with a smooth cloth) --- even in a 10X mirror, I do not see any traces of makeup.</li>
            <li> Was exactly what I ordered and could not find any where else</li>
            <li> I have recently started making some of my own shampoo and cleaning supplies.  This is all you need.  Well almost.</li>
            <li> This stuff lasts forever. I&#x27;ve had 1 bottle for close to 5 months now, and its still going strong. There is no fake fragrance. It is simply a mild soap. It leaves my hair with a clean (but not a &#x27;stripped of oil&#x27;) feel. A little of the water-like soap goes a real long way. It lathers up incredibly well.This stuff is my shampoo of choice.</li>
            <li> I make homeade body wash and this worked perfectly to add to my recipes.  Good lather and mild on the most sensative skin.</li>
            <li> I bought this to make a homemade shampoo (1 C. Castile, 1tbsp. Tea tree essential oil, 2tbsp. Apple cider vinegar, 1/4 C.water). I wasn&#x27;t sure it would work but it did! I&#x27;m now using it as a face and body wash, too. It eliminates dandruff, allergic reactions, acne, etc. I didn&#x27;t realize how much of an allergic reaction I was having to the soaps and shampoos I&#x27;ve tried until I used this. On top of it, I only have to condition my hair (very long and lots of it) every week or two, now.</li>
            <li> I have been using Bronner&#x27;s Liquid Soap for over 30 years and it is quite true that I am never without it. I use it as a shampoo, also. This is the best and purest soap I know of and my years spent with it is a testimony of it&#x27;s quality. I have also used it for many years to bathe my cats as it leaves no residue whatsoever and that is quite tricky with animal fur. It also rinses very quickly and leaves both hair and fur totally clean. This soap is extremely mild but can even be used to wash dishes or clothes. Best of all, since it has no chemicals, it does not cause reactions. Great for washing diapers, as well. Recommend it most highly and always have.</li>
            <li> I adore this soap. I use it not only to wash my hands and body, but even my face. I spent year trying different acne scrubs and face washes full of chemicals to reduce the oil that built up on my face. It seems counterintuitive to use a soap made from oils to remove oil from my skin but it works like a charm and my skin is more clear and vibrant than ever and no longer gets oily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also love Dr Bronners for use on a new tattoo or piercing. The baby mild is gentle and moisturizing to these &amp;#34;wounds.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I clean up messes in my house with this soap as well, works well on counters, sinks, stove, etc. with a small dab on a wet paper towel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Can&#x27;t go wrong!</li>
            <li> I use this product to make my own dishwashing detergent (along with lemon juice, water, and vinegar) in order to use less chemicals in our home and make it a safer place for our children.  This soap rinses away cleanly and works well for us.  I would recommend the soap, but only give 4 stars since it can be purchased for less from WholeFoods (if you have one nearby).  If the price were lower I would give it 5 stars.</li>
            <li> Love it has so many uses!</li>
            <li> I searched long and hard for a true organic shampoo for my family to use. There are not many brands out there that are truly pure like this one. I was weary at first because this is a type of soap that has like 18 or more uses so I did not know if it would make an ideal shampoo but turns out it&#x27;s wonderful!! I have long, straight, thin hair that is not to oily, about in the middle and this makes my hair sooo soft and shiny!! I plan on using this soap for a long time and I&#x27;m going to try and buy some for my mom since she has cancer and needs to stay away from putting harsh chemicals on her body as much as possible. Also a big plus was everything about God on the label. Being a Christian family it really makes me like the product even more! God bless Dr. Bronner and his family for this product!! I also bought the peppermint and hemp bar soap and it is wonderful too! Makes my skin really soft and I love the smell! So happy I found this product.</li>
            <li> Love this. Use it homemade products and a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> Was looking for something scentless, natural, non-irritating and this fit the bill, I use it as shower soap, a little goes a long way</li>
            <li> Shipping was fast. This is the best face wash I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li> aside from all the preachy new age junk written on the bottle, its a good product.</li>
            <li> Works really well in my liquid soaps. I love this product. About time to order more.</li>
            <li> I LOVE THIS STUFF!  I use it for everything including cleaning dishes, counters, toilets and all kinds of things around the house!  It&#x27;s nice and gentle to use in my kid&#x27;s bath routine and I can use it to make all kind of crafts like homemade wipes.  Love love LOVE this stuff.  Great price, shipped fast with no problems.</li>
            <li> Gentle and wonderful. I used it in all my homemade cleansers.</li>
            <li> I use this soap to make my own foaming hand soap. Fill the foam dispenser 3/4 full with water top off with a tablespoon or so of soap. Voila! Save tons of money and it&#x27;s not drying because there&#x27;s no alcohol etc. One bottle lasts our family of three for at least a year!</li>
            <li> i love this product my skin feels much better after i started to use this product and this product has encouraged me to try other products from the dr bronner&#x27;s brand</li>
            <li> Fast shipping ! Items as described.</li>
            <li> This stuff works great on absolutely everything.  My boys have sensitive skin so I use this to make our laundry detergent, body wash, and so much more.</li>
            <li> after a lot of research finally got this body wash and its great, just love the way it smells and cleans my baby</li>
            <li> This is the worst product I have ever bought for my skin and it&#x27;s not really pure castile soap! True castile uses mostly olive oil with water(it&#x27;s 4th on the list of ingredients in this product) but, the main ingredient, besides water, is coconut oil. To top it off, there are stars next to some ingredients such as olive oil, that state \\&quot;None remains after saponifying oils into soap and glycerin,\\&quot; so it&#x27;s not even a castile soap. You are left with water, hemp oil, jojoba oil, citric acid and tocopherol. This site, [...], sells pure castile soap with just olive oil and water, which is what pure castile soap is so I might try that. I have sensitive skin that&#x27;s on the dry side and this dried my skin out so bad and made it itchy and red. This soap was worse for me than other store soaps that are scented and full of harsh ingredients. It must have been the citric acid.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I was looking for!  Makes excellent hand soap!</li>
            <li> I use it as part of my homemade wipes formula.</li>
            <li> A great product for those who do not like the stronger scented items from the Dr.</li>
            <li> I never received this product.  I wrote to the retailer with no response.  I will never purchase from this company again.</li>
            <li> This is the very very best body wash, shampoo, tooth cleaner....anything you would use a sopa for, use this...great company!! use for babies, kids, none of that hormone disrupter junk in it...just pure stuff</li>
            <li> I purchased this item after reading several homemade recipes for Baby wash. I thought that this would be 100% castile liquid soap. It was not, this product is already diluted with a variety of plant oils so I used it as is. I&#x27;d like a thicker &amp; less watery product. On the up side- it appears to be a gentle cleanser &amp; baby&#x27;s hair is soft. As a side note- the label has a lot of strange rant like writing all over it.</li>
            <li> I ordered this as a hair and body wash for my 1 year old, which it works great for! The first time I used it (1T or so on a wet rag) it dried his skin out a little, so I diluted it in a sports water bottle for the next time and had great results. The only thing I dont like about it is it doesn&#x27;t have that \\&quot;baby smell\\&quot; that Johnsons has, but nothing healthy is going to, thats a fragrance that is not good for their skin, so I didn&#x27;t deduct for that. And his hair was kinda unruly the next day, possibly from this? I haven&#x27;t cleaned with it or bathed myself with it, as I use the peppermint scented soap for me, and I give it a 5 star rating (but 1 star as a shampoo!!) Maybe this would work better since its unscented, I might try it one day.</li>
            <li> Not sure if it is because we have hard water or what, but this stuff feels like I am just putting sticky waxy stuff on top of the dirt. My hair was so gummy I couldn&#x27;t even brush though it and I washed it out thoroughly. In fact, I got back in the shower and rinsed it out again thinking I left some in, but it was the same after rinsing it again. It took a few washings with another shampoo to get it out. It leaves skin feeling sticky and itchy too.</li>
            <li> Great product. Will definitely buy again!!</li>
            <li> I bought this to start making my daugthers bath soap. I think it&#x27;s a wonderful product and a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> Love this soap.  I use it to make my own shampoo and since it is milder and has no scent, it really works out well.  Just remember to add water or whatever to it, do not not use straight.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t clean the leaves of our citrus as quickly and thoroughly as U-Tube video said it would</li>
            <li> Very nice pure soap. Used in homemade foaming soap. Just add fractionated coconut oil and some scent and water and you have a very mild hand soap. Great for winter less drying of hands because there are no harsh chemicals.</li>
            <li> i was looking for a natural shampoo with no smell and as long as the advertising is true re natural ingredients then this will work for me. i plan to add it to other things for usage later like aloe from plants i grow myself.  its also quite concentrated as 5 or 6 drops create loads of sudsy bubbles.  it does seem to strip a bit so you might have to add something to it if you&#x27;re using it on hair or dry skin.</li>
            <li> This is my avorite soap for my baby. It cleans well, doesn&#x27;t bother his very sensitive skin, and doesn&#x27;t dry his skin out.</li>
            <li> I have used this diluted on very dirty children. Great results! I use this soap in my all purpose cleaning solution as well. It works well. No streaking or funky smells.</li>
            <li> This soap is great for use in the backcountry while backpacking especially the unscented version when in bear country.  It is biodegradable which is good for helping to preserve the backwoods.  A little goes a LONG way.  That means you don&#x27;t need to take much at all along with you in your pack.  Even for a group, a couple ounces ought to last a week or more.  You need literally just a couple if drops when you need soap for something.  It suds up easily and washes off easily so you don&#x27;t need a lot of water either.  Great product  for nature.</li>
            <li> When I don&#x27;t have time to make my own soap, Dr. Bronner&#x27;s is the next best thing.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried LOTS of different soaps and body washes over the years to combat severely dry skin. Some have smelled really nice but dried my skin, and one left me feeling moisturized but not clean. Dr. Bonner&#x27;s is nearly perfect. It doesn&#x27;t dry my skin at all and leaves me feeling clean. It also works very well as a shampoo for my dog with hyper-sensitive skin. Plus it&#x27;s natural and cruelty free.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The scent is a bit odd, as is the writing all over the bottle. But those are the only shortcomings I&#x27;ve found, so I&#x27;m sticking with it :^)</li>
            <li> I use this to make my own foaming hand soap by mixing a quarter of the Castile liquid soap to 3/4 water in a foaming dispenser. It&#x27;s not drying the way so many other hand soaps are. I also use it to make a gentle face cleaner by doing something similar with the addition of 1/2 tsp baking soda. It&#x27;s gentle enough to use on my eyelash extensions.</li>
            <li> I use this to make bodywork, cleaning products, ect.  It works great.</li>
            <li> No sent, great suds but it leaves a little film behind and I don&#x27;t like that</li>
            <li> This soap is awesome! A tiny bit foams up nicely to clean while in the shower. It doesnt create any bubbles if used in the tub but it softens the water and you get our felling clean. This size will last forever and it is now my chosen soap for my whole family. This is safe and a better choice than other soaps with all of the additional chemicals.</li>
            <li> good stuff, but leaves a soap scum on everything. not good for hair- turns it to straw</li>
            <li> I never tried this before. I was not disappointed.  I use this for my homemade shampoo and body wash.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never used Dr. Bronner&#x27;s Liquid Soap before, so I never knew what the consistency should be when I opened my bottle. It turned out that it shouldn&#x27;t be runny like water, but thick. Maybe the soap now comes pre-watered down? The product itself works well. I used it to kill ants, but have found it works well as a dish soap and cleaner. Will continue to use, but disappointed to find out it&#x27;s not the correct dilution. I&#x27;m not sure if the fault lies with the manufacturer or the company I purchased it from, but I purchased it from Hi-Tech Products (not sure why I&#x27;m buying soap from somewhere called &amp;#34;Hi-Tech&amp;#34;)</li>
            <li> I love Dr. Bronner&#x27;s Castile soap, especially the liquid (organic) type. I&#x27;ve been using Dr. Bronner&#x27;s for years and feel it is the best Castile soap out there,  I like the peppermint that is most popular, but the rose and this mild type are both keepers!  You might be buying 32 ounces here but since you mix it with water, you&#x27;re actually getting 64 ounces - great bargain and wonderful soap.  It doesn&#x27;t dry your skin out, either.  It is so mild that you can make hair shampoo out of it.</li>
            <li> I was looking for an unscented soap and this is it! A wonderful product that works very well made by an ethical company.</li>
            <li> Love using this in diluted form for hand washing in the winter when my hands get so dry.  I put it in a used foam soap type dispenser.  Gets the same effect.</li>
            <li> I really love this Item. am also please with the quality of it.&lt;br /&gt;the price is also right. thank you.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure this works as well as the traditional peppermint Bronners, but it seems lacking. It is amazingly mild, so those with sensitivities would do well to try this out. Personally I am too used to the strong peppermint soap.</li>
            <li> And tactile feeling after using this soap. I use it especially on silicon body implements when I want to clean something but don&#x27;t want it to erode from the cleaning solution that I am using.</li>
            <li> This soap has many uses and is very gentle. I love love this soap and it does not dry out my skin.</li>
            <li> Excellent natural soap... But the product label &amp;#34;sucks.&amp;#34; Label font is too small to read creating great difficulty in finding/reading product information. My concern about this concentrated liquid soap product was, the recommended &amp;#34;dilution ratio&amp;#34; of soap to water. After spending 15min reading this entire (ridiculous) label, all that that was stated was &amp;#34;Delute&amp;#34; and so I conducted my own tests finding a satisfactory dilution ratio. The entire label is covered with inappropriate and (irrelevant to the product) religious messages. Without a doubt, the most ridiculous product label I&#x27;ve ever seen, and not consumer friendly.</li>
            <li> What can you say about pure soap? It doesn&#x27;t leave a sticky film on my skin like most soaps,,it lathers well, and has a very pleasant scent that lasts all day, I will never use conventional soap again.</li>
            <li> I like Mea. Meyers better.  Bronners Leaves residue in my sink</li>
            <li> If you need a good mild soap for shampoo, for babies, etc. this is great. Dilute by half and add a few drops of Castor oil and it is a great shampoo.</li>
            <li> I love this product! I use it as a body wash and a household cleaner and it&#x27;s awesome!</li>
            <li> I used to use purity and it was so expensive.  I read on a message board to try this, and it works and removes makeup very well.  I have very sensitive skin and this did not break me out at all.  It is good to bath with as well and it gets you CLEAN and it is not drying to the skin.  THere is no smell at all.  I have also used this to wash clothes.  THIS PRODUCT is the best.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m looking to eliminate as many chemicals as possible around my family. This soap is great and can be used in/for just about everything!</li>
            <li> I bought this product for my psoriasis because some of the reviews said it helps. I have not seen a change in condition.</li>
            <li> I used this to make a foaming &amp;#34;all purpose wash&amp;#34; and I am very pleased.&lt;br /&gt;It is used as a hand soap, body and hair wash for my 21 month old son.&lt;br /&gt;Just used an old foaming hand soap dispenser.&lt;br /&gt;It works wonderfully, gets you clean without being drying to the skin.</li>
            <li> Super gentle, all natural and the best soap you can treat your body too. Organic and free of nasty chemicals you will find in most commercial soaps. If you haven&#x27;t tried Dr.Bronners and you or your children have skin issues... TRY IT!</li>
            <li> I really like how nontoxic and natural Dr. Bronner&#x27;s is. I currently am using it for hand soap with a few drops of lavender oil, and I can tell it isn&#x27;t regular soap because instead of leaving your hands soft and slippery, it leave them more squeaky and dry. I suppose I need to add glycerin to it as well to be softer. I use it with peppermint oil and water to clean counter tops, which has been very successful. As for using it for a baby soap, I&#x27;m not sure that I would straight from the bottle for fear of drying out my baby. I guess that&#x27;s what baby oil is for.</li>
            <li> I like this, it suds up without the chemicals added.  Mild on the skin and no smell or fragrance.  Great organic product.</li>
            <li> Old product is new again.  Mix this with an essential oil, fill a foaming hand soap container and now I have a healthy moisturizing antibacterial hand cream with no harmful chemicals.  The foaming hand soap container helps make the soap last longer, not as much wasted soap and ecomnomical to use.</li>
            <li> This soap is fantastic.  I use it for my daughters and it is so very gentle on their skin.  The unscented kind is even more gentle.</li>
            <li> I use this on my baby and my 3 y/o daughter. It smells soooooo good. Basically like a baby. I always have it on hand.</li>
            <li> Dr. Bronner&#x27;s liquid soap is the absolute best.  Gentle enough to be an excellent shampoo, strong enough so that only about 4 drops will clean your hands.  I sometimes use the peppermint soam for my armpits because it leaves them smelling great.  I don&#x27;t use it anywhere else on my body, since it will sting sensitive areas.</li>
            <li> I seriously love this stuff. My picky skin couldn&#x27;t be happier.</li>
            <li> Used this to make own foaming hand soap with essental oil.</li>
            <li> I love this. I make my own hand soap and body wash with this.</li>
            <li> I use this hand soap all the time and it last a long time. I does a great job of cleaning your hands and is not full of poison like most soaps today. I highly recommend this product and will use it the rest of my life.</li>
            <li> I love this product and Amazon has the best price!! We use this soap for everything (hand soap, body wash, shampoo, and cleaning). Great multipurpose product with great ingredients!</li>
            <li> There are so many uses for this product plus it is a good feeling to know that it is safe to use. I even use it to brush my teeth!</li>
            <li> This soap is good for so many household needs. If you&#x27;re looking for a chemical free product without chemical causing irritants, this product is for you and I recommend it highly. Just remember a little goes a long way, so dilute it 50/50.</li>
            <li> I use this in everything! Laundry soap, hand soap, skin care, cleaner and I even wash my makeup brushes in it. I love that it has no scent so I can add scent to it when I make my foaming hand soap. I would buy it by the case if I could afford it.</li>
            <li> love it. it can be used for hair, skin, massage, anything!!! i so glad that i purchased it. i use it everyday</li>
            <li> I ordered the baby mild and received rose.. Not happy and unsure who to contact.</li>
            <li> It was just like baby soap but very liquefied. So it spills down your hand. I use it as shampoo so I suggest pouring on your head. It was recommended for shampoo because I have psoriasis and it&#x27;s gentle.  I don&#x27;t think its helping my psoriasis I could have used baby shampoo from the drugstore.</li>
            <li> A safe shampoo for small kids.</li>
            <li> Just a few drops works so well as baby&#x27;s first bath and her skin is so soft and supple. I apply lanolin cream to her skin after the bath. The only thing I don&#x27;t like is that her hair smells a little funny.</li>
            <li> I like this soap for my toddlers. Not a strong smell, lathers very well. My only complaint is that it makes my daughter&#x27;s hair feel kind of tangly when I wash it out. Best for body and on short hair.</li>
            <li> I read that you could use Dr. Bronners in a high efficiency (HE)  washing machine. I have a baby on the way and when I looked at the environmental working group website most baby detergents were graded F! No way did i want that near my baby. So I tried out Dr. Bronners in my HE washer. I had read to use 1/3 to 1/2 cup in a regular washer and half that in an HE so I used 1/4 cup baby mild in a load of my darks. Fantastic results! Totally clean! No white deoderant residue,  no armpit smell,  no discoloration on the white crotch of the underwear. So many laundry detergents that are \\&quot;green \\&quot; really don&#x27;t work very well and the greener they are the less they work. Not this stuff. It gets the best possible rating by EWG and cleaned my clothes as well as regular laundry detergent (but no chemical smell!) I may purchase the lavender scent for my own clothes when I run out of my old detergent but I certainly will use the Baby Mild for all my baby laundry. Plus I did not see suds during the wash (important for HE washers).&lt;br /&gt;I did discover that the 1/4 cup was too much for my HE, in that it did not rinse totally out of the clothes.  I&#x27;ve also tried about 1/8 cup on a load of towels and that seemed to work better (I filled up my regular HE detergent measuring cup to the line designated for an HE wash).  My white towels and socks got clean but I did not notice the \\&quot;stiffness\\&quot; of residue.  So I am going to keep experamenting with the quantity.  Based on my trials, it appears that using the amount of Dr. Bronner&#x27;s that one would normally use with regular HE detergent is the way to go.&lt;br /&gt;I also have been using Dr Bronnr&#x27;s peppermint for hand soap while pregnant. I feel it&#x27;s a little drying on my skin but its nontoxic. So I have kept on. Just recently tried it to handwash dishes and it seemed to work fine.&lt;br /&gt;***UPDATE:  I had noticed that when I was home a lot and not at work (such as on weekends) my hands would get a little red.  I assumed that it was because this soap was really strong and it was so drying.  But I kept using it because EWG gave it such great ratings.  I just kept on putting on hand lotion.&lt;br /&gt;Now, after having done several loads of laundry with it, I have discovered that the slightest bit of residue left on the laundry makes my skin itch like crazy.  And I&#x27;ve tried lowering the amount I use but I still find that it does not fully rinse out (I started using my peppermint to wash just so i could smell whether there was still soap in there).  So clearly I&#x27;m not going to be using this as baby laundry detergent.  I guess I will be using my remainder as dish soap and use my favorite body wash as hand soap till baby is weaned.&lt;br /&gt;I would, however, recommend this as laundry soap for adults if you are not allergic.  It gets the clothes really clean and is much better for the environment than regular laundry detergent.&lt;br /&gt;As for my laundry, I&#x27;m going to go back to using Earth Friendly Products ECOS detergent, which EWG still rated better than a lot of traditional detergents, it gets the clothes clean, it rinses clean, and I can buy it at Costco.s really strong and it was so drying.

            <li> Works just as well as commercial, chemical laden soaps with all natural ingredients. Gentle on skin and has HUNDREDS of uses from laundry soap to shampoo.</li>
            <li> This is my first time using Castile soap and I will probably never go back! It is such a versatile product with so many uses! So far I have: clean dishes, used it as a body wash and a shave gel, a hand soap and a face cleaner. I can&#x27;t wait to try it as a detergent and a floor cleaner .. So many great recipes to be find online for this environmentally (and vegetarian) profit! Also, initially it does seem very pricy, but for also every use, you are diluting it. The only downside would be it does burn your eyes so be careful if you use it on your face and despite what many people say, not good in a DIY shampoo. It coats your hair with an oil consistency and does not come out.. It looked like I did not just wash my hair and have me dandruff. Some people swear by it, and good for you if it works for you, but I am sticking with an organic shampoo. Also, for this particular scent (baby mild aloe) would be it has virtually  no scent (which I think it is not supposed to and you may like that)! Overall, a very good product and I will be repurchasing when I run out (probably in bulk :) ).</li>
            <li> very mild, I use it for body and hair. In the summer time it is very good since you shower a few times a day since it does not dry your skin. It will be my shower gel forever and ever...</li>
            <li> I just had a baby and have been wanting to make my own cleaning supplies and found Castile soap to be a necessity! This was a great price and arrived super fast! I will definitely use these guys in the future! Thanks!!</li>
            <li> I bought this product to make body wash and it does exactly what it is supposed to.  I&#x27;m happy to be using a product that is better for my family.</li>
            <li> This soap continues to be our favorite for our baby. It&#x27;s mild, washes away without leaving residue, and has a good score from Environmental Working Group!</li>
            <li> Use for foaming hand soap here.  I love it!  I also carry it with me in my bag for soap when we are out and about - allergies here so we are unable to use most soaps from other places.</li>
            <li> Up until recently I used to be one of those people who had to buy the antibacterial scented soaps.. Every month or so I would head down to bath and body works and grab a month supply of their foaming hand soaps because... well frankly.. they smell amazing.. until I checked out  a website a friend sent me. The website allowed you to search products and rated them based on their toxicity and explained how dangerous each chemical ingredient in your chosen item was.. (forgive me but I don&#x27;t remember the name of the exact website check google if your interested) Long story short after learning about all the junk that I use in my every day life (consumable goods like soaps, baby washes, cosmetics, shampoos etc etc etc) I started looking into what I could use in my home that I would feel safe giving to my toddler to use daily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;-gentle gentle gentle  (BUT if you use it correctly.. you do need to water this down if your using as a clenser/soap. We use 7/8 parts water and 1/8 part soap for a foaming cleanser)&lt;br /&gt;-doesn&#x27;t stink of perfumes&lt;br /&gt;- a little goes a long way. this 32 oz bottle lasts me 4 months (in a 4 person household)&lt;br /&gt;-you can use it as a detergent, kitchen counter cleaner, soap cleanser, shampoo, body wash etc etc etc&lt;br /&gt;-its certified organic&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;-I wish it had a pour spout. when I&#x27;m putting it into a measuring cap (to ensure accuracy) I feel as though I waste too much product.</li>
            <li> I have tried to find something, anything, to get rid of my babies cradle cap. I used this a few times but it is extremely difficult to keep out of his eyes and it does burn his eyes. It may be good soap but I can&#x27;t keep using it on him. They did not advertise it as being tear free so this is no fault of the company, but I would not advertise it as \\&quot;baby mild\\&quot; either.</li>
            <li> This is the first time I purchased Castile soap after a friend recommended it.  I&#x27;ve used it for about a month to replace both my face wash and regular body wash.  It works really well.  My face has started breaking out less (even though I was washing it twice a day with acne specific wash).  And I feel like when I get out of the shower my skin is a bit dryer than normal (I used to use Dove extra moisture wash), however I&#x27;ve now noticed after a month that throughout the day my skin doesn&#x27;t get as dry and I don&#x27;t need to use as much lotion throughout the day as I was using before.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I got the baby mild soap, because I couldn&#x27;t decide between the smells and I thought I&#x27;d get the most general one to start with, and I&#x27;m happy with my choice.  It really doesn&#x27;t smell like anything, which I prefer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is very liquid-y, I&#x27;m used to using more shower gels / creamy soaps, so that was a bit of a change.  Its really helped to use a loofa, and just a very small amount goes a long way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m very happy I&#x27;ve switched soaps, as (1) it will be much cheaper, since I use less, and I&#x27;ve been using less lotion etc throughout the day (2) I like that its organic and not as harsh on the environment as other soaps (3) although I&#x27;ve only used it for face / body wash, I keep reading about all of the other uses for it, and will probably start using it more often once I run out of other items (dishwashing soap, laundry, etc), so it will be really nice to have to only buy one product and use it for everything.</li>
            <li> The soap is good, but the price I paid is almost twice as much as what my local grocery store charges! I should have done more research!</li>
            <li> My new favorite is the Hemp Almond soap they make but this used to be my favorite. The hemp almond is even milder and I love the smell. Even though this is &amp;#34;baby mild&amp;#34; I have eczema and if I used it too often it would cause an outbreak. So far the hemp almond is better in that regard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway this is great soap for most people and I do recommend it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also recommend Dr. Bronners as a company because they are pro- labeling of GMO&#x27;s and put their money into campaigns to get labeling laws for GMO &amp;#34;food&amp;#34;. They are a company that I wish other companies would imitate. They now make a lot of other products besides soap and their organic coconut oil for example is very good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This soap? It is mild, it smells good and it&#x27;s cheap compared to most other quality soaps.  Buy it. Support Dr. Bronners!</li>
            <li> I am very sensitive to soaps and this is wonderful!  Doesn&#x27;t leave a greasy feeling and bubbles into a great lather.  My little girls wash with it, too.  I also use it to wash my &amp;#34;unmentionables&amp;#34; in the washer on the delicate cycle, as I can&#x27;t tolerate even the fragrance free laundry detergent.  It cleans and works perfectly!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Amazon ALWAYS has it priced lower than I can get it in the store.  Thanks, Amazon!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> Soap works great, I got this because I have a sensitive inflamed scalp. Which is so frustrating... This soap was my attempt to find something &amp;#34;chemical free&amp;#34; and mild. It definitely cleans the hair but you will have to do some conditioning so its not all dried out. Would be great for oily hair and it works well to remove leave-in oil treatments that otherwise make you look like a drowned rat the next day. Didn&#x27;t solve any of my scalp problems but I didn&#x27;t expect miracles, just going for not making it any worse. This size bottle will last you forever. I only use a couple drops of this stuff but I have short hair.</li>
            <li> If you are looking to exit the supermarket with less chemicals and toxic crud, this is a great product.  I have been taking my ways back to the olden days (that rhymes), and making my own shampoo, face wash, etc.  This is a main ingredient.  I appreciate that there are real alternatives to mass produced chemically laden garbage out there.  I also love what this company stands for, I love the labeling and using the label to inform their customers about GMOs.  Awesome.  Well done.</li>
            <li> I am using the Mild Baby Organic Castile liquid soap for shampoo, body wash, face wash, and hand soap, as well as a liquid cleanser for the house (use it like dish soap) for counters, sinks, tubs,  and floors etc.  I feel very clean. I love that there is no scent, my face and body feels smooth and soft. No dryness, tightness, or filmy feeling. It has a lovely lather. I am happy that it is non toxic and uses healthy natural ingredients, that I can pronounce. I love that the ingredient list is not a mile long. It gives me peace of mind for my household, that we have chosen well. Loving that it is multipurpose. Also, it leaves no soap scumb on the shower doors.</li>
            <li> Bought: organic, unscented, baby mild.&lt;br /&gt;I have eczema, dry skin, oily skin, hypersensitivity to: dry air, moist air, scented anything, and pretty much anything not natural.&lt;br /&gt;I make my own bar soap but need a liquid. (If you wanted to know: bon-fire &amp;#34;white&amp;#34; ash from &amp;#34;hard&amp;#34; wood, pour distilled water over, collect the water &amp;#34;lye&amp;#34;, let sit until strong enough to mix with olive oil, done.)&lt;br /&gt;But I have to say, as far as liquids go, this is awesome!&lt;br /&gt;Bought a DollarTree foaming dispenser (poured out the petro-chemical soap then washed the bottle) and this works great!&lt;br /&gt;The dispenser really helps not get too much or too little.</li>
            <li> Secret to cleanliness.. good for people who do not like heavy scents.&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t care if I get a scent or not, but this is economical.&lt;br /&gt;Plus you get some good reading from the bottle label.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Reading material.. put your glasses on.</li>
            <li> Great product works wonderfully only downfall is the smell  and do not mix with vinegar as it converts back to oils and does not clean at all</li>
            <li> We recived the product before we were told, made our own handmade soap last night. We are enjoying the soap. And will continue to use it. Thank you</li>
            <li> This is great!! I use it for everything from home made shampoo with coconut milk to moisturizing body wash with olive oil and essential oils. Also will be making my own liquid hand soap with this. Suds up great, feels clean, soft on skin and odorless so it can be mixed with anything to add a personal touch. Price is comparable to stores.</li>
            <li> I love the product, but the cap had come loose in the box and coated the bottle and the orange oil I had received with it. It was not much lost but enough to coat some of the bottle. That was my only issue with the product.</li>
            <li> I use all of the dr bronner&#x27;s soaps  - I use them to clean with -- everything with the sal suds  --  the products are so wonderful  -- You use a very small amount when using  -- they are safe and your house hold and your body  - I use to wash my face- It is very very mild  - which is what I like about it  -- -  cleans mildly  -- I don&#x27;t have any young children  but I use this on myself  - my face  --  hair  --  body wash --  This is my personal favorite of the soaps for body care  --</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very happy with this product. It works wonderfully! It seemed like alot to pay for only 32oz originally, but it&#x27;s so strong that I have to dilute it to use it, so I really get more out of it than most 32oz containers of soap. I also love that I can use it for pretty much anything from shampoo, body wash, baby soap, hand soap, to washing toys, cleaning, and I have a friend that even uses it on her pet. It&#x27;s the perfect all in one soap!</li>
            <li> this product looked good on the web page so i gave it a try. when i got it, it is everything the ad said it was and more!! it works far better than i thought it would. i am very please with my purchase and will buy again! so people give this a try you will not regret it. i am disabled and this item make a good mixture for  a bag enema and is mild and really helps those with bowel cleaning who can&#x27;t do it on their own due to disabilities. i find 2 teaspoons of this liquid in a enema bag works perfect. any more than this would make it to strong and cause cramps.</li>
            <li> I use this for myself and my 2 yr old. It&#x27;s totally safe and free of harmful chemicals and dyes. I like to put it in a pump bottle and add essential oils to mine. I don&#x27;t add scent to my toddlers though. It really lasts quite a while so the price is worth it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s mild and suds good. I use it to make my own baby wipes. My baby has sensitive skin and this works great.</li>
            <li> going to try making my own shower soap! thank you!</li>
            <li> I buy Dr. Bronners soap regularly and it always has a seal.&lt;br /&gt;This arrived unsealed and had opened and leaked in the mail.&lt;br /&gt;Disappointing.</li>
            <li> I use all of Dr. Bronner&#x27;s  products. Never have I been disappointed with anything I have tried. Great products and great for the environment .</li>
            <li> This soap is wonderful for sensitive skin no scent and a big 32 oz bottle great for cleaning cpap equipment this is the best soap I have found and it will last a long long time.</li>
            <li> Great product! Unscented, gentle on baby&#x27;s skin, and a little goes a long way! What more could you ask for in a baby soap? :)&lt;br /&gt;I use it on my toddler and infant!</li>
            <li> Love the smell. Love it! Exactly what I was looking for, great product. I would recommend it to people that  want mild soap.</li>
            <li> I have been weining myself off of store - bought soaps for about a year now. This product is detergent free and gentle on the skin. Great for people with dry or sensitive skin. Great for babies. I would recommend.</li>
            <li> I love this soap!  It is THE best product I have used.  My skin is the softest it has ever been without the use of lotion.  I highly recommend this if you have sensitive dry skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Dr. Bronner&#x27;s for myself for years.  When I had a baby, it seemed natural to use their unscented soap for him.  It does the job of cleaning well and that sweet baby smell is not masked by unnatural fragrance.  This is NOT a tear-free formula, but I&#x27;ve never had an issue as long as I rinse the suds from his hands fairly quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only downside to Dr. Bronner&#x27;s is the buildup around the spout.  I&#x27;ve since found a pump to replace the cap and that has helped tremendously with the build up.</li>
            <li> I use it for all my homemade soap making needs. It is a vital ingredient to make the exact soaps that you desire for your home.</li>
            <li> I mix my Dr. Bronner&#x27;s soap with water and put it in a foam dispenser.  I add a little essential oil to compliment the season and I&#x27;m left with an all natural, organic cleanser for much less than I&#x27;d pay anywhere else.  Plus, my 3 year old likes to over-pump the soap dispensers, and with a foam option it&#x27;s not a problem!  It lasts a long time as well!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also use as a shampoo and body wash!</li>
            <li> I used this product to make a mosturizing face wash as a holiday present for friends.&lt;br /&gt;I could not be happier with the product &amp; the price point. Thank you!</li>
            <li> I love using Dr. Bronner&#x27;s Castile Liquid Soap because it is a great natural product that works. I use it in several of my homemade recipes: hand soap, mild baby body wash and shampoo, fabric stain remover and appliance and granite surface cleaner, but it can be used for so much more. If you will be adding your own essential oils be sure to use glass or PET containers and if you have children who will be using the product make sure you are using safe amounts and types of essential oils. Note: Product is not tear free. I found out after my daughter complained and I tested it in my own eyes. Ouch!</li>
            <li> Using Dr. Bonner&#x27;s Organic Castile Soap Unscented Baby-Mild I have less acne, very happy, happy skin! It&#x27;s perfect for face washing.</li>
            <li> Great soap.  I use for cleaning vegetables mainly.  Like because has no harsh chemicals to worry about.  Will order again when I run out.</li>
            <li> I am addicted to these soaps. I use them for everything. And I mean everything. The baby mild is great for my sons problem skin. He has bad eczema and it cleared right up. I use almond and my husband loves peppermint for himself as body wash. It&#x27;s also in our soap dispensers at the sink. Tea tree makes an amazing face wash. My skin has never looked better and I&#x27;ve used everything from philosophy to perricone md. Rose is for laundry. The citrus is in the kitchen and all the bathrooms for dishes and all purpose cleaning.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s truly a magic soap.</li>
            <li> Not happy with the smell. This was my first castle soap purchase. Not sure if the unscented is supposed to smell bad, but it&#x27;s kind of rank/fishy. Thought maybe it was out of date, but couldn&#x27;t find an expiration date so sending back.  I didn&#x27;t know any better, thought it was supposed to smell that way, but my sister confirmed there&#x27;s something not right. Hate that I wasted a lot of my DoTerra essential oils (which isn&#x27;t cheap) trying to mask the smell.</li>
            <li> it make my skin feels smooth</li>
            <li> I LOVE THIS SOAP!  I USE IT IN ALL MY COSMETIC CLEANSERS SINCE I STOPPED BUYING COMMERCIAL SOAPS AND LOTIONS!!</li>
            <li> This product has HEMP in it a commonly used term for high-growing varieties of the Cannabis plant. Just informing buyers...overall great product for a baby shampoo</li>
            <li> Good for making liquid laundry and/or hand soap.</li>
            <li> Used other &#x27;flavors&#x27; before but like the unscented version. Works like it should. Would purchase again. Is my main body soap</li>
            <li> This soap smells so good!</li>
            <li> I have used it as a body wash as well as a shampoo.  All I need is a few drops and the soap totally foams up.  I think it is going to last a long time so I&#x27;m glad I like the product.</li>
            <li> smells super clean, can use this for just about anything!  cleans quickly and does exactly what it says it does.</li>
            <li> I cannot say enough good things about this stuff!  I have been on a mission to eliminate harsh chemicals from my life and after starting to use this soap in a variety of recipes I make sure I ALWAYS have some on hand.  I use this mostly for making my own body wash although I have switched to the baby mild formula for that.  Let me just tell you I have NEVER felt more clean in my life.  You don&#x27;t really notice the soapy film that builds up on you from regular body wash until you have made some body wash with this stuff.  This stuff is AMAZING!</li>
            <li> I buy this over and over.  It is pure castile soap.  I also buy the bars.  This is an excellent product.</li>
            <li> I have rosacea and I use this as a face soap.  Its the only wash I&#x27;ve ever used that causes no redness at all.  I even get redness from prescription wash from my dermatologist.  Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Good quality soap. But I can buy much cheaper at my local health food store now.</li>
            <li> I use this stuff for everything! I am not super into the whole organic scene but if I mix this with a little anti bacterial dish soap it works great for a hand soap. I also use it alone as a body wash with just a little on my body sponge.</li>
            <li> The only soap my husband can use.  Love that there is no scent and leaves no itchy skin.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff!  I use it for EVERYTHING!  Nice price, multi-purpose chemical free soap.  If you&#x27;ve never used it before be aware that it&#x27;s not like other soaps in that it&#x27;s not a gel or a cream, it does lather up but it&#x27;s like water when you first pour it.  I like to mix it with water to make it last longer.  When you use it to wash your hair it does leave it your hair really &amp;#34;tangled&amp;#34; feeling so make sure you use conditioner (I like the Bronner&#x27;s brand hair rinse, it smells like citrus) Also, it does leave a residue when you use it to clean, which is another reason why I like to dilute it.</li>
            <li> This is a good mild and chemical free soap for baby skin.  I use it on my two year old and my newborn, both of whom have sensitive skin, and it does the job nicely!  A little goes a long way, too.</li>
            <li> One soap for everything&lt;br /&gt;One soap for everything&lt;br /&gt;Saves room and time&lt;br /&gt;One bottle in the shower&lt;br /&gt;Good stuff yeah</li>
            <li> I liked this product, but it tends to leave your hands a little dry.  I liked the no scent as I am allergic to other soaps with strong scents.</li>
            <li> I like this product, and use the almond version for myself. However, it is not tear free, so be aware of that if you are purchasing it for use with a baby. It is very mild and gentle on their skin though.</li>
            <li> I have been using Dr. Bronners since I was a teenager. Loved the peppermint as a body wash. I use it to wash my face as well. Lathers up perfectly and lasts a while!</li>
            <li> I love this liquid soap from Dr. Bromner&#x27;s. It is all organic and pure and contains no chemicals and it really cleans. I have a foaming soap dispenser. I add 5/6 of water and about 1/6 of the liquid soap and my whole family has pure soap without the chemicals. It cleans and smell good. I can highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Wanted to like this product but between the rants on the bottle and the rancid smell after being open just a few weeks I am not a fan. Rather than put it in my kids&#x27; bath, I tried to mix it with some essential oils so that I might be able to use it for myself. Unfortunately, I still can&#x27;t get past that oily smell. Like oil gone bad. I like the fact that it is organic and pure, but I will be looking for another soap, both for my kids and for myself that is pure but can still be mixed nicely with my essential oils.</li>
            <li> I love this soap!  I was getting all kinds of bumps (looked like chicken skin) on the back of my legs...and now they&#x27;re almost all gone, I will not go back to processed soaps!</li>
            <li> This soap lasts a long time.  It is very natural, no smell.  It works well to clean but I would mousturize if your skin is dry.</li>
            <li> I had switched to the baby mild from the tea tree one because my skin was getting too dry!  Well the baby mild was also drying out my skin.  Then I happened upon  the blog &#x27;going green&#x27; by Lisa Bronner and read her cheat sheet.  The first 2 words are Dilute! Dilute!  Reading further I see that for my face the amount is 2-3 DROPS!  And here for my body I was squirting out at least a half cup several times on my scrubbie sponge! No wonder my skin was all dry! lol&lt;br /&gt;Needless to say by using the proper amount (I think I use perhaps 1/2 to one capful on a wet wash cloth for my entire body now) my skin is back to soft and hydrated.&lt;br /&gt;here is the cheat sheet!  : )&lt;br /&gt;http://www.lisabronner.com/dilutions-cheat-sheet-for-dr-bronners-castile-soap/</li>
            <li> Good product to save money to do your own foamy handsoap. Just add whatever essential oil that you like.</li>
            <li> Smells horrible. Seemed diluted. Offensive Label.  Not nearly as useful as I was led to believe.  Total waste of money.</li>
            <li> My kids tend to be sensitive to ALL shampoos, soaps, laundry detergents.  No matter how \\&quot;Natural\\&quot; of a product I find, someone gets a minor rash.  Also, my daughter has thick naturally curly hair, and I don&#x27;t want to use harsh chemicals on her hair, but she doesn&#x27;t need tangles!  THIS IS AMAZING.  No rash and makes her hair so soft!  Takes the tangles right out!  Plus it&#x27;s great that it can be a body wash too.  Love the all in one option with kids.  I absolutely recommend this to parents for their kids.  Four years of searching and two kids- this is the one!</li>
            <li> I make my own foaming hand soap with this, essential oils &amp; water - a little of this goes a long way!</li>
            <li> Since I discovered I am allergic to formaldehyde and its many cousins in personal care products (body wash, hand soap, dish soap, shampoo, clothes detergents) I needed to find something else to use in the shower.  A friend recommended Dr Bronner&#x27;s - she was using peppermint - so I checked it out and tried it.  I have used the baby soap, the almond, the peppermint and the tea tree oil.  This is great as shampoo and body wash.  A little goes a long way.  I like the almond or this baby unscented for body wash; peppermint for an invigorating shampoo; and tea tree for hand-washing because of the antibacterial properties.  Also use the peppermint or tea tree for making creamy liquid cleanser to clean the bathroom and the kitchen sink.  All the Dr Bronner liquid castile soap products I have tried - baby, almond, peppermint and tea tree - have been excellent.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been buying Dr. Bronner&#x27;s mint soap for years and I was very pleased to find this version of his useful, economical, liquid soap.  I really like using unscented products and this one fits the bill.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been a long time user of Dr. Bronner&#x27;s Soaps. As a hiker it&#x27;s nice to have a biodegradable soap that can be used for everything from dish washing to teeth brushing. It is nice to only have to take one product in your pack. The unscented soap is recommended for anyone with sensitive skin or for anyone looking for a soap base to make their own hair and body wash.</li>
            <li> This Liquid soap is amazing.  I make shampoo with it and mix with water 1:1.  This is great for those who are sensitive to chemicals found in other shampoos.  I would recommend this product to my friends.</li>
            <li> Great product. I mistakenly bought Baby, I thought I was just buying unscented. But it still works in my homemade body wash. And while it is unscented, there is a slight clean smell to it :) I love this product!</li>
            <li> I purchased Dr. Bronners baby-mild soap because I wanted a shampoo/body wash for my newborn that was cleansing without being harsh and having crazy chemicals.  This is just what the Dr. ordered! Pun intended.  My son&#x27;s skin feels clean and soft after a bath and this has also been a nice cleansing soap for his cradle cap.  This is just what I wanted. I recommend.</li>
            <li> bronner&#x27;s baby can&#x27;t go wrong all one all one all one all one all one all one all one all one</li>
            <li> This is probably my favorite of the Dr. Bronner soaps (I&#x27;ve tried peppermint, lavender, citrus orange, and tea tree).  The Baby mild feels great on the skin and since it has more olive oil in it I don&#x27;t seem as dry when I use it.  I use this for my bath soap, in all our foaming hand soap dispensers, and will use it on my baby when he&#x27;s born (just be careful to keep it out of his eyes).  A little goes a LONG way, i cut it to 25% soap and 75% water (at the strongest).</li>
            <li> I love this soap. I use it all the time for washing my hands. I also use it for washing produce (says you can brush your teeth with it, so why not?), and I use it for cleaning the tub, sinks and toilets.</li>
            <li> My baby has eczema and I read the reviews and thought this might be a good product for my baby since it&#x27;s &amp;#34;BABY MILD&amp;#34;. WRONG! I poured some in my baby&#x27;s bath water, put her in and she screamed like she was in a lot of pain. her skin immediately turned bright red, after drying her off, her skin looked like she had got burnt. (i never used hot water to bathe her, only lukewarm or cool, simply because her skin is very sensitive) I can tell the product was the reason for the irritation of her skin. i didnt want to waste the product so I decided to use it and I did not like it at all. it does burn your skin (especially if you have sensitive skin) you know that feeling when you have an itchy, irritated area on your skin and it comes in contact with something strong, like alcohol, matter of fact it feels like a really bad sunburn. i know this is how my daughter skin was feeling. my poor baby. oh, and the smell was not pleasant at all!</li>
            <li> I bought this to use in a variety of ways, but I find that the dilutions make the soap very thin - almost a water consistency.  I really don&#x27;t like the smell and find it distracting.  I may try a different scent at some point.  Overall, it does clean fairly well, but it leaves my hands feeling funny (like they have a residue on them) and the scent bothers me.  I likely won&#x27;t purchase this type again.</li>
            <li> I love Dr. Bronners castile soap. I use it to wash my hair and in my cleaning products. It is very gentle and cleans very thoroughly.</li>
            <li> I bought it for my own sensitive scalp but it wasn&#x27;t ideal for my hair. However, it&#x27;s great for my puppy. Well diluted, it lathers nicely and contains no perfumes to irritate my puppy&#x27;s skin.</li>
            <li> I use Dr. Bronners for making multiple cleaning supplies (hand soap, general cleaner). This one is great because there is no smell. I purposely got this one to make wipes.</li>
