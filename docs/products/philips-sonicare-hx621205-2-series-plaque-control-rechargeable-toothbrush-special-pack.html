            <li>This is a very good toothbrush and the price is fantastic.</li>
            <li>Very satisfied with the rest of items.</li>
            <li>I had a cheaper electric toothbrush and now I am very satisfied with Sonicare.  </li>

            <li>Amazing product.</li>
            <li>Well, my wife noticed and soon wanted one of her own.  </li>
            <li>I always had heard about the Sonicare and how effective they were.</li>
            <li>But the prince may be nice.</li>
            <li>Great buy for sure :)</li>
            <li>travel case is nice too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All</li>
            <li>Liked the toothbrush, also recommend it to friends</li>
            <li>Great gift for globe-trotting kids--just make sure they have the appropriate plug for non-US electrics</li>
            <li>Would be nice to hear from Amazon on this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>nice to hold.</li>
            <li>Charge lasts for weeks-very nice.</li>
            <li>-------update after 5 weeks use----- I honestly just feel betrayed.  </li>
            <li>The case was a nice bonus too because we are always staying overnight somewhere.</li>
            <li>and you can&#x27;t beat the price with a nice travel case included.</li>
            <li>Battery gets drained way to fast not that happy with my purchase after all!!!</li>
            <li>We liked it that</li>

            <li>Liked the storage cover for the bristle end</li>
            <li>While I liked them, the battery lives were abysmal.</li>
            <li>This is kind of handy, it comes with the travel case.</li>
            <li>Nice package.</li>
            <li>so I can effectively brush my teeth, but still avoid the fractured tooth.</li>
            <li>I am able to maintain superior oral hygiene but avoid my extraction and implant tooth site while it is healing.</li>
            <li>Nice shopping practice</li>
            <li>Its a nice size</li>
            <li>it took him some time to warm up to it</li>
            <li>a nice buzzing gum massage)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Also liked the look of the 2 series as it appeared to be slimmer.  </li>
            <li>Anyway, I kind of was hoping I could save some money and get this model</li>
            <li>nice price!&lt;br /&gt;high rate</li>
            <li>Nice for the replacement.</li>
            <li>Nice as a muscle relaxer...</li>
            <li>I am LOVING this product.</li>
            <li>how good this device is... got my teeth really clean and bright.  </li>
            <li>Very good, very practical, I very love</li>
            <li>Great toothbrush...gets that clean feeling after brushing.  </li>
            <li>The new one is excellent.</li>
            <li>Was very happy with the Essence but wanted to get a new model because the mold that grows inside the brush heads for the Essence was grossing me out.</li>
            <li>Good experience and easy to use.</li>
            <li>Super happy</li>
            <li>Very strong vibration.</li>
            <li>I like Philips electric toothbrush, so I am very easy to protect my teeth every day.</li>
            <li>and I can honestly feel that it does remove six times more plague than my manual did.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Buy cheap hangeo well as a good product.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you.</li>
            <li>HOWEVER, honestly, I find that the E series brushes have more power, and it felt stronger.  </li>
            <li>I feel good that I&#x27;m taking care of my teeth the best that I can to keep them as healthy as possible.  </li>
            <li>Good price, good quality, and fast service!</li>
            <li>love love love my sonic!</li>
            <li>Incredible, mouth so clean, specially if you get the air/mouthwash water pic.</li>
            <li>The toothbrush is really cheap, and really good, love Philips</li>
            <li>Great product at great price.. Would definitely recommend.</li>
            <li>stars for the design (good shape, good handling and very slim).&lt;br /&gt;5</li>
            <li>Great product to have as a first time electric toothbrush.</li>
            <li>Great product this is the first electric tooth brush.</li>
            <li>Great product and fast shipping!</li>
            <li>True, it does not have the bells &amp; whistles (a good thing, IMHO),</li>
            <li>Although very cheap, but the quality is unstable.</li>
            <li>Very light buildup and virtually no inflammation.</li>
            <li>Very comfortable to use.</li>
            <li>Easy to use, effective.</li>
            <li>Good stuff, quickly shipping.</li>
            <li>It is like having had a good cleaning at the dentist.&lt;br /&gt;Tartar build-up and gums are super healthy.</li>
            <li>The brush threads are high quality and clean your teeth beautifully!</li>
            <li>Seems good, but it makes too much noise!!</li>
            <li>Now if the replacement heads were cheaper that would be a huge + !</li>
            <li>practice many of these things can be improved or prevented.</li>
            <li>feel more sonic power.</li>
            <li>I love it</li>
            <li>I also like the fact that it seems to be water resistant as I use it in the shower mostly.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d prefer a more stable charger but functions</li>
            <li>okay :)</li>
            <li>Love how my teeth feel.  </li>
            <li>My gums and teeth feel so much better.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using one for 15 years or more, and I used to have gum issues, soreness and inflammation, but have had not one instance since using this toothbrush.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;d give it more than five stars if I could.</li>
            <li>I travel a lot and love that there is a dedicated carrying case for the unit.</li>
            <li>Make sure to hold the handle</li>
            <li>Make sure to angle the brush head upwards or downwards to stimulate the gums and saliva.</li>
            <li>After owning this toothbrush for two months I can successfully say that it is the best one I&#x27;ve ever owned, though in full disclosure I&#x27;ve only ever owned cheap electrics and manual toothbrushes.  </li>
            <li>This toothbrush is the entry level model, for sure.</li>
            <li>;.... okay.</li>
            <li>price is also much better</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I did!&lt;br</li>
            <li>I think the waterpik is better.</li>
            <li>Why spend more on fancier models with timers and what not.</li>
            <li>And its function is OK</li>
            <li>love the sensation of brushing my teeth, it makes the task much more enjoyable</li>
            <li>Better than going to the dentist to have my teeth cleaned.</li>
            <li>she said my fillings were okay</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this toothbrush.  </li>
            <li>So glad I did.  </li>
            <li>Cute.</li>
            <li>Love Sonicare and had one for years.  </li>
            <li>Well, the product is ok for cleaning.</li>
            <li>Not as great as the Healthy White, but still a really good toothbrush.</li>
            <li>Love that I don&#x27;t need to keep it plugged in.</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s ok, but the bottom line is that it discourages me from using this tooth</li>
            <li>They are well built and do a better job of cleaning my family&#x27;s teeth</li>
            <li>but it is more money.</li>
            <li>&#x3D;)</li>
            <li>I love this toothbrush.</li>
            <li>I bought for my parents and they love it.</li>
            <li>Like the smaller headed brush; works great!</li>
            <li>I like it much more than the rotating head brushes.</li>
            <li>It is okay if it works as it should.</li>
            <li>We both like the Sonicare better than the Oral B</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>I had a Braun circular brush for many years.  </li>
            <li>My first, nice electric toothbrush and I am very pleased.</li>
            <li>It is a worthwhile investment for those of us who want to take care of our teeth and maintain them for life.</li>
            <li>I like this a lot better.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m perfectly satisfied by this</li>
            <li>So make sure to register your unit.</li>
            <li>:)</li>
            <li>Feels better than a manual toothbrush.</li>
            <li>(manual brush better to mousse the toothpaste)</li>
            <li>It is too noise，high to 75db or more</li>
            <li>That sound level is somewhere between a phone ringtone and an alarm clock!  </li>
            <li>She actually said she was impressed!</li>
            <li>being said, I love it and would recommend it.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure I could find 4-ply TP for my ass</li>
            <li>Dental hygienist pleased with results.</li>
            <li>They both work great, but this one is really noisy for some reason.</li>
            <li>Excellent daily and travel toothbrush.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had others I like better.</li>
            <li>Love this Sonicare.  </li>
            <li>I love this toothbrush.  </li>
            <li>I have been using Sonicare for about fifteen years, and I love them.</li>
            <li>better than my panasonic</li>
            <li>This brush works so much better</li>
            <li>I am pleased with this product.</li>
            <li>I love this toothbrush.</li>
            <li>Better than my oral b for sure.</li>
            <li>and this is a lot better.</li>
            <li>Who doesn&#x27;t love sonicare?</li>
            <li>This is our favorite brand to use as the quality is top notch and gets the job done.</li>
            <li>,i love it</li>
            <li>like the mini container, cute and practical.</li>
            <li>The Braun was much more efficient for me.  </li>
            <li>HX69XX is better more.</li>
            <li>It seems to do a much better job than a battery brush.  </li>
            <li>This does not work much better than a manual toothbrush</li>
            <li>I just could never get myself to spend more than 30 seconds brushing, more than once a day.</li>
            <li>I do feel like my teeth are being cleaned more thoroughly.  </li>
            <li>Love it although somethings</li>
            <li>Feels much better than a manual brush.</li>
            <li>I bought this brush to try because it was inexpensive, compared to the ones sold at most stores.  </li>
            <li>I know people love these toothbrushes</li>
            <li>but it cleans the gum line a lot more efficiently.</li>
            <li>nice and cheap.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>Still, I am satisfied with my purchase.</li>
            <li>Even battery powered made in china disposable ones are better than this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Even the bottom of the line oralB models are more value for the money.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used Sonicare for over a decade and love these toothbrushes.  </li>
            <li>absolutely better than oral-b.</li>
            <li>and I feel that it does a better job at cleaning.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Thanks for a great product.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>works better than others</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>the amazon&#x27;s service is very perfect, also for next time.</li>
            <li>Love this brush, and the carry case it comes with is convenient.</li>
            <li>The simple on-off button is best way to go.  </li>
            <li>I love it</li>
            <li>I love this.</li>
            <li>You get more for your money with the extras..</li>
            <li>I love the Sonicare, although the instruction indicate that after 30 seconds it buzzs to let you know to move to another tooth surface</li>
            <li>I love it .I</li>
            <li>Cheap, practical,Great!</li>
            <li>this represents an OUTSTANDING value.</li>
            <li>I use it twice a day - I&#x27;m pleased with the results, and so is my dentist.</li>
            <li>Enjoy brushing!</li>
            <li>Even better, it has a much better reach than my manual toothbrush.</li>
            <li>but most people don&#x27;t need all the extras.</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>Pretty remarkable.</li>
            <li>And it is lighter and more compact.</li>
            <li>Overall very happy with the purchase!</li>
            <li>I really love it</li>
            <li>噪音比较大，相比6730,声音大多了。&lt;br /&gt;noise lot more than 6730.</li>
            <li>but i feel it is ok.</li>
            <li>/&gt;This is slimmer, more compact heads, cleaner also cheaper</li>
            <li>i have brought many send to my family,i think it is helpful.</li>
            <li>the rotation is away better  </li>
            <li>(faster, feels more cleaner and more satisfactory)&lt;br</li>
            <li>job is OK.</li>
            <li>The price the toothbrush head is not high, the use is very good, very satisfied.</li>
            <li>It is significantly stronger and feels much more effective.</li>
            <li>particular set is great because you get a travel case (which I love to use when taking w/ me on trips)</li>
            <li>Very powerful toothbrush!  </li>
            <li>So far so good!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great, high frequency, I&#x27;m satisfied with it.</li>
            <li>It sounds good, feels food and generally does a good job, but there is a design flaw:&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>This does a nice job of leaving your teeth feeling clean.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a Prime Subscriber and decided to wait the additional day for delivery to have the travel case (great quality, highly recommended) and the additional brush head included at no additional cost.</li>
            <li>Brushing your teeth is very clean</li>
            <li>He says it makes his teeth feel very clean.</li>
            <li>Pretty good.</li>
            <li>I loved my first sonicare</li>
            <li>The noise is relatively large, but sonic toothbrush with very practical, if can reduce the noise will be very perfect.</li>
            <li>The special bonus pack is very well and the travel case is so beautiful.</li>
            <li>At today&#x27;s cleaning I was told I had a significant improvement!</li>
            <li>bought it at a very cheap price and it is really worthy!</li>
            <li>Soniicare brush is great, like the new styling, no gunk on the inside anymore.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to care for and whitens your teeth better than the strips.</li>
            <li>The case makes it a nice travel brush which is what I wanted it for, but it is nowhere near as good as a Sonicare should be</li>
            <li>A+ It has worked great so far, my teeth love it.</li>
            <li>the BEST price for the money PLUS the Free head and case makes it a double deal!</li>
            <li>Talked my husband into it since I have the more advanced model and LOVE it.</li>
            <li>But it&#x27;s just fine, and nice to have a sonicare easily accessible downstairs, for us.</li>
            <li>Teeth get clean!</li>
            <li>but this thing makes my mouth feel clean and refreshed after every use!</li>
            <li>Clean teeth!</li>
            <li>My teeth have never felt so clean!  </li>
            <li>NOTHING gets my teeth so clean!</li>
            <li>Makes my teeth feel really clean!</li>
            <li>The noise is large, the use of good</li>
            <li>I love how it works, and the lovely, clean feeling produced.  </li>
            <li>My friend bought  the same one, the quality is very good.</li>
            <li>With two replace brush and a travel bag, that&#x27;s very cool.</li>
            <li>Things are very good, need to buy the next time.</li>
            <li>Very good, the span of a voltage adapter is very big, does not require switching power supply.</li>
            <li>Bought it for my vacation house as I have a better model at home and it is fantastic.</li>
            <li>and i love it, although it makes a noisy sound</li>
            <li>It works great and though at times a bit loud...</li>
            <li>It just depends on what you think is more important...</li>
            <li>the ideal fundamental or basic model.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li>I have a sensitive mouth, and while the toothbrush itself has been great, I will consider getting &amp;#34;sensitive brush heads in the future&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Great so far.</li>
            <li>so much for the good.  </li>
            <li>it makes so much noise,but take good care of my tooth</li>
            <li>good toothbrush and reasonable price.</li>
            <li>The toothbrush is good, but too much noise</li>
            <li>It came in a handy travel case which was a useful addition.</li>
            <li>Good deal; reasonable performance.</li>
            <li>The special bonus pack is great since you get a second head and a handy case.  </li>
            <li>The price on CVS and Walgreens and other websites are much&lt;br /&gt;more, great deal !!!!!</li>
            <li>Dental hygienist, orthodontist and the dentist are impressed by how healthy my teeth are and how little plaque there is to scrape.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I think it does a better job than my original one.</li>
            <li>I can travel with it easily.  </li>
            <li>After several days of use, I&#x27;m pleased to report that I am incredibly happy with the performance of this toothbrush.</li>
            <li>Easy to Find Replacement Heads&lt;br /&gt;-&amp;#62; Shuts off after 2 min</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to bring when trip, and can use 2 weeks without charge.</li>
            <li>Easy to charge.</li>
            <li>Easy to use,but it&#x27;s too noisy.</li>
            <li>Easy to use.  </li>
            <li>It really cleaned my teeth exceptionally well.</li>
            <li>Who doesn&#x27;t love clean teeth?</li>
            <li>new.&lt;br /&gt;Very easy to use by just guiding the brush, there is no need to press and &amp;#34;help&amp;#34; it out.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Easy to use, easy to maintain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Easy to use, just a lot of noise.</li>
            <li>This toothbrush is easy to use and sleek when not in use and on the counter.  </li>
            <li>Easy to use and store.</li>
            <li>The brush oscillates laterally instead of rotating and it appears quite easy to break a tooth.</li>
            <li>Went with FlexPlus model, better feel, meant to last, works great.</li>
            <li>It will easily pay for itself in saved dental procedures.</li>
            <li>Cleaning seems convenient and charging is easy.</li>
            <li>But over all it is easy to use</li>
            <li>strong vibration&lt;br /&gt;-Nice</li>
            <li>High speed, good experience.</li>
            <li>but I may have to upgrade to the Easy Clean if it means  being able to enjoy brushing my teeth instead of dreading it.  </li>
            <li>I really feel like I&#x27;m getting a good clean.</li>
            <li>and it is fine.</li>
            <li>It is fine.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m using it in Argentina just fine...</li>
            <li>works fine.</li>
            <li>Item is fine.  </li>
            <li>Fine toothbrush.</li>
            <li>Easy to use, and I feel comfortable after use it in the morning.</li>
            <li>The unit I bought works fine</li>
            <li>in all, it is a good setup if you&#x27;re looking to make the switch from your old analog toothbrush!</li>
            <li>Easy to use and easy to clean.</li>
            <li>I could buy one of their new better units, and would normally be OK with that, but I don&#x27;t want to send Philips any more money after this.</li>
            <li>It certainly cleans your teeth nicely and leaves everything sparkly.</li>
            <li>Works super well and teeth feels very clean.  </li>
            <li>This is the 2nd one I had; honestly the first one lasted almost 8 years!!!!</li>
            <li>It is gentle and soft, and the price is very good.</li>
            <li>It has made a huge difference on my dental hygiene.  </li>
            <li>like that the head on these does not leave a huge crevice for paste and water to get caught in and grow -</li>
            <li>However the toothbrush heads do not fit perfectly...</li>
            <li>it was really cheap (on sale).  </li>
            <li>I smoothly remove food particles and the floss remains intact.</li>
            <li>don&#x27;t like the way the heads fit on this model.</li>
            <li>lightly</li>
            <li>Official instructions say instead to use light pressure and glide the brush along the gumlines.</li>
            <li>And that&#x27;s the important thing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The brush uses UltraSonic sound vibrations to smack plaque off your teeth.</li>
            <li>in all, I feel that this brush is a fantastic value</li>
            <li>, the price is cheap</li>
            <li>and I liked it so much</li>
            <li>(confirmed by my dentist)</li>
            <li>Got this on a cyber Monday deal for cheap because I always wanted to try out an electric toothbrush.</li>
            <li>Picked up for $30 via slickdeals, really great basic electric toothbrush.</li>
            <li>He suggested the Sonicare Easy Clean model for a more powerful vibration.</li>
            <li>They also made a version with a UV light to kill germs</li>
            <li>Really fast and effective electric toothbrush and the price when I bought was un-beatable.</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s convenient and cheap to buy it from Amazon ship to China.</li>
            <li>The great thing is you can use different heads on this unit depending on what your needs are.</li>
            <li>Easy to clean.</li>
            <li>Makes it easy to pack and keeps the heads clean and hygienic.</li>
            <li>Nice and fast and doesn&#x27;t hurt my gum</li>
            <li>The handle is comfortable.</li>
            <li>Brushing has become something I enjoy, 2-3 times a day.</li>
            <li>I liked the results in my teeth so much, that I decided to give it a week.</li>
            <li>Such a great price, I checked the prices of the BRUSH HEADS before ordering and checking all over sites online.</li>
            <li>However, when it is charged the light goes out.  </li>
            <li>Wouldn&#x27;t a larger head be more effective because it could cover more surface area?  </li>
            <li>Whenever I did go to the dentist they would say I had a great oral care regimen and didnt even need deep cleaning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s probably a cheap battery problem.  </li>
            <li>Replaced it with another Sonicare because i felt that was a reasonable life span for this kind of produce.</li>
            <li>This is a great product at any cost, and especially if you catch it on sale.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to use and clean well</li>
            <li>I had been told at my dental checkups to get away from the cheap manual brushes and buy one of these.</li>
            <li>I measured a sound level of 80 dB six inches from my iPad running a sound level ap with an ambient (room) level of about 40 dB.</li>
            <li>The most noticeable difference is that Sonicare is more gentle than Oral-B, in terms of the core motor movement.</li>
            <li>The brushes that came with it are too soft for my taste, but the brushes I use with the flexcare are interchangeable with this unit so all is good.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It is a good feature to have the timer ~ which in all honesty, I have never used ~ for young kids and adults to do quadrants for the recommended time</li>
            <li>I used to own a basic Oral B electric toothbrush that I really liked (Oral B 2000).  </li>
            <li>But I think it&#x27;s still worthy since the special package contains one more brush head and a carrying case.</li>
            <li>teeth feel super clean!</li>
            <li>Ok right now I have had it four days</li>
            <li>Charging station is really cool, and all in all easy to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons.</li>
            <li>when I went to register the unit online, I got another 1-1/2 years extra warranty time added for free!!!</li>
            <li>Very powerful.</li>
            <li>Very powerful.</li>
            <li>My teeth feel amazing and my whole mouth feels totally clean.</li>
            <li>I bought this thinking it would be a nice change or upgrade versus my older model Sonicare.</li>
            <li>I had mild gum disease and my gums bled easily.</li>
            <li>I really like it。I feel like my teeth are becoming more white。</li>
            <li>It allows you to be more precise with your cleaning and work on a smaller area, it also vibrates a lot more and leaves your mouth feeling a lot more clean afterwords.</li>
            <li>2 weeks after the need to charge, generally speaking good</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve noticed a significant reduction in plaque build-up.</li>
            <li>useful !</li>
            <li>The box is quite useful when travelling!</li>
            <li>I originally started with the E series ones, and have since moved on to this one.  </li>
            <li>too noisy and not sure if this is the best one in market but for $30 bucks I cant complain.</li>
            <li>However, there is a significant difference: the noise.  </li>
            <li>Was originally recommended by my Dentist</li>
            <li>Well worth the price!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m actually excited to see my dentist again, so he can see</li>
            <li>The heads on the Oral B Sonic Complete are more comfortable and cleaned better.</li>
            <li>I hope some of the higher end models have better quality components.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m still running off the original charge.</li>
            <li>so long lol..</li>
            <li>Our other units, models HX6711 and HX5711, both noticeably disrupt the flow; it&#x27;s actually pretty impressive.  </li>
            <li>My original Sonicare 1 lasted over 15 years.</li>
            <li>: there&#x27;s a significant gap between the handle and brush head.</li>
            <li>This is my first time using a electric toothbrush, and I am glad to make that decision!&lt;br /&gt;For</li>
            <li>After 4 years my original Phillips Sonicare gave out.  </li>
            <li>bought it with coupon and sale price, worth every penny!</li>
            <li>product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can feel clean than original toothbrush every times</li>
            <li>translation: doesn&#x27;t clean between the teeth and under the gums as well.  </li>
            <li>and her hygienist told her that her teeth have not ever been this clean</li>
            <li>This gap allows my toothbrush to seep inside and because of this I have to pull out the head every time to wipe that area clean.</li>
            <li>to remove head and clean to prevent molding</li>
            <li>I can feel a noticeable difference in how clean my teeth</li>
            <li>to clean and Maintain.&lt;br /&gt;Huge</li>
            <li>difference in how clean the teeth feel after brushing.</li>
            <li>Makes me teeth clean, and me gums pampered</li>
            <li>Keeps my teeth clean.</li>
            <li>It ensures that I clean my teeth for 2 min everytime.</li>
            <li>Keeps teeth clean.</li>
            <li>It makes my teeth feel so clean.</li>
            <li>after purchasing my teeth are gone too clean.</li>
            <li>Anyways, my mouth feels so god damn clean.</li>
            <li>My teeth feel dentist clean every time I use it.</li>
            <li>and I will say my teeth felt clean</li>
            <li>The power flosser heads kept my teeth and gums clean</li>
            <li>which was an issue with the e-series (BTW, if you have an e-series, clean out undre the cap with bleach each time you swap heads, and you won&#x27;t have any funk growing).  </li>
            <li>teeth have never felt cleaner, like just from the dentist clean.</li>
            <li>This brush should be used to clean shoes, not put into your mouth.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think my teeth have every felt so clean.</li>
            <li>The sonicare makes my teeth extremely clean.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It works well and gives a clean feeling when you are done.</li>
            <li>Just received today, a little noise, clean effect is very good</li>
            <li>The whole body has a very cheap feel to it.</li>
            <li>I was so excited to buy this product because it was such a good deal on Amazon and Sonicare is the holy grail of electronic toothbrushes.</li>
            <li>special travel case is a life saver.</li>
            <li>This toothbrush allows me to get a much better clean without using as much pressure.  </li>
            <li>Very convenient, electric toothbrush cleans teeth better.</li>
            <li>It was smaller and lighter, which are good things</li>
            <li>It really is a lot more convenient than manually brushing and it also stops itself after 2 minutes</li>
            <li>Good plug for performance and starting.</li>
            <li>and I did adjust to the Sonic and love it as much as the Waterpik.</li>
            <li>Loving so far.</li>
            <li>It is good , but the noise is a bit bigger.</li>
            <li>it is straight forward, brush your teeth with it and it does a much better job than a manual brush.</li>
            <li>People make more noise than this toothbrush when they are getting ready in the bathroom.</li>
            <li>Very good!&lt;br /&gt;Description As a manual toothbrush is more than 4 times and wipe well.</li>
            <li>Takes much longer to recharge and it a bit noisier and more vibrations to my hand.</li>
            <li>cool looking charging station, etc.  </li>
            <li>The extra brush is in good quality as well.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>It takes around two full days to get a full charge out of the box.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It gradually increases speed over two weeks, you can override this and start it at full speed.</li>
            <li>Couldn&#x27;t resist for such a good price.</li>
            <li>This will work till I get the full size version.</li>
            <li>The full power is what you are going to want to use anyway.  </li>
            <li>too much noise, like I&#x27;m using a electric saw, but effect is ok.</li>
            <li>Good price and came with an extra brush and travel case.  </li>
            <li>I wanted to love this, I really did.</li>
            <li>Considering the price, i think this is not bad.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not bad.  </li>
            <li>A little too strong in the beginning but works great after adaption</li>
            <li>There is an easy start function if you are new to electronic tooth brushes (it eases you into these brushes with vibrations that increase each time you use it until you reach full power); obviously I don&#x27;t need this function, but it would be great if you are just getting started with these brushes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Easy to use and did exactly what a wanted.</li>
            <li>other thing that greatly aggravates me is this is suppose to be a well designed brush yet</li>
            <li>It was a great deal and works just as expected!</li>
            <li>I have ever owned and it gives you that fresh from the dentist clean.</li>
            <li>Price and quality is totally worth it, my teeth feel so clean.</li>
            <li>The clean makes my teeth feel like I&#x27;m fresh from the dentist.</li>
            <li>I am still having difficulty with the strength of the vibrations and pressure I apply to be comfortable in the more sensitive front area.</li>
            <li>Great toothbrush only thing bristles don&#x27;t move the whole head vibrates.</li>
            <li>I think this toothbrush package is a fantastic offer and if you have Prime membership - the free shipping really makes it</li>
            <li>will say one more thing - considering on the package of the box that Sonicare will guarantee you&#x27;ll love it or your money back within 60 days?</li>
            <li>The shake will quickly shake all toothpaste out of it.</li>
            <li>Super product for the price.</li>
            <li>but you get use to it quickly.</li>
            <li>a worthy replacement.</li>
            <li>Brushing is quick.</li>
            <li>It does seem to brush decently, but I was expecting more from all of the Sonicare hype that I had heard.</li>
            <li>Older versions seemed to be more vigorous but this serves the purpose</li>
            <li>Quick mail to China.</li>
            <li>It charges quickly as well.  </li>
            <li>I love this brush, not lets make sure I pass my next dentist cleaning!</li>
            <li>I had it before and just needed a quick fix b/c it stopped working.</li>
            <li>It moves quick and</li>
            <li>And when I went back for my cleaning 6 months later, my hygienist was very happy with the results!&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li>The frequency of the brush movement seems greater than the older model.  </li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t recommend this toothbrush more highly.</li>
            <li>She has a permanent dental &amp;#34;bridge&amp;#34; and gives this unit a very good after using it for the past 3 months.</li>
            <li>Really leaves my teeth perfectly clean!</li>
            <li>This is my first electric toothbrush and I must say that I continue to enjoy using it.</li>
            <li>With the softest toothbrushes available, it made my teeth hurt for the rest of the day after the first use.  </li>
            <li>very very valueable one!</li>
            <li>I like it very much!</li>
            <li>Noise ruins a great brush.</li>
            <li>He likes it very much!</li>
            <li>I like this tooth brush and very glad to get the extra brushes.</li>
            <li>The good news is that the charge on the toothbrush lasts a long time.</li>
            <li>It charges quickly, cleans easily with warm water and a quick wipe down and is good to go for the next brushing.</li>
            <li>I was super excited to purchase my first electric toothbrush.  </li>
            <li>works great less filling(s)</li>
            <li>My teeth are left feeling cleaner than ever, we also love the 2 minute timer!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s pretty significant.  </li>
            <li>Exactly what I needed!</li>
            <li>When the battery goes, I will certainly buy this model again if it is still available.</li>
            <li>/&gt;To say that this toothbrush, use it for the first time, I was scared, toothbrush voice can use the basic &amp;#34;too large&amp;#34; to describe, but after brushing teeth, teeth were very clean, is much better than manual brushing effect.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I was a little concerned it might be too powerful, not a problem at all, but a great electric toothbrush purchase with a bonus travel case.</li>
            <li>I am perfectly happy with the basic level sonicare and don&#x27;t needs lot of different settings, so this brush suits me just fine.  </li>
            <li>basic function, it is enough, very good experience in using</li>
            <li>Besides the cheap price and good speed of direct mail , it does not have any advantages, standby time is short, the sound of vibration is too large, do not suggest to buy.</li>
            <li>this toothbrush was recommended by my dentist for gum care and it really works, very comfortable and easy to use, battery lasts full two weeks before recharge is necessary</li>
            <li>The exchange was fast and efficient, and even included free return</li>
            <li>The travel case and extra brush head are a nice touch</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s been an enjoyable time so far.</li>
            <li>I would say this is definitely worth the investment in your oral health.  </li>
            <li>Philips toothbrush useful, also brought a spare toothbrush head</li>
            <li>Much better than old one with the fat handle.</li>
            <li>expect that most people think that if it vibrates loudly, it is working best.&lt;br</li>
            <li>so I rarely made it before)&lt;br</li>
            <li>So much better than the old version</li>
            <li>This is the first true electric toothbrush that I&#x27;ve had</li>
            <li>So, we&#x27;ll see in about 3 months what the deal is and if it was worth the $50 for this.</li>
            <li>And forget the powerful &amp;#34;sonic&amp;#34; type system.  </li>
            <li>but well worth it.</li>
            <li>This brush was just too powerful for me.</li>
            <li>travel case is extremely useful to hold and protect your brush.</li>
            <li>Works well and gets the fur off close to the gum line better than my old non hypersonic brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>She likes it better than her old one.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m really enjoying using this toothbrush so far.</li>
            <li>i think it is useful for protecting my teeth.</li>
            <li>The thing is powerful.  </li>
            <li>If I had sensitive gums or teeth, I probably wouldn&#x27;t be able to handle it.  </li>
            <li>Quality good, product as expected</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t have as much power as the more expensive models, but it&#x27;s perfect for what I use it for.  </li>
            <li>I did not like the feel, so I gave it to my 13 yr old grand daughter.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s okay for a Sonic Toothbrush, I preferred my Oral B Sonic Complete, I wish I didn&#x27;t throw it away</li>
            <li>people will find it a useful oral hygiene addition.</li>
            <li>Pro, came with two brushes&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Con, more action within the handle than the brush, noisy.</li>
            <li>I bought it for my husband, he said it&#x27;s useful, he like it.</li>
            <li>and I have the $100 Sonicare HealthyWhite already so figured this would be a nice backup since another customer stated they were comparable, just with different heads</li>
            <li>I think this toothbrush is absolutely worth the price.  </li>
            <li>I also liked that it came with an extra head and a travel case.</li>
            <li>Returned this model and purchased the Easy Clean with sensitive brush heads.</li>
            <li>It comes with two brush heads and a travel case worth what I paid - there was a $10 off coupon at the time.  </li>
            <li>it s worth the price.&lt;br /&gt;Also</li>
            <li>It is cheaper and useful</li>
            <li>It comes with a great hard cover travel case that fits the brush and 2 heads, which I find infinitely superior to the older model&#x27;s soft pouch traveling case.</li>
            <li>This gap also means that you have to make sure to clean it regularly to prevent gunk from seeping into the mechanical part of the brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>hx6730 is more quiet and in clean mode</li>
            <li>toothbrush does a great job on cleaning the teeth where it works smoothly, but the brush and handle on it are just too long to give individual teeth the thorough attention I like to give them.  </li>
            <li>I am still using the original brush head, very endurable.&lt;br /&gt;Recharges</li>
            <li>I feel I have avoided significant expense on tooth and gum work thanks to these brushes.</li>
            <li>Accent slightly, other good</li>
            <li>, right?  </li>
            <li>#34;you don&#x27;t know what you don&#x27;t know&amp;#34;, right?</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t talk right now.</li>
            <li>At the beginning it was all right.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s all right but not that fancy.</li>
            <li>It took some getting used to, but my dentist was right</li>
            <li>Great toothbrush, providing the bare minimum features at a low price.</li>
            <li>This toothbrush is easy for the kids too who never did a good job with a regular brush or one of the low grade electronic toothbrushes.</li>
            <li>My teeth feel really clean, and the 2 minute timer is really helpful.</li>
            <li>It feels, and apparently is, straight from the dentist clean.</li>
            <li>(It emits a rather high pitched sound, guess that is the sonic care part)</li>
            <li>The noise is very large.</li>
            <li>If you want to spend more money for that, be my guest, but the basic 2 minute timer was perfectly adequate for my needs.   </li>
            <li>I like this one much better, it is smaller and faster and does, to me, a better job than my old one.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Finally, the toothbrush in the price is not expensive, the effect also can also, and the 2 brush heads, it is worth buying.</li>
            <li>At this point, it feels perfectly normal and comfortable.</li>
            <li>but pretty powerful and uesful.</li>
            <li>Not nearly as we&#x27;ll made or effective.</li>
            <li>feel a little bit noisy, other wise good</li>
            <li>think the new 1 goes beyond sonic to cheap with the vibration.</li>
            <li>the first couple of times to get the rhythm right without them).  </li>
            <li>This is so loud and the vibration is so strong.  </li>
            <li>Although it is obvious where they cut corners, it is more powerful than it used to be.  </li>
            <li>Not normally this excited over a tooth brush but even my gums feel better.</li>
            <li>easy to accidentally push the button and stop action.</li>
            <li>of the more expensive models look great</li>
            <li>If you want a no-frills, simple and yet effective Sonicare, I&#x27;d really suggest spending the extra 30 bucks and getting the Easy Clean.</li>
            <li>Nothing fancy, just a good old Sonicare brush that will last me another 4 years as the first one did.</li>
            <li>I was honestly worried about my front teeth coming loose</li>
            <li>Like it very much.</li>
            <li>I recommend this product if you want a quality product at a very reasonable price.</li>
            <li>and it certainly does a better job of keeping their little mouthes healthy.</li>
            <li>Good product, There is anotehr upgraded version is a little bit better(with 30s quadrant reminder).</li>
            <li>Although the noise is a little loud,it is a good brush.</li>
            <li>Does not brush like first series, the head piece also keep falling during the brushing time.</li>
            <li>and it does  a better job cleaning my teeth than just a standard toothbrush.  </li>
            <li>This is my first electric toothbrush.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re going from a regular toothbrush to this, it may be ok; otherwise if replacing another electric, keep looking</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll know more about it\s effectiveness after my next check-up and leaning in June.</li>
            <li>I have the higher end model and it doesn&#x27;t rattle.  </li>
            <li>I decided I would get her a current model expecting it to be better in all aspects</li>
            <li>Thought this was a higher lever Sonicare.  </li>
            <li>; Make sure to learn the proper technique for using a Sonicare brush!</li>
            <li>The brush feels slightly funny to me</li>
            <li>and I am glad I made my next brush a Sonicare.</li>
            <li>Also, compared to the OralB brush this one is way better, the head is smaller and doesn&#x27;t feel like you are shoving a a shovel in your mouth.</li>
            <li>And the first time I use this toothbrush I get blood.</li>
            <li>Long lasting and great acceleration.  </li>
            <li>Exactly as described.</li>
            <li>, just make sure that you check that option because when ordering there where 3 different ones I could choose from, like a xmas addition or something.</li>
            <li>;)</li>
            <li>Exactly as described.  </li>
            <li>First electric toothbrush and I will never go back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>nice very good.but,the charging time is so long.</li>
            <li>I won&#x27;t be able to comment on its effectiveness until after my next dental check-up, which is a couple of months from now.</li>
            <li>When I tried a &amp;#34;barely touch&amp;#34; method (actually, didn&#x27;t even feel like I was touching my teeth)</li>
            <li>Sounds funny I know, and I suppose it is if you were looking at me.  </li>
            <li>Makes brushing my teeth so much easier!</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t really like it!</li>
            <li>When I comment, I found there are many same issues.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It tickles at first</li>
            <li>Teeth feel cleaner and gums, especially are massaged and kept healthy.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m pretty bummed as I was thinking</li>
            <li>Higher priced sonicare toothbrushes come with timer features etc.</li>
            <li>Since that played out I bought this Sonicare and at first it&lt;br /&gt;tickled</li>
            <li>This too many series from Philips such as HX62xx/HX65xx/HX60xx something like that.</li>
            <li>Pony up and buy the higher end model from Costco or something.</li>
            <li>I wanted to get a quantifiable measure of how loud, so I downloaded a free decibel meter to my phone.  </li>
            <li>I really like this brush!</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t used the case yet, but glad to have it for my next travel.</li>
            <li>My teeth felt like I had just gone in for cleaning after first use.  </li>
            <li>I was used to with my first gen sonicare brush...</li>
            <li>This one does not have the 4x30 sec timer, but honestly, I didn&#x27;t want that as I pull the toothbrush out way before that just to spit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Yeah, it does a better job, and the first couple brushes did make a big difference, but</li>
            <li>Exactly what I was expecting.</li>
            <li>Brush head is different - but works OK.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the first time for me to use an ultrasonic toothbrush.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll know for sure next month when I go to the dentist, which they do recommend this brand.</li>
            <li>My first automatic Toothbrush.</li>
            <li>After several months, I&#x27;m absolutely in love with my Sonicare toothbrush.</li>
            <li>I love my Sonicare toothbrush and can&#x27;t imagine going back to anything else.  </li>
            <li>I tried it several days and it didn&#x27;t get better.  </li>
            <li>my first electric toothbrush</li>
            <li>This is the most basic and inexpensive Sonicare model I could find!  </li>
            <li>It is powerful yet gentle on the gums.</li>
            <li>Self timer is great for brushing long enough.</li>
            <li>Has a loud sound, but does its job.</li>
            <li>This is my first electric toothbrush so the first two times I had to get use to it</li>
            <li>I love that it lets me know when I&#x27;ve brushed two minutes by shutting off.  </li>
            <li>My first electro toothbrush.</li>
            <li>I had one of the first soicare and used it for 10 years.</li>
            <li>At first I thought, well, maybe this one needs a &amp;#34;break in&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>This is the first electric toothbrush I&#x27;ve ever owned.  </li>
            <li>SO much happier!</li>
            <li>As the basic type of Sonicare,it is ok.</li>
            <li>Same as most stated.</li>
            <li>First electric toothbrush I&#x27;ve ever had.  </li>
            <li>Things have a loud, for the first time to use are not used to, but it does the brush clean.</li>
            <li>clean my teeth very well, normally.  </li>
            <li>Residue and bubbles are the easiest to clean and they do NOT go near the motor.</li>
            <li>The vibration of the brush is vary good though must be careful if you have sensitive teeth.  </li>
            <li>The first one to go out was about 4+ years old, not bad in my book.  </li>
            <li>it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will be replacing this with a much nicer model now that I&#x27;ve learned you have to shell out quite a bit more money to get a seemingly simple product.</li>
            <li>A friend told me not to spring for a more expensive model because all Philips Sonicare toothbrushes are a good bet</li>
            <li>and I don&#x27;t want to be bothered with the return, but I would advise anyone in the market to spend the extra and get a better quality toothbrush, something with a sturdier charging port and much quieter.  </li>
            <li>It does have the Easy-Start feature where it gently increases power over the first 14 uses to allow you to get use to the vibration as it can be a bit weird/tickly at first.  </li>
            <li>But if you want the real deal, spend the extra money and get a better model.</li>
            <li>Great toothbrush, but be aware that the brush head is much smaller than other sonicare toothbrushes.</li>
            <li>and this takes much less effort and does a better job!</li>
            <li>there is a difference- reviews I read said they are pretty much alike.</li>
            <li>she loves it thus mission accomplished ;)</li>
            <li>I am a China users, this is my first time in USA Amazon bought straight mail mail to China goods.</li>
            <li>Cord management is becoming an issue in the bathroom with 2 toothbrushes, flosser, razor, Kindle, WiFi extender, &amp; hair dryer, We need a universal charger!</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s okay as long as it works.</li>
            <li>I waited anxiously for the good news that my teeth had improved.</li>
            <li>It makes my teeth looking white, feeling clean, and my mouth smelling fresh.</li>
            <li>I have a Sonicare Healthy White toothbrush and an older model with screw in brushes:  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t particularly like Healthy White because of the reminder noise every 30 seconds.  </li>
            <li>Great battery life, the automatic shut off makes sure I always brush for 2 minutes (something thats hard to do if your running late) and my teeth feel supremely smooth after brushing.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t seem to get the toothbrush at the back of my bottom teeth at the right angle to clean them well.  </li>
            <li>I like this a lot, because it lets me easily reach the back molars without difficulty.</li>
            <li>With this model, cleaning is simple and easy.  </li>
            <li>Easy to use, but the noise is larger</li>
            <li>vibrates like hell (they are meant too though), only issue I had is the head piece has a bur in the plastic that scratched the inside of my gums...  can easily grind it off or sand it</li>
            <li>Vibration is strong enough!</li>
            <li>The brush is very loud, but for the price i think its worth it</li>
            <li>This certainly the cheaper model but</li>
            <li>This toothbrush certainly wont help you towards that goal.</li>
            <li>Noise is relatively large</li>
            <li>The good is that the heads are smaller and costs slightly less to replace and easier to clean up and not have to deal with the gunk that gets stuck in the older model.</li>
            <li>I resisted for a year, then finally caved in bought a Sonicare toothbrush as a new year&#x27;s resolution (to take better care of my teeth).&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>It has the same cleaning power as the pricier versions and I love to new brush heads that came with this one.</li>
            <li>It is a universal voltage products, completely suitable for China&#x27;s 220 v voltage, is very convenient and brushing your teeth are clean, is really not generally experience, particularly in the us</li>
            <li>We both love our new toothbrushes and it really does make a big difference!</li>
            <li>The handle and inner workings themselves are just fine.</li>
            <li>Spend a little bit more and get a higher end model!</li>
            <li>Nice but a little abrasive.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t vibrate or clean as well as the next higher model.  </li>
            <li>so fast,to china only 13 days,it so well so fast so cheap</li>
            <li>Going from a regular brush to this is a huge step up and will leave you wondering why you haven&#x27;t purchased one sooner.</li>
            <li>I really like this product</li>
            <li>It is very noisy.</li>
            <li>and I knew the replacement heads would be much cheaper...</li>
            <li>fast shiped&lt;br</li>
            <li>They leave a gap at the bottom and are much noisier than the screw on type heads.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very good!I like it.</li>
            <li>Very cost-effective products, I very like it.</li>
            <li>I also really like that this has inductive charging which means that there is nothing to plug in, just set your brush on the holder and it will charge.  </li>
            <li>i like this very much&lt;br</li>
            <li>Too much noise.</li>
            <li>it is  very good,and convenient to carry</li>
            <li>I bought this for my brother for Christmas, he boasted so much about it that I had to give it a try.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this toothbrush!</li>
            <li>haha.</li>
            <li>It works very well.  </li>
            <li>My teeth feel much cleaner than with a non-electric toothbrush.  </li>
            <li>Mine is much louder than the one I saw in video,</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall I really am liking the toothbrush</li>
            <li>WAY TOO INTENSE.</li>
            <li>but she said the toothbrush was the same one she had at home, but it didn&#x27;t sound like mine</li>
            <li>I real received one is HX6210......</li>
            <li>The toothbrush is very noise during using it.</li>
            <li>Wow, this thing is powerful.  </li>
            <li>I am really satisfied&lt;br /&gt;Want</li>
            <li>too much noisy！i cannot stand it！only one reason that i bought</li>
            <li>The sound is very big</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used one for years and it works well in removing stains and preventing plaque while being gentle on the gums</li>
            <li>These products really good.&lt;br</li>
            <li>They love it and think I spent three times what i did for it.</li>
            <li>Too much effort for that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It did not bother me much</li>
            <li>that I really don&#x27;t care for.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t bother me much, but I figure it should be brought to everyone&#x27;s attention.</li>
            <li>the inside of my mouth almost too much.  </li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t believe how much cleaner and whiter</li>
            <li>do not really &amp;#34;feel&amp;#34; like this Sonicare is brushing my teeth any better than my Oral B did.  </li>
            <li>but I&#x27;d much prefer the quieter hum</li>
            <li>fast shipping .</li>
            <li>Works very well.  </li>
            <li>If your looking for an electronic toothbrush really consider purchasing.</li>
            <li>This seems to work really well.  </li>
            <li>It holds a charge very well.  </li>
            <li>It came post haste packaged very well like always from Amazon.  </li>
            <li>and I really like the travel case.  </li>
            <li>The effect is very good,love it</li>
            <li>Too much noise it makes, did</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t look like it&#x27;ll do much.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t really understand what&#x27;s going on with this product.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m beginning to think it&#x27;s much cheaper than it sells for.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not whisper quiet, but it&#x27;s not annoying.</li>
            <li>I bought this much cheaper Sonicare toothbrush.  </li>
            <li>So those feature weren&#x27;t really doing anything for me</li>
            <li>used really good.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Fast shipping</li>
            <li>Doesnt need to be charged very often, and the heads are not showing much wear after 2 months of use.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>I tried this because I had heard so much about Sonicare.  </li>
            <li>I think the light should stay on when it is plugged in and charged since you can&#x27;t tell if the charger is actually receiving power.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>really cleans your teeth and helps remove what flossing misses</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s basic, one button and one light.  </li>
            <li>Works very well.  </li>
            <li>very well!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Once your battery is running low, the unit will notify you by vibrating a couple of times, the battery light will also flash.</li>
            <li>much cheaper than in Tianchao</li>
            <li>Had another Sonicare with multi-speeds and was cumbersome to turn off and on and to even know which speed you were really on.  </li>
            <li>Vibrates way too much.  </li>
            <li>However, this one is VERY noisy...</li>
            <li>Much lighter than the elite e series.</li>
            <li>I wish you could change the pressure, the vibration is almost to intense</li>
            <li>I really couldn&#x27;t be happier with this.</li>
            <li>I really feel like my teeth are much cleaner after using this</li>
            <li>I really like it.</li>
            <li>My kid really likes it and uses  twice a day.</li>
            <li>but, it just doesn&#x27;t work well at all, and the vibration is really</li>
            <li>test you can perform is to place the brush head under a gentle stream of water from a faucet, and observe what happens to the water when the toothbrush is activated.  </li>
            <li>This one doesn&#x27;t do much at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It make too much noise after 2 month used.</li>
            <li>It is very convenient.</li>
            <li>The delivery is fast.</li>
            <li>that&#x27;s how much this thing vibrates.</li>
            <li>This one us very under powered even when fully charged..</li>
            <li>But it lasts much longer when fully charged as Compared to Oral B which my wife uses.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li>is if you apply too much pressure the pulse will stop so it reminds you to be gentle on your gums and</li>
            <li>But it&#x27;s really too noise</li>
            <li>Thanks.</li>
            <li>it makes so much noisy .</li>
            <li>but I was very disapointed to find that it did not have the feature (quadpacer?)</li>
            <li>brush feels just as effective as my Sonicare FlexCare, which is an older model, but costs way less.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to keep clean, and the charger is small, so it easily fits next to my sink.    </li>
            <li>After years of using the higher end version, thought, I can know when the 30 seconds are up to move to the new section of my mouth...</li>
            <li>Easy to carry, battery life is amazingly long, and I keep finding coupons for the replacement heads.</li>
            <li>The general feeling，But worthy of the price</li>
            <li>Good product, I have had better toothbrushes, but with the price of this, you can&#x27;t go wrong!</li>
            <li>and the first time my teeth were very sensitive to it.  </li>
            <li>Your teeth will feel clean for the whole day, night and even the next morning!</li>
            <li>Noisy, brush head is not durable, other ok.</li>
            <li>In my last trip to Thailand 5 months ago my sonic toothbrush died as there was no travel case but this time it was neat and 100% working thanks to the special case</li>
            <li>Paid a few dollars more and get one model higher.</li>
            <li>My only gripe with this toothbrush is that I have to take off the head and clean out the brush and head with a Q-tip to prevent mold from building up.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The price is attracted,it has the basic function clean and white,and also has a timer.</li>
            <li>It makes your teeth feel as clean as if you left the dentist office.</li>
            <li>My teeth literally feel so clean even the next day!</li>
            <li>My teeth almost feel like I just left the Dentist office and are so sparkly and squeeky clean.</li>
            <li>Just left the dentist feeling clean</li>
            <li>It is very noisy compared to my older model HX6911 Flex Care toothbrush.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t want to spend a ridiculous amount on a toothbrush but still wanted good quality.</li>
            <li>Sound a little big, but very comfortable to use</li>
            <li>I thought this thing knocked out a filling, it was so unbelievably intense &amp; high speed.....</li>
            <li>And to think, if I&#x27;d never had purchased the older model first, I would have never known this and would have given it a few more stars in my review...</li>
            <li>My husband ordered the Waterpik Prime special that was 69.00 and got it on a daily deal for 59.00.</li>
            <li>As other one-star reviewers have mentioned, it vibrates loudly, but it does not clean nearly as effectively as the better ones.  </li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t provide as vigorous of a clean as the older, basic model it is trying to replace.</li>
            <li>It just so happens that I&#x27;m a messy tooth brusher.&lt;br /&gt;Other than occasionally having the plastic part of the brush vibrate against my teeth as I move, brushing is for the most part smooth.</li>
            <li>This is my first Sonicare brush, so I have nothing to compare it to, but it didn&#x27;t seem excessively loud to me.</li>
            <li>A word of warning: When I first started using this toothbrush, the vibrating sensation was almost unbearable to my sensitive teeth.</li>
            <li>Finally, your dentist will stop complaining full time about your grill.</li>
            <li>First time owning an electric toothbrush and wow,</li>
            <li>full battery could just last 7 times...</li>
            <li>Not bad for one who brushes their teeth several times a day.  </li>
            <li>But what I really dont like is it does not clean much better than manual.</li>
            <li>a little sound, but powerful</li>
            <li>Overall good, but a little bit noisy.</li>
            <li>As other reviews have mentioned, I found this brush to rattle and sound cheaply made if not actually defective.  </li>
            <li>My husband really likes the new one, lighter weight and easier for him to handle.</li>
            <li>The sonic feature may be the difference, but it feels more thorough than previous power toothbrushes.</li>
            <li>If you are going to be traveling for less than a week, you should be able to leave the charger at home.</li>
            <li>This unit has only one speed and while it works adequately for what it is, it is the cheaper cheaper version.</li>
            <li>This was a replacement of an older Sonicare.  </li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t vibrate as smoothly as older model.</li>
            <li>I love the idea of a smaller head and a longer neck, to get into the back of your mouth.</li>
            <li>I feel that this model is weaker than the older ones.  </li>
            <li>This one is built cheaper than my older model.</li>
            <li>It replaced an older Sonicare that just stopped working after 4 or 5 years.  </li>
            <li>Every once in awhile I use my manual toothbrush to give myself a quick brush in the middle of the day, but it&#x27;s no comparison to the way my teeth feel after a Sonicare brushing.</li>
            <li>BUT I couldn&#x27;t stand the vibration on my teeth and particularly my lips.  </li>
            <li>so you might need an adapter for traveling to particular</li>
            <li>This particular model is the snap-on head, which I prefer over the screw-on head.  </li>
            <li>I always thought that my manual cleaning was good enough and these things were just a sham to get people&#x27;s money.</li>
            <li>Will edit this if it fails much earlier than I would expect but for now thoroughly impressed with what I got for the price.</li>
            <li>Decent item but</li>
            <li>This is a decent entry level toothbrush.</li>
            <li>However, the new smaller bases can still trap some moisture, although not nearly as bad.  </li>
            <li>But if this one lasts even half as long, it is still a good value.</li>
            <li>you&#x27;re in the market for a high priced unit,</li>
            <li>Also, I highly recommend switching to an electronic tooth brush if you have not already.</li>
            <li>The high freq started off tickling my nose, but I guess I got used to it.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>highly recommend these types of brushes.</li>
            <li>highly recommending it.</li>
            <li>When I turn it on, it no longer vibrates, but instead emits this high pitched ringing noise.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.  </li>
            <li>highly recommend.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d highly recommend this.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>HIGHLY RECOMMEND.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend a Sonicare for anyone...</li>
            <li>I got some new mouthwash and was a more diligent brusher for the next six months until my next cleaning.</li>
            <li>Got it with a very reasonable price, and the international shipment is fast and convenient</li>
            <li>This new model replaced and older Phillips model.  </li>
            <li>The vibrations aren&#x27;t nearly as powerful as the higher end model, it doesn&#x27;t pause every 30 sec.</li>
            <li>The only real difference between this and the DiamondClean edition is a huge price tag and a different head.</li>
            <li>just feel much cleaner and healthier after using this product compared to my old Oral-B electric toothbrush.</li>
            <li>There is a much stronger action them my ancient Braun oscillating toothbrush.  </li>
            <li>Still, both of these are very serviceable and professional machines, not like the 2 Series Plaque.  </li>
            <li>I use it everyday, better than normal tooth brush,&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>does not seen to be heavy duty,but is working ok</li>
            <li>experience is good, except for the big noise, much bigger than expected</li>
            <li>I would have liked the UV cleaning systems but at least the brush head is covered.</li>
            <li>It is not quite as powerful as my last Sonicare toothbrush.</li>
            <li>Bought it to replace the old model healthy white (which quit working after 2 years, it turns itself on for no reason in the middle of the night).</li>
            <li>Sometimes I feel like it&#x27;s not brushing hard enough, but it&#x27;s the right way to brush teeth, not as abrasive as I was doing on my own with a manual brush.  </li>
            <li>This one does everything that the more expensive units do and accepts any of the brushes (including the Diamond Clean} , but the ones with the large heads.  </li>
            <li>If the connection between the brush heads and the toothbrush was just a little bit more snug, I think that would fix the problem with the outrageously loud and intense action.  </li>
            <li>My teeth definitely feel clean after using it, much cleaner than when I use just a regular toothbrush..</li>
            <li>This toothbrush is fine, but I was very surprised that it doesn&#x27;t alert you every 30 seconds to switch quadrants as the other models do.</li>
            <li>Vibration is very big, the noise is very large</li>
            <li>because of the extremely strong vibration, you tend to injury your gum if you press down too</li>
            <li>After filing down the inner metal ring of the brush head it certainly helped minimize the VERY LOUD sympathetic vibrations but did not fix the issue.</li>
            <li>My dentist has been trying to get me to buy a Sonicare for a long time, my old power tooth brush finally died so I got a Sonicare, and it does work a lot better.</li>
            <li>yes its a little loud but not terribly so</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t used it but 4 days looking forward to longer use to see how my cleaning fares to using my new brush</li>
            <li>so I bought a new toothbrush.  </li>
            <li>The Oral-B can be opened up to &amp;#34;recycle&amp;#34; the battery or just solder a new one in it.  </li>
            <li>I met a new world with it.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Husband loves having a new one once again.</li>
            <li>For years, I have literally had a new cavity at every dentist&#x27;s check up.</li>
            <li>so you can get used to it when new.</li>
            <li>Having this new sonicare brush rapidly improved my oral hygiene.</li>
            <li>new users</li>
            <li>This new model also has 30-second and 2-minute alarms as well as a break in program.  </li>
            <li>When this happens, the vibrations get louder, but the actual cleaning action becomes less effective.  </li>
            <li>Thanks Amazon for shipping me fast enough before Christmas.</li>
            <li>I was using a regular manual toothbrush before this, and my oral hygiene really declined because I was so scared of my brushing my teeth very well because of that fractured tooth.</li>
            <li>did (loud &amp; extremely high speed)</li>
            <li>I like it very much, my teeth white now.</li>
            <li>I love Sonicare toothbrushes, but this new &amp;#34;2 Series&amp;#34; design is inferior to past models.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>It slowly ramps up over the first dozen times you use it to get you use to the strong pulsing.</li>
            <li>Exactly what I wanted; a simple electric tooth brush.</li>
            <li>That makes me aware of brushing my all of my teeth properly.  </li>
            <li>I have seen others scrub as they do with manual toothbrushes, and did the same for the first couple of days.</li>
            <li>SO LOUD!</li>
            <li>This thing is priced only slightly cheaper than the older, much much better units.  </li>
            <li>but I am sure I charge it no more than every 2 weeks.</li>
            <li>I have used multiple Sonicare products for years and this was my first dud.</li>
            <li>There are other name brand similar products costing 2X to 3X more that offer identical performance.</li>
            <li>In the first BIG photo there is a &amp;#34;TRAVEL CASE&#x27;.</li>
            <li>Also, another bonus is that you can change out the heads and share it with a significant other.</li>
            <li>just had my first cleaning since November of last year</li>
            <li>Lightweight, small charger base, nice case, good clean.  </li>
            <li>charging station is a little bit flimsy and easy to knock over, but the charge lasts quite a while, so I pull it out to charge it about once a week and then put it away</li>
            <li>This one is just the basic, but I didn&#x27;t need all the bells and whistles, and they all clean the same.</li>
            <li>&quot; The new design of brush head is a considerable improvement on the original models, and they hold a charge extremely well.  </li>
            <li>Toothbrush trial, noise is a little big, but is multi-purpose twice to adapt, have a portable box is also easy to travel!</li>
            <li>If this was not the case I would give this item a 5 star but the sound right now is ridiculous.</li>
            <li>aside, I have no doubt that these will last a long time and my kids will enjoy them.</li>
            <li>I previously used a Sonicare FLEX-Care w/ the UV Light head sanitizing station.</li>
            <li>We&#x27;ve only got the older model to compare it against and by that measure this one feels cheap and very loose.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m disappointed in Philips for trying to cash in on their previously good Sonicare name with a genuinely overpriced piece of junk.  </li>
            <li>Only reason I&#x27;m docking a star is that its pretty loud.</li>
            <li>The battery is full use of time is short, can only use about 3 days.</li>
            <li>I finally broke down and bought this and love it.  </li>
            <li>The old Sonicare brush is over 12 years old and the only reason he was willing to get a new one was because the battery is dying on the old one.</li>
            <li>Not previously used the electric toothbrush, for the first time, trust Philips quality, feeling than the ordinary toothbrush to clean, send a brush head</li>
            <li>This brush is great and feels like it&#x27;s cleaning at least twice as well as the previous brushes used.</li>
            <li>Cleans better and faster than my previous model, but the charge does not last as long.&lt;br /&gt;Loud , but efficient.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been a loyal sonicare user for 10 yrs and have used multiple different models.  </li>
            <li>, it will get your gums sore, because of the vibrations and whatnot, but it has a easy start, which slowly eases you into the fast bristle movement.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Its fine, makes a lot of noise - more so than other similar styles ive had in the past.</li>
            <li>This is possibly a defective unit, and will certainly be returned.  </li>
            <li>May be because is the first time I use an electric toothbrush, I feel its vibration amplitude is a bit big, other good, in addition to charging is slow</li>
            <li>handle is a little more compact to me than the earlier versions.</li>
            <li>the only thing I miss over the more costly one, which lasted me over 8 years, is the lack of quadrant timers - the little pause that tells you when to move on.  </li>
            <li>I take my oral health pretty seriously and finally asked my hygienist what I could do since I thought I was doing much better.</li>
            <li>I love how it gets through all the hard to reach places.</li>
            <li>Maybe it&#x27;s not as powerful because these have NI-MH battery pack instead of the Li-Ion on the more expensive model.</li>
            <li>Looking at them it is clearly a design flaw.</li>
            <li>So if you have sensitive teeth, be prepared for a brief \\&quot;breaking in\\&quot; period, but stick with it, because it&#x27;s very temporary.</li>
            <li>The vibration is intense enough that two of the people I gave one to wont use it (they are a couple</li>
            <li>Maneuverability is important for a few reasons.</li>
            <li>I was pleasantly surprised as to the quality and</li>
            <li>At that point I began researching and realized that I had the old style model...</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m completely awestruck.</li>
            <li>The professional version seems to vibrate faster than this version.  </li>
            <li>The brush head is fairly soft.</li>
            <li>heads are loud when you insert them in -</li>
            <li>This is what makes the brush loud - the connection where the brush head vibrates.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used Sonicare since the early 1990s</li>
            <li>be a bit loud</li>
            <li>Direct mail to China is about 220 yuan.</li>
            <li>I used this to replace an old Braun version.  </li>
            <li>Quite loud and rattles quite a bit.</li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t be happier with this purchase, the real question is why didn&#x27;t I switch to an electronic toothbrush earlier.</li>
            <li>Used it for around two months before it stops working completely before March 2015.</li>
            <li>few weeks before it failed, when it start to make chirpy sounds and flashing amber light while charging, I have to take it off the charger in order to get a good night sleep.</li>
            <li>And it can make me to brush my teeth completely.</li>
            <li>These are so much weaker than any Sonicare toothbrush I&#x27;ve ever used (I&#x27;ve been using various models of Sonicare for over 10 years now).  </li>
            <li>My old Sonicare was getting grungy and the rubber grip was falling apart</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d say over 2 weeks without having to put it in the chager.&lt;br /&gt;The brush heads far exceeded my expectations.</li>
            <li>my old Oral B had that changed the vibration every 30 seconds</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s basic but has the 2-minute timer which is what I really wanted.</li>
            <li>It is so loud you can&#x27;t use it.</li>
            <li>Loud.</li>
            <li>Loud.</li>
            <li>Loud.  </li>
            <li>far as the leaving the dentist feeling, I&#x27;ll call b/s on that one.  </li>
            <li>Old style heads</li>
            <li>My hand moves around on the handle and turns the product off  frequently while in use.</li>
            <li>brush is soft and durable.</li>
            <li>Haven&#x27;t learned how to use this brush nearly as efficiently.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;As far as the functionality of the toothbrush is concerned...</li>
            <li>I have extremely sensitive gums that bleed, every time I brush them.</li>
            <li>My teeth also tend to yellow, and be very resistant to whitening products.</li>
            <li>The toothbrush is a bit loud.</li>
            <li>I bought this for my wife whose old Sonicare quit working.  </li>
            <li>but what I&#x27;ve seen so far on the pricing may make me try non-Phillips brands...</li>
            <li>Under &#x27;frequently bought together&#x27; is shows a TRAVEL CASE.  </li>
            <li>If you have a sensitive mouth, this might not work for you.</li>
            <li>the handle is charging a green light blinks.</li>
            <li>Expect my next teeth cleaning to be much shorter.</li>
            <li>What a difference this brush has made to my teeth feeling much fresher and cleaner overall.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t believe how loud this thing is--</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s THAT loud.</li>
            <li>It is loud when on for the 2 min.</li>
            <li>After using it I feel like I&#x27;ve just been to a professional dental cleaning.</li>
            <li>but the noise is too loud. thx~</li>
            <li>and I really like the travel case and extra toothbrush head.  </li>
            <li>Not recommend it if you are sensitive to noise.</li>
            <li>I just dont like how loud it is</li>
            <li>number of the favorable reviewers have suggested that it is nearly identical to the fancier Sonicare units, just without the bells &amp; whistles.  </li>
            <li>I used my brother&#x27;s old Braun for a while before I ran out of brush heads.</li>
            <li>I have been using this brush once a day, just before bed, ever since it arrived in early January.</li>
            <li>Bought for 21 yr old son, it is louder than our Oral B ones, but he said it doesn&#x27;t bother him.</li>
            <li>I would give this 5 stars if it wasn&#x27;t so loud.  </li>
            <li>Too loud.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s too noisy somehow,  dont expect too much on it, but since it is a basic model, it does its job</li>
            <li>So far it has worked well</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t care too much for it and went back to manual.</li>
            <li>My old Sonicare had that feature</li>
            <li>tooth brush is good, but bristles are a bit expensive.</li>
            <li>The sonicare is good to use,but the toothbrush head is expensive</li>
            <li>Now, I do have a few other steps I take, but this is a very important one in the whole process.</li>
            <li>and overall I like the product other than one huge flaw.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to carry because the small box,then I can take it when out for travelling.</li>
            <li>have been free of cavities and other dental problems and my dental visits are basic cleaning every 2 years because I was using Or*lB</li>
            <li>I bought the more expensive sonicare from costco but don&#x27;t use all its modes, this is pretty much the same thing but</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to use, and the price is half what my dentist charges for the same product.</li>
            <li>The head on the brush is small enough to get around in my mouth and after getting used to the sound, I really do like the way my teeth felt.  </li>
            <li>This has an easy start feature which I really appreciated because my gums were not ready for the cleaning power that this little thing possesses.  </li>
            <li>not LiON kind, weak electronic, magnets, very very budget, not worth it, returned.  </li>
            <li>particular Series 2 brush has a smaller head than the comparable Essence series brush that my roommate owns.</li>
            <li>As such, there is an optional setting that begins with minimal vibration and gradually increases over two weeks to full power.</li>
            <li>Cheap feeling, excessive vibration of the handle, loud.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s lightweight and shuts off after 2 minutes, so you know exactly when you&#x27;ve brushed enough.</li>
            <li>but I never used the other modes like gum care or refresh, I only ever used the clean mode.  </li>
            <li>The toothbrush head pop right on and off and doesn&#x27;t screw on like other models I&#x27;ve</li>
            <li>would highly recommend this version as it doesn&#x27;t have all the bells and whistles that likely wouldn&#x27;t use anyway.  </li>
            <li>Overall, the new brush does not seem as sturdy or as well made as my old one.</li>
            <li>A little noisy but works better than the quiet model I had of the same brand.</li>
            <li>Exactly what I expected.</li>
            <li>It feels like it really cleans at the gum line, although only my dental hygienist will have the final say on its effectiveness.  </li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t careful enough when I bought it as a travel brush and didn&#x27;t notice there was no mention of the quadpacer feature, which IMHO is extremely useful in signaling when to change section.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve already tossed the case in my bag a few times to take the toothbrush to work with me for a quick brush after lunch.</li>
            <li>However, it is very noisy, unlike the more expensive one.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Either of those models would be far superior to this one; it&#x27;s really disappointing that Philips makes and sells this.  </li>
            <li>Also, the handle is thicker and the weight is lighter than the Flexcare, and I don&#x27;t feel that this one has quite as much power or something, but that could be due to the different brush head or the model, not sure which, but I doubt it really affects the quality of the clean and I&#x27;ll get used to it in time.</li>
            <li>If they could include this feature in the very old, basic model, why did they remove it?  </li>
            <li>This all you need, all other higher price model is just for gimmicks.</li>
            <li>, you get an extra brush head - which by the way, the NEWER sets usually do NOT come w/</li>
            <li>While the brush is ok itself, the battery is weak though.</li>
            <li>only things that I don&#x27;t necessarily love about this brush is that the head is a little smaller than the e-series, but there are bigger heads that you can get.  </li>
            <li>It makes too much noise and sounds like the battery is loose inside the brush housing.</li>
            <li>The new model had a different design that sheds water instead of pooling it in the older magnet pocket (which always caused the growth of mold unless the brush head was removed each time and the cavity allowed to dry).  </li>
            <li>Nowhere near as much vibration as my other Sonicares have had.</li>
            <li>The brushhead that came with the product does not even fit well, there is a half inch gap and water and toothpaste gets into the brushhead and on the toothbrush and crusts there if you dont spend an extra ten minutes cleaning it after every use.</li>
            <li>I had an older version that I had for a long time.  </li>
            <li>The noise is relatively large, the charge is not very convenient.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very loud, rickety, weak, and cheaply made.  </li>
            <li>and we both said same thing it completely changed our mouth</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m going back to my old Braun Oral B.  </li>
            <li>My old unit just died after years of use - this is nothing close to the quality of the prior sonicare.  </li>
            <li>It barely vibrates.</li>
            <li>My old brush was solid.</li>
            <li>Now after barely 4 months, it has stopped working.</li>
            <li>[See photo]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Second issue, probably related, this toothbrush is extremely loud.  </li>
            <li>Seams are irregular, loud handle vibration is matched by reduced power in the mouth, larger and heavier.  </li>
            <li>finally, after a visit, I went directly to my computer and ordered one from Amazon.  </li>
            <li>The units works well and is an appropriate size, however, it does not clean as thoroughly as the previous Sonicare toothbrush I had.</li>
            <li>I had a very old, basic Sonicare electric toothbrush that finally died, so I bought this to replace it.  </li>
            <li>with a single normal mode.</li>
            <li>Its so much louder than I expected it to be!</li>
            <li>; however other than that no problems, I really like the included travel case</li>
            <li>The 7 yr-old needed a little help to get used to the brush and to be able to turn it in her mouth, but once she got it after a few days</li>
            <li>If this issue were fixed, this would be a 5 star product today - especially considering I got them for only $29.99</li>
            <li>the past my Sonicare toothbrushes have lasted roughly 3 years so at the price, I have lower expectations for longevity but its easy to replace.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t at this time give it 5 stars, only because I need to spend a little more time with it, plus I want to see if the little space where the head joins the handle is going to be gross with time.  </li>
            <li>For the first time I used it,  my baby was waken up and kept crying......</li>
            <li>However, I&#x27;m not sure that this model is even worth that</li>
            <li>Perhaps a good thing that it&#x27;s powerful, but it shakes violently and I would assume that the brush head being loose only contributes to this problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Much improved over the previous model, which accumulated gunk inside the handle.</li>
            <li>Was previously using a much nicer Oral-B and have no complaints.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m late to the bandwagon with electric toothbrushes but caught up quick with this one.</li>
            <li>Really cleans down deep.</li>
            <li>The heads are small enough to get in the very back, the handles are not too heavy, and you get the main effect of sonic waves to clean like all Sonicare brushes.</li>
            <li>Now, I&#x27;m not sure if maybe I got a defective one, as I noticed it wasn&#x27;t holding it&#x27;s charge very long and also didn&#x27;t stay on for the full two minutes.</li>
            <li>Ordered this Philips Sonicare HX6212/05, but received a HX6210 model that has a loose and loud vibrating mechanism.  </li>
            <li>To my great disappointment I got all the plaque and in less time by brushing manually.&lt;br</li>
            <li>charger is smaller than previous versions of Sonicare brush chargers - not too much, but noticeable to me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It hurts and is incredibly loud like there is loose plastic when vibrating.&lt;br /&gt;There is no 30 second pacing which I sorely miss.&lt;br</li>
            <li>hope Philips re-thinks this new design and does not expand it to other models.</li>

            <li> It is an ORIGINAL Phillips Sonicare and works GREAT!</li>
            <li> Toothbrush works well and does an excellent job in keeping teeth clean.</li>
            <li> A direct mail shopping very good, four days from the ocean to reach the destination, very happy</li>
            <li> It works great, as good as the top of the line unit I have at home, but it does not have the timer built into it.  </li>
            <li> This is a very good toothbrush and the price is fantastic.</li>
            <li> Very satisfied with the rest of items.</li>
            <li> I had a cheaper electric toothbrush and now I am very satisfied with Sonicare.  </li>
            <li> and I must say, Sonicare has done a great job bringing UltraSonic brushing technology to a more affordable level without sacrificing quality.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Very satisfied</li>
            <li> I did the research and according to what I read this brush is a great value and performs in the top of its class.</li>

            <li> Outstanding value!</li>
            <li> Amazing product at an amazing price.</li>
            <li> This toothbrush feels great and has made a huge difference in my dental hygiene.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall this is great for your teeth,&lt;br /&gt;maybe not for the light sleepers around me,&lt;br /&gt;but</li>
            <li> Amazing product.</li>
            <li> Well, my wife noticed and soon wanted one of her own.  </li>
            <li> I always had heard about the Sonicare and how effective they were.</li>
            <li> But the prince may be nice.</li>
            <li> Great buy for sure :)</li>
            <li> travel case is nice too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All</li>
            <li> Liked the toothbrush, also recommend it to friends</li>
            <li> Great gift for globe-trotting kids--just make sure they have the appropriate plug for non-US electrics</li>
            <li> Would be nice to hear from Amazon on this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> nice to hold.</li>
            <li> Charge lasts for weeks-very nice.</li>
            <li> -------update after 5 weeks use----- I honestly just feel betrayed.  </li>
            <li> The case was a nice bonus too because we are always staying overnight somewhere.</li>
            <li> and you can&#x27;t beat the price with a nice travel case included.</li>
            <li> Battery gets drained way to fast not that happy with my purchase after all!!!</li>
            <li> We liked it that</li>
            <li> I still kind of use both</li>
            <li> not the kind like leaving the dentist.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The travel storage case is handy.</li>
            <li> glad a good deal doeseo</li>
            <li> This products is really nice~~~</li>
            <li> The rechargeable feature is nice.</li>
            <li> It is HIGHLY effective and is</li>
            <li> She liked it</li>
            <li> Liked the storage cover for the bristle end</li>
            <li> While I liked them, the battery lives were abysmal.</li>
            <li> This is kind of handy, it comes with the travel case.</li>
            <li> Nice package.</li>
            <li> so I can effectively brush my teeth, but still avoid the fractured tooth.</li>
            <li> I am able to maintain superior oral hygiene but avoid my extraction and implant tooth site while it is healing.</li>
            <li> Nice shopping practice</li>
            <li> Its a nice size</li>
            <li> it took him some time to warm up to it</li>
            <li> a nice buzzing gum massage)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Also liked the look of the 2 series as it appeared to be slimmer.  </li>
            <li> Anyway, I kind of was hoping I could save some money and get this model</li>
            <li> nice price!&lt;br /&gt;high rate</li>
            <li> Nice for the replacement.</li>
            <li> Nice as a muscle relaxer...</li>
            <li> I am LOVING this product.</li>
            <li> how good this device is... got my teeth really clean and bright.  </li>
            <li> Very good, very practical, I very love</li>
            <li> Great toothbrush...gets that clean feeling after brushing.  </li>
            <li> The new one is excellent.</li>
            <li> Was very happy with the Essence but wanted to get a new model because the mold that grows inside the brush heads for the Essence was grossing me out.</li>
            <li> Good experience and easy to use.</li>
            <li> Super happy</li>
            <li> Very strong vibration.</li>
            <li> I like Philips electric toothbrush, so I am very easy to protect my teeth every day.</li>
            <li> and I can honestly feel that it does remove six times more plague than my manual did.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Buy cheap hangeo well as a good product.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you.</li>
            <li> HOWEVER, honestly, I find that the E series brushes have more power, and it felt stronger.  </li>
            <li> I feel good that I&#x27;m taking care of my teeth the best that I can to keep them as healthy as possible.  </li>
            <li> Good price, good quality, and fast service!</li>
            <li> love love love my sonic!</li>
            <li> Incredible, mouth so clean, specially if you get the air/mouthwash water pic.</li>
            <li> The toothbrush is really cheap, and really good, love Philips</li>
            <li> Great product at great price.. Would definitely recommend.</li>
            <li> stars for the design (good shape, good handling and very slim).&lt;br /&gt;5</li>
            <li> Great product to have as a first time electric toothbrush.</li>
            <li> Great product this is the first electric tooth brush.</li>
            <li> Great product and fast shipping!</li>
            <li> True, it does not have the bells &amp; whistles (a good thing, IMHO),</li>
            <li> Although very cheap, but the quality is unstable.</li>
            <li> Very light buildup and virtually no inflammation.</li>
            <li> Very comfortable to use.</li>
            <li> Easy to use, effective.</li>
            <li> Good stuff, quickly shipping.</li>
            <li> It is like having had a good cleaning at the dentist.&lt;br /&gt;Tartar build-up and gums are super healthy.</li>
            <li> The brush threads are high quality and clean your teeth beautifully!</li>
            <li> Seems good, but it makes too much noise!!</li>
            <li> Now if the replacement heads were cheaper that would be a huge + !</li>
            <li> practice many of these things can be improved or prevented.</li>
            <li> feel more sonic power.</li>
            <li> I love it</li>
            <li> I also like the fact that it seems to be water resistant as I use it in the shower mostly.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d prefer a more stable charger but functions</li>
            <li> okay :)</li>
            <li> Love how my teeth feel.  </li>
            <li> My gums and teeth feel so much better.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using one for 15 years or more, and I used to have gum issues, soreness and inflammation, but have had not one instance since using this toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;d give it more than five stars if I could.</li>
            <li> I travel a lot and love that there is a dedicated carrying case for the unit.</li>
            <li> Make sure to hold the handle</li>
            <li> Make sure to angle the brush head upwards or downwards to stimulate the gums and saliva.</li>
            <li> After owning this toothbrush for two months I can successfully say that it is the best one I&#x27;ve ever owned, though in full disclosure I&#x27;ve only ever owned cheap electrics and manual toothbrushes.  </li>
            <li> This toothbrush is the entry level model, for sure.</li>
            <li> ;.... okay.</li>
            <li> price is also much better</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad I did!&lt;br</li>
            <li> I think the waterpik is better.</li>
            <li> Why spend more on fancier models with timers and what not.</li>
            <li> And its function is OK</li>
            <li> love the sensation of brushing my teeth, it makes the task much more enjoyable</li>
            <li> Better than going to the dentist to have my teeth cleaned.</li>
            <li> she said my fillings were okay</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> So glad I did.  </li>
            <li> Cute.</li>
            <li> Love Sonicare and had one for years.  </li>
            <li> Well, the product is ok for cleaning.</li>
            <li> Not as great as the Healthy White, but still a really good toothbrush.</li>
            <li> Love that I don&#x27;t need to keep it plugged in.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s ok, but the bottom line is that it discourages me from using this tooth</li>
            <li> They are well built and do a better job of cleaning my family&#x27;s teeth</li>
            <li> but it is more money.</li>
            <li> &#x3D;)</li>
            <li> I love this toothbrush.</li>
            <li> I bought for my parents and they love it.</li>
            <li> Like the smaller headed brush; works great!</li>
            <li> I like it much more than the rotating head brushes.</li>
            <li> It is okay if it works as it should.</li>
            <li> We both like the Sonicare better than the Oral B</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> I had a Braun circular brush for many years.  </li>
            <li> My first, nice electric toothbrush and I am very pleased.</li>
            <li> It is a worthwhile investment for those of us who want to take care of our teeth and maintain them for life.</li>
            <li> I like this a lot better.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m perfectly satisfied by this</li>
            <li> So make sure to register your unit.</li>
            <li> :)</li>
            <li> Feels better than a manual toothbrush.</li>
            <li> (manual brush better to mousse the toothpaste)</li>
            <li> It is too noise，high to 75db or more</li>
            <li> That sound level is somewhere between a phone ringtone and an alarm clock!  </li>
            <li> She actually said she was impressed!</li>
            <li> being said, I love it and would recommend it.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure I could find 4-ply TP for my ass</li>
            <li> Dental hygienist pleased with results.</li>
            <li> They both work great, but this one is really noisy for some reason.</li>
            <li> Excellent daily and travel toothbrush.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had others I like better.</li>
            <li> Love this Sonicare.  </li>
            <li> I love this toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> I have been using Sonicare for about fifteen years, and I love them.</li>
            <li> better than my panasonic</li>
            <li> This brush works so much better</li>
            <li> I am pleased with this product.</li>
            <li> I love this toothbrush.</li>
            <li> Better than my oral b for sure.</li>
            <li> and this is a lot better.</li>
            <li> Who doesn&#x27;t love sonicare?</li>
            <li> This is our favorite brand to use as the quality is top notch and gets the job done.</li>
            <li> ,i love it</li>
            <li> like the mini container, cute and practical.</li>
            <li> The Braun was much more efficient for me.  </li>
            <li> HX69XX is better more.</li>
            <li> It seems to do a much better job than a battery brush.  </li>
            <li> This does not work much better than a manual toothbrush</li>
            <li> I just could never get myself to spend more than 30 seconds brushing, more than once a day.</li>
            <li> I do feel like my teeth are being cleaned more thoroughly.  </li>
            <li> Love it although somethings</li>
            <li> Feels much better than a manual brush.</li>
            <li> I bought this brush to try because it was inexpensive, compared to the ones sold at most stores.  </li>
            <li> I know people love these toothbrushes</li>
            <li> but it cleans the gum line a lot more efficiently.</li>
            <li> nice and cheap.</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> Still, I am satisfied with my purchase.</li>
            <li> Even battery powered made in china disposable ones are better than this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Even the bottom of the line oralB models are more value for the money.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Sonicare for over a decade and love these toothbrushes.  </li>
            <li> absolutely better than oral-b.</li>
            <li> and I feel that it does a better job at cleaning.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Thanks for a great product.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> works better than others</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> the amazon&#x27;s service is very perfect, also for next time.</li>
            <li> Love this brush, and the carry case it comes with is convenient.</li>
            <li> The simple on-off button is best way to go.  </li>
            <li> I love it</li>
            <li> I love this.</li>
            <li> You get more for your money with the extras..</li>
            <li> I love the Sonicare, although the instruction indicate that after 30 seconds it buzzs to let you know to move to another tooth surface</li>
            <li> I love it .I</li>
            <li> Cheap, practical,Great!</li>
            <li> this represents an OUTSTANDING value.</li>
            <li> I use it twice a day - I&#x27;m pleased with the results, and so is my dentist.</li>
            <li> Enjoy brushing!</li>
            <li> Even better, it has a much better reach than my manual toothbrush.</li>
            <li> but most people don&#x27;t need all the extras.</li>
            <li> I love this product.</li>
            <li> Pretty remarkable.</li>
            <li> And it is lighter and more compact.</li>
            <li> Overall very happy with the purchase!</li>
            <li> I really love it</li>
            <li> 噪音比较大，相比6730,声音大多了。&lt;br /&gt;noise lot more than 6730.</li>
            <li> but i feel it is ok.</li>
            <li> /&gt;This is slimmer, more compact heads, cleaner also cheaper</li>
            <li> i have brought many send to my family,i think it is helpful.</li>
            <li> the rotation is away better  </li>
            <li> (faster, feels more cleaner and more satisfactory)&lt;br</li>
            <li> job is OK.</li>
            <li> The price the toothbrush head is not high, the use is very good, very satisfied.</li>
            <li> It is significantly stronger and feels much more effective.</li>
            <li> particular set is great because you get a travel case (which I love to use when taking w/ me on trips)</li>
            <li> Very powerful toothbrush!  </li>
            <li> So far so good!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great, high frequency, I&#x27;m satisfied with it.</li>
            <li> It sounds good, feels food and generally does a good job, but there is a design flaw:&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> This does a nice job of leaving your teeth feeling clean.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a Prime Subscriber and decided to wait the additional day for delivery to have the travel case (great quality, highly recommended) and the additional brush head included at no additional cost.</li>
            <li> Brushing your teeth is very clean</li>
            <li> He says it makes his teeth feel very clean.</li>
            <li> Pretty good.</li>
            <li> I loved my first sonicare</li>
            <li> The noise is relatively large, but sonic toothbrush with very practical, if can reduce the noise will be very perfect.</li>
            <li> The special bonus pack is very well and the travel case is so beautiful.</li>
            <li> At today&#x27;s cleaning I was told I had a significant improvement!</li>
            <li> bought it at a very cheap price and it is really worthy!</li>
            <li> Soniicare brush is great, like the new styling, no gunk on the inside anymore.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to care for and whitens your teeth better than the strips.</li>
            <li> The case makes it a nice travel brush which is what I wanted it for, but it is nowhere near as good as a Sonicare should be</li>
            <li> A+ It has worked great so far, my teeth love it.</li>
            <li> the BEST price for the money PLUS the Free head and case makes it a double deal!</li>
            <li> Talked my husband into it since I have the more advanced model and LOVE it.</li>
            <li> But it&#x27;s just fine, and nice to have a sonicare easily accessible downstairs, for us.</li>
            <li> Teeth get clean!</li>
            <li> but this thing makes my mouth feel clean and refreshed after every use!</li>
            <li> Clean teeth!</li>
            <li> My teeth have never felt so clean!  </li>
            <li> NOTHING gets my teeth so clean!</li>
            <li> Makes my teeth feel really clean!</li>
            <li> The noise is large, the use of good</li>
            <li> I love how it works, and the lovely, clean feeling produced.  </li>
            <li> My friend bought  the same one, the quality is very good.</li>
            <li> With two replace brush and a travel bag, that&#x27;s very cool.</li>
            <li> Things are very good, need to buy the next time.</li>
            <li> Very good, the span of a voltage adapter is very big, does not require switching power supply.</li>
            <li> Bought it for my vacation house as I have a better model at home and it is fantastic.</li>
            <li> and i love it, although it makes a noisy sound</li>
            <li> It works great and though at times a bit loud...</li>
            <li> It just depends on what you think is more important...</li>
            <li> the ideal fundamental or basic model.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li> I have a sensitive mouth, and while the toothbrush itself has been great, I will consider getting &amp;#34;sensitive brush heads in the future&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Great so far.</li>
            <li> so much for the good.  </li>
            <li> it makes so much noise,but take good care of my tooth</li>
            <li> good toothbrush and reasonable price.</li>
            <li> The toothbrush is good, but too much noise</li>
            <li> It came in a handy travel case which was a useful addition.</li>
            <li> Good deal; reasonable performance.</li>
            <li> The special bonus pack is great since you get a second head and a handy case.  </li>
            <li> The price on CVS and Walgreens and other websites are much&lt;br /&gt;more, great deal !!!!!</li>
            <li> Dental hygienist, orthodontist and the dentist are impressed by how healthy my teeth are and how little plaque there is to scrape.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I think it does a better job than my original one.</li>
            <li> I can travel with it easily.  </li>
            <li> After several days of use, I&#x27;m pleased to report that I am incredibly happy with the performance of this toothbrush.</li>
            <li> Easy to Find Replacement Heads&lt;br /&gt;-&amp;#62; Shuts off after 2 min</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to bring when trip, and can use 2 weeks without charge.</li>
            <li> Easy to charge.</li>
            <li> Easy to use,but it&#x27;s too noisy.</li>
            <li> Easy to use.  </li>
            <li> It really cleaned my teeth exceptionally well.</li>
            <li> Who doesn&#x27;t love clean teeth?</li>
            <li> new.&lt;br /&gt;Very easy to use by just guiding the brush, there is no need to press and &amp;#34;help&amp;#34; it out.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Easy to use, easy to maintain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Easy to use, just a lot of noise.</li>
            <li> This toothbrush is easy to use and sleek when not in use and on the counter.  </li>
            <li> Easy to use and store.</li>
            <li> The brush oscillates laterally instead of rotating and it appears quite easy to break a tooth.</li>
            <li> Went with FlexPlus model, better feel, meant to last, works great.</li>
            <li> It will easily pay for itself in saved dental procedures.</li>
            <li> Cleaning seems convenient and charging is easy.</li>
            <li> But over all it is easy to use</li>
            <li> strong vibration&lt;br /&gt;-Nice</li>
            <li> High speed, good experience.</li>
            <li> but I may have to upgrade to the Easy Clean if it means  being able to enjoy brushing my teeth instead of dreading it.  </li>
            <li> I really feel like I&#x27;m getting a good clean.</li>
            <li> and it is fine.</li>
            <li> It is fine.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m using it in Argentina just fine...</li>
            <li> works fine.</li>
            <li> Item is fine.  </li>
            <li> Fine toothbrush.</li>
            <li> Easy to use, and I feel comfortable after use it in the morning.</li>
            <li> The unit I bought works fine</li>
            <li> in all, it is a good setup if you&#x27;re looking to make the switch from your old analog toothbrush!</li>
            <li> Easy to use and easy to clean.</li>
            <li> I could buy one of their new better units, and would normally be OK with that, but I don&#x27;t want to send Philips any more money after this.</li>
            <li> It certainly cleans your teeth nicely and leaves everything sparkly.</li>
            <li> Works super well and teeth feels very clean.  </li>
            <li> This is the 2nd one I had; honestly the first one lasted almost 8 years!!!!</li>
            <li> It is gentle and soft, and the price is very good.</li>
            <li> It has made a huge difference on my dental hygiene.  </li>
            <li> like that the head on these does not leave a huge crevice for paste and water to get caught in and grow -</li>
            <li> However the toothbrush heads do not fit perfectly...</li>
            <li> it was really cheap (on sale).  </li>
            <li> I smoothly remove food particles and the floss remains intact.</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t like the way the heads fit on this model.</li>
            <li> lightly</li>
            <li> Official instructions say instead to use light pressure and glide the brush along the gumlines.</li>
            <li> And that&#x27;s the important thing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The brush uses UltraSonic sound vibrations to smack plaque off your teeth.</li>
            <li> in all, I feel that this brush is a fantastic value</li>
            <li> , the price is cheap</li>
            <li> and I liked it so much</li>
            <li> (confirmed by my dentist)</li>
            <li> Got this on a cyber Monday deal for cheap because I always wanted to try out an electric toothbrush.</li>
            <li> Picked up for $30 via slickdeals, really great basic electric toothbrush.</li>
            <li> He suggested the Sonicare Easy Clean model for a more powerful vibration.</li>
            <li> They also made a version with a UV light to kill germs</li>
            <li> Really fast and effective electric toothbrush and the price when I bought was un-beatable.</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s convenient and cheap to buy it from Amazon ship to China.</li>
            <li> The great thing is you can use different heads on this unit depending on what your needs are.</li>
            <li> Easy to clean.</li>
            <li> Makes it easy to pack and keeps the heads clean and hygienic.</li>
            <li> Nice and fast and doesn&#x27;t hurt my gum</li>
            <li> The handle is comfortable.</li>
            <li> Brushing has become something I enjoy, 2-3 times a day.</li>
            <li> I liked the results in my teeth so much, that I decided to give it a week.</li>
            <li> Such a great price, I checked the prices of the BRUSH HEADS before ordering and checking all over sites online.</li>
            <li> However, when it is charged the light goes out.  </li>
            <li> Wouldn&#x27;t a larger head be more effective because it could cover more surface area?  </li>
            <li> Whenever I did go to the dentist they would say I had a great oral care regimen and didnt even need deep cleaning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s probably a cheap battery problem.  </li>
            <li> Replaced it with another Sonicare because i felt that was a reasonable life span for this kind of produce.</li>
            <li> This is a great product at any cost, and especially if you catch it on sale.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to use and clean well</li>
            <li> I had been told at my dental checkups to get away from the cheap manual brushes and buy one of these.</li>
            <li> I measured a sound level of 80 dB six inches from my iPad running a sound level ap with an ambient (room) level of about 40 dB.</li>
            <li> The most noticeable difference is that Sonicare is more gentle than Oral-B, in terms of the core motor movement.</li>
            <li> The brushes that came with it are too soft for my taste, but the brushes I use with the flexcare are interchangeable with this unit so all is good.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It is a good feature to have the timer ~ which in all honesty, I have never used ~ for young kids and adults to do quadrants for the recommended time</li>
            <li> I used to own a basic Oral B electric toothbrush that I really liked (Oral B 2000).  </li>
            <li> But I think it&#x27;s still worthy since the special package contains one more brush head and a carrying case.</li>
            <li> teeth feel super clean!</li>
            <li> Ok right now I have had it four days</li>
            <li> Charging station is really cool, and all in all easy to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons.</li>
            <li> when I went to register the unit online, I got another 1-1/2 years extra warranty time added for free!!!</li>
            <li> Very powerful.</li>
            <li> Very powerful.</li>
            <li> My teeth feel amazing and my whole mouth feels totally clean.</li>
            <li> I bought this thinking it would be a nice change or upgrade versus my older model Sonicare.</li>
            <li> I had mild gum disease and my gums bled easily.</li>
            <li> I really like it。I feel like my teeth are becoming more white。</li>
            <li> It allows you to be more precise with your cleaning and work on a smaller area, it also vibrates a lot more and leaves your mouth feeling a lot more clean afterwords.</li>
            <li> 2 weeks after the need to charge, generally speaking good</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve noticed a significant reduction in plaque build-up.</li>
            <li> useful !</li>
            <li> The box is quite useful when travelling!</li>
            <li> I originally started with the E series ones, and have since moved on to this one.  </li>
            <li> too noisy and not sure if this is the best one in market but for $30 bucks I cant complain.</li>
            <li> However, there is a significant difference: the noise.  </li>
            <li> Was originally recommended by my Dentist</li>
            <li> Well worth the price!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m actually excited to see my dentist again, so he can see</li>
            <li> The heads on the Oral B Sonic Complete are more comfortable and cleaned better.</li>
            <li> I hope some of the higher end models have better quality components.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m still running off the original charge.</li>
            <li> so long lol..</li>
            <li> Our other units, models HX6711 and HX5711, both noticeably disrupt the flow; it&#x27;s actually pretty impressive.  </li>
            <li> My original Sonicare 1 lasted over 15 years.</li>
            <li> : there&#x27;s a significant gap between the handle and brush head.</li>
            <li> This is my first time using a electric toothbrush, and I am glad to make that decision!&lt;br /&gt;For</li>
            <li> After 4 years my original Phillips Sonicare gave out.  </li>
            <li> bought it with coupon and sale price, worth every penny!</li>
            <li> product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can feel clean than original toothbrush every times</li>
            <li> translation: doesn&#x27;t clean between the teeth and under the gums as well.  </li>
            <li> and her hygienist told her that her teeth have not ever been this clean</li>
            <li> This gap allows my toothbrush to seep inside and because of this I have to pull out the head every time to wipe that area clean.</li>
            <li> to remove head and clean to prevent molding</li>
            <li> I can feel a noticeable difference in how clean my teeth</li>
            <li> to clean and Maintain.&lt;br /&gt;Huge</li>
            <li> difference in how clean the teeth feel after brushing.</li>
            <li> Makes me teeth clean, and me gums pampered</li>
            <li> Keeps my teeth clean.</li>
            <li> It ensures that I clean my teeth for 2 min everytime.</li>
            <li> Keeps teeth clean.</li>
            <li> It makes my teeth feel so clean.</li>
            <li> after purchasing my teeth are gone too clean.</li>
            <li> Anyways, my mouth feels so god damn clean.</li>
            <li> My teeth feel dentist clean every time I use it.</li>
            <li> and I will say my teeth felt clean</li>
            <li> The power flosser heads kept my teeth and gums clean</li>
            <li> which was an issue with the e-series (BTW, if you have an e-series, clean out undre the cap with bleach each time you swap heads, and you won&#x27;t have any funk growing).  </li>
            <li> teeth have never felt cleaner, like just from the dentist clean.</li>
            <li> This brush should be used to clean shoes, not put into your mouth.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think my teeth have every felt so clean.</li>
            <li> The sonicare makes my teeth extremely clean.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It works well and gives a clean feeling when you are done.</li>
            <li> Just received today, a little noise, clean effect is very good</li>
            <li> The whole body has a very cheap feel to it.</li>
            <li> I was so excited to buy this product because it was such a good deal on Amazon and Sonicare is the holy grail of electronic toothbrushes.</li>
            <li> special travel case is a life saver.</li>
            <li> This toothbrush allows me to get a much better clean without using as much pressure.  </li>
            <li> Very convenient, electric toothbrush cleans teeth better.</li>
            <li> It was smaller and lighter, which are good things</li>
            <li> It really is a lot more convenient than manually brushing and it also stops itself after 2 minutes</li>
            <li> Good plug for performance and starting.</li>
            <li> and I did adjust to the Sonic and love it as much as the Waterpik.</li>
            <li> Loving so far.</li>
            <li> It is good , but the noise is a bit bigger.</li>
            <li> it is straight forward, brush your teeth with it and it does a much better job than a manual brush.</li>
            <li> People make more noise than this toothbrush when they are getting ready in the bathroom.</li>
            <li> Very good!&lt;br /&gt;Description As a manual toothbrush is more than 4 times and wipe well.</li>
            <li> Takes much longer to recharge and it a bit noisier and more vibrations to my hand.</li>
            <li> cool looking charging station, etc.  </li>
            <li> The extra brush is in good quality as well.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> It takes around two full days to get a full charge out of the box.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It gradually increases speed over two weeks, you can override this and start it at full speed.</li>
            <li> Couldn&#x27;t resist for such a good price.</li>
            <li> This will work till I get the full size version.</li>
            <li> The full power is what you are going to want to use anyway.  </li>
            <li> too much noise, like I&#x27;m using a electric saw, but effect is ok.</li>
            <li> Good price and came with an extra brush and travel case.  </li>
            <li> I wanted to love this, I really did.</li>
            <li> Considering the price, i think this is not bad.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not bad.  </li>
            <li> A little too strong in the beginning but works great after adaption</li>
            <li> There is an easy start function if you are new to electronic tooth brushes (it eases you into these brushes with vibrations that increase each time you use it until you reach full power); obviously I don&#x27;t need this function, but it would be great if you are just getting started with these brushes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Easy to use and did exactly what a wanted.</li>
            <li> other thing that greatly aggravates me is this is suppose to be a well designed brush yet</li>
            <li> It was a great deal and works just as expected!</li>
            <li> I have ever owned and it gives you that fresh from the dentist clean.</li>
            <li> Price and quality is totally worth it, my teeth feel so clean.</li>
            <li> The clean makes my teeth feel like I&#x27;m fresh from the dentist.</li>
            <li> I am still having difficulty with the strength of the vibrations and pressure I apply to be comfortable in the more sensitive front area.</li>
            <li> Great toothbrush only thing bristles don&#x27;t move the whole head vibrates.</li>
            <li> I think this toothbrush package is a fantastic offer and if you have Prime membership - the free shipping really makes it</li>
            <li> will say one more thing - considering on the package of the box that Sonicare will guarantee you&#x27;ll love it or your money back within 60 days?</li>
            <li> The shake will quickly shake all toothpaste out of it.</li>
            <li> Super product for the price.</li>
            <li> but you get use to it quickly.</li>
            <li> a worthy replacement.</li>
            <li> Brushing is quick.</li>
            <li> It does seem to brush decently, but I was expecting more from all of the Sonicare hype that I had heard.</li>
            <li> Older versions seemed to be more vigorous but this serves the purpose</li>
            <li> Quick mail to China.</li>
            <li> It charges quickly as well.  </li>
            <li> I love this brush, not lets make sure I pass my next dentist cleaning!</li>
            <li> I had it before and just needed a quick fix b/c it stopped working.</li>
            <li> It moves quick and</li>
            <li> And when I went back for my cleaning 6 months later, my hygienist was very happy with the results!&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li> The frequency of the brush movement seems greater than the older model.  </li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t recommend this toothbrush more highly.</li>
            <li> She has a permanent dental &amp;#34;bridge&amp;#34; and gives this unit a very good after using it for the past 3 months.</li>
            <li> Really leaves my teeth perfectly clean!</li>
            <li> This is my first electric toothbrush and I must say that I continue to enjoy using it.</li>
            <li> With the softest toothbrushes available, it made my teeth hurt for the rest of the day after the first use.  </li>
            <li> very very valueable one!</li>
            <li> I like it very much!</li>
            <li> Noise ruins a great brush.</li>
            <li> He likes it very much!</li>
            <li> I like this tooth brush and very glad to get the extra brushes.</li>
            <li> The good news is that the charge on the toothbrush lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> It charges quickly, cleans easily with warm water and a quick wipe down and is good to go for the next brushing.</li>
            <li> I was super excited to purchase my first electric toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> works great less filling(s)</li>
            <li> My teeth are left feeling cleaner than ever, we also love the 2 minute timer!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s pretty significant.  </li>
            <li> Exactly what I needed!</li>
            <li> When the battery goes, I will certainly buy this model again if it is still available.</li>
            <li> /&gt;To say that this toothbrush, use it for the first time, I was scared, toothbrush voice can use the basic &amp;#34;too large&amp;#34; to describe, but after brushing teeth, teeth were very clean, is much better than manual brushing effect.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I was a little concerned it might be too powerful, not a problem at all, but a great electric toothbrush purchase with a bonus travel case.</li>
            <li> I am perfectly happy with the basic level sonicare and don&#x27;t needs lot of different settings, so this brush suits me just fine.  </li>
            <li> basic function, it is enough, very good experience in using</li>
            <li> Besides the cheap price and good speed of direct mail , it does not have any advantages, standby time is short, the sound of vibration is too large, do not suggest to buy.</li>
            <li> this toothbrush was recommended by my dentist for gum care and it really works, very comfortable and easy to use, battery lasts full two weeks before recharge is necessary</li>
            <li> The exchange was fast and efficient, and even included free return</li>
            <li> The travel case and extra brush head are a nice touch</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s been an enjoyable time so far.</li>
            <li> I would say this is definitely worth the investment in your oral health.  </li>
            <li> Philips toothbrush useful, also brought a spare toothbrush head</li>
            <li> Much better than old one with the fat handle.</li>
            <li> expect that most people think that if it vibrates loudly, it is working best.&lt;br</li>
            <li> so I rarely made it before)&lt;br</li>
            <li> So much better than the old version</li>
            <li> This is the first true electric toothbrush that I&#x27;ve had</li>
            <li> So, we&#x27;ll see in about 3 months what the deal is and if it was worth the $50 for this.</li>
            <li> And forget the powerful &amp;#34;sonic&amp;#34; type system.  </li>
            <li> but well worth it.</li>
            <li> This brush was just too powerful for me.</li>
            <li> travel case is extremely useful to hold and protect your brush.</li>
            <li> Works well and gets the fur off close to the gum line better than my old non hypersonic brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> She likes it better than her old one.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really enjoying using this toothbrush so far.</li>
            <li> i think it is useful for protecting my teeth.</li>
            <li> The thing is powerful.  </li>
            <li> If I had sensitive gums or teeth, I probably wouldn&#x27;t be able to handle it.  </li>
            <li> Quality good, product as expected</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t have as much power as the more expensive models, but it&#x27;s perfect for what I use it for.  </li>
            <li> I did not like the feel, so I gave it to my 13 yr old grand daughter.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s okay for a Sonic Toothbrush, I preferred my Oral B Sonic Complete, I wish I didn&#x27;t throw it away</li>
            <li> people will find it a useful oral hygiene addition.</li>
            <li> Pro, came with two brushes&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Con, more action within the handle than the brush, noisy.</li>
            <li> I bought it for my husband, he said it&#x27;s useful, he like it.</li>
            <li> and I have the $100 Sonicare HealthyWhite already so figured this would be a nice backup since another customer stated they were comparable, just with different heads</li>
            <li> I think this toothbrush is absolutely worth the price.  </li>
            <li> I also liked that it came with an extra head and a travel case.</li>
            <li> Returned this model and purchased the Easy Clean with sensitive brush heads.</li>
            <li> It comes with two brush heads and a travel case worth what I paid - there was a $10 off coupon at the time.  </li>
            <li> it s worth the price.&lt;br /&gt;Also</li>
            <li> It is cheaper and useful</li>
            <li> It comes with a great hard cover travel case that fits the brush and 2 heads, which I find infinitely superior to the older model&#x27;s soft pouch traveling case.</li>
            <li> This gap also means that you have to make sure to clean it regularly to prevent gunk from seeping into the mechanical part of the brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> hx6730 is more quiet and in clean mode</li>
            <li> toothbrush does a great job on cleaning the teeth where it works smoothly, but the brush and handle on it are just too long to give individual teeth the thorough attention I like to give them.  </li>
            <li> I am still using the original brush head, very endurable.&lt;br /&gt;Recharges</li>
            <li> I feel I have avoided significant expense on tooth and gum work thanks to these brushes.</li>
            <li> Accent slightly, other good</li>
            <li> , right?  </li>
            <li> #34;you don&#x27;t know what you don&#x27;t know&amp;#34;, right?</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t talk right now.</li>
            <li> At the beginning it was all right.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s all right but not that fancy.</li>
            <li> It took some getting used to, but my dentist was right</li>
            <li> Great toothbrush, providing the bare minimum features at a low price.</li>
            <li> This toothbrush is easy for the kids too who never did a good job with a regular brush or one of the low grade electronic toothbrushes.</li>
            <li> My teeth feel really clean, and the 2 minute timer is really helpful.</li>
            <li> It feels, and apparently is, straight from the dentist clean.</li>
            <li> (It emits a rather high pitched sound, guess that is the sonic care part)</li>
            <li> The noise is very large.</li>
            <li> If you want to spend more money for that, be my guest, but the basic 2 minute timer was perfectly adequate for my needs.   </li>
            <li> I like this one much better, it is smaller and faster and does, to me, a better job than my old one.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Finally, the toothbrush in the price is not expensive, the effect also can also, and the 2 brush heads, it is worth buying.</li>
            <li> At this point, it feels perfectly normal and comfortable.</li>
            <li> but pretty powerful and uesful.</li>
            <li> Not nearly as we&#x27;ll made or effective.</li>
            <li> feel a little bit noisy, other wise good</li>
            <li> think the new 1 goes beyond sonic to cheap with the vibration.</li>
            <li> the first couple of times to get the rhythm right without them).  </li>
            <li> This is so loud and the vibration is so strong.  </li>
            <li> Although it is obvious where they cut corners, it is more powerful than it used to be.  </li>
            <li> Not normally this excited over a tooth brush but even my gums feel better.</li>
            <li> easy to accidentally push the button and stop action.</li>
            <li> of the more expensive models look great</li>
            <li> If you want a no-frills, simple and yet effective Sonicare, I&#x27;d really suggest spending the extra 30 bucks and getting the Easy Clean.</li>
            <li> Nothing fancy, just a good old Sonicare brush that will last me another 4 years as the first one did.</li>
            <li> I was honestly worried about my front teeth coming loose</li>
            <li> Like it very much.</li>
            <li> I recommend this product if you want a quality product at a very reasonable price.</li>
            <li> and it certainly does a better job of keeping their little mouthes healthy.</li>
            <li> Good product, There is anotehr upgraded version is a little bit better(with 30s quadrant reminder).</li>
            <li> Although the noise is a little loud,it is a good brush.</li>
            <li> Does not brush like first series, the head piece also keep falling during the brushing time.</li>
            <li> and it does  a better job cleaning my teeth than just a standard toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> This is my first electric toothbrush.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re going from a regular toothbrush to this, it may be ok; otherwise if replacing another electric, keep looking</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll know more about it\s effectiveness after my next check-up and leaning in June.</li>
            <li> I have the higher end model and it doesn&#x27;t rattle.  </li>
            <li> I decided I would get her a current model expecting it to be better in all aspects</li>
            <li> Thought this was a higher lever Sonicare.  </li>
            <li> ; Make sure to learn the proper technique for using a Sonicare brush!</li>
            <li> The brush feels slightly funny to me</li>
            <li> and I am glad I made my next brush a Sonicare.</li>
            <li> Also, compared to the OralB brush this one is way better, the head is smaller and doesn&#x27;t feel like you are shoving a a shovel in your mouth.</li>
            <li> And the first time I use this toothbrush I get blood.</li>
            <li> Long lasting and great acceleration.  </li>
            <li> Exactly as described.</li>
            <li> , just make sure that you check that option because when ordering there where 3 different ones I could choose from, like a xmas addition or something.</li>
            <li> ;)</li>
            <li> Exactly as described.  </li>
            <li> First electric toothbrush and I will never go back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> nice very good.but,the charging time is so long.</li>
            <li> I won&#x27;t be able to comment on its effectiveness until after my next dental check-up, which is a couple of months from now.</li>
            <li> When I tried a &amp;#34;barely touch&amp;#34; method (actually, didn&#x27;t even feel like I was touching my teeth)</li>
            <li> Sounds funny I know, and I suppose it is if you were looking at me.  </li>
            <li> Makes brushing my teeth so much easier!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really like it!</li>
            <li> When I comment, I found there are many same issues.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It tickles at first</li>
            <li> Teeth feel cleaner and gums, especially are massaged and kept healthy.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pretty bummed as I was thinking</li>
            <li> Higher priced sonicare toothbrushes come with timer features etc.</li>
            <li> Since that played out I bought this Sonicare and at first it&lt;br /&gt;tickled</li>
            <li> This too many series from Philips such as HX62xx/HX65xx/HX60xx something like that.</li>
            <li> Pony up and buy the higher end model from Costco or something.</li>
            <li> I wanted to get a quantifiable measure of how loud, so I downloaded a free decibel meter to my phone.  </li>
            <li> I really like this brush!</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used the case yet, but glad to have it for my next travel.</li>
            <li> My teeth felt like I had just gone in for cleaning after first use.  </li>
            <li> I was used to with my first gen sonicare brush...</li>
            <li> This one does not have the 4x30 sec timer, but honestly, I didn&#x27;t want that as I pull the toothbrush out way before that just to spit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Yeah, it does a better job, and the first couple brushes did make a big difference, but</li>
            <li> Exactly what I was expecting.</li>
            <li> Brush head is different - but works OK.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the first time for me to use an ultrasonic toothbrush.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll know for sure next month when I go to the dentist, which they do recommend this brand.</li>
            <li> My first automatic Toothbrush.</li>
            <li> After several months, I&#x27;m absolutely in love with my Sonicare toothbrush.</li>
            <li> I love my Sonicare toothbrush and can&#x27;t imagine going back to anything else.  </li>
            <li> I tried it several days and it didn&#x27;t get better.  </li>
            <li> my first electric toothbrush</li>
            <li> This is the most basic and inexpensive Sonicare model I could find!  </li>
            <li> It is powerful yet gentle on the gums.</li>
            <li> Self timer is great for brushing long enough.</li>
            <li> Has a loud sound, but does its job.</li>
            <li> This is my first electric toothbrush so the first two times I had to get use to it</li>
            <li> I love that it lets me know when I&#x27;ve brushed two minutes by shutting off.  </li>
            <li> My first electro toothbrush.</li>
            <li> I had one of the first soicare and used it for 10 years.</li>
            <li> At first I thought, well, maybe this one needs a &amp;#34;break in&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> This is the first electric toothbrush I&#x27;ve ever owned.  </li>
            <li> SO much happier!</li>
            <li> As the basic type of Sonicare,it is ok.</li>
            <li> Same as most stated.</li>
            <li> First electric toothbrush I&#x27;ve ever had.  </li>
            <li> Things have a loud, for the first time to use are not used to, but it does the brush clean.</li>
            <li> clean my teeth very well, normally.  </li>
            <li> Residue and bubbles are the easiest to clean and they do NOT go near the motor.</li>
            <li> The vibration of the brush is vary good though must be careful if you have sensitive teeth.  </li>
            <li> The first one to go out was about 4+ years old, not bad in my book.  </li>
            <li> it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will be replacing this with a much nicer model now that I&#x27;ve learned you have to shell out quite a bit more money to get a seemingly simple product.</li>
            <li> A friend told me not to spring for a more expensive model because all Philips Sonicare toothbrushes are a good bet</li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t want to be bothered with the return, but I would advise anyone in the market to spend the extra and get a better quality toothbrush, something with a sturdier charging port and much quieter.  </li>
            <li> It does have the Easy-Start feature where it gently increases power over the first 14 uses to allow you to get use to the vibration as it can be a bit weird/tickly at first.  </li>
            <li> But if you want the real deal, spend the extra money and get a better model.</li>
            <li> Great toothbrush, but be aware that the brush head is much smaller than other sonicare toothbrushes.</li>
            <li> and this takes much less effort and does a better job!</li>
            <li> there is a difference- reviews I read said they are pretty much alike.</li>
            <li> she loves it thus mission accomplished ;)</li>
            <li> I am a China users, this is my first time in USA Amazon bought straight mail mail to China goods.</li>
            <li> Cord management is becoming an issue in the bathroom with 2 toothbrushes, flosser, razor, Kindle, WiFi extender, &amp; hair dryer, We need a universal charger!</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s okay as long as it works.</li>
            <li> I waited anxiously for the good news that my teeth had improved.</li>
            <li> It makes my teeth looking white, feeling clean, and my mouth smelling fresh.</li>
            <li> I have a Sonicare Healthy White toothbrush and an older model with screw in brushes:  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t particularly like Healthy White because of the reminder noise every 30 seconds.  </li>
            <li> Great battery life, the automatic shut off makes sure I always brush for 2 minutes (something thats hard to do if your running late) and my teeth feel supremely smooth after brushing.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t seem to get the toothbrush at the back of my bottom teeth at the right angle to clean them well.  </li>
            <li> I like this a lot, because it lets me easily reach the back molars without difficulty.</li>
            <li> With this model, cleaning is simple and easy.  </li>
            <li> Easy to use, but the noise is larger</li>
            <li> vibrates like hell (they are meant too though), only issue I had is the head piece has a bur in the plastic that scratched the inside of my gums...  can easily grind it off or sand it</li>
            <li> Vibration is strong enough!</li>
            <li> The brush is very loud, but for the price i think its worth it</li>
            <li> This certainly the cheaper model but</li>
            <li> This toothbrush certainly wont help you towards that goal.</li>
            <li> Noise is relatively large</li>
            <li> The good is that the heads are smaller and costs slightly less to replace and easier to clean up and not have to deal with the gunk that gets stuck in the older model.</li>
            <li> I resisted for a year, then finally caved in bought a Sonicare toothbrush as a new year&#x27;s resolution (to take better care of my teeth).&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> It has the same cleaning power as the pricier versions and I love to new brush heads that came with this one.</li>
            <li> It is a universal voltage products, completely suitable for China&#x27;s 220 v voltage, is very convenient and brushing your teeth are clean, is really not generally experience, particularly in the us</li>
            <li> We both love our new toothbrushes and it really does make a big difference!</li>
            <li> The handle and inner workings themselves are just fine.</li>
            <li> Spend a little bit more and get a higher end model!</li>
            <li> Nice but a little abrasive.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t vibrate or clean as well as the next higher model.  </li>
            <li> so fast,to china only 13 days,it so well so fast so cheap</li>
            <li> Going from a regular brush to this is a huge step up and will leave you wondering why you haven&#x27;t purchased one sooner.</li>
            <li> I really like this product</li>
            <li> It is very noisy.</li>
            <li> and I knew the replacement heads would be much cheaper...</li>
            <li> fast shiped&lt;br</li>
            <li> They leave a gap at the bottom and are much noisier than the screw on type heads.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very good!I like it.</li>
            <li> Very cost-effective products, I very like it.</li>
            <li> I also really like that this has inductive charging which means that there is nothing to plug in, just set your brush on the holder and it will charge.  </li>
            <li> i like this very much&lt;br</li>
            <li> Too much noise.</li>
            <li> it is  very good,and convenient to carry</li>
            <li> I bought this for my brother for Christmas, he boasted so much about it that I had to give it a try.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this toothbrush!</li>
            <li> haha.</li>
            <li> It works very well.  </li>
            <li> My teeth feel much cleaner than with a non-electric toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> Mine is much louder than the one I saw in video,</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall I really am liking the toothbrush</li>
            <li> WAY TOO INTENSE.</li>
            <li> but she said the toothbrush was the same one she had at home, but it didn&#x27;t sound like mine</li>
            <li> I real received one is HX6210......</li>
            <li> The toothbrush is very noise during using it.</li>
            <li> Wow, this thing is powerful.  </li>
            <li> I am really satisfied&lt;br /&gt;Want</li>
            <li> too much noisy！i cannot stand it！only one reason that i bought</li>
            <li> The sound is very big</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used one for years and it works well in removing stains and preventing plaque while being gentle on the gums</li>
            <li> These products really good.&lt;br</li>
            <li> They love it and think I spent three times what i did for it.</li>
            <li> Too much effort for that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It did not bother me much</li>
            <li> that I really don&#x27;t care for.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t bother me much, but I figure it should be brought to everyone&#x27;s attention.</li>
            <li> the inside of my mouth almost too much.  </li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe how much cleaner and whiter</li>
            <li> do not really &amp;#34;feel&amp;#34; like this Sonicare is brushing my teeth any better than my Oral B did.  </li>
            <li> but I&#x27;d much prefer the quieter hum</li>
            <li> fast shipping .</li>
            <li> Works very well.  </li>
            <li> If your looking for an electronic toothbrush really consider purchasing.</li>
            <li> This seems to work really well.  </li>
            <li> It holds a charge very well.  </li>
            <li> It came post haste packaged very well like always from Amazon.  </li>
            <li> and I really like the travel case.  </li>
            <li> The effect is very good,love it</li>
            <li> Too much noise it makes, did</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t look like it&#x27;ll do much.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really understand what&#x27;s going on with this product.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m beginning to think it&#x27;s much cheaper than it sells for.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not whisper quiet, but it&#x27;s not annoying.</li>
            <li> I bought this much cheaper Sonicare toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> So those feature weren&#x27;t really doing anything for me</li>
            <li> used really good.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Fast shipping</li>
            <li> Doesnt need to be charged very often, and the heads are not showing much wear after 2 months of use.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> I tried this because I had heard so much about Sonicare.  </li>
            <li> I think the light should stay on when it is plugged in and charged since you can&#x27;t tell if the charger is actually receiving power.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> really cleans your teeth and helps remove what flossing misses</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s basic, one button and one light.  </li>
            <li> Works very well.  </li>
            <li> very well!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Once your battery is running low, the unit will notify you by vibrating a couple of times, the battery light will also flash.</li>
            <li> much cheaper than in Tianchao</li>
            <li> Had another Sonicare with multi-speeds and was cumbersome to turn off and on and to even know which speed you were really on.  </li>
            <li> Vibrates way too much.  </li>
            <li> However, this one is VERY noisy...</li>
            <li> Much lighter than the elite e series.</li>
            <li> I wish you could change the pressure, the vibration is almost to intense</li>
            <li> I really couldn&#x27;t be happier with this.</li>
            <li> I really feel like my teeth are much cleaner after using this</li>
            <li> I really like it.</li>
            <li> My kid really likes it and uses  twice a day.</li>
            <li> but, it just doesn&#x27;t work well at all, and the vibration is really</li>
            <li> test you can perform is to place the brush head under a gentle stream of water from a faucet, and observe what happens to the water when the toothbrush is activated.  </li>
            <li> This one doesn&#x27;t do much at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It make too much noise after 2 month used.</li>
            <li> It is very convenient.</li>
            <li> The delivery is fast.</li>
            <li> that&#x27;s how much this thing vibrates.</li>
            <li> This one us very under powered even when fully charged..</li>
            <li> But it lasts much longer when fully charged as Compared to Oral B which my wife uses.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li> is if you apply too much pressure the pulse will stop so it reminds you to be gentle on your gums and</li>
            <li> But it&#x27;s really too noise</li>
            <li> Thanks.</li>
            <li> it makes so much noisy .</li>
            <li> but I was very disapointed to find that it did not have the feature (quadpacer?)</li>
            <li> brush feels just as effective as my Sonicare FlexCare, which is an older model, but costs way less.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to keep clean, and the charger is small, so it easily fits next to my sink.    </li>
            <li> After years of using the higher end version, thought, I can know when the 30 seconds are up to move to the new section of my mouth...</li>
            <li> Easy to carry, battery life is amazingly long, and I keep finding coupons for the replacement heads.</li>
            <li> The general feeling，But worthy of the price</li>
            <li> Good product, I have had better toothbrushes, but with the price of this, you can&#x27;t go wrong!</li>
            <li> and the first time my teeth were very sensitive to it.  </li>
            <li> Your teeth will feel clean for the whole day, night and even the next morning!</li>
            <li> Noisy, brush head is not durable, other ok.</li>
            <li> In my last trip to Thailand 5 months ago my sonic toothbrush died as there was no travel case but this time it was neat and 100% working thanks to the special case</li>
            <li> Paid a few dollars more and get one model higher.</li>
            <li> My only gripe with this toothbrush is that I have to take off the head and clean out the brush and head with a Q-tip to prevent mold from building up.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The price is attracted,it has the basic function clean and white,and also has a timer.</li>
            <li> It makes your teeth feel as clean as if you left the dentist office.</li>
            <li> My teeth literally feel so clean even the next day!</li>
            <li> My teeth almost feel like I just left the Dentist office and are so sparkly and squeeky clean.</li>
            <li> Just left the dentist feeling clean</li>
            <li> It is very noisy compared to my older model HX6911 Flex Care toothbrush.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t want to spend a ridiculous amount on a toothbrush but still wanted good quality.</li>
            <li> Sound a little big, but very comfortable to use</li>
            <li> I thought this thing knocked out a filling, it was so unbelievably intense &amp; high speed.....</li>
            <li> And to think, if I&#x27;d never had purchased the older model first, I would have never known this and would have given it a few more stars in my review...</li>
            <li> My husband ordered the Waterpik Prime special that was 69.00 and got it on a daily deal for 59.00.</li>
            <li> As other one-star reviewers have mentioned, it vibrates loudly, but it does not clean nearly as effectively as the better ones.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t provide as vigorous of a clean as the older, basic model it is trying to replace.</li>
            <li> It just so happens that I&#x27;m a messy tooth brusher.&lt;br /&gt;Other than occasionally having the plastic part of the brush vibrate against my teeth as I move, brushing is for the most part smooth.</li>
            <li> This is my first Sonicare brush, so I have nothing to compare it to, but it didn&#x27;t seem excessively loud to me.</li>
            <li> A word of warning: When I first started using this toothbrush, the vibrating sensation was almost unbearable to my sensitive teeth.</li>
            <li> Finally, your dentist will stop complaining full time about your grill.</li>
            <li> First time owning an electric toothbrush and wow,</li>
            <li> full battery could just last 7 times...</li>
            <li> Not bad for one who brushes their teeth several times a day.  </li>
            <li> But what I really dont like is it does not clean much better than manual.</li>
            <li> a little sound, but powerful</li>
            <li> Overall good, but a little bit noisy.</li>
            <li> As other reviews have mentioned, I found this brush to rattle and sound cheaply made if not actually defective.  </li>
            <li> My husband really likes the new one, lighter weight and easier for him to handle.</li>
            <li> The sonic feature may be the difference, but it feels more thorough than previous power toothbrushes.</li>
            <li> If you are going to be traveling for less than a week, you should be able to leave the charger at home.</li>
            <li> This unit has only one speed and while it works adequately for what it is, it is the cheaper cheaper version.</li>
            <li> This was a replacement of an older Sonicare.  </li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t vibrate as smoothly as older model.</li>
            <li> I love the idea of a smaller head and a longer neck, to get into the back of your mouth.</li>
            <li> I feel that this model is weaker than the older ones.  </li>
            <li> This one is built cheaper than my older model.</li>
            <li> It replaced an older Sonicare that just stopped working after 4 or 5 years.  </li>
            <li> Every once in awhile I use my manual toothbrush to give myself a quick brush in the middle of the day, but it&#x27;s no comparison to the way my teeth feel after a Sonicare brushing.</li>
            <li> BUT I couldn&#x27;t stand the vibration on my teeth and particularly my lips.  </li>
            <li> so you might need an adapter for traveling to particular</li>
            <li> This particular model is the snap-on head, which I prefer over the screw-on head.  </li>
            <li> I always thought that my manual cleaning was good enough and these things were just a sham to get people&#x27;s money.</li>
            <li> Will edit this if it fails much earlier than I would expect but for now thoroughly impressed with what I got for the price.</li>
            <li> Decent item but</li>
            <li> This is a decent entry level toothbrush.</li>
            <li> However, the new smaller bases can still trap some moisture, although not nearly as bad.  </li>
            <li> But if this one lasts even half as long, it is still a good value.</li>
            <li> you&#x27;re in the market for a high priced unit,</li>
            <li> Also, I highly recommend switching to an electronic tooth brush if you have not already.</li>
            <li> The high freq started off tickling my nose, but I guess I got used to it.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> highly recommend these types of brushes.</li>
            <li> highly recommending it.</li>
            <li> When I turn it on, it no longer vibrates, but instead emits this high pitched ringing noise.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend.  </li>
            <li> highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d highly recommend this.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> HIGHLY RECOMMEND.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend a Sonicare for anyone...</li>
            <li> I got some new mouthwash and was a more diligent brusher for the next six months until my next cleaning.</li>
            <li> Got it with a very reasonable price, and the international shipment is fast and convenient</li>
            <li> This new model replaced and older Phillips model.  </li>
            <li> The vibrations aren&#x27;t nearly as powerful as the higher end model, it doesn&#x27;t pause every 30 sec.</li>
            <li> The only real difference between this and the DiamondClean edition is a huge price tag and a different head.</li>
            <li> just feel much cleaner and healthier after using this product compared to my old Oral-B electric toothbrush.</li>
            <li> There is a much stronger action them my ancient Braun oscillating toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> Still, both of these are very serviceable and professional machines, not like the 2 Series Plaque.  </li>
            <li> I use it everyday, better than normal tooth brush,&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> does not seen to be heavy duty,but is working ok</li>
            <li> experience is good, except for the big noise, much bigger than expected</li>
            <li> I would have liked the UV cleaning systems but at least the brush head is covered.</li>
            <li> It is not quite as powerful as my last Sonicare toothbrush.</li>
            <li> Bought it to replace the old model healthy white (which quit working after 2 years, it turns itself on for no reason in the middle of the night).</li>
            <li> Sometimes I feel like it&#x27;s not brushing hard enough, but it&#x27;s the right way to brush teeth, not as abrasive as I was doing on my own with a manual brush.  </li>
            <li> This one does everything that the more expensive units do and accepts any of the brushes (including the Diamond Clean} , but the ones with the large heads.  </li>
            <li> If the connection between the brush heads and the toothbrush was just a little bit more snug, I think that would fix the problem with the outrageously loud and intense action.  </li>
            <li> My teeth definitely feel clean after using it, much cleaner than when I use just a regular toothbrush..</li>
            <li> This toothbrush is fine, but I was very surprised that it doesn&#x27;t alert you every 30 seconds to switch quadrants as the other models do.</li>
            <li> Vibration is very big, the noise is very large</li>
            <li> because of the extremely strong vibration, you tend to injury your gum if you press down too</li>
            <li> After filing down the inner metal ring of the brush head it certainly helped minimize the VERY LOUD sympathetic vibrations but did not fix the issue.</li>
            <li> My dentist has been trying to get me to buy a Sonicare for a long time, my old power tooth brush finally died so I got a Sonicare, and it does work a lot better.</li>
            <li> yes its a little loud but not terribly so</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used it but 4 days looking forward to longer use to see how my cleaning fares to using my new brush</li>
            <li> so I bought a new toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> The Oral-B can be opened up to &amp;#34;recycle&amp;#34; the battery or just solder a new one in it.  </li>
            <li> I met a new world with it.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Husband loves having a new one once again.</li>
            <li> For years, I have literally had a new cavity at every dentist&#x27;s check up.</li>
            <li> so you can get used to it when new.</li>
            <li> Having this new sonicare brush rapidly improved my oral hygiene.</li>
            <li> new users</li>
            <li> This new model also has 30-second and 2-minute alarms as well as a break in program.  </li>
            <li> When this happens, the vibrations get louder, but the actual cleaning action becomes less effective.  </li>
            <li> Thanks Amazon for shipping me fast enough before Christmas.</li>
            <li> I was using a regular manual toothbrush before this, and my oral hygiene really declined because I was so scared of my brushing my teeth very well because of that fractured tooth.</li>
            <li> did (loud &amp; extremely high speed)</li>
            <li> I like it very much, my teeth white now.</li>
            <li> I love Sonicare toothbrushes, but this new &amp;#34;2 Series&amp;#34; design is inferior to past models.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> It slowly ramps up over the first dozen times you use it to get you use to the strong pulsing.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I wanted; a simple electric tooth brush.</li>
            <li> That makes me aware of brushing my all of my teeth properly.  </li>
            <li> I have seen others scrub as they do with manual toothbrushes, and did the same for the first couple of days.</li>
            <li> SO LOUD!</li>
            <li> This thing is priced only slightly cheaper than the older, much much better units.  </li>
            <li> but I am sure I charge it no more than every 2 weeks.</li>
            <li> I have used multiple Sonicare products for years and this was my first dud.</li>
            <li> There are other name brand similar products costing 2X to 3X more that offer identical performance.</li>
            <li> In the first BIG photo there is a &amp;#34;TRAVEL CASE&#x27;.</li>
            <li> Also, another bonus is that you can change out the heads and share it with a significant other.</li>
            <li> just had my first cleaning since November of last year</li>
            <li> Lightweight, small charger base, nice case, good clean.  </li>
            <li> charging station is a little bit flimsy and easy to knock over, but the charge lasts quite a while, so I pull it out to charge it about once a week and then put it away</li>
            <li> This one is just the basic, but I didn&#x27;t need all the bells and whistles, and they all clean the same.</li>
            <li> &quot; The new design of brush head is a considerable improvement on the original models, and they hold a charge extremely well.  </li>
            <li> Toothbrush trial, noise is a little big, but is multi-purpose twice to adapt, have a portable box is also easy to travel!</li>
            <li> If this was not the case I would give this item a 5 star but the sound right now is ridiculous.</li>
            <li> aside, I have no doubt that these will last a long time and my kids will enjoy them.</li>
            <li> I previously used a Sonicare FLEX-Care w/ the UV Light head sanitizing station.</li>
            <li> We&#x27;ve only got the older model to compare it against and by that measure this one feels cheap and very loose.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m disappointed in Philips for trying to cash in on their previously good Sonicare name with a genuinely overpriced piece of junk.  </li>
            <li> Only reason I&#x27;m docking a star is that its pretty loud.</li>
            <li> The battery is full use of time is short, can only use about 3 days.</li>
            <li> I finally broke down and bought this and love it.  </li>
            <li> The old Sonicare brush is over 12 years old and the only reason he was willing to get a new one was because the battery is dying on the old one.</li>
            <li> Not previously used the electric toothbrush, for the first time, trust Philips quality, feeling than the ordinary toothbrush to clean, send a brush head</li>
            <li> This brush is great and feels like it&#x27;s cleaning at least twice as well as the previous brushes used.</li>
            <li> Cleans better and faster than my previous model, but the charge does not last as long.&lt;br /&gt;Loud , but efficient.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been a loyal sonicare user for 10 yrs and have used multiple different models.  </li>
            <li> , it will get your gums sore, because of the vibrations and whatnot, but it has a easy start, which slowly eases you into the fast bristle movement.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Its fine, makes a lot of noise - more so than other similar styles ive had in the past.</li>
            <li> This is possibly a defective unit, and will certainly be returned.  </li>
            <li> May be because is the first time I use an electric toothbrush, I feel its vibration amplitude is a bit big, other good, in addition to charging is slow</li>
            <li> handle is a little more compact to me than the earlier versions.</li>
            <li> the only thing I miss over the more costly one, which lasted me over 8 years, is the lack of quadrant timers - the little pause that tells you when to move on.  </li>
            <li> I take my oral health pretty seriously and finally asked my hygienist what I could do since I thought I was doing much better.</li>
            <li> I love how it gets through all the hard to reach places.</li>
            <li> Maybe it&#x27;s not as powerful because these have NI-MH battery pack instead of the Li-Ion on the more expensive model.</li>
            <li> Looking at them it is clearly a design flaw.</li>
            <li> So if you have sensitive teeth, be prepared for a brief \\&quot;breaking in\\&quot; period, but stick with it, because it&#x27;s very temporary.</li>
            <li> The vibration is intense enough that two of the people I gave one to wont use it (they are a couple</li>
            <li> Maneuverability is important for a few reasons.</li>
            <li> I was pleasantly surprised as to the quality and</li>
            <li> At that point I began researching and realized that I had the old style model...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m completely awestruck.</li>
            <li> The professional version seems to vibrate faster than this version.  </li>
            <li> The brush head is fairly soft.</li>
            <li> heads are loud when you insert them in -</li>
            <li> This is what makes the brush loud - the connection where the brush head vibrates.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Sonicare since the early 1990s</li>
            <li> be a bit loud</li>
            <li> Direct mail to China is about 220 yuan.</li>
            <li> I used this to replace an old Braun version.  </li>
            <li> Quite loud and rattles quite a bit.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t be happier with this purchase, the real question is why didn&#x27;t I switch to an electronic toothbrush earlier.</li>
            <li> Used it for around two months before it stops working completely before March 2015.</li>
            <li> few weeks before it failed, when it start to make chirpy sounds and flashing amber light while charging, I have to take it off the charger in order to get a good night sleep.</li>
            <li> And it can make me to brush my teeth completely.</li>
            <li> These are so much weaker than any Sonicare toothbrush I&#x27;ve ever used (I&#x27;ve been using various models of Sonicare for over 10 years now).  </li>
            <li> My old Sonicare was getting grungy and the rubber grip was falling apart</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d say over 2 weeks without having to put it in the chager.&lt;br /&gt;The brush heads far exceeded my expectations.</li>
            <li> my old Oral B had that changed the vibration every 30 seconds</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s basic but has the 2-minute timer which is what I really wanted.</li>
            <li> It is so loud you can&#x27;t use it.</li>
            <li> Loud.</li>
            <li> Loud.</li>
            <li> Loud.  </li>
            <li> far as the leaving the dentist feeling, I&#x27;ll call b/s on that one.  </li>
            <li> Old style heads</li>
            <li> My hand moves around on the handle and turns the product off  frequently while in use.</li>
            <li> brush is soft and durable.</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t learned how to use this brush nearly as efficiently.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;As far as the functionality of the toothbrush is concerned...</li>
            <li> I have extremely sensitive gums that bleed, every time I brush them.</li>
            <li> My teeth also tend to yellow, and be very resistant to whitening products.</li>
            <li> The toothbrush is a bit loud.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my wife whose old Sonicare quit working.  </li>
            <li> but what I&#x27;ve seen so far on the pricing may make me try non-Phillips brands...</li>
            <li> Under &#x27;frequently bought together&#x27; is shows a TRAVEL CASE.  </li>
            <li> If you have a sensitive mouth, this might not work for you.</li>
            <li> the handle is charging a green light blinks.</li>
            <li> Expect my next teeth cleaning to be much shorter.</li>
            <li> What a difference this brush has made to my teeth feeling much fresher and cleaner overall.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe how loud this thing is--</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s THAT loud.</li>
            <li> It is loud when on for the 2 min.</li>
            <li> After using it I feel like I&#x27;ve just been to a professional dental cleaning.</li>
            <li> but the noise is too loud. thx~</li>
            <li> and I really like the travel case and extra toothbrush head.  </li>
            <li> Not recommend it if you are sensitive to noise.</li>
            <li> I just dont like how loud it is</li>
            <li> number of the favorable reviewers have suggested that it is nearly identical to the fancier Sonicare units, just without the bells &amp; whistles.  </li>
            <li> I used my brother&#x27;s old Braun for a while before I ran out of brush heads.</li>
            <li> I have been using this brush once a day, just before bed, ever since it arrived in early January.</li>
            <li> Bought for 21 yr old son, it is louder than our Oral B ones, but he said it doesn&#x27;t bother him.</li>
            <li> I would give this 5 stars if it wasn&#x27;t so loud.  </li>
            <li> Too loud.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s too noisy somehow,  dont expect too much on it, but since it is a basic model, it does its job</li>
            <li> So far it has worked well</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t care too much for it and went back to manual.</li>
            <li> My old Sonicare had that feature</li>
            <li> tooth brush is good, but bristles are a bit expensive.</li>
            <li> The sonicare is good to use,but the toothbrush head is expensive</li>
            <li> Now, I do have a few other steps I take, but this is a very important one in the whole process.</li>
            <li> and overall I like the product other than one huge flaw.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to carry because the small box,then I can take it when out for travelling.</li>
            <li> have been free of cavities and other dental problems and my dental visits are basic cleaning every 2 years because I was using Or*lB</li>
            <li> I bought the more expensive sonicare from costco but don&#x27;t use all its modes, this is pretty much the same thing but</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to use, and the price is half what my dentist charges for the same product.</li>
            <li> The head on the brush is small enough to get around in my mouth and after getting used to the sound, I really do like the way my teeth felt.  </li>
            <li> This has an easy start feature which I really appreciated because my gums were not ready for the cleaning power that this little thing possesses.  </li>
            <li> not LiON kind, weak electronic, magnets, very very budget, not worth it, returned.  </li>
            <li> particular Series 2 brush has a smaller head than the comparable Essence series brush that my roommate owns.</li>
            <li> As such, there is an optional setting that begins with minimal vibration and gradually increases over two weeks to full power.</li>
            <li> Cheap feeling, excessive vibration of the handle, loud.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s lightweight and shuts off after 2 minutes, so you know exactly when you&#x27;ve brushed enough.</li>
            <li> but I never used the other modes like gum care or refresh, I only ever used the clean mode.  </li>
            <li> The toothbrush head pop right on and off and doesn&#x27;t screw on like other models I&#x27;ve</li>
            <li> would highly recommend this version as it doesn&#x27;t have all the bells and whistles that likely wouldn&#x27;t use anyway.  </li>
            <li> Overall, the new brush does not seem as sturdy or as well made as my old one.</li>
            <li> A little noisy but works better than the quiet model I had of the same brand.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I expected.</li>
            <li> It feels like it really cleans at the gum line, although only my dental hygienist will have the final say on its effectiveness.  </li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t careful enough when I bought it as a travel brush and didn&#x27;t notice there was no mention of the quadpacer feature, which IMHO is extremely useful in signaling when to change section.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve already tossed the case in my bag a few times to take the toothbrush to work with me for a quick brush after lunch.</li>
            <li> However, it is very noisy, unlike the more expensive one.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Either of those models would be far superior to this one; it&#x27;s really disappointing that Philips makes and sells this.  </li>
            <li> Also, the handle is thicker and the weight is lighter than the Flexcare, and I don&#x27;t feel that this one has quite as much power or something, but that could be due to the different brush head or the model, not sure which, but I doubt it really affects the quality of the clean and I&#x27;ll get used to it in time.</li>
            <li> If they could include this feature in the very old, basic model, why did they remove it?  </li>
            <li> This all you need, all other higher price model is just for gimmicks.</li>
            <li> , you get an extra brush head - which by the way, the NEWER sets usually do NOT come w/</li>
            <li> While the brush is ok itself, the battery is weak though.</li>
            <li> only things that I don&#x27;t necessarily love about this brush is that the head is a little smaller than the e-series, but there are bigger heads that you can get.  </li>
            <li> It makes too much noise and sounds like the battery is loose inside the brush housing.</li>
            <li> The new model had a different design that sheds water instead of pooling it in the older magnet pocket (which always caused the growth of mold unless the brush head was removed each time and the cavity allowed to dry).  </li>
            <li> Nowhere near as much vibration as my other Sonicares have had.</li>
            <li> The brushhead that came with the product does not even fit well, there is a half inch gap and water and toothpaste gets into the brushhead and on the toothbrush and crusts there if you dont spend an extra ten minutes cleaning it after every use.</li>
            <li> I had an older version that I had for a long time.  </li>
            <li> The noise is relatively large, the charge is not very convenient.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very loud, rickety, weak, and cheaply made.  </li>
            <li> and we both said same thing it completely changed our mouth</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m going back to my old Braun Oral B.  </li>
            <li> My old unit just died after years of use - this is nothing close to the quality of the prior sonicare.  </li>
            <li> It barely vibrates.</li>
            <li> My old brush was solid.</li>
            <li> Now after barely 4 months, it has stopped working.</li>
            <li> [See photo]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Second issue, probably related, this toothbrush is extremely loud.  </li>
            <li> Seams are irregular, loud handle vibration is matched by reduced power in the mouth, larger and heavier.  </li>
            <li> finally, after a visit, I went directly to my computer and ordered one from Amazon.  </li>
            <li> The units works well and is an appropriate size, however, it does not clean as thoroughly as the previous Sonicare toothbrush I had.</li>
            <li> I had a very old, basic Sonicare electric toothbrush that finally died, so I bought this to replace it.  </li>
            <li> with a single normal mode.</li>
            <li> Its so much louder than I expected it to be!</li>
            <li> ; however other than that no problems, I really like the included travel case</li>
            <li> The 7 yr-old needed a little help to get used to the brush and to be able to turn it in her mouth, but once she got it after a few days</li>
            <li> If this issue were fixed, this would be a 5 star product today - especially considering I got them for only $29.99</li>
            <li> the past my Sonicare toothbrushes have lasted roughly 3 years so at the price, I have lower expectations for longevity but its easy to replace.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t at this time give it 5 stars, only because I need to spend a little more time with it, plus I want to see if the little space where the head joins the handle is going to be gross with time.  </li>
            <li> For the first time I used it,  my baby was waken up and kept crying......</li>
            <li> However, I&#x27;m not sure that this model is even worth that</li>
            <li> Perhaps a good thing that it&#x27;s powerful, but it shakes violently and I would assume that the brush head being loose only contributes to this problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Much improved over the previous model, which accumulated gunk inside the handle.</li>
            <li> Was previously using a much nicer Oral-B and have no complaints.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m late to the bandwagon with electric toothbrushes but caught up quick with this one.</li>
            <li> Really cleans down deep.</li>
            <li> The heads are small enough to get in the very back, the handles are not too heavy, and you get the main effect of sonic waves to clean like all Sonicare brushes.</li>
            <li> Now, I&#x27;m not sure if maybe I got a defective one, as I noticed it wasn&#x27;t holding it&#x27;s charge very long and also didn&#x27;t stay on for the full two minutes.</li>
            <li> Ordered this Philips Sonicare HX6212/05, but received a HX6210 model that has a loose and loud vibrating mechanism.  </li>
            <li> To my great disappointment I got all the plaque and in less time by brushing manually.&lt;br</li>
            <li> charger is smaller than previous versions of Sonicare brush chargers - not too much, but noticeable to me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It hurts and is incredibly loud like there is loose plastic when vibrating.&lt;br /&gt;There is no 30 second pacing which I sorely miss.&lt;br</li>
            <li> hope Philips re-thinks this new design and does not expand it to other models.</li>
            <li> I was really looking forward to upgrading to this from the older Sonicare models that had a large unsealed base on the toothbrush heads that would trap tons of moisture and get real moldy.  </li>
            <li> but it is a little softer brushing than my older sonicare model</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s loud, does not feel as well-built as their other models, but it works.</li>
            <li> This brush is completely inferior to every other Sonicare brush I&#x27;ve had.  </li>
            <li> Like other reviewers have said, this thing is LOUD.  </li>
            <li> Other reviews complain that it is loud.</li>
            <li> The toothbrush is somewhat loud as other reviewers mentioned, but it doesn&#x27;t bother me (maybe because I&#x27;ve never had another, quieter electronic toothbrush).  </li>
            <li> my regular electric toothbrush thinking it would give me an extra boost in getting rid of plaque formation and keeping my oral health optimal for a long future.</li>
            <li> Another issue is that I don&#x27;t have perfectly straight teeth due to crowding and in certain spots the brush head bumps against my teeth which is not good.</li>
            <li> I bought two but one of the pack was opened and the plastic package was been tore, I am not sure whether it was used but quite sure it was at least a returned item.</li>
            <li> but I really want to know if why mine has such excessive noise.</li>
            <li> Not knowing anything at all about these Sonicare toothbrushes, I purchased one on impulse a few months ago not knowing it was actually an older discontinued model...</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s a bit lightweight/cheap feeling compared to the higher end models which you can get at Costco with an additional base for slightly more money.</li>
            <li> I got a pink version of this brush from a major retailer for Christmas</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s small and sleek and doesn&#x27;t take up much</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never had issues with dental hygiene, even remarkably low plaque build up over long periods of time.</li>
            <li> I have had some that were a bit quieter, but that is such a minor concern.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I just wish Oral B had softer toothbrushes, even their softest are not soft enough for me.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s charging every 2 days and doesn&#x27;t seem to hold the charge long enough</li>
            <li> Upgrading from a manual toothbrush to this has been a true game changer.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using a different brand for some years now, the one with the little round head, but thought I&#x27;d give this a shot, the price was right.  </li>
            <li> The handle feels terrific in hand, but has little to offer as far as rubberized grip.</li>
            <li> My new dentist recommended the Phillips Sonicare because I always have heavy plaque build up.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ok, but the sound is terrible.</li>
            <li> In less than 2 months time, it has helped get rid of plaque and improve my gums and almost completely eliminate any gum bleeding.</li>
            <li> I had the older model Philips brush (the one with the head and larger base) and this one is way better.</li>
            <li> I find the charging base a bit precarious and the power cord still has the kinks from being folded in box which tends to make the whole thing topple over more often</li>
            <li> and I am unsure it would last a single trip.</li>
            <li> However, this new 2 Series is noisy and does not seem to vibrate with the same intensity as past models.</li>
            <li> I called Philips Sonicare Customer Service and the representative admitted that this new 2 Series uses a different type of motor than past models.</li>
            <li> It is a lot less expensive to maintain than having toreplace and far too many people end up with dentures due to improper maintenance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The other ones do have different timing features, but who actually uses all those?</li>
            <li> This was our fourth Sonicare toothbrush, but it is vastly inferior to the other three.  </li>
            <li> This replaced one that was 6 years old, still working, but looking a little ragged.</li>
            <li> It is a little loud, but its not an issue.</li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t need to push hard at all - I allow the brush to glide around my mouth, and if you really want to step it up, you can get their &amp;#34;Whitening&amp;#34; head</li>
            <li> Holds a charge very well (2 days at least).</li>
            <li> This one was the most disappointing.</li>
            <li> A charge lasts a long time.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> so I know how long I&#x27;ve been brushing.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t order it because I didn&#x27;t need a water pik and didn&#x27;t want to waste the extra counter space and their separate tooth brush was oddly more expensive at 89.00</li>
            <li> When I tilt the tip of the brush downward the brush works, but the toothbrush handle is too long</li>
            <li> Why did I wait so long to buy one of these?  </li>
            <li> Also, it takes a verrrrry long time to change.</li>
            <li> I can take it on week long trips without the charger.</li>
            <li> charge lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> The battery lasts long time.</li>
            <li> investment I&#x27;ve made in a long time.</li>
            <li> receiving the toothbrush and placing a brush head on it, I realized that (unlike in the photos) the brush head does NOT fit completely on to the toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> minus one star is that it can keep my teeth white.</li>
            <li> The product is good, but the noise is too big, the other two kinds of mode conversion is very inconvenient</li>
            <li> so I went with a less expensive option, and I absolutely love it.  </li>
            <li> The handle also seems to be less solid, which may be a reason for the extra noise.  </li>
            <li> Also the two minute timer ensures I brush for as long as I am supposed to (two minutes is a long time!</li>
            <li> Other than the cheaper replacement heads and being lighter, the current model is in every other aspect a big step backwards in development and quality.  </li>
            <li> Hope it lasts as long!</li>
            <li> I bought 3 of these tooth brushes based on the reviews that said they &amp;#34;work the same as all the other Sonicare toothbrushes but without the bells and whistles.&amp;#34;  </li>
            <li> This means that I can put on toothpaste, insert the Sonicare into my mouth toward my back teeth, and the brush stays there as I pull the handle to brush the other teeth.  </li>
            <li> Initially I thought this was due to the two week break in period, but this toothbrush never picked up strength and remains loud/rattle-y.</li>
            <li> This toothbrush vibrates at the same speed as the other models.  </li>
            <li> Like my new toothbrush- slight improvements from the previous Philips Sonicare I used to use.</li>
            <li> /&gt;After a few weeks suffering from the problem mentioned above, it finally decided to give up and die.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m forced to use my wife&#x27;s older Sonicare until I decide what to do about this.  </li>
            <li> It is nice to know that I have an extra base if I need</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve wanted one of these for awhile, but have limited counter space.  </li>
            <li> I was completely thrown outa whack by her discovery of heavy plaque build up and an extreme case of gingivitis.</li>
            <li> And full of electricity needed 20 hours at a time, I don&#x27;t know if there is something wrong.</li>
            <li> This could be solved by creating a &amp;#34;bump&amp;#34; in the screw tread that would lock the assembly in place and prevent the brush from vibrating loose.  </li>
            <li> Two weeks with the toothbrush head and a toothbrush the junction between the host began to loose.</li>
            <li> It feels like it could knock loose teeth out.  </li>
            <li> Considering this brush costs just a smidgen under two Thomas Jefferson notes, vs the former brush I had costing nearly 10 notes, um -- seriously?</li>
            <li> The brush is very silent, you hear a slight humming noise from the bristles vibrating.</li>
            <li> I spend less time brushing because with a manual I never felt like two minutes was enough.</li>
            <li> Floss then brush with this toothbrush regularly and your teeth and gums will thank you with less need to visit your dentist besides biannual cleanings.</li>
            <li> It was strange, unpleasant (although not painful) and almost caused me to send it back.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Though, there are a bit of cons such as that there&#x27;s a gap between the brush head and the body because it doesn&#x27;t click together tightly.</li>
            <li> Although, $25 extra for the plastic carrying case and an additional toothbrush head is a little steep.</li>
            <li> I miss the quad pacer a little bit, but it is not a big problem.</li>
            <li> Anyway, the disappointment comes from how much louder this model is from the old ones.  </li>
            <li> They are great while theywork, but horrible lifespan and reliability.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I have had quite a few Sonicare brushes at different price points.  </li>
            <li> I am going back to the round brush electric toothbrush by Oral B.  </li>
            <li> Has the 2 minute brushing cycle but lacks the 30 sec buzzer that tells you to change brushing sector.</li>
            <li> so you know roughly what quarter of your mouth you should be on).  </li>
            <li> it is powerful to brush my teeth,i had bought a expensive toothpaste for it。</li>
            <li> I kinda feel like I was never really brushing before with a manual toothbrush</li>
            <li> everyday basic use and travel.  </li>
            <li> i don&#x27;t like the whole production behind using it.</li>
            <li> I think it goes well as expected.</li>
            <li> I was having trouble brushing my teeth enough and this has helped a ton.</li>
            <li> Head shape is different too, Oral B is round, this one is not.</li>
            <li> , I&#x27;m curious to see what she says.  </li>
            <li> Nice charge base that has no metal contacts to get wet.</li>
            <li> I mainly purchased this because I had a hard time brushing my wisdom teeth and brushed too hard which caused gum recession.</li>
            <li> BIG DISAPPOINTMENT right from the start.  </li>
            <li> The bristles of the brush head are also different... thicker and not as pointy or stiff...</li>
            <li> Then the button starts to fail when I can&#x27;t turn it on/off normally, have to either press really hard or really</li>
            <li> It tickled my mouth so badly that I couldn&#x27;t clean my teeth properly at all.</li>
            <li> and I was hoping if one didnt like the other would).</li>
            <li> In reference to the other poster who mentioned this brush is &amp;#34;loud&amp;#34; - I&#x27;m unsure what they&#x27;re talking about.</li>
            <li> As a former user of the famous oscillating brush head before, I can tell you this brush gives you expensive quality cleaning without the expensive price tag.</li>
            <li> It literally closed my gum pockets!</li>
            <li> Other than that it does the trick.</li>
            <li> Other than that</li>
            <li> My dentist had recommended Sonicares over the past several years but the models they sold at their office were in the $80-$120 range.</li>
            <li> Technology has overtaken the past with thousands of brush strokes per second.  </li>
            <li> my wife and I had been using for the past 5 years as they both recently died.</li>
            <li> The people who leave those reviews must have never used other Sonicare brushes.</li>
            <li> brush head has a sharp protrusion where plastic was injected into the mold that scrapes on my lips while I use</li>
            <li> The only upside of those toothbrushes is that they came with several replacement heads, but we noticed we were accumulating replacement heads while we ended up throwing out the toothbrushes because they failed regularly, even after changing batteries frequently.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The unit came with two brushes so I tried the other one and that brush will stay on the handle.</li>
            <li> As other reviewers note, it doesn&#x27;t seem to be an issue with the body of the toothbrush</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s no way this should have made it out of QA but going by other reviews</li>
            <li> One year ago at my 6 month cleaning appointment I got some pretty sad news.</li>
            <li> Received order and the case won&#x27;t stay closed!  </li>
            <li> I bought 2 of these, one for me and the other for my girlfriend.  </li>
            <li> But the 2 minute timer doesn&#x27;t include the 30-second beep that tells you to switch from one side of your mouth to the other</li>
            <li> My roommate who was sitting on the other side of the house thought I was using a hair buzzer.</li>
            <li> I purchased it as a travel version, but my other Sonicare promptly crashed/gave up the ghost.....</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure how to feel about this brush as I don&#x27;t feel like it&#x27;s actually cleaning my teeth..</li>
            <li> You can get past the ramp-up on this toothbrush by pressing on/off multiple times if you are already using an electric toothbrush and this is just a replacement.</li>
            <li> The only complaint is that the charging base is kind of lightweight, so it tends to flip over due to twisting forces exerted by the electric cord.</li>
            <li> This often allows the brush assembly to vibrate loose (no matter how tight you turn it).  </li>
            <li> You should also note that the default toothbrush heads are small, much smaller than an average</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s loud and weak.</li>
            <li> It only has 1 mode but honestly, I never used the other modes on the other toothbrushes anyway.  </li>
            <li> I have used a previous generation of Sonicare higher end just to have the battery start to fail after a year or so.  </li>
            <li> This toothbrush has little to no real power.</li>
            <li> not sure if I want to use a long durability</li>
            <li> This one is just not worth it.</li>
            <li> It registered with a peak of 80 dB and and average of 73 dB.  </li>
            <li> I really am not sure how long it stays in there</li>
            <li> Not powerful for plaque removal.</li>
            <li> After using the sonicare for less than two weeks (and actively rinsing my mouth after meals and w/ mouthwash)</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not worth  $40.</li>
            <li> Only complaint that battery takes 2 days to re charge</li>
            <li> The shrill buzzing is so loud I wouldn&#x27;t use it without ear protection.</li>
            <li> They don&#x27;t go all the way down after they click in either.</li>
            <li> Once it breaks down, I&#x27;ll have to upgrade to features I wish this had.</li>
            <li> Never breaks down once.</li>
            <li> Little bit louder than other Sonicare</li>
            <li> Weak, barely an entry model..</li>
            <li> The charger on the other hand does not fit in the case.</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that it&#x27;s a little noisier than the previous models I&#x27;ve owned from Sonicare.</li>
            <li> I purchased this on Black Friday.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s about half the price it used to be.  </li>
            <li> Even when it&#x27;s fully charged its just a slight amount of vibration.</li>
            <li> I had previous Sonicare brushes and this</li>
            <li> Found we&#x27;ve had less cavities and tartar.  </li>
            <li> It has a bunch of less bells and whistles, but otherwise works just as well.</li>
            <li> Had this for half a year now.</li>
            <li> this is the typical result...</li>
            <li> My previous electric toothbrush cost me over a hundred dollars.</li>
            <li> I am truly sorry that this picture has changed because my last oral B toothbrush tanked after 7 years of solid family use and I am now stuck with this one since I cant return it because I took it with me for a one year sabbatical overseas.&lt;br</li>
            <li> and this has less features..</li>
            <li> I cannot get used to it at the begining, but now I cannot stand with my previous toothbrush.</li>
            <li> The battery lasts less than two weeks as the ads promised.....</li>
            <li> The brush does not seem to be robust and we need to replace the brush head in less than three months.</li>
            <li> Not good enough, and seems not very comfortable</li>
            <li> Cons: Extremely loud, vibrations CRAZY intense, toothbrush does not stay exactly put on the charger base and swivels around a bit.</li>
            <li> Not true.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;However, when you twist on the brush, it doesn&#x27;t click tight into place.  </li>
            <li> It reaches between the tight places that a brush alone could not</li>
            <li> a little bit noisy than what I have used before.</li>
            <li> but little noisy.</li>
            <li> It takes a little getting use to</li>
            <li> a little noise</li>
            <li> and so it makes me a little nervous.  </li>
            <li> and you get a little vibration from the plastic side.  </li>
            <li> Also, this brush is a little louder than the e-series, but it isn&#x27;t anything that will stop me from using it.</li>
            <li> but it is bad, the brush head loose, but now I used to open, only to find, after a return period</li>
            <li> This is NOT just like the other higher-end brushes!!</li>
            <li> Contacted Amazon and was unable to get the call center representative to clearly understand my complaint.  </li>
            <li> I was replacing a Sonicare with the timed settings and a few options.  </li>
            <li> I think i will return this item in few days.</li>
            <li> front bottom teeth, the ones that everyone has trouble flossing?</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money on this.</li>
            <li> It is so disheartening to see that Sonicare would put their name on such a poor product.  </li>
            <li> the battery is dead.</li>
            <li> Wish I didn&#x27;t waste my money.</li>
            <li> this was the big driver behind my purchase (and price).</li>
            <li> After a few months, they cease to work.</li>
            <li> I never realized what I was missing out on all those years.</li>
            <li> I bought this toothbrush as an upgrade to my rechargable e-series that I bought a few years ago.  </li>
            <li> But after not going to the dentist for two years, my gums were in trouble and I was told I needed cleanings every three months as well as using prescription mouthwash every night.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> the stem is made of hard plastic, the penalty for not being careful with the position of the brush is the jackhammering of hard plastic against your teeth (happens every other day).&lt;br /&gt;With</li>
            <li> I purchased this as a second electric toothbrush and the vibration was very weak as compared to my other one.</li>
            <li> I have a small mouth and it is very hard to reach the back teeth on both sides.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> but I used to be a grown ass adult with very poor dental hygiene.</li>
            <li> Compared to other Sonicare versions at least.  </li>
            <li> Some have complained that it doesn&#x27;t come with a \\&quot;quadrant\\&quot; timer, or other types of timer functions.</li>
            <li> And it is not easy cleaning.</li>
            <li> brush is too small and does not clean efficiently.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The brush head also seems a little too small.  </li>
            <li> (I usually charge mine every 10 days since I brush a little longer than 2 minutes)</li>
            <li> So overall, not very reliable, only lasted two months, which is very disappointing.</li>
            <li> No matter how hard I push down, it won&#x27;t stay sealed.</li>
            <li> Have been using it since the past few months</li>
            <li> This brush does change on my old base (although it does come with its own base as well).  </li>
            <li> thing brushes at least twice as vigorously as my previous model.</li>
            <li> I find it a little finicky to use as when you are maneuvering it around in your mouth the bristle part is sometimes hard to keep facing the teeth</li>
            <li> I found the description of this product a little confusing.</li>
            <li> My only criticism is that it vibrates so hard that it&#x27;s a little uncomfortable.</li>
            <li> There is a sizable gap between the brush head and battery -- no matter how hard you push, it does not fit flush.</li>
            <li> However, the case is larger than my Oral-B&#x27;s, and is a bit difficult to carry in a backpack.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Small brush  </li>
            <li> A charge lasts a few weeks!</li>
            <li> nothing too out of the ordinary.  </li>
            <li> An extremely small piece of plastic is supposed to hold the brush to the handle, but it is too small</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a small thing, but I do miss it.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I still had a heavy build up!</li>
            <li> The brushes are expensive and last about three months.  </li>
            <li> Going to stick to the higher end one for now and disappointed somebody lied about the comparison between the two brushes.</li>
            <li> the brush is too small</li>
            <li> There is a small gap there that collects debris.</li>
            <li> Trust Amazon as usual</li>
            <li> I also have a new $15 dollar (ugly green handle)</li>
            <li> It is weird getting used to the fact that this model does NOT give you the little indicator pause every 30 seconds to alert you when you&#x27;re supposed to move quadrants, but I never really followed that anyway</li>
            <li> I hate to have to stop in the middle of a brushing to turn off the mechanism and attempt to re-twist the brush head for it to work properly.</li>
            <li> The wife and i use the same base and different heads.</li>
            <li> I was disappointed with this one in that it is not nearly as powerful as my old one.</li>
            <li> The older model is a mess to deal with because water gets in the brush and at the base of the handle.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t get dirty as fast and doesn&#x27;t have buildup at the base like the old one does.</li>
            <li> The brush heads are not suitable for toothbrush and it&#x27;s noisy when working.</li>
            <li> and it won&#x27;t bother me in the long run (just weird</li>
            <li> Really disappointed as I&#x27;m used to the power and force of the HealthyWhite and feel as if this doesn&#x27;t really get into the grooves as well</li>
            <li> It is rather expensive in view of its limited capabilities.</li>
            <li> brush is hard to maneuver in your mouth.</li>
            <li> This model hardly works like my e-Series did.  </li>
            <li> *, as you can stop vibrations in the brush by pressing too hard.</li>
            <li> hard cover travel case&lt;br /&gt;-Comes</li>
            <li> It rattles which makes it hard on your teeth.</li>
            <li> The dental hygienist was cleaning my teeth and said there was hardly even a drop of tartar buildup.</li>
            <li> The price is a little expensive, can be a little cheaper.</li>
            <li> &#x27;s hard working in the end.</li>
            <li> I can only say that I am a little bad luck.</li>
            <li> This model of toothbrush vibrates nicely - not too strongly, not too weakly.  </li>
            <li> With each brushing, the unpleasant sensations subsided, and by the end of the week, it barely registered with me.</li>
            <li> There is an open space/gap between the brushing head and the motor part,so when i brush my teeth，my mouth become numb.</li>
            <li> mentioned that it was a common complaint.</li>
            <li> there is not anything negative about this brush.</li>
            <li> It does time 2 min for you at least.</li>
            <li> at least it does the job of cleaning your teeth well.</li>
            <li> This is really slow, one setting.  </li>
            <li> brush says there is a 14 day adjustment period where the vibrations slowly increase over time.</li>
            <li> Delivery speed slow no surprises, order in January 5, 2015, January 19th to get the goods.&lt;br</li>
            <li> She complains that it&#x27;s slow and under-powered.</li>
            <li> It has literally saved my teeth and it will save your teeth as well as money down the road on dental costs!!!  </li>
            <li> Very weak compared to my other Sonicare.  </li>
            <li> Sonicare uses very small movements which are stopped if you press too hard.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, I missed the return deadline due to thinking that it would improve, so I&#x27;m stuck with it ... triple argh.</li>
            <li> With this one I have only one mode, which is all I need, and the charging base takes up less counter space.  </li>
            <li> Except  very small eating.</li>
            <li> Seriously.</li>
            <li> That sounds ridiculous, I know.</li>
            <li> Recommended by my dentist-I have serious reservations using it and now seldom do.  </li>
            <li> Ridiculous.</li>
            <li> However, in the small print it does describe what is in the box, but we found the presentation VERY MISLEADING, and we are very disappointed.</li>
            <li> Very poor compared to my previous model.  </li>
            <li> I guess looking for a less expensive model was a dumb idea...</li>
            <li> Not good.</li>
            <li> i still couldn&#x27;t  charging it to 100%.i plan to ask customer service for these question,but i&#x27;m not good at it.may</li>
            <li> sorry i wasted money on this product</li>
            <li> It vibrate slightly, not as good as oral-B.</li>
            <li> (apparently they rank people at this office when they come in).  </li>
            <li> Oh, and it doesn&#x27;t stay on after 2 mins, which is kinda dumb.</li>
            <li> It is very hard to have toothpaste on it.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended you try this unit; you won&#x27;t be disappointed!</li>
            <li> it cleans poorly if you do not get to all your teeth 3)</li>
            <li> This toothbrush, though, it&#x27;s a game changer.</li>
            <li> Totally broken on March 19th.</li>
            <li> No happy</li>
            <li> My plaque has decreased substantially since I started using it.</li>
            <li> I had been brushing twice a day with my manual toothbrush, and so I decided I would step my brushing game up.</li>
            <li> Totally frustrating</li>
            <li> is by far the worst.  </li>
            <li> BUT, the noise was too loud, it&#x27;s terrible!</li>
            <li> I was VERY disappointed to discover that this model does not alert you at 30 second intervals.  </li>
            <li> noise of the toothbrush motor is a little annoying</li>
            <li> Now - if you&#x27;re talking about a competing brand that uses the infamous oscillating bristles, YES.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, Sonicare no longer makes the magnetically driven model so we&#x27;re stuck with this flimsy item</li>
            <li> almost uncomfortably so.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately I threw out the stuff that the box had in it that the brush came in....</li>
            <li> Some of them are so obviously fake.  </li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t find anything that is not perfect about it.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t think an electric toothbrush was complicated, so I went ahead and impulse bought this since it was rated #1 on amazon.</li>
            <li> The brushes are too expensive to change them every 7-10 days.</li>
            <li> Also it makes weird noises at night.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, I am not impressed with this toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> but the cost can be scary.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately, 2 months after using it, it stopped working.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical.</li>
            <li> As a night owl I almost feel guilty for brushing my teeth at 1 am, worrying if I&#x27;m waking up the house.&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s sad,</li>
            <li> really sad because I was looking forward to the ultrasonic feature rather than</li>
            <li> Sorry Philips..&lt;br /&gt;Just</li>
            <li> There should be a pressure switch in the base that turns the brush on when the head presses against teeth, and turns off when you press too hard.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s disappointing how expensive the brush heads are</li>
            <li> /&gt;We had been using battery operated toothbrushes for years and got sick and tired of replacing the batteries and cleaning up all the gunk that accumulates around the battery compartment.</li>
            <li> The reality is this thing rattles and vibrates like crazy.  </li>
            <li> the head vibrates like crazy and gives the impression</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t use it in the morning, afraid of wake up my family.</li>
            <li> That was acceptable but disappointing.</li>
            <li> This thing is like if a toothbrush was chicken, this is fried chicken.</li>
            <li> The vibration is a bit weird tickles my mouth!</li>
            <li> WRONG!  </li>
            <li> a word, bad purchase experience.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t tell if it&#x27;s just a bad design of the brushes or if they intend it to do this</li>
            <li> But,How can I return it in China?Very bad purchase.</li>
            <li> But when i charge for it ,it really shocked me, after about 20hours,</li>
            <li> my teeth are shocked...</li>
            <li> Ordered this Philips Sonicare HX6212/05, but received a HX6210 model :(  </li>
            <li> We gave this as a dirty Santa gift and it was quite the hit!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m highly disappointed.</li>
            <li> I was rather disappointed by the performance of the brush.</li>
            <li> Quite disappointed</li>
            <li> Loosens all kinds of crap.</li>
            <li> I hate leaving my toothbrush out to charge, I put it inside my bathroom wall mirror for maybe 2 weeks at a time before it needs charged.  </li>
            <li> The toothbrush just sits atop the charger as opposed to sliding into a base.  </li>
            <li> Base is tippy</li>
            <li> the brushes don&#x27;t sit flush against the base.</li>
            <li> It vibrates/oscillates so violently that your hand is even shaking while holding it!&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s annoying.</li>
            <li> I hated that I could not take it with me on trips without also bringing the charging base.</li>
            <li> Disappointed!  </li>
            <li> Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> I am very disappointed in this shopping.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed in the quality.</li>
            <li> Terrible.</li>
            <li> this is the worst product I have ever bought.</li>
            <li> Its awful product design.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Noisy, brush head is not durable, other ok.</li>
            <li> Got great deal on product and nothing fancy. This all you need, all other higher price model is just for gimmicks. You need for it to brush your teeth.</li>
            <li> This is a very good toothbrush and the price is fantastic.</li>
            <li> i buy it and later it at 49.9 and it become 39.9 later</li>
            <li> noisy，very uncomfortable，but at an entry level price</li>
            <li> I got 3, we thought it was a good deal. 6x better than manual brushing! Others are only 2x!&lt;br /&gt;I do not know what the disembodied robo dentures looked like that they did that study on. But I dont think it was tested on actual people. The brush works by vibrating the entire stem. The vibration is intense enough that two of the people I gave one to wont use it (they are a couple and I was hoping if one didnt like the other would). It actually heats up to around 103 degrees from the intensity of the brush strokes.&lt;br /&gt;The brush is hard to maneuver in your mouth. Maneuverability is important for a few reasons. 1) the brush does not turn off when you take it out of your mouth and it flings toothpaste 2) it cleans poorly if you do not get to all your teeth 3) the stem is made of hard plastic, the penalty for not being careful with the position of the brush is the jackhammering of hard plastic against your teeth (happens every other day).&lt;br /&gt;With practice many of these things can be improved or prevented. But what I really dont like is it does not clean much better than manual. It does not reach the plaque at the gum line or between teeth no matter how I position it. In order to test its effectiveness I tried brushing with it turned off. To my great disappointment I got all the plaque and in less time by brushing manually.&lt;br /&gt;The other thing that greatly aggravates me is this is suppose to be a well designed brush yet I vastly improved the design with just a moment of thought. The stem should be padded with silicon to prevent the pain and damage to teeth when it touches them, the silicon padding should form a tongue cleaner on the back of the head. There should be a pressure switch in the base that turns the brush on when the head presses against teeth, and turns off when you press too hard.</li>
            <li> teeth feel super clean!</li>
            <li> It makes a lot noise that bothers you when using it.</li>
            <li> It makes too much noise and sounds like the battery is loose inside the brush housing.</li>
            <li> Does not brush like first series, the head piece also keep falling during the brushing time.</li>
            <li> This model hardly works like my e-Series did.  I guess looking for a less expensive model was a dumb idea...</li>
            <li> Very convenient, electric toothbrush cleans teeth better. I recommend it to everyone.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I wanted; a simple electric tooth brush. Great battery life, the automatic shut off makes sure I always brush for 2 minutes (something thats hard to do if your running late) and my teeth feel supremely smooth after brushing.</li>
            <li> This is the lower model of this series.  And the feel and look show.  It doesn&#x27;t vibrate or clean as well as the next higher model.  I&#x27;ve been a loyal sonicare user for 10 yrs and have used multiple different models.  This is inferior in feel and quality.  Paid a few dollars more and get one model higher.</li>
            <li> I really like this product and it does  a better job cleaning my teeth than just a standard toothbrush.  No complaints, and I am picky.  When I got this it was also a great deal at Amazon.</li>
            <li> Brushing your teeth is very clean</li>
            <li> This is my first electric toothbrush. Good experience and easy to use.</li>
            <li> Its fine, makes a lot of noise - more so than other similar styles ive had in the past. Not going to return it but wouldnt buy it again.</li>
            <li> there is a difference- reviews I read said they are pretty much alike. Not true.  I was replacing a Sonicare with the timed settings and a few options.  This is really slow, one setting.  If you&#x27;re going from a regular toothbrush to this, it may be ok; otherwise if replacing another electric, keep looking</li>
            <li> Teeth get clean! However the toothbrush heads do not fit perfectly...</li>
            <li> I like it because it times the length of my tooth brushing. That makes me aware of brushing my all of my teeth properly.  I can travel with it easily.  I am still having difficulty with the strength of the vibrations and pressure I apply to be comfortable in the more sensitive front area.</li>
            <li> this had been recommended and it lived up to it expections. Great toothbrush and it leaves your teeth feeling wonderful.</li>
            <li> a little bit noisy than what I have used before.</li>
            <li> bought it at a very cheap price and it is really worthy! Still not get used to it but I think I will!</li>
            <li> It is very noisy. I have nother Philips sonicare brush for kids, it is not noisy. So i think it is the qulity problem for this HX6212. I think i will return this item in few days.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to use, and the price is half what my dentist charges for the same product. I&#x27;ll know more about it\s effectiveness after my next check-up and leaning in June.</li>
            <li> honestly that&#x27;s awesome.considering its price and the travel case and the replace brush head,I have to give it a five points!</li>
            <li> my mom in law says she like it</li>
            <li> Great toothbrush only thing bristles don&#x27;t move the whole head vibrates. So if your looking for a brush that&#x27;s bristles move this is not the one for you. The vibration of the brush is vary good though must be careful if you have sensitive teeth.  I haven&#x27;t used it but 4 days looking forward to longer use to see how my cleaning fares to using my new brush</li>
            <li> feel more sonic power.</li>
            <li> Not previously used the electric toothbrush, for the first time, trust Philips quality, feeling than the ordinary toothbrush to clean, send a brush head is cost-effective, is to use when the noise is big.</li>
            <li> They work beautifully.  The first one to go out was about 4+ years old, not bad in my book.  The unit we bought had 2 brushes in it and the second is still going!</li>
            <li> I must have gotten defective ones, this model rattles with any pressure applied to the heads.  I have the higher end model and it doesn&#x27;t rattle.  I returned mine.  The price is very good for 30 dollars including 2 heads.  This model is lower end and I wouldn&#x27;t care about the fancy stuff. But here is my observed differences.  The vibrations aren&#x27;t nearly as powerful as the higher end model, it doesn&#x27;t pause every 30 sec. for you to keep track of your time.  Maybe it&#x27;s not as powerful because these have NI-MH battery pack instead of the Li-Ion on the more expensive model.</li>
            <li> As others have already stated... its too noisy.  Not knowing anything at all about these Sonicare toothbrushes, I purchased one on impulse a few months ago not knowing it was actually an older discontinued model... it was really cheap (on sale).  I was pleasantly surprised as to the quality and how good this device is... got my teeth really clean and bright.  Well, my wife noticed and soon wanted one of her own.  At that point I began researching and realized that I had the old style model... it was bigger, heavier and the replacement heads are way more expensive so... I decided I would get her a current model expecting it to be better in all aspects, right?  It arrived and... BIG DISAPPOINTMENT right from the start.  It was smaller and lighter, which are good things and I knew the replacement heads would be much cheaper... so much for the good.  The reality is this thing rattles and vibrates like crazy.  We&#x27;ve only got the older model to compare it against and by that measure this one feels cheap and very loose.  Perhaps its the frequency of vibration but the pitch is different and it seems to match the resonance frequency of the handle... the head vibrates like crazy and gives the impression it will rattle itself to pieces over time.  The bristles of the brush head are also different... thicker and not as pointy or stiff... translation: doesn&#x27;t clean between the teeth and under the gums as well.  Other than the cheaper replacement heads and being lighter, the current model is in every other aspect a big step backwards in development and quality.  And to think, if I&#x27;d never had purchased the older model first, I would have never known this and would have given it a few more stars in my review... because &amp;#34;you don&#x27;t know what you don&#x27;t know&amp;#34;, right?</li>
            <li> fast shiped&lt;br /&gt;A low price&lt;br /&gt;Satisfaction</li>
            <li> I purchased this item recently upon a recommendation from my dentist. After several days of use, I&#x27;m pleased to report that I am incredibly happy with the performance of this toothbrush. It charges quickly, cleans easily with warm water and a quick wipe down and is good to go for the next brushing. The travel case and extra brush head are a nice touch and I&#x27;ve already tossed the case in my bag a few times to take the toothbrush to work with me for a quick brush after lunch.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never had issues with dental hygiene, even remarkably low plaque build up over long periods of time. This toothbrush, though, it&#x27;s a game changer. I&#x27;ve been using it daily for two weeks and there is no plaque on my teeth. None. At. All.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My front bottom teeth, the ones that everyone has trouble flossing? You know the ones. No matter how often I flossed, there was always a bit of plaque between these teeth that would shred the floss. Now, the floss no longer rips on these teeth. I smoothly remove food particles and the floss remains intact. I&#x27;m completely awestruck. I always had heard about the Sonicare and how effective they were. I now wish I had gotten one sooner.</li>
            <li> I changed from oral b to sonic are and what a difference I love it</li>
            <li> The general feeling，But worthy of the price</li>
            <li> Exactly what I expected. I also like the fact that it seems to be water resistant as I use it in the shower mostly.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ok, but the sound is terrible.</li>
            <li> Great product and good price.</li>
            <li> Very satisfied with the rest of items. Except  very small eating. And the charges on shipping for the g-shock watch.</li>
            <li> Thought this was a higher lever Sonicare.  This unit has only one speed and while it works adequately for what it is, it is the cheaper cheaper version.</li>
            <li> Works as it should.  The vibration is a bit weird tickles my mouth! hehehe  I find the charging base a bit precarious and the power cord still has the kinks from being folded in box which tends to make the whole thing topple over more often then I want to deal with.  I&#x27;d prefer a more stable charger but functions okay :)</li>
            <li> Was using oral b for years.  This is like getting your teeth cleaned.  Very impressed.</li>
            <li> Great toothbrush. Like it very much.</li>
            <li> Not good enough, and seems not very comfortable</li>
            <li> I had a cheaper electric toothbrush and now I am very satisfied with Sonicare.  It has met all of my needs.</li>
            <li> Works great.  Love how my teeth feel.  The professional version seems to vibrate faster than this version.  My gums and teeth feel so much better.</li>
            <li> I purchased this on Black Friday.  I have used an Oral-B toothbrush for years but had always heard great things about Sonicare.  Well, as they say...You get what you pay for.  This is so loud and the vibration is so strong.  I would not recommend to anyone.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t recommend this toothbrush more highly. I&#x27;ve been using one for 15 years or more, and I used to have gum issues, soreness and inflammation, but have had not one instance since using this toothbrush.  It&#x27;s about half the price it used to be.  You don&#x27;t need anything fancier than the basic model.</li>
            <li> Works great. A charge lasts a long time.&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t like the way the heads fit on this model. They leave a gap at the bottom and are much noisier than the screw on type heads.</li>
            <li> This toothbrush is EVERYTHING!  Do your teeth and gums a favor and get one!  It has literally saved my teeth and it will save your teeth as well as money down the road on dental costs!!!  I&#x27;d give it more than five stars if I could.</li>
            <li> I ordered two, one for me, another for my mother. it works good with a case</li>
            <li> No frills sonic care.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The travel case and extra head is a big +++++. I travel a lot and love that there is a dedicated carrying case for the unit.</li>
            <li> I have had quite a few Sonicare brushes at different price points.  This works as well as any.  I have had some that were a bit quieter, but that is such a minor concern.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pro&lt;br /&gt;-&amp;#62; Carry Case is a Must&lt;br /&gt;-&amp;#62; Easy to Find Replacement Heads&lt;br /&gt;-&amp;#62; Shuts off after 2 min&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons&lt;br /&gt;-&amp;#62; The charger is sometimes requires me to turn the brush a bit to start charging.</li>
            <li> I bought two but one of the pack was opened and the plastic package was been tore, I am not sure whether it was used but quite sure it was at least a returned item. Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> so fast,to china only 13 days,it so well so fast so cheap</li>
            <li> Good product for the price.  Hopefully, it will have some longevity in use!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very good!I like it.</li>
            <li> Update 12/29/14: After two weeks of use&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I switched from Oral-B (3000 Series) to Sonicare with this brush. It&#x27;s been an enjoyable time so far. The most noticeable difference is that Sonicare is more gentle than Oral-B, in terms of the core motor movement. Sonicare uses very small movements which are stopped if you press too hard. Oral-B brushes seem to dig in to the gumline. My Oral-B had a 30-second &amp;#34;quadpacer&amp;#34;, but this Sonicare only has a 2-minute overall timer. The brush stops when 2 minutes is over, which seems redundant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This particular Series 2 brush has a smaller head than the comparable Essence series brush that my roommate owns. I like this a lot, because it lets me easily reach the back molars without difficulty. The brush head is fairly soft. The handle feels terrific in hand, but has little to offer as far as rubberized grip. Make sure to hold the handle *lightly*, as you can stop vibrations in the brush by pressing too hard. As compared to the Essence, I haven&#x27;t seen any gunk or build-up yet. I bought the &amp;#34;gift&amp;#34; version, and the travel case is a *very* nice addition to the brush - very nicely built! However, the case is larger than my Oral-B&#x27;s, and is a bit difficult to carry in a backpack.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&#x3D;&#x3D;&amp;#62; Make sure to learn the proper technique for using a Sonicare brush! I have seen others scrub as they do with manual toothbrushes, and did the same for the first couple of days. Official instructions say instead to use light pressure and glide the brush along the gumlines. Make sure to angle the brush head upwards or downwards to stimulate the gums and saliva. Here&#x27;s a terrific video from Sonicare: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v&#x3D;gjoR91BmJJQ&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The brush says there is a 14 day adjustment period where the vibrations slowly increase over time. My gums weren&#x27;t initially irritated by the motion since I came from an Oral-B. I haven&#x27;t noticed the increase during this time - so perhaps it is working for me. During this time, I haven&#x27;t had to recharge yet.</li>
            <li> Very cost-effective products, I very like it.</li>
            <li> After owning this toothbrush for two months I can successfully say that it is the best one I&#x27;ve ever owned, though in full disclosure I&#x27;ve only ever owned cheap electrics and manual toothbrushes.  This has an easy start feature which I really appreciated because my gums were not ready for the cleaning power that this little thing possesses.  I also really like that this has inductive charging which means that there is nothing to plug in, just set your brush on the holder and it will charge.  My wife went to the dentist this week after using this for two months (not the same one, don&#x27;t worry!) and her hygienist told her that her teeth have not ever been this clean (apparently they rank people at this office when they come in).  Final Word:  I would say this is definitely worth the investment in your oral health.  I used to vigorously brush my teeth before with a manual tooth brush and this takes much less effort and does a better job!</li>
            <li> Gave it as a gift and she was very happy with it</li>
            <li> This toothbrush is the entry level model, for sure. It&#x27;s loud, does not feel as well-built as their other models, but it works. And that&#x27;s the important thing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought these for a 7 and 12 year-old. The heads are small enough to get in the very back, the handles are not too heavy, and you get the main effect of sonic waves to clean like all Sonicare brushes. The 7 yr-old needed a little help to get used to the brush and to be able to turn it in her mouth, but once she got it after a few days it was easy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The heads are loud when you insert them in - these are not the screw on type. They don&#x27;t go all the way down after they click in either. This is what makes the brush loud - the connection where the brush head vibrates. The handle and inner workings themselves are just fine. If this issue were fixed, this would be a 5 star product today - especially considering I got them for only $29.99 each!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That aside, I have no doubt that these will last a long time and my kids will enjoy them.</li>
            <li> So - where do I start? I must say - for the price point of this device, it exceeded my expectations. I&#x27;ve used Sonicare since the early 1990s and I must say, Sonicare has done a great job bringing UltraSonic brushing technology to a more affordable level without sacrificing quality.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This particular set is great because you get a travel case (which I love to use when taking w/ me on trips), you get an extra brush head - which by the way, the NEWER sets usually do NOT come w/ any extra but just the one brush head when purchased - which adds to the total value of this brush head. Considering that the recommended brush head change interval is &amp;#34;every 3 months&amp;#34; - you&#x27;ve got SIX MONTHS of brush heads / cleaning in this package.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The handle is a little more compact to me than the earlier versions. From the 1st gen to now - I&#x27;ve seen the handles become lighter and easier to handle. In reference to the other poster who mentioned this brush is &amp;#34;loud&amp;#34; - I&#x27;m unsure what they&#x27;re talking about. The brush is very silent, you hear a slight humming noise from the bristles vibrating. They say they didn&#x27;t want to &amp;#34;wake up their partner brushing their teeth.&amp;#34; Are you kidding me?! I&#x27;ve never seen this brush make tons of noise. Now - if you&#x27;re talking about a competing brand that uses the infamous oscillating bristles, YES. It&#x27;s &amp;#34;LOUD-er&amp;#34;.... okay. I&#x27;m stopping there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will say, w/ the handles being &amp;#34;lighter&amp;#34; also makes me notice that the handles seem to be of &amp;#34;CHEAP-er&amp;#34; quality. If you&#x27;re used Sonicare before, you&#x27;ll know what I&#x27;m talking about. I previously used a Sonicare FLEX-Care w/ the UV Light head sanitizing station. That handle was rubberized to make it easier to hold. This handle, is all plastic w/ exception of the rubberized power button. The brush feels slightly funny to me considering I&#x27;m used to the rubberized handle but the &amp;#34;raised dots&amp;#34; on the back of the handle allow my finger to gripthe brush. It&#x27;s no big deal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The handle conveniently &amp;#34;pulses&amp;#34; every 30 seconds to remind me to move to the next section of my mouth and at the end of 2 minutes, the handle will signal that you&#x27;ve completed the brushing session. How convenient!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The charger is smaller than previous versions of Sonicare brush chargers - not too much, but noticeable to me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This brush feels just as effective as my Sonicare FlexCare, which is an older model, but costs way less. Considering this brush costs just a smidgen under two Thomas Jefferson notes, vs the former brush I had costing nearly 10 notes, um -- seriously? I think this toothbrush package is a fantastic offer and if you have Prime membership - the free shipping really makes it convenient!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will say one more thing - considering on the package of the box that Sonicare will guarantee you&#x27;ll love it or your money back within 60 days? Well - chances are, you won&#x27;t want your money back! The brush uses UltraSonic sound vibrations to smack plaque off your teeth. You allow the brush to work for you. You don&#x27;t need to push hard at all - I allow the brush to glide around my mouth, and if you really want to step it up, you can get their &amp;#34;Whitening&amp;#34; head and it definitely makes a difference to me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, I feel that this brush is a fantastic value and I am glad I made my next brush a Sonicare. As a former user of the famous oscillating brush head before, I can tell you this brush gives you expensive quality cleaning without the expensive price tag.</li>
            <li> I had the older model Philips brush (the one with the head and larger base) and this one is way better. It doesn&#x27;t get dirty as fast and doesn&#x27;t have buildup at the base like the old one does. Also, compared to the OralB brush this one is way better, the head is smaller and doesn&#x27;t feel like you are shoving a a shovel in your mouth. It allows you to be more precise with your cleaning and work on a smaller area, it also vibrates a lot more and leaves your mouth feeling a lot more clean afterwords. Going from a regular brush to this is a huge step up and will leave you wondering why you haven&#x27;t purchased one sooner.</li>
            <li> This is my first electric toothbrush and I must say that I continue to enjoy using it. It really is a lot more convenient than manually brushing and it also stops itself after 2 minutes so I know how long I&#x27;ve been brushing. The case is convenient for storing my extra brush head.&lt;br /&gt;Though, there are a bit of cons such as that there&#x27;s a gap between the brush head and the body because it doesn&#x27;t click together tightly. This gap allows my toothbrush to seep inside and because of this I have to pull out the head every time to wipe that area clean. It just so happens that I&#x27;m a messy tooth brusher.&lt;br /&gt;Other than occasionally having the plastic part of the brush vibrate against my teeth as I move, brushing is for the most part smooth.</li>
            <li> i like this very much&lt;br /&gt;The price is also much better</li>
            <li> Too much noise.And the first time I use this toothbrush I get blood.And it is not easy cleaning.But the prince may be nice.Otherwise I won&#x27;t choose it.</li>
            <li> Feels like I went to the dentist EVERY DAY! My sons use it and it has cleaned there teeth up amazingly! Had to get one for my best friend!!!!</li>
            <li> good  gift, very nice!</li>
            <li> Philips toothbrush useful, also brought a spare toothbrush head, the price is cheap</li>
            <li> Nowhere near as much vibration as my other Sonicares have had. The case makes it a nice travel brush which is what I wanted it for, but it is nowhere near as good as a Sonicare should be</li>
            <li> 2 weeks after the need to charge, generally speaking good</li>
            <li> My new dentist recommended the Phillips Sonicare because I always have heavy plaque build up.  I brush, I floss, I use tater control  toothpaste and I still get tons of tarter.  Turns out it is genetic so I can blame my Dad for this!  Brushing with the Sonicare leaves my teeth feeling like we just left the dentist every day.  I love the 2 minute timer feature!</li>
            <li> This toothbrush is very good and the tooth brush is clean.</li>
            <li> Besides the cheap price and good speed of direct mail , it does not have any advantages, standby time is short, the sound of vibration is too large, do not suggest to buy.</li>
            <li> Great tooth brush. Comes with two heads. Very powerful. I like this toothbrush</li>
            <li> I love it. it is  very good,and convenient to carry</li>
            <li> I got a pink version of this brush from a major retailer for Christmas and I liked it so much I bought this one (from Amazon) for my boyfriend. We both love our new toothbrushes and it really does make a big difference! I&#x27;m a slacker when it comes to oral hygiene but this thing makes my mouth feel clean and refreshed after every use! I&#x27;ve even noticed my teeth getting whiter but that may be from the toothpaste I switched to around the same time I got this brush. Great buy for sure :)</li>
            <li> It is a perfect goods Let me feel happy is good quality and price is the reason why I always choose amazon</li>
            <li> Much better than old one with the fat handle. Doesn&#x27;t collect gunk under brush attachment.</li>
            <li> This brush is awesome! Your literally feel like you just got back from the dentist every day. I bought this for my brother for Christmas, he boasted so much about it that I had to give it a try. I&#x27;m glad I did!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re in the market for a high priced unit, Don&#x27;t Bother. The only real difference between this and the DiamondClean edition is a huge price tag and a different head. You can buy the DiamondClean brushes for this model too, they&#x27;re all interchangeable. They both have the same 31,000 strokes per minute. The other ones do have different timing features, but who actually uses all those?</li>
            <li> It sounds good, feels food and generally does a good job, but there is a design flaw:&lt;br /&gt;I expect that most people think that if it vibrates loudly, it is working best.&lt;br /&gt;However, when you twist on the brush, it doesn&#x27;t click tight into place.  This often allows the brush assembly to vibrate loose (no matter how tight you turn it).  When this happens, the vibrations get louder, but the actual cleaning action becomes less effective.  This could be solved by creating a &amp;#34;bump&amp;#34; in the screw tread that would lock the assembly in place and prevent the brush from vibrating loose.  I hate to have to stop in the middle of a brushing to turn off the mechanism and attempt to re-twist the brush head for it to work properly.</li>
            <li> Although it is obvious where they cut corners, it is more powerful than it used to be.  Hope it lasts as long!</li>
            <li> Good plug for performance and starting. Long lasting and great acceleration.  Very satisfied</li>
            <li> My wife loves this brush. I did the research and according to what I read this brush is a great value and performs in the top of its class.</li>
            <li> My item was delivered on time, it was as described, I recommend this fantastic item and perfect seller</li>
            <li> Ok right now I have had it four days and it is fine. I had the Sonic years before and loved it. My husband ordered the Waterpik Prime special that was 69.00 and got it on a daily deal for 59.00. I had been using it for two weeks and we both said same thing it completely changed our mouth and we had healthier gums in two weeks. It literally closed my gum pockets! (confirmed by my dentist) I didn&#x27;t order it because I didn&#x27;t need a water pik and didn&#x27;t want to waste the extra counter space and their separate tooth brush was oddly more expensive at 89.00 so I got this sonic. It is fine. I thought it had two speeds but doesn&#x27;t appear to be adjustable or else I can&#x27;t figure it out. I think the waterpik is better. I will update in two weeks to see if I feel any different.  It is a couple months later and I did adjust to the Sonic and love it as much as the Waterpik. I would still get the Waterpik if priced the same,however.  I never have noticed two speeds on it. I am going to upgrade from four stars to five stars as my gums are still in great health.</li>
            <li> This toothbrush has little to no real power. Even when it&#x27;s fully charged its just a slight amount of vibration. Kinda like when your phone is on vibrate. I had previous Sonicare brushes and this is by far the worst.  Don&#x27;t waste your money on this. Up your price point and just get an Oral-B brush.</li>
            <li> Exactly as described.</li>
            <li> I have been using the Phillips Sonicare HX6212/05 for over 6 months now and I definitely notice an improvement in my dental health. My teeth seem brighter and my gums overall just feel much cleaner and healthier after using this product compared to my old Oral-B electric toothbrush. It comes with a great hard cover travel case that fits the brush and 2 heads, which I find infinitely superior to the older model&#x27;s soft pouch traveling case. My only gripe with this toothbrush is that I have to take off the head and clean out the brush and head with a Q-tip to prevent mold from building up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;-Very strong vibration&lt;br /&gt;-Nice hard cover travel case&lt;br /&gt;-Comes with a second brush head&lt;br /&gt;-Paid $30 for mine when there was a coupon clipping&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;-Can be a bit loud but this doesn&#x27;t bother me at all but it might bother others&lt;br /&gt;-Have to remove head and clean to prevent molding</li>
            <li> The price is attracted,it has the basic function clean and white,and also has a timer.For me,it is enough</li>
            <li> Great toothbrush...gets that clean feeling after brushing.  Just press the button and away you go until it stops.</li>
            <li> Loving so far. Great product to have as a first time electric toothbrush. My teeth definitely feel cleaner when I use this. Once it breaks down, I&#x27;ll have to upgrade to features I wish this had. But for this price point you can beat the quality.</li>
            <li> Works great and battery life is not an issue. Why spend more on fancier models with timers and what not. This works great cleans well, after all this is just a toothbrush. Skip the fancier models and save some loot. I would recommend also I got a extra brush with the pack I got, just make sure that you check that option because when ordering there where 3 different ones I could choose from, like a xmas addition or something. All were the same model just packed in different bundles.</li>
            <li> This is great. After a week, my teeth are cleaner, whiter. Loosens all kinds of crap. Makes it easier to get places I wouldn&#x27;t. Small brush  head gets into cracks</li>
            <li> This was a replacement of an older Sonicare.  I like this one much better, it is smaller and faster and does, to me, a better job than my old one.</li>
            <li> a good toothbrush,i like it.</li>
            <li> Way better than using a manual toothbrush! I&#x27;ve noticed a significant reduction in plaque build-up. I highly recommend this toothbrush! Especially for the price!</li>
            <li> Direct mail to China is about 220 yuan. Things have a loud, for the first time to use are not used to, but it does the brush clean.</li>
            <li> excellent，cheap，Effective，Fast transport，Worth buying！</li>
            <li> a little sound, but powerful</li>
            <li> The price is good. And its function is OK</li>
            <li> It works with  big noise.I can&#x27;t use it in the morning, afraid of wake up my family.If I am in America, I would request a return.Although very cheap, but the quality is unstable.My friend bought  the same one, the quality is very good.I can only say that I am a little bad luck.I am very disappointed in this shopping.</li>
            <li> The use of 2 days, my teeth white!</li>
            <li> Electric toothbrush , to make me happy $&#x3D;)</li>
            <li> This certainly the cheaper model but the only thing I miss over the more costly one, which lasted me over 8 years, is the lack of quadrant timers - the little pause that tells you when to move on.  Other than that it does the trick.</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful tooth brush!  My teeth are left feeling cleaner than ever, we also love the 2 minute timer!</li>
            <li> Bought it on jan 6th. Totally broken on March 19th.</li>
            <li> Got this on a cyber Monday deal for cheap because I always wanted to try out an electric toothbrush. It is awesome!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love the sensation of brushing my teeth, it makes the task much more enjoyable haha. Also the two minute timer ensures I brush for as long as I am supposed to (two minutes is a long time! so I rarely made it before)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The travel case is nice too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, it is a good setup if you&#x27;re looking to make the switch from your old analog toothbrush! ;)</li>
            <li> Good!! with non metal contact outside.</li>
            <li> Better than going to the dentist to have my teeth cleaned. Very pleased.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s the product I want. It&#x27;s easy to bring when trip, and can use 2 weeks without charge. but little noisy.</li>
            <li> A great value and a great product.  Exactly as described.  Very pleased with this order.</li>
            <li> GREAT PRODUCT. Quality construction and great performance. Wish I purchased this sooner. I was a little concerned it might be too powerful, not a problem at all, but a great electric toothbrush purchase with a bonus travel case.</li>
            <li> The noise is relatively large, the charge is not very convenient.</li>
            <li> The noise is very large. It is very hard to have toothpaste on it. The shake will quickly shake all toothpaste out of it.</li>
            <li> So much better than the old version</li>
            <li> I used this to replace an old Braun version.  Love it!</li>
            <li> Love it! Works great.</li>
            <li> Not nearly as we&#x27;ll made or effective. Two minute timer not separated into 30 second increments. Quite loud and rattles quite a bit. Unfortunately, Sonicare no longer makes the magnetically driven model so we&#x27;re stuck with this flimsy item and it&#x27;s cousins.</li>
            <li> it makes so much noise,but take good care of my tooth</li>
            <li> I paid $30 for this Philips Sonicare electric toothbrush.  It came with a second brush, a re-charger, and a traveling case.  It works very well.  My teeth feel much cleaner than with a non-electric toothbrush.  For the price, this was an excellent purchase.  Also, I highly recommend switching to an electronic tooth brush if you have not already.</li>
            <li> First electric toothbrush and I will never go back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Saw a video on the sonicare website and it helped on how to use it. Definitely would recommend buying this product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this for almost two months and overall I like the product other than one huge flaw. This is the first true electric toothbrush that I&#x27;ve had so I have nothing to compare to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros. I really feel like I&#x27;m getting a good clean. I spend less time brushing because with a manual I never felt like two minutes was enough. Charging station is really cool, and all in all easy to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons. SO LOUD! I just saw a video today prompting me to write this review. Mine is much louder than the one I saw in video, almost uncomfortably so. It makes me wonder if mine is defective. Another issue is that I don&#x27;t have perfectly straight teeth due to crowding and in certain spots the brush head bumps against my teeth which is not good. Other than that it&#x27;s disappointing how expensive the brush heads are but I knew that going in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall I really am liking the toothbrush but I really want to know if why mine has such excessive noise.</li>
            <li> excellent product and good quality.</li>
            <li> Liked the toothbrush, also recommend it to friends&lt;br /&gt;They also have purchased, used, all feel very, very good</li>
            <li> Great gift for globe-trotting kids--just make sure they have the appropriate plug for non-US electrics</li>
            <li> Terrible. WAY TOO INTENSE. I thought this thing knocked out a filling, it was so unbelievably intense &amp; high speed.....I went to the dentist....she said my fillings were okay but she said the toothbrush was the same one she had at home, but it didn&#x27;t sound like mine did (loud &amp; extremely high speed)....she recommended I return it, and not use it. Unfortunately I threw out the stuff that the box had in it that the brush came in....I would never use this thing. My gums hurt for three days after I used it for the last time. I&#x27;m going back to my old Braun Oral B.  I would like to get my money back but doubt they would take it back without all the box contents.....?  I actually wonder if it might be defective. Would be nice to hear from Amazon on this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;****UPDATE***&lt;br /&gt;Feb. 2, 2015&lt;br /&gt;I found the packaging stuff that came with the toothbrush along with the box, thankfully....I&#x27;m sending this thing back tomorrow! I think I got a lemon...it&#x27;s not something I would ever use again!</li>
            <li> Amazing product at an amazing price. My dentist had recommended Sonicares over the past several years but the models they sold at their office were in the $80-$120 range. Because of this I never bothered looking into them anymore based solely on price consciousness. There was a $10 off coupon applied at checkout which was a plus because I was going to buy this regardless. Total price with tax was about $32 and I couldn&#x27;t be happier. I&#x27;m a Prime Subscriber and decided to wait the additional day for delivery to have the travel case (great quality, highly recommended) and the additional brush head included at no additional cost.</li>
            <li> Picked up for $30 via slickdeals, really great basic electric toothbrush. I bought the more expensive sonicare from costco but don&#x27;t use all its modes, this is pretty much the same thing but with a single normal mode.</li>
            <li> I real received one is HX6210......</li>
            <li> Perfect toothbrush---perfect size</li>
            <li> Great toothbrush, works wonderfully on my teeth and gums. Very powerful. Good quality for the price.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this toothbrush.  I had an older version that I had for a long time.  Couldn&#x27;t buy replacement brushes so I bought a new toothbrush.  So glad I did.  Feels like the hygienist cleans my teeth every time I use it.  Not normally this excited over a tooth brush but even my gums feel better.</li>
            <li> nice to hold. Easy to charge.</li>
            <li> Works great. Charge lasts for weeks-very nice. The high freq started off tickling my nose, but I guess I got used to it. As such, there is an optional setting that begins with minimal vibration and gradually increases over two weeks to full power. Cute.</li>
            <li> Easy to use,but it&#x27;s too noisy.</li>
            <li> Love Sonicare and had one for years.  Mine had to be replaced so tried this one.  It&#x27;s perfect and a great price to have the kids get one as well.  Found we&#x27;ve had less cavities and tartar.  Very pleased with this product.</li>
            <li> Works great, so much better than the Braun,</li>
            <li> There is an open space/gap between the brushing head and the motor part,so when i brush my teeth，my mouth become numb.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just what I want. good toothbrush and reasonable price.</li>
            <li> nice very good.but,the charging time is so long.</li>
            <li> Well, the product is ok for cleaning. BUT, the noise was too loud, it&#x27;s terrible! For the first time I used it,  my baby was waken up and kept crying......</li>
            <li> Good product, I have had better toothbrushes, but with the price of this, you can&#x27;t go wrong!</li>
            <li> Sound a little big, but very comfortable to use</li>
            <li> One star for the bonus. The toothbrush is very noise during using it. Instead of 2 week battery-life as promote, it gives me only about 4 days.</li>
            <li> Incredible, mouth so clean, specially if you get the air/mouthwash water pic. You feel like you had your dentist cleaned your teeth,&lt;br /&gt;my dentist recommended them, I knew on Amazon was on sale. The price on CVS and Walgreens and other websites are much&lt;br /&gt;more, great deal !!!!!</li>
            <li> Not as great as the Healthy White, but still a really good toothbrush.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t be happier with this purchase, the real question is why didn&#x27;t I switch to an electronic toothbrush earlier. My wife and I both use this and I can honestly feel that it does remove six times more plague than my manual did. I had puffy receding gums and was recommended by the hygienist&lt;br /&gt;to switch to the Sonicare. I look forward to brushing my teeth these days.</li>
            <li> This thing is a joke. This brush is completely inferior to every other Sonicare brush I&#x27;ve had.  It&#x27;s very loud, rickety, weak, and cheaply made.  I&#x27;m disappointed in Philips for trying to cash in on their previously good Sonicare name with a genuinely overpriced piece of junk.  Yet I see that it for some reason has spectacular, glowing reviews?!!  Some of them are so obviously fake.  &amp;#34;BEST SONICARE TOOTHBRUSH EVER!&amp;#34; says the headline of one of them.  I simply refuse to believe that Amazon&#x27;s review system isn&#x27;t being gamed by Philips.  -------update after 5 weeks use----- I honestly just feel betrayed.  It is so disheartening to see that Sonicare would put their name on such a poor product.  I&#x27;m forced to use my wife&#x27;s older Sonicare until I decide what to do about this.  This thing is priced only slightly cheaper than the older, much much better units.  I could buy one of their new better units, and would normally be OK with that, but I don&#x27;t want to send Philips any more money after this.</li>
            <li> Works great. Love that I don&#x27;t need to keep it plugged in. A charge lasts a few weeks!</li>
            <li> Not use yet, good price.</li>
            <li> I just bought this toothbrush based on the reviews. It&#x27;s loud and weak. I&#x27;m returning. Don&#x27;t buy</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never used an electric toothbrush like this.  Easy to use.  It uses a recharging station rather than batteries.  I have no opinion on that.  I&#x27;ll update my review once I go back to the dentist, which recommended I get an electric toothbrush to help with plague.  So, we&#x27;ll see in about 3 months what the deal is and if it was worth the $50 for this.</li>
            <li> It is good , but the noise is a bit bigger.</li>
            <li> The dental tool I recently purchased, Phillips Sonicare, is working as advertised.  I won&#x27;t be able to comment on its effectiveness until after my next dental check-up, which is a couple of months from now.</li>
            <li> I purchased this as a second electric toothbrush and the vibration was very weak as compared to my other one. I called Philips and the representative mentioned that it was a common complaint. He suggested the Sonicare Easy Clean model for a more powerful vibration.</li>
            <li> Very powerful toothbrush!  With the softest toothbrushes available, it made my teeth hurt for the rest of the day after the first use.  When I tried a &amp;#34;barely touch&amp;#34; method (actually, didn&#x27;t even feel like I was touching my teeth) there was no pain, and my teeth came out feeling like I just got them cleaned at the dentist&#x27;s office.  However, after a couple of months of use I no longer use this toothbrush.  For me there are two problems:&lt;br /&gt;1.  I just barley feel the toothbrush on my teeth and yet this product causes my teeth to hurt for days afterwards, now.&lt;br /&gt; 2.  I can&#x27;t seem to get the toothbrush at the back of my bottom teeth at the right angle to clean them well.  When I tilt the tip of the brush downward the brush works, but the toothbrush handle is too long and it hits my upper mouth.  This strain and mouth contortions causes all the fluid to fall out of my mouth!  Sounds funny I know, and I suppose it is if you were looking at me.  That&#x27;s ok, but the bottom line is that it discourages me from using this tooth brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I clean my teeth very well, normally.  But because of the above problems I started skipping the back of my bottom teeth and this is not good!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Conclusion:&lt;br /&gt;This toothbrush does a great job on cleaning the teeth where it works smoothly, but the brush and handle on it are just too long to give individual teeth the thorough attention I like to give them.  I am going back to the round brush electric toothbrush by Oral B.  And forget the powerful &amp;#34;sonic&amp;#34; type system.  In my opinion, the tarter control electric toothbrush works just as well.  I just wish Oral B had softer toothbrushes, even their softest are not soft enough for me.</li>
            <li> I bought this brush in Jan. It stopped work yesterday. the battery is dead.</li>
            <li> This is the third Sonicare toothbrush I have bought over the years. They are well built and do a better job of cleaning my family&#x27;s teeth then another toothbrush I&#x27;ve tried. This toothbrush is easy for the kids too who never did a good job with a regular brush or one of the low grade electronic toothbrushes. Now their teeth are cleaner which will hopefully help with cavity reduction later on in life. The case was a nice bonus too because we are always staying overnight somewhere. They also made a version with a UV light to kill germs but it is more money. Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> A direct mail shopping very good, four days from the ocean to reach the destination, very happy</li>
            <li> This is very good. useful !</li>
            <li> Well, I&#x27;m using&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not sure if I want to use a long durability</li>
            <li> Why did I wait so long to buy one of these?  Makes brushing my teeth so much easier!</li>
            <li> I have one of the more expensive flexcare platinum models for home use, but decided to pick up one of these while on sale for traveling. It has a bunch of less bells and whistles, but otherwise works just as well. The brushes that came with it are too soft for my taste, but the brushes I use with the flexcare are interchangeable with this unit so all is good.</li>
            <li> Seems good, but it makes too much noise!! Also, it takes a verrrrry long time to change.</li>
            <li> Only one mode, and 6730 is not the same, and the battery is not lithium battery</li>
            <li> Bought this on 12/23/2014, received it on 12/26/2014. Used it for around two months before it stops working completely before March 2015. I noticed issues few weeks before it failed, when it start to make chirpy sounds and flashing amber light while charging, I have to take it off the charger in order to get a good night sleep. Then I notice that it will turn itself on/off for a moment, which freak my wife and I out at the beginning, thinking some ghost is brushing their teeth. &#x3D;) Then the button starts to fail when I can&#x27;t turn it on/off normally, have to either press really hard or really soft.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After a few weeks suffering from the problem mentioned above, it finally decided to give up and die. So overall, not very reliable, only lasted two months, which is very disappointing.</li>
            <li> I love it&lt;br /&gt;Good!!!</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t vibrate as smoothly as older model.</li>
            <li> it is great. it does the job as advertised. there is not anything negative about this brush. it is straight forward, brush your teeth with it and it does a much better job than a manual brush.</li>
            <li> This is the cheapest version and I wished I did not buy this model.  It rattles which makes it hard on your teeth.</li>
            <li> Easy to use, effective.</li>
            <li> The toothbrush is really cheap, and really good, love Philips</li>
            <li> The brush heads are not suitable for toothbrush and it&#x27;s noisy when working.</li>
            <li> This thing makes a huge noise!!! I don&#x27;t really like it!</li>
            <li> Super product for the price. Bought it for my vacation house as I have a better model at home and it is fantastic. Has the 2 minute brushing cycle but lacks the 30 sec buzzer that tells you to change brushing sector. Since I bought my home sonicare my dental checkups have been great.</li>
            <li> Really fast and effective electric toothbrush and the price when I bought was un-beatable.</li>
            <li> Wow, this thing is powerful.  There is a much stronger action them my ancient Braun oscillating toothbrush.  It feels like it really cleans at the gum line, although only my dental hygienist will have the final say on its effectiveness.  The charge seems to last forever and I don&#x27;t put it back on the charger except once a week.</li>
            <li> I love this toothbrush. It makes my teeth looking white, feeling clean, and my mouth smelling fresh. I love the idea of a smaller head and a longer neck, to get into the back of your mouth.</li>
            <li> the brush head is loose,works with big noise. and the Toothbrush could have hurt my gum&lt;br /&gt;it is should be a zero star item.</li>
            <li> I am really satisfied&lt;br /&gt;Want to give 100 points&lt;br /&gt;Good seller !!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s too noisy!&lt;br /&gt;I think it&#x27;s design problem. When I comment, I found there are many same issues.&lt;br /&gt;In a word, bad purchase experience.</li>
            <li> Easy to use and easy to clean. And it can make me to brush my teeth completely.</li>
            <li> Used for 9 months now, no issues.  Holds a charge very well (2 days at least).</li>
            <li> Great product. I bought for my parents and they love it.</li>
            <li> We have his &amp; hers.  Really cleans down deep.</li>
            <li> I had my last sonic are for ten years. I loved it. It&lt;br /&gt;quit on me. I hated that I could not take it with me on trips without also bringing the charging base. The new one is excellent. I can take it on week long trips without the charger. It performs well. I can&#x27;t find anything that is not perfect about it.</li>
            <li> I love this toothbrush! It tickles at first but you get use to it quickly. It really cleaned my teeth exceptionally well. It takes a little getting use to but well worth it. I&#x27;m hoping to avoid a deep cleaning in the next 6 mo. so my dentist recommended this brush for me to use. So far so good!</li>
            <li> I use it for almost 3 months and i love it, although it makes a noisy sound</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t careful enough when I bought it as a travel brush and didn&#x27;t notice there was no mention of the quadpacer feature, which IMHO is extremely useful in signaling when to change section. Furthermore, it rattles and doesn&#x27;t seem as solid as regular Sonicare brushes. It is rather expensive in view of its limited capabilities.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to carry because the small box,then I can take it when out for travelling.</li>
            <li> Like the smaller headed brush; works great!</li>
            <li> Works great! The gf loves it</li>
            <li> Great product.  I like it much more than the rotating head brushes.</li>
            <li> Ordered this Philips Sonicare HX6212/05, but received a HX6210 model :(  No happy</li>
            <li> Very strong vibration.</li>
            <li> too much noisy！i cannot stand it！only one reason that i bought it is the price</li>
            <li> I love Sonicare toothbrushes, but this new &amp;#34;2 Series&amp;#34; design is inferior to past models.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have owned and used almost every version of Sonicare toothbrushes since they first came out, and they have all been excellent ... I would never use anything else. However, this new 2 Series is noisy and does not seem to vibrate with the same intensity as past models. (And yes, I did turn off the newbie &amp;#34;ramp-up&amp;#34; feature.)  I called Philips Sonicare Customer Service and the representative admitted that this new 2 Series uses a different type of motor than past models. She immediately offered to exchange this 2 Series for an older-style &amp;#34;Easy Clean&amp;#34; model. The exchange was fast and efficient, and even included free return shipping.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hope Philips re-thinks this new design and does not expand it to other models.</li>
            <li> The sound is very big</li>
            <li> very very valueable one!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a toothbrush!!!!</li>
            <li> This brush was just too powerful for me. It tickled my mouth so badly that I couldn&#x27;t clean my teeth properly at all. I changed the brush and gave it to my son. He loves it. He says it makes his teeth feel very clean.</li>
            <li> Pretty good. but the price is not stable</li>
            <li> it is very good!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> I use it everyday, better than normal tooth brush,&lt;br /&gt;I wonder what more expensive products offer. this is still good.</li>
            <li> I found the description of this product a little confusing. It does come with the travel case, which I had already ordered separately.</li>
            <li> Great toothbrush but it is a little softer brushing than my older sonicare model</li>
            <li> This did not work for me. The speed adjustment did not work too. It is okay if it works as it should. Not for the price I paid for it.</li>
            <li> works great less filling(s)</li>
            <li> Everyone should give up their manual tooth brush and use one of these.  Technology has overtaken the past with thousands of brush strokes per second.  Teeth feel cleaner and gums, especially are massaged and kept healthy.  Charge can last for two weeks.  Kids like it and it certainly does a better job of keeping their little mouthes healthy.</li>
            <li> Note: the box model is HX6212/05, but I received there is HX6210 but it is bad, the brush head loose, but now I used to open, only to find, after a return period</li>
            <li> Cheap feeling, excessive vibration of the handle, loud.  My old unit just died after years of use - this is nothing close to the quality of the prior sonicare.  I&#x27;ll try one of the more expensive models.  Unless you just can&#x27;t afford a more expensive unit, or don&#x27;t mind the noise/vibration, I&#x27;d stay away from this.  I&#x27;m returning.</li>
            <li> Who doesn&#x27;t love clean teeth? We gave this as a dirty Santa gift and it was quite the hit! I&#x27;ve used one for years and it works well in removing stains and preventing plaque while being gentle on the gums</li>
            <li> I bought this to replace my Sonicare HX6711/02 HealthyWhite 710 which I loved.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This toothbrush is garbage compared to that one.  Wish I didn&#x27;t waste my money. It barely vibrates. The whole body has a very cheap feel to it. My old brush was solid.</li>
            <li> Sonicare is truly the best.  I can feel a noticeable difference in how clean my teeth feel.&lt;br /&gt;Everyone should have one.  Seriously.</li>
            <li> The box is quite useful when travelling!</li>
            <li> These products really good.&lt;br /&gt;Buy cheap hangeo well as a good product.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you.</li>
            <li> a little noise but you can bear it</li>
            <li> Bought this for friend and they won&#x27;t stop talking about it. They love it and think I spent three times what i did for it.</li>
            <li> The special bonus pack is very well and the travel case is so beautiful.</li>
            <li> The toothbrush is good, but too much noise</li>
            <li> I like it very much, my teeth white now.</li>
            <li> Love it! Used it on my Florida trip and didn&#x27;t have to charge for a week.  Great product.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s good. but don&#x27;t have quardfacer function.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a remplacement for the OralB my wife and I had been using for the past 5 years as they both recently died. I didn&#x27;t want to spend a ridiculous amount on a toothbrush but still wanted good quality. This was a great deal. We both like the Sonicare better than the Oral B and you can&#x27;t beat the price with a nice travel case included. One simple 2 minute timer and that&#x27;s it. Love it.</li>
            <li> Good product, There is anotehr upgraded version is a little bit better(with 30s quadrant reminder). I bought the another 4 of a different version as gifts.</li>
            <li> Great price with the promo coupon! This is mid-line series. It does not have the timer for brushing each section of your teeth. I suppose you can just count 30 seconds x4 while brushing.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sticking with the lower cost versions of electronic toothbrushes now.  I have used a previous generation of Sonicare higher end just to have the battery start to fail after a year or so.  I actually moved to Oral B after that with similar results.  The Oral-B can be opened up to &amp;#34;recycle&amp;#34; the battery or just solder a new one in it.  Too much effort for that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This hit a good price point with a coupon.  It works great and though at times a bit loud...nothing too out of the ordinary.  It did not bother me much so I would say this is not a deal breaker.  It only has 1 mode but honestly, I never used the other modes on the other toothbrushes anyway.  My opinion is save some dollars as you are going to have to replace this in a year or two anyway.</li>
            <li> Disappointed!  I bought 3 of these tooth brushes based on the reviews that said they &amp;#34;work the same as all the other Sonicare toothbrushes but without the bells and whistles.&amp;#34;  WRONG!  These are so much weaker than any Sonicare toothbrush I&#x27;ve ever used (I&#x27;ve been using various models of Sonicare for over 10 years now).  The people who leave those reviews must have never used other Sonicare brushes. I&#x27;m pretty bummed as I was thinking this would be a cheaper option for my children, but no.</li>
            <li> My old Sonicare was getting grungy and the rubber grip was falling apart so I decided to replace it. I didn&#x27;t think an electric toothbrush was complicated, so I went ahead and impulse bought this since it was rated #1 on amazon. This was my mistake.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This thing brushes at least twice as vigorously as my previous model. It hurts and is incredibly loud like there is loose plastic when vibrating.&lt;br /&gt;There is no 30 second pacing which I sorely miss.&lt;br /&gt;The brush head has a sharp protrusion where plastic was injected into the mold that scrapes on my lips while I use it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will be replacing this with a much nicer model now that I&#x27;ve learned you have to shell out quite a bit more money to get a seemingly simple product.</li>
            <li> I wanted this Sonicare tooth brush for years.  It is all I thought it was.  Good buy!</li>
            <li> Great toothbrush, providing the bare minimum features at a low price. Higher priced sonicare toothbrushes come with timer features etc. that I really don&#x27;t care for. I had one of their &amp;#34;top end&amp;#34; toothbrushes (bought in a 2-pack for ~$150 from Costco) for several years before the motor simply died. I think it lasted 5-6 years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This toothbrush is def. a worthy replacement. Only reason I&#x27;m docking a star is that its pretty loud. Doesn&#x27;t bother me much, but I figure it should be brought to everyone&#x27;s attention.</li>
            <li> I had a Braun circular brush for many years.  Since that played out I bought this Sonicare and at first it&lt;br /&gt;tickled the inside of my mouth almost too much.  Now I think I have become used to it.  Brushing is quick.</li>
            <li> Soniicare brush is great, like the new styling, no gunk on the inside anymore. My husband really likes the new one, lighter weight and easier for him to handle. The old Sonicare brush is over 12 years old and the only reason he was willing to get a new one was because the battery is dying on the old one.</li>
            <li> Battery gets drained way to fast not that happy with my purchase after all!!! It&#x27;s charging every 2 days and doesn&#x27;t seem to hold the charge long enough</li>
            <li> The item is very nice.I like it very much!</li>
            <li> My dentist has been trying to get me to buy a Sonicare for a long time, my old power tooth brush finally died so I got a Sonicare, and it does work a lot better.</li>
            <li> Great product. The battery endures for almost 2 weeks!! I&#x27;m using it in Argentina just fine... buy an adapter.</li>
            <li> Had this for half a year now. Never breaks down once. I am still using the original brush head, very endurable.&lt;br /&gt;Recharges well and still can last for around two weeks after fully recharging.&lt;br /&gt;The travel case is extremely useful to hold and protect your brush.</li>
            <li> My first, nice electric toothbrush and I am very pleased.</li>
            <li> Very good. I like it, it&#x27;s convenient and cheap to buy it from Amazon ship to China.</li>
            <li> Very good use, brush your teeth very clean</li>
            <li> I bought this one for our daughter after purchasing a two-pack at Costco for my husband and myself. We liked it that much!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We had been using battery operated toothbrushes for years and got sick and tired of replacing the batteries and cleaning up all the gunk that accumulates around the battery compartment. The only upside of those toothbrushes is that they came with several replacement heads, but we noticed we were accumulating replacement heads while we ended up throwing out the toothbrushes because they failed regularly, even after changing batteries frequently.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The charge lasts a long time. I&#x27;d say over 2 weeks without having to put it in the chager.&lt;br /&gt;The brush heads far exceeded my expectations. I have braces and the brush looks brand new.&lt;br /&gt;Very easy to use by just guiding the brush, there is no need to press and &amp;#34;help&amp;#34; it out.&lt;br /&gt;Convenient travel case.&lt;br /&gt;Great to have another replacement head.&lt;br /&gt;Easy to clean and Maintain.&lt;br /&gt;Huge difference in how clean the teeth feel after brushing. It is like having had a good cleaning at the dentist.&lt;br /&gt;Tartar build-up and gums are super healthy. Dental hygienist, orthodontist and the dentist are impressed by how healthy my teeth are and how little plaque there is to scrape.&lt;br /&gt;It is a good feature to have the timer ~ which in all honesty, I have never used ~ for young kids and adults to do quadrants for the recommended time&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Very easy to accidentally push the button and stop action. But all electric toothbrushes have a similar issue. No stars deducted for this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Loud. But so what? It is not a jet engine. People make more noise than this toothbrush when they are getting ready in the bathroom. No big deal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend these types of brushes. It is a worthwhile investment for those of us who want to take care of our teeth and maintain them for life. It is a lot less expensive to maintain than having toreplace and far too many people end up with dentures due to improper maintenance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We take these when RV&#x27;ing too. No need to bring the charger for a two week trip, but will for longer trips.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used sonicare for years now.  I originally started with the E series ones, and have since moved on to this one.  The reason I moved away from the e series is because of the issue with the mold.  Cleaning under the brush heads were gross.  With this model, cleaning is simple and easy.  I like this a lot better.  HOWEVER, honestly, I find that the E series brushes have more power, and it felt stronger.  I feel that this model is weaker than the older ones.  It may have to do with the way the toothbrush head is connected.  However, I still think that this model is good.  It just depends on what you think is more important...the ease of cleaning the brush, or the power of the vibration.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m perfectly satisfied by this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can feel clean than original toothbrush every times</li>
            <li> love love love my sonic! This is the 2nd one I had; honestly the first one lasted almost 8 years!!!! This one is just the basic, but I didn&#x27;t need all the bells and whistles, and they all clean the same. The great thing is you can use different heads on this unit depending on what your needs are. So I saved money by buying this basic unit and I can upgrade it by just changing the brush heads! Another totally awesome side benefit, when I went to register the unit online, I got another 1-1/2 years extra warranty time added for free!!! So make sure to register your unit. When I went to the dentist, the hygienist was done in like 10 minutes - the dr came in for the exam and he said the hygienist told him I had virtually no plaque buildup! Now, I do have a few other steps I take, but this is a very important one in the whole process. Highly recommended you try this unit; you won&#x27;t be disappointed!</li>
            <li> Makes me teeth clean, and me gums pampered</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe how much cleaner and whiter my teeth have gotten after months of using this thing! LOVE IT!</li>
            <li> Keeps my teeth clean. Easy to use, easy to maintain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some people might dislike the sounds while brushing teeth - I don&#x27;t mind - and prefer Sonicare over Oral B, which I used before.</li>
            <li> Very good!&lt;br /&gt;Description As a manual toothbrush is more than 4 times and wipe well.</li>
            <li> After I use it my teeth feel clean.&lt;br /&gt;The noise of the toothbrush motor is a little annoying but It is not a big problem if you compare it with the benefits.</li>
            <li> The battery lasts long time. I like this product.</li>
            <li> recommended by my hygenist.</li>
            <li> too noisy and not sure if this is the best one in market but for $30 bucks I cant complain.</li>
            <li> Overall good, but a little bit noisy.</li>
            <li> Very nice. Easy to clean. Battery lasts for about 2 weeks. The travel case is perfect to take it anywhere. The brush threads are high quality and clean your teeth beautifully!</li>
            <li> Love it! Really leaves my teeth perfectly clean! :) Feels better than a manual toothbrush. I still kind of use both (manual brush better to mousse the toothpaste)</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t talk right now. I&#x27;m brushing my teeth.</li>
            <li> It is too noise，high to 75db or more</li>
            <li> i just brought this, used it yesterday. ITS A RELIGIOUS EXPERIENCE FOR YOUR MOUTH!!!</li>
            <li> feel a little bit noisy, other wise good</li>
            <li> Easy to use, just a lot of noise.</li>
            <li> Thank you&lt;br /&gt;Product looks good.</li>
            <li> Works well and gets the fur off close to the gum line better than my old non hypersonic brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d chew some spinach and include a before and after photo but i don&#x27;t want to gross anyone out.</li>
            <li> Within 10 days of receiving the &amp;#34;Philips Sonicare HX6212/05 2 Series Plaque Control Rechargeable Toothbrush&amp;#34; the brush fell off the handle and will not stay on. This means that I can put on toothpaste, insert the Sonicare into my mouth toward my back teeth, and the brush stays there as I pull the handle to brush the other teeth.  The unit came with two brushes so I tried the other one and that brush will stay on the handle. Looking at them it is clearly a design flaw. An extremely small piece of plastic is supposed to hold the brush to the handle, but it is too small so it break away from the usage/vibration of the unit.  The brushes are too expensive to change them every 7-10 days.</li>
            <li> Considering the price, i think this is not bad. With two replace brush and a travel bag, that&#x27;s very cool. But I still don&#x27;t know about which type of brush can be replace. This too many series from Philips such as HX62xx/HX65xx/HX60xx something like that.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my son. It does not work like the Philips hx6730 that  I&#x27;ve owned a  for years. The body vibrates instead of the brush.</li>
            <li> I bought this Toothbrush in April this year. It stopped charging now. Also it makes weird noises at night. Anyway I can return it or exchange it?</li>
            <li> Before purchasing, people have said this feels the same as the more expensive models--and this was the big driver behind my purchase (and price). My father has a higher end model (Sonicare HX9170/10 Flexcare UV Sanitizer ) and while I was visiting this past weekend, I just took the head of the toothbrush with me. When I used the HX9170, I immediately noticed a difference. It is significantly stronger and feels much more effective. In comparison, the HX6212 feels like a TOY.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Honestly, I would avoid this product. I would definitely not purchase this model again. Pony up and buy the higher end model from Costco or something. This one is just not worth it.</li>
            <li> I think that Sonicare&#x27;s quality control has gone way downhill.  I used to own a basic Oral B electric toothbrush that I really liked (Oral B 2000).  I&#x27;d heard about Sonicares for quite a while and decided to try one.  Admittedly, I think I got a closeout model off of Amazon because I only paid about forty dollars for it.  However, I&#x27;m not sure that this model is even worth that much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do not really &amp;#34;feel&amp;#34; like this Sonicare is brushing my teeth any better than my Oral B did.  That is a subjective measurement, though, so it might be totally off.  I can report back after my next dental cleaning to see if they notice any improvement.  However, there is a significant difference: the noise.  Like other reviewers have said, this thing is LOUD.  I wanted to get a quantifiable measure of how loud, so I downloaded a free decibel meter to my phone.  I calibrated it and held the Sonicare ~6 inches away from my phone.  It registered with a peak of 80 dB and and average of 73 dB.  That sound level is somewhere between a phone ringtone and an alarm clock!  If your bathroom is close to your bed, don&#x27;t expect your partner to sleep through you brushing!  Like Jessica A said, I think this a result of the brush head not seating properly to the brush.  This gap also means that you have to make sure to clean it regularly to prevent gunk from seeping into the mechanical part of the brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This Sonicare does have a 2 minute timer, but it doesn&#x27;t have quadrant pacing (something my old Oral B had that changed the vibration every 30 seconds so you know roughly what quarter of your mouth you should be on).  It&#x27;s a small thing, but I do miss it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I am not impressed with this toothbrush.  It does seem to brush decently, but I was expecting more from all of the Sonicare hype that I had heard.</li>
            <li> Happy wife Happy Life... she loves it thus mission accomplished ;)&lt;br /&gt;get it and get&#x27; r DONE</li>
            <li> We all know Sonicare is about the best way to brush our teeth but the cost can be scary.  I finally broke down and bought this and love it.  I hate leaving my toothbrush out to charge, I put it inside my bathroom wall mirror for maybe 2 weeks at a time before it needs charged.  I really am not sure how long it stays in there but I am sure I charge it no more than every 2 weeks.</li>
            <li> I had a very old, basic Sonicare electric toothbrush that finally died, so I bought this to replace it.  I was VERY disappointed to discover that this model does not alert you at 30 second intervals.  If they could include this feature in the very old, basic model, why did they remove it?  Overall, the new brush does not seem as sturdy or as well made as my old one.</li>
            <li> the same as it describes</li>
            <li> Great toothbrush, but be aware that the brush head is much smaller than other sonicare toothbrushes.</li>
            <li> jugpou9giurtgjfoiyrjjp0vfuy9ujhbutj[gi98u5jyu8tjiekhjgjgjjrfjfm,huhifvlfvuijibuygsijghujgyuguuhfgugfhhgfuhguhgfhgfhuhuuyhfguhgthuguhgvuhgbjjgjgjfgjfgjjrgjfjgfjgfufgjhjgfjfuf  jjkfjkfij yfjkjf</li>
            <li> This toothbrush is fine, but I was very surprised that it doesn&#x27;t alert you every 30 seconds to switch quadrants as the other models do. It does time 2 min for you at least. This is a very basic model.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve wanted a Sonicare toothbrush for a while so when I had the chance I ordered this one. It&#x27;s basic but has the 2-minute timer which is what I really wanted. My teeth feel amazing and my whole mouth feels totally clean.</li>
            <li> Best brush. no reason to spend money on the more expensive models. better than the best oral B. I had oral-b&#x27;s for 6 years and this puts it to shame.</li>
            <li> i use it smoothly，like it</li>
            <li> Got this as a gift and it is a updated replace for the one she had.  She likes it better than her old one.</li>
            <li> Not powerful for plaque removal.</li>
            <li> Ordered this Philips Sonicare HX6212/05, but received a HX6210 model that has a loose and loud vibrating mechanism.  Very weak compared to my other Sonicare.  Initially I thought this was due to the two week break in period, but this toothbrush never picked up strength and remains loud/rattle-y.</li>
            <li> The brush itself is good and I&#x27;ve been using Sonicare for years now, but it&#x27;s a bit lightweight/cheap feeling compared to the higher end models which you can get at Costco with an additional base for slightly more money.</li>
            <li> Best toothbrush I&#x27;ve ever used. This toothbrush feels great and has made a huge difference in my dental hygiene.</li>
            <li> I really like this brush! My plaque has decreased substantially since I started using it. I haven&#x27;t used the case yet, but glad to have it for my next travel. I also like that it charges &amp; I don&#x27;t have to use batteries.</li>
            <li> basic function, it is enough, very good experience in using</li>
            <li> I got this cheaper version as a second unit just to keep in another living space.  It works great, as good as the top of the line unit I have at home, but it does not have the timer built into it.  After years of using the higher end version, thought, I can know when the 30 seconds are up to move to the new section of my mouth...This is really good value.</li>
            <li> I bought this as a gift as I already have the same toothbrush. Toothbrush works well and does an excellent job in keeping teeth clean.</li>
            <li> We have several Sonicares.  This one sounds like an airplane.  It is so loud you can&#x27;t use it.</li>
            <li> My teeth felt like I had just gone in for cleaning after first use.  Two minutes is longer than you think.</li>
            <li> Noise ruins a great brush. As other reviewers note, it doesn&#x27;t seem to be an issue with the body of the toothbrush but the brush heads themselves. I can&#x27;t tell if it&#x27;s just a bad design of the brushes or if they intend it to do this but I&#x27;d much prefer the quieter hum I was used to with my first gen sonicare brush... After filing down the inner metal ring of the brush head it certainly helped minimize the VERY LOUD sympathetic vibrations but did not fix the issue. If this was not the case I would give this item a 5 star but the sound right now is ridiculous. There&#x27;s no way this should have made it out of QA but going by other reviews this is the typical result... I loved my first sonicare but I will avoid them in the future because of this.</li>
            <li> I bought this thinking it would be a nice change or upgrade versus my older model Sonicare. This one is built cheaper than my older model. Takes much longer to recharge and it a bit noisier and more vibrations to my hand. The good is that the heads are smaller and costs slightly less to replace and easier to clean up and not have to deal with the gunk that gets stuck in the older model. The model is smaller and weaker but it does the job. I like the travel case that comes with this so I can brush my teeth when I travel. Makes it easy to pack and keeps the heads clean and hygienic.</li>
            <li> Loud. Loud. Loud.  Compared to other Sonicare versions at least.  No big deal though, works well.</li>
            <li> Great Deal for a great toothbrush.. Got this for my teen daughter for Christmas. She has done several trips and loves it. Also, loves the carrying case so that she can keep it in her room.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s a practical product, basiclally compliance to my request.</li>
            <li> does not seen to be heavy duty,but is working ok</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really enjoying using this toothbrush so far. My teeth feel really clean, and the 2 minute timer is really helpful. My only criticism is that it vibrates so hard that it&#x27;s a little uncomfortable. I have to put my finger up against the back of the brush attachment part to get it to a manageable level.</li>
            <li> fast shipping . works fine. giving it to my son, i dont like the vibration.</li>
            <li> Love Sonicare toothbrushes!  My dentist says she can always tell the patients who use one.  Clean teeth!</li>
            <li> Ithink when I get use to it I will like it</li>
            <li> I brush my chomps twice a day with the following procedure: floss, generic listerine, Sonicare, in that order. Embarrassingly, after 6 years of not going to the dentist, I went. Yes I&#x27;m one of those people, don&#x27;t judge. The dental hygienist was cleaning my teeth and said there was hardly even a drop of tartar buildup. She couldn&#x27;t believe I hadn&#x27;t had my teeth cleaned in 6 years. She simply had nothing to scrape off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So go get a Sonicare and try using some Listerine before brushing. It feels, and apparently is, straight from the dentist clean. I guess I&#x27;ll try a decade next time.</li>
            <li> After my dentist visit today I decided I needed to write a review. I owe it to this toothbrush. One year ago at my 6 month cleaning appointment I got some pretty sad news. While I thought I had been taking good care of my teeth, my hygienist told me otherwise. I was completely thrown outa whack by her discovery of heavy plaque build up and an extreme case of gingivitis. I had been brushing twice a day with my manual toothbrush, and so I decided I would step my brushing game up. I got some new mouthwash and was a more diligent brusher for the next six months until my next cleaning. I waited anxiously for the good news that my teeth had improved. But no!! I still had a heavy build up! I take my oral health pretty seriously and finally asked my hygienist what I could do since I thought I was doing much better. She suggested a good electric toothbrush. So, after doing some research I settled on this model, not wanting to spend a fortune.  I am so glad I did! At today&#x27;s cleaning I was told I had a significant improvement! Very light buildup and virtually no inflammation. She actually said she was impressed! Hooray for this brush. Easy to use and did exactly what a wanted. I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll ever go back to a manual brush!</li>
            <li> It ensures that I clean my teeth for 2 min everytime. My teeth become whiter indeed.</li>
            <li> it is powerful to brush my teeth,i had bought a expensive toothpaste for it。</li>
            <li> Best change I&#x27;ve ever made!</li>
            <li> Awesome product! Would recommend it to anyone!</li>
            <li> It does very good cleaning</li>
            <li> I met a new world with it.&lt;br /&gt;I feel dentist&#x27;s cleaning every use.&lt;br /&gt;And, I don&#x27;t see any bleeding after brushing.&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommending it.</li>
            <li> Awesome product! Would recommend it to anyone!</li>
            <li> A great toothbrush.  Older versions seemed to be more vigorous but this serves the purpose</li>
            <li> I was so excited to buy this product because it was such a good deal on Amazon and Sonicare is the holy grail of electronic toothbrushes. Unfortunately, 2 months after using it, it stopped working. When I turn it on, it no longer vibrates, but instead emits this high pitched ringing noise. I&#x27;ve tried to check the Sonicare website to ask for a replacement since it is still under warranty, but the product number does not register when I type it in. I&#x27;m highly disappointed.</li>
            <li> Love how great it works!! My theth feel great!</li>
            <li> Highly recommend.  Works well!  Floss then brush with this toothbrush regularly and your teeth and gums will thank you with less need to visit your dentist besides biannual cleanings.</li>
            <li> Works very well.  Keeps teeth clean.</li>
            <li> The brush is very loud, but for the price i think its worth it at least it does the job of cleaning your teeth well.</li>
            <li> Have had this for over a year and couldn&#x27;t be any happier with this purchase. Extremely happy with this and the price. If your looking for an electronic toothbrush really consider purchasing.</li>
            <li> I bought this when it came out with they carrying case and extra head for only an extra $15.  The reason I bought this model was b/c it gives me the function without all the frills over the more expensive brand.  I didn&#x27;t care about lights, cool looking charging station, etc.  This one does not have the 4x30 sec timer, but honestly, I didn&#x27;t want that as I pull the toothbrush out way before that just to spit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The heads can be replaced with the more expensive ones if you want&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As far as the leaving the dentist feeling, I&#x27;ll call b/s on that one.  Yeah, it does a better job, and the first couple brushes did make a big difference, but not the kind like leaving the dentist.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That being said, I love it and would recommend it.  Best bang for your buck.  I&#x27;m sure I could find 4-ply TP for my ass but my 2-ply seems to do a great job as well :)</li>
            <li> Exactly what I was expecting. Super happy</li>
            <li> Works great. Dental hygienist pleased with results.</li>
            <li> I was very pleased with this toothbrush. It makes my teeth feel so clean. I kinda feel like I was never really brushing before with a manual toothbrush</li>
            <li> Good buy if you don&#x27;t want to brush your own teeth.</li>
            <li> I like Philips electric toothbrush, so I am very easy to protect my teeth every day.</li>
            <li> This seems to work really well.  Amazing power compared to my cheaper, rotating-style electric tooth brush!</li>
            <li> Received order and the case won&#x27;t stay closed!  Contacted Amazon and was unable to get the call center representative to clearly understand my complaint.  Contacted Sonicare and was told to take it up with Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  Totally frustrating</li>
            <li> This is the second one that I have. They both work great, but this one is really noisy for some reason. Taking the head off solves the noise problem, so I guess it has something to do with that. Otherwise, it has converted me from using a manual toothbrush. The travel storage case is handy.</li>
            <li> My daughter loves this toothbrush...she upgraded from the battery powered one and so very happy she did.  It holds a charge very well.  It came post haste packaged very well like always from Amazon.  Thank you.</li>
            <li> Excellent daily and travel toothbrush. It can hold a charger for over a week, depending on use. And most importantly, it does an excellent job cleaning my teeth. My teeth have never felt cleaner after use.</li>
            <li> The price is a little expensive, can be a little cheaper. Things are very good, need to buy the next time.</li>
            <li> everyday basic use and travel.  nothing fancy but it does the job.  highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had others I like better.</li>
            <li> have not used it, but it looks good!</li>
            <li> Good one to start. Nice and fast and doesn&#x27;t hurt my gum</li>
            <li> Love this Sonicare.  Works great</li>
            <li> I love this toothbrush.  It replaced an older Sonicare that just stopped working after 4 or 5 years.  Quieter and I really like the travel case.  I only charge it once every 7-10 days.  I don&#x27;t need to worry about the charger for week-long trips.  Brush head is different - but works OK.  Old style heads I have still work on this unit.  Was originally recommended by my Dentist</li>
            <li> Husband loves having a new one once again. He does not have to charge it as often and it works great.</li>
            <li> This was the third sonicare toothbrush I owned. This one was the most disappointing. It does not include a  30 second prompt  for changing positions like the others did.  That was acceptable but disappointing. Now after barely 4 months, it has stopped working. Since it is in the warranty period, I will contact the manufacturer for replacement. Hopefully this will go well.  I would choose a different model  next time.</li>
            <li> Love this! Easy to carry, battery life is amazingly long, and I keep finding coupons for the replacement heads. :o)</li>
            <li> Two weeks with the toothbrush head and a toothbrush the junction between the host began to loose.And full of electricity needed 20 hours at a time, I don&#x27;t know if there is something wrong.</li>
            <li> I have a 6730 using now. And comparing to it, this 6212 sounds so noisy when work. But I think it&#x27;s still worthy since the special package contains one more brush head and a carrying case.</li>
            <li> I have been using Sonicare for about fifteen years, and I love them. I feel I have avoided significant expense on tooth and gum work thanks to these brushes. I go to the dentist for an annual checkup, and am told, \\&quot;No plaque, no tartar, keep doing what you&#x27;re doing.\\&quot; The new design of brush head is a considerable improvement on the original models, and they hold a charge extremely well.  Don&#x27;t be put off by the expense of these brushes, it&#x27;s a good deal in comparison with dental work.</li>
            <li> While the brush is ok itself, the battery is weak though. I need to recharge the brush minimum twice a week.</li>
            <li> The effect is very good,love it</li>
            <li> It is gentle and soft, and the price is very good.</li>
            <li> better than my panasonic</li>
            <li> as described and on time  thank you</li>
            <li> Item is fine.  Price was no different than in the store.</li>
            <li> Why there is a gap between the host and the brush head? It sounds noisy with the gap.Quick mail to China. It&#x27;s the first time for me to use an ultrasonic toothbrush.</li>
            <li> Great product this is the first electric tooth brush. I have ever owned and it gives you that fresh from the dentist clean. Thank You, Sonicare for a Great Product.</li>
            <li> High speed, good experience.</li>
            <li> This toothbrush is easy to use and sleek when not in use and on the counter.  It charges quickly as well.  Sometimes I feel like it&#x27;s not brushing hard enough, but it&#x27;s the right way to brush teeth, not as abrasive as I was doing on my own with a manual brush.  It&#x27;s lightweight and shuts off after 2 minutes, so you know exactly when you&#x27;ve brushed enough. Philips Sonicare is the way to go with an electric toothbrush.</li>
            <li> Philips sonicare series are always satisfactory except the price of toothbrush.</li>
            <li> At the beginning it was all right. And then just after 4 month it can not turn on any longer. I go to philips website in order to change another charge but this model is not include.</li>
            <li> good,however,why it writes X6210 in my toothbrush?</li>
            <li> Prior to using this toothbrush I had used the spin brush pro. This brush works so much better and I could not be more happy with the purchase.</li>
            <li> I have the basic E series Sonicare toothbrush as well but got this one as a spare. I was rather disappointed by the performance of the brush. It doesn&#x27;t provide as vigorous of a clean as the older, basic model it is trying to replace.</li>
            <li> Fine toothbrush. My son likes it</li>
            <li> Perfect! Nothing fancy, just a good old Sonicare brush that will last me another 4 years as the first one did.</li>
            <li> Worked quite well but changing batteries will be a challenge.</li>
            <li> I am pleased with this product. It does take some getting use to (tickles) if you previously used the older style of brush heads. One  design flaw is the ON switch on the handle. My hand moves around on the handle and turns the product off  frequently while in use.</li>
            <li> I  like it. Easy to use, and I feel comfortable after use it in the morning.</li>
            <li> Commodity packaging is very good, no damage. Toothbrush trial, noise is a little big, but is multi-purpose twice to adapt, have a portable box is also easy to travel!</li>
            <li> A very nice practical items&lt;br /&gt;Too good to even carry&lt;br /&gt;Well I will use&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m glad a good deal doeseo</li>
            <li> good .the best brush i have ever used</li>
            <li> I love this toothbrush.</li>
            <li> Better than my oral b for sure. I used Oral B electric for years and this is a lot better.</li>
            <li> Who doesn&#x27;t love sonicare? We definitely do! It was a great deal and works just as expected! We bought two and also have the kids one. This is our favorite brand to use as the quality is top notch and gets the job done.</li>
            <li> Just received today, a little noise, clean effect is very good</li>
            <li> perfect choice ,i love it</li>
            <li> I am a China users, this is my first time in USA Amazon bought straight mail mail to China goods. Delivery speed slow no surprises, order in January 5, 2015, January 19th to get the goods.&lt;br /&gt;To say that this toothbrush, use it for the first time, I was scared, toothbrush voice can use the basic &amp;#34;too large&amp;#34; to describe, but after brushing teeth, teeth were very clean, is much better than manual brushing effect.&lt;br /&gt;Finally, the toothbrush in the price is not expensive, the effect also can also, and the 2 brush heads, it is worth buying.</li>
            <li> cant beat this at the price, great product</li>
            <li> Like my new toothbrush- slight improvements from the previous Philips Sonicare I used to use.</li>
            <li> Great toothbrush. Philips Sonicare are the best electric toothbrushes there are.</li>
            <li> i think it is useful for protecting my teeth.</li>
            <li> Love this toothbrush!  My teeth have never felt so clean!  Will never go without one again!</li>
            <li> This was recommended by our son who purchased one. It makes your teeth feel as clean as if you left the dentist office. It&#x27;s easy to care for and whitens your teeth better than the strips.</li>
            <li> Best tooth brush I have ever used</li>
            <li> Great price that met the needs.</li>
            <li> Not good. The price is unstable. I lost 10 dollar. This toothbrush hurts my mouth.</li>
            <li> What can I say? Great product at a great price. This replaced one that was 6 years old, still working, but looking a little ragged.</li>
            <li> This products is really nice~~~ the ideal fundamental or basic model.&lt;br /&gt;The brush is soft and durable. The extra brush is in good quality as well.&lt;br /&gt;I like the mini container, cute and practical.</li>
            <li> Thank you .&lt;br /&gt;sonicare after purchasing my teeth are gone too clean.</li>
            <li> tooth brush is good, but bristles are a bit expensive.</li>
            <li> Great value for money. Easy to use and store. Like the travel kit it comes along. Have been using it since the past few months and I would definitely recommend it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It not only cleans the teeth well, but also helps in cleaning the gums.</li>
            <li> Noisy.But,How can I return it in China?Very bad purchase.</li>
            <li> The Braun was much more efficient for me.  Haven&#x27;t learned how to use this brush nearly as efficiently.  Praying that it doesn&#x27;t lead to more cavities!</li>
            <li> Too much noise it makes, did others is the same as me?&lt;br /&gt;I suggest somebody would like to buy it, you would purchase HX69XX is better more.</li>
            <li> good product. well packaged</li>
            <li> Very pleased with this.  It seems to do a much better job than a battery brush.  I&#x27;ll know for sure next month when I go to the dentist, which they do recommend this brand.</li>
            <li> I like it. The handle is comfortable.</li>
            <li> A+ It has worked great so far, my teeth love it.</li>
            <li> Upgraded from a battery powered electric toothbrush (oral b, colgate, etc).  This brush is great and feels like it&#x27;s cleaning at least twice as well as the previous brushes used. I&#x27;d highly recommend this.</li>
            <li> Got it with a very reasonable price, and the international shipment is fast and convenient</li>
            <li> Good price, good quality, and fast service!</li>
            <li> works well, will never go back to manual brush</li>
            <li> Great buy! Price and quality is totally worth it, my teeth feel so clean.</li>
            <li> My friend asked me to bought this .he was happy when he got this package</li>
            <li> I was skeptical. I resisted for a year, then finally caved in bought a Sonicare toothbrush as a new year&#x27;s resolution (to take better care of my teeth).&lt;br /&gt;I turned it on and looked at it, &amp;#34;So what? its just vibrating. Doesn&#x27;t look like it&#x27;ll do much. Hows that gun help my teeth?&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Boy, was I wrong.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;-My teeth feel like I just came out of a dentist&#x27;s office.&lt;br /&gt;-I can already see a change in color and stain removal (and I&#x27;m still using the same toothpaste and mouthwash)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Con:&lt;br /&gt;- Its so much louder than I expected it to be! BUZZZZZZZZZZZZZZ!&lt;br /&gt; As a night owl I almost feel guilty for brushing my teeth at 1 am, worrying if I&#x27;m waking up the house.&lt;br /&gt;- I have a sensitive mouth, and while the toothbrush itself has been great, I will consider getting &amp;#34;sensitive brush heads in the future&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall this is great for your teeth,&lt;br /&gt;maybe not for the light sleepers around me,&lt;br /&gt;but I made a resolution to care for my teeth so folks can just wait until next year to get on that list. JK.</li>
            <li> For years, I have literally had a new cavity at every dentist&#x27;s check up. I&#x27;ve used a sonicare for 1.5 years now and no cavities yet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bought this model for my wife... Much improved over the previous model, which accumulated gunk inside the handle.</li>
            <li> My first automatic Toothbrush. Good experience.</li>
            <li> Well worth the price! Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> It works, but triple noisy than my hx6942.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s perfect except the noise.</li>
            <li> This does not work much better than a manual toothbrush</li>
            <li> great toothbrush at a great price.</li>
            <li> This tooth brush has literally changed my life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s sad, but I used to be a grown ass adult with very poor dental hygiene. I just could never get myself to spend more than 30 seconds brushing, more than once a day. This lead to all sorts of cavities, gingivitis, and dental costs I could not afford.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Switching to electric was the change I needed to bring some excitement to my brushing routine. That sounds ridiculous, I know. Anyways, my mouth feels so god damn clean. Brushing has become something I enjoy, 2-3 times a day. My teeth and gums are visibly healthier. I&#x27;m actually excited to see my dentist again, so he can see the difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Best investment I&#x27;ve made in a long time.</li>
            <li> I bought 2 of these, one for me and the other for my girlfriend.  It has made a huge difference on my dental hygiene.  I actually look forward to brushing my teeth and that was not the case before.  I attract a lot of plaque and this has helped reduce that by a lot.  I would definitely recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product about a month ago and it stopped working today. I have used multiple Sonicare products for years and this was my first dud. Very disappointed in the quality.</li>
            <li> I may like it unless the noise disappered.</li>
            <li> This is my 2nd Phillips Sonicare toothbrush. They work great! I had a problem with receding gums &amp;#34;from brushing too hard&amp;#34;, according to my dentist. This toothbrush allows me to get a much better clean without using as much pressure.  Every once in awhile I use my manual toothbrush to give myself a quick brush in the middle of the day, but it&#x27;s no comparison to the way my teeth feel after a Sonicare brushing. It&#x27;s like coming back from the dentist each time I use it. Give it a try. You&#x27;re teeth AND gums will thank you!</li>
            <li> My first electronic toothbrush and it works great! Makes brushing teeth a lot easier/faster.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really understand what&#x27;s going on with this product.  I was super excited to purchase my first electric toothbrush.  A friend told me not to spring for a more expensive model because all Philips Sonicare toothbrushes are a good bet so I went for this one and also purchased a pack of replacement brush heads for a really good deal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Upon receiving the toothbrush and placing a brush head on it, I realized that (unlike in the photos) the brush head does NOT fit completely on to the toothbrush.  There is a sizable gap between the brush head and battery -- no matter how hard you push, it does not fit flush. [See photo]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Second issue, probably related, this toothbrush is extremely loud.  I would not want to use it in a master bath if my partner were sleeping feet away from me.  Perhaps a good thing that it&#x27;s powerful, but it shakes violently and I would assume that the brush head being loose only contributes to this problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also do not like that the charger is so flimsy.  The toothbrush just sits atop the charger as opposed to sliding into a base.  I have cats and so it makes me a little nervous.  It takes around two full days to get a full charge out of the box.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As far as the functionality of the toothbrush is concerned...It&#x27;s not bad.  I do feel like my teeth are being cleaned more thoroughly.  The thing is powerful.  If I had sensitive gums or teeth, I probably wouldn&#x27;t be able to handle it.  You should also note that the default toothbrush heads are small, much smaller than an average toothbrush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will probably keep it because it seems to do the trick for now and I don&#x27;t want to be bothered with the return, but I would advise anyone in the market to spend the extra and get a better quality toothbrush, something with a sturdier charging port and much quieter.  I wouldn&#x27;t give this as a gift. I&#x27;m beginning to think it&#x27;s much cheaper than it sells for.</li>
            <li> After several months, I&#x27;m absolutely in love with my Sonicare toothbrush. I have extremely sensitive gums that bleed, every time I brush them. My teeth also tend to yellow, and be very resistant to whitening products. After using the Sonicare for only a week, my gums stopped bleeding (and haven&#x27;t bled since), and my teeth are the whitest they&#x27;ve ever been. The clean makes my teeth feel like I&#x27;m fresh from the dentist. The design is simple, and comes with a convenient carrying case, for travel. It&#x27;s easy to keep clean, and the charger is small, so it easily fits next to my sink.    Some have complained that it doesn&#x27;t come with a \\&quot;quadrant\\&quot; timer, or other types of timer functions. If you want to spend more money for that, be my guest, but the basic 2 minute timer was perfectly adequate for my needs.   Other reviews complain that it is loud. This is my first Sonicare brush, so I have nothing to compare it to, but it didn&#x27;t seem excessively loud to me. It&#x27;s not whisper quiet, but it&#x27;s not annoying. I&#x27;d compare the volume level to that of my iPhone vibrating.     A word of warning: When I first started using this toothbrush, the vibrating sensation was almost unbearable to my sensitive teeth. It was strange, unpleasant (although not painful) and almost caused me to send it back. I liked the results in my teeth so much, that I decided to give it a week. With each brushing, the unpleasant sensations subsided, and by the end of the week, it barely registered with me. At this point, it feels perfectly normal and comfortable. So if you have sensitive teeth, be prepared for a brief \\&quot;breaking in\\&quot; period, but stick with it, because it&#x27;s very temporary.</li>
            <li> Great toothbrush. If you are looking for a quiet toothbrush, I would suggest looking at a different product. The toothbrush is a bit loud. However, it does a great job on what it&#x27;s supposed to do. The rechargeable feature is nice.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my wife whose old Sonicare quit working.  She complains that it&#x27;s slow and under-powered.</li>
            <li> A little noisy but works better than the quiet model I had of the same brand. Efficiently cleans my teeth!!! Helps keep gum problems at bay. Love it!!!</li>
            <li> Recommended by my dentist-I have serious reservations using it and now seldom do.  The brush oscillates laterally instead of rotating and it appears quite easy to break a tooth.</li>
            <li> I love my Sonicare toothbrush and can&#x27;t imagine going back to anything else.  I&#x27;ve had the Flexcare for years and it just quit on me for whatever reason, so to replace it I bought this much cheaper Sonicare toothbrush.  The Flexcare was great but I never used the other modes like gum care or refresh, I only ever used the clean mode.  And I think I used the UV cleaner maybe twice in the last five years.  So those feature weren&#x27;t really doing anything for me and I couldn&#x27;t justify the cost of that model versus this one.  With this one I have only one mode, which is all I need, and the charging base takes up less counter space.  Also, the travel case is a bit nicer than the one I got with the Flexcare, but that could be a generational difference rather than a model difference.  It is weird getting used to the fact that this model does NOT give you the little indicator pause every 30 seconds to alert you when you&#x27;re supposed to move quadrants, but I never really followed that anyway and it won&#x27;t bother me in the long run (just weird the first couple of times to get the rhythm right without them).  Also, the handle is thicker and the weight is lighter than the Flexcare, and I don&#x27;t feel that this one has quite as much power or something, but that could be due to the different brush head or the model, not sure which, but I doubt it really affects the quality of the clean and I&#x27;ll get used to it in time.</li>
            <li> My previous electric toothbrush cost me over a hundred dollars. This one seems to work just as well, just without all the bells and whistles. I&#x27;m glad to have it!</li>
            <li> After a few months, they cease to work. You push the button and although the charge appears at fully charged --- nothing!  I love how it works, and the lovely, clean feeling produced.  But not the reliability!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m late to the bandwagon with electric toothbrushes but caught up quick with this one. Superior performance all the way around... One caveat yet addressed is the replacement heads but what I&#x27;ve seen so far on the pricing may make me try non-Phillips brands...</li>
            <li> Love it although somethings i don&#x27;t like the whole production behind using it. However, this the cleanness I&#x27;ve seen my teeth when using this opposed to a traditional toothbrush.</li>
            <li> BEST DEAL! This was a better price than any deal I saw on Groupon! It also comes with an EXTRA brush head and also a carrrying case! Such a great price, I checked the prices of the BRUSH HEADS before ordering and checking all over sites online. NOTHING BEATS this price. It is an ORIGINAL Phillips Sonicare and works GREAT! My teeth literally feel so clean even the next day! Never had that with a regular toothbrush. My teeth almost feel like I just left the Dentist office and are so sparkly and squeeky clean. NOTHING gets my teeth so clean! Your teeth will feel clean for the whole day, night and even the next morning! It is HIGHLY effective and is the BEST price for the money PLUS the Free head and case makes it a double deal! HIGHLY RECOMMEND. Residue and bubbles are the easiest to clean and they do NOT go near the motor. Where the Brush attaches to the handle can be rinsed and wiped. AWESOME design and highly effective!</li>
            <li> Help my friend buy this. He likes it very much!</li>
            <li> Feels much better than a manual brush. Stays charged for about 2 weeks on end. I love this brush, not lets make sure I pass my next dentist cleaning!</li>
            <li> used really good.&lt;br /&gt; It is convenient to use.&lt;br /&gt; A good product.&lt;br /&gt; Fast shipping thank me come.</li>
            <li> Best thing for your teeth. Befor my Doc would tell me i need to floss now he just tells me how great my teeth are</li>
            <li> Purchased as a gift for my sister. She has a permanent dental &amp;#34;bridge&amp;#34; and gives this unit a very good after using it for the past 3 months. It reaches between the tight places that a brush alone could not and she is quite happy. There are other name brand similar products costing 2X to 3X more that offer identical performance. Similarly, there are low cost options that just do not compare to this level of quality.</li>
            <li> I bought this brush to try because it was inexpensive, compared to the ones sold at most stores.  I had tried the Sonicare with the larger brush heads and didn&#x27;t like them.  This one does everything that the more expensive units do and accepts any of the brushes (including the Diamond Clean} , but the ones with the large heads.  The brushes are expensive and last about three months.  This does not have the &amp;#34;quad pacer&amp;#34; but simply shuts off after two minutes.  It does start off at a reduced speed so you can get used to it when new. It gradually increases speed over two weeks, you can override this and start it at full speed.</li>
            <li> Great ultrasonic toothbrush, i have been told to get one by the dentist for years and finally found a deal on one. The wife and i use the same base and different heads. Doesnt need to be charged very often, and the heads are not showing much wear after 2 months of use.</li>
            <li> In the first BIG photo there is a &amp;#34;TRAVEL CASE&#x27;. Under &#x27;frequently bought together&#x27; is shows a TRAVEL CASE.  Upon arrival NOOOO  travel case.  However, in the small print it does describe what is in the box, but we found the presentation VERY MISLEADING, and we are very disappointed.</li>
            <li> Quality good, product as expected</li>
            <li> Good machine. Base is tippy</li>
            <li> Upgrading from a manual toothbrush to this has been a true game changer. I never realized what I was missing out on all those years. My teeth feel dentist clean every time I use it. I know I am cleaning areas that I didn&#x27;t use to with a manual toothbrush. Also, another bonus is that you can change out the heads and share it with a significant other. Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> A little too strong in the beginning but works great after adaption</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t have as much power as the more expensive models, but it&#x27;s perfect for what I use it for.  I never used those extra settings anyway.</li>
            <li> Great for the price..</li>
            <li> I did not like the feel, so I gave it to my 13 yr old grand daughter.  She liked it</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s okay for a Sonic Toothbrush, I preferred my Oral B Sonic Complete, I wish I didn&#x27;t throw it away, I should have just changed the battery.  The heads on the Oral B Sonic Complete are more comfortable and cleaned better.</li>
            <li> Weak, barely an entry model.. not LiON kind, weak electronic, magnets, very very budget, not worth it, returned.  Went with FlexPlus model, better feel, meant to last, works great.</li>
            <li> I tried this because I had heard so much about Sonicare.  I know people love these toothbrushes and I will say my teeth felt clean BUT I couldn&#x27;t stand the vibration on my teeth and particularly my lips.  I tried it several days and it didn&#x27;t get better.  Had to send it back.  If you have a sensitive mouth, this might not work for you.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s all right but not that fancy.</li>
            <li> It came in a handy travel case which was a useful addition. It certainly cleans your teeth nicely and leaves everything sparkly. I find it a little finicky to use as when you are maneuvering it around in your mouth the bristle part is sometimes hard to keep facing the teeth and you get a little vibration from the plastic side.  It feels a lot different than my Braun but it cleans the gum line a lot more efficiently. (It emits a rather high pitched sound, guess that is the sonic care part) Liked the storage cover for the bristle end so you can store it in the charger.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When the handle is charging a green light blinks. However, when it is charged the light goes out.  I think the light should stay on when it is plugged in and charged since you can&#x27;t tell if the charger is actually receiving power.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A customer asked me if it works on 50/60Hz and 100/230V. Yes, it automatically switches. However it comes with a Japan/US style equal-sized parallel plug so you might need an adapter for traveling to particular countries.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Most people will find it a useful oral hygiene addition.</li>
            <li> nice and cheap. Thanks Amazon for shipping me fast enough before Christmas. I will continue shopping on Amazon.</li>
            <li> Finally, your dentist will stop complaining full time about your grill. This thing is like if a toothbrush was chicken, this is fried chicken. It&#x27;s glorious.</li>
            <li> really cleans your teeth and helps remove what flossing misses</li>
            <li> Was a very pleasant shopping experience, and the toothbrush is too easy, and it comes with two brushes</li>
            <li> The price the toothbrush head is not high, the use is very good, very satisfied.</li>
            <li> Great toothbrush. Love it.</li>
            <li> This model of toothbrush vibrates nicely - not too strongly, not too weakly.  But the 2 minute timer doesn&#x27;t include the 30-second beep that tells you to switch from one side of your mouth to the other (my boyfriend&#x27;s Philips Sonicare toothbrush of a different model has this feature).  The brush head also seems a little too small.  Wouldn&#x27;t a larger head be more effective because it could cover more surface area?  Still, I am satisfied with my purchase.</li>
            <li> I wish I would have bought one sooner. It will easily pay for itself in saved dental procedures.</li>
            <li> my first electric toothbrush</li>
            <li> Even battery powered made in china disposable ones are better than this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Its really sad because I was looking forward to the ultrasonic feature rather than my regular electric toothbrush thinking it would give me an extra boost in getting rid of plaque formation and keeping my oral health optimal for a long future. But NO this toothbrush only vibrates, the bristles dont even rotate and brush basic foodcrumbs off my teeth. Whatever the sonicare feature is, its of no use since the brush doesnt do a basic cleaning job let alone anything else.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m a biochemical engineer and trust me this is the worst product I have ever bought. The brushhead that came with the product does not even fit well, there is a half inch gap and water and toothpaste gets into the brushhead and on the toothbrush and crusts there if you dont spend an extra ten minutes cleaning it after every use. Its awful product design. I cannot even donate this to anyone its that bad!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been free of cavities and other dental problems and my dental visits are basic cleaning every 2 years because I was using Or*lB electric toothbrushes for 14 years now. The power flosser heads kept my teeth and gums clean and I didnt even need to floss or visit the dentist often. Whenever I did go to the dentist they would say I had a great oral care regimen and didnt even need deep cleaning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well I am truly sorry that this picture has changed because my last oral B toothbrush tanked after 7 years of solid family use and I am now stuck with this one since I cant return it because I took it with me for a one year sabbatical overseas.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not a corporate spokesperson and I didnt get paid to review this or anything else. Do yourself a favor, dont buy this toothbrush. Even the bottom of the line oralB models are more value for the money. Take care of your teeth. This toothbrush certainly wont help you towards that goal.</li>
            <li> it works well.i like it</li>
            <li> In a  word,it was amazing teethbrush,when i got it ,i use it at first,it was quite good.But when i charge for it ,it really shocked me, after about 20hours,i still couldn&#x27;t  charging it to 100%.i plan to ask customer service for these question,but i&#x27;m not good at it.may be next time i will.&lt;br /&gt;  all in all it was good but not excellent,thanks amazon and express&#x27;s hard working in the end.</li>
            <li> Works super well and teeth feels very clean.  Cleaning seems convenient and charging is easy.</li>
            <li> Wonderful product, but make me disappoint that it dont have A stand for the brush. That is not so convinient. The best thing is the charger is 100-240V.</li>
            <li> gift for my girlfriend,her love it!</li>
            <li> This is the most basic and inexpensive Sonicare model I could find!  I&#x27;ve used Sonicare for over a decade and love these toothbrushes.  I will be brief in my review but a couple things to point out.  This toothbrush vibrates at the same speed as the other models.  It&#x27;s basic, one button and one light.  It does have the Easy-Start feature where it gently increases power over the first 14 uses to allow you to get use to the vibration as it can be a bit weird/tickly at first.  The toothbrush head pop right on and off and doesn&#x27;t screw on like other models I&#x27;ve had.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While it has a 2 minute timer, it does not have the quad-spacer to tell you when you move to another &amp;#34;region&amp;#34; of your mouth.  I have a gone that I sing in my head when I&#x27;m brushing that keeps on on track with the 30 seconds.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would highly recommend this version as it doesn&#x27;t have all the bells and whistles that likely wouldn&#x27;t use anyway.  It&#x27;s small and sleek and doesn&#x27;t take up much room!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the past my Sonicare toothbrushes have lasted roughly 3 years so at the price, I have lower expectations for longevity but its easy to replace.</li>
            <li> absolutely better than oral-b.</li>
            <li> This series 2 rechargeable toothbrush by Sonicare works well, however it does not have the &amp;#34;beep&amp;#34; after 30 seconds to let you know to move to the next quadrant. So you have to use a stop watch or make your judgment on when to change the area that you are brushing.</li>
            <li> Works very well.  Expect my next teeth cleaning to be much shorter.</li>
            <li> Have 3 in our house and soon there will be 4-they eliminate gum irritation and plaque</li>
            <li> What a difference this brush has made to my teeth feeling much fresher and cleaner overall.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s too noisy... sometimes feel like shake off my head..</li>
            <li> Vibration is strong enough!</li>
            <li> Pro, came with two brushes&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Con, more action within the handle than the brush, noisy.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d been using an Oral B Pulsonic, and before that the 1000. While I liked them, the battery lives were abysmal. And the Pulsonic only has 1 type of brush head.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I upgraded to this Philips Sonicare. Great so far. The brush head that came with the toothbrush is smaller than the Pulsonic and I feel that it does a better job at cleaning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only things I dislike about it is the lack of a 30-sec quad-pacer and the size. Oh, and it doesn&#x27;t stay on after 2 mins, which is kinda dumb.</li>
            <li> I was really looking forward to upgrading to this from the older Sonicare models that had a large unsealed base on the toothbrush heads that would trap tons of moisture and get real moldy.  However, the new smaller bases can still trap some moisture, although not nearly as bad.  I don&#x27;t know why they don&#x27;t engineer a seal over the connection so water doesn&#x27;t get in.  Anyway, the disappointment comes from how much louder this model is from the old ones.  It&#x27;s pretty significant.  The handle also seems to be less solid, which may be a reason for the extra noise.  Update:  4 months after buying this, the toothbrush started to freak out, turning on periodically like it was possessed, whether it was on the charging stand or not.  It&#x27;s probably a cheap battery problem.  I hope some of the higher end models have better quality components.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I needed!</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe how loud this thing is-- it sounds like I&#x27;m restarting a motor boat every time I turn it on. My roommate who was sitting on the other side of the house thought I was using a hair buzzer. It&#x27;s THAT loud. Ridiculous.</li>
            <li> Although the noise is a little loud,it is a good brush.</li>
            <li> Works well for the price</li>
            <li> Very good, the span of a voltage adapter is very big, does not require switching power supply.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s very good that it&#x27;s very useful and walkful</li>
            <li> it was great price that i got .i want to buy another for my husband but it didnt have discount anymore.</li>
            <li> Have used a Sonicare toothbrush for two years now and would not ever go back to regular brushing.  When I saw this brush offered by Amazon I purchased it for my husband.  Couldn&#x27;t resist for such a good price. The travel case is a must because once you get used to using the Sonicare you will not even want to stay overnight someplace without it!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great, high frequency, I&#x27;m satisfied with it.</li>
            <li> Thanks for a great product.&lt;br /&gt;I hope your business to flourish.</li>
            <li> It is loud when on for the 2 min. and the first time my teeth were very sensitive to it.  I know it will take time to adjust.</li>
            <li> noisy--feels like a dental drill.  sorry i wasted money on this product</li>
            <li> too noise, but the price is relative low. can accept it. If you do not care money, but a advantage one.</li>
            <li> bought it for my husband,it works</li>
            <li> Great product, great price.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you!</li>
            <li> convenient with the pack and i like it !!</li>
            <li> This will work till I get the full size version. I had it before and just needed a quick fix b/c it stopped working. This is kind of handy, it comes with the travel case. and 2 heads.</li>
            <li> I bought this for our downstairs bathroom and it&#x27;s a good product. It is not as sturdy as the more expensive version, and doesn&#x27;t seem to have the same level of vibration as the pricier model. But it&#x27;s just fine, and nice to have a sonicare easily accessible downstairs, for us. But if you want the real deal, spend the extra money and get a better model.</li>
            <li> Nice package. Good quality.</li>
            <li> Great tooth brush. Love it.</li>
            <li> Bought it for my friend,Seams good!</li>
            <li> This toothbrush is phenomenal!!!!! I bought the cheaper version as I was unsure if I would like it but I love it!  After using it I feel like I&#x27;ve just been to a professional dental cleaning. This reaches places I never knew existed!</li>
            <li> Easy to use, but the noise is larger</li>
            <li> good~ but the noise is too loud. thx~</li>
            <li> works better than others</li>
            <li> to me it&#x27;s too noisy.</li>
            <li> Bought each of my son&#x27;s a sonicare for Christmas. They love it !!!</li>
            <li> Good price and good performance.&lt;br /&gt;My wife like it.</li>
            <li> Thank you seller&lt;br /&gt;Good Product</li>
            <li> I love it. Does it job very well!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had a fractured tooth and before I could get my tooth extracted and an implant put in place, my doctor suggested me to get an electric toothbrush so I can effectively brush my teeth, but still avoid the fractured tooth. I was using a regular manual toothbrush before this, and my oral hygiene really declined because I was so scared of my brushing my teeth very well because of that fractured tooth. Having this new sonicare brush rapidly improved my oral hygiene. I had mild gum disease and my gums bled easily. After using the sonicare for less than two weeks (and actively rinsing my mouth after meals and w/ mouthwash) my gum disease improved and is basically gone now. Since then, I have had my that fractured tooth extracted and an implant put in its place. I am able to maintain superior oral hygiene but avoid my extraction and implant tooth site while it is healing. Only downside may be that after I purchased this, I went to Costco and saw that they had the even nicer models for a similar price as this one, but that is my fault.</li>
            <li> Noise is relatively large</li>
            <li> I have used this product for years.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend a Sonicare for anyone... They are great at cleaning teeth and removing plaque.  This model is just what I need... one button and done.  This particular model is the snap-on head, which I prefer over the screw-on head.  It times your brushing for 2 minutes so you know that you&#x27;ve brushed for the recommended amount of time.  I love my Sonicare!</li>
            <li> my teeth are shocked...</li>
            <li> I bought it for my husband, he said it&#x27;s useful, he like it.</li>
            <li> First time owning an electric toothbrush and wow, the Philips Sonicare HX6212/05 is amazing! I love how it gets through all the hard to reach places. It is powerful yet gentle on the gums. I mainly purchased this because I had a hard time brushing my wisdom teeth and brushed too hard which caused gum recession. After using this for a couple of weeks now, I won&#x27;t be going back to a manual toothbrush. Battery life is also good, lasts up to 2 weeks. (I usually charge mine every 10 days since I brush a little longer than 2 minutes) Once your battery is running low, the unit will notify you by vibrating a couple of times, the battery light will also flash. I also suggest removing the brush head after use and drying the bottom part of the brush head and the metal part of the handle so that rust or mold doesn&#x27;t grow. I would definitely recommend this to family and friends.</li>
            <li> I bought this toothbrush as an upgrade to my rechargable e-series that I bought a few years ago.  I am perfectly happy with the basic level sonicare and don&#x27;t needs lot of different settings, so this brush suits me just fine.  There is an easy start function if you are new to electronic tooth brushes (it eases you into these brushes with vibrations that increase each time you use it until you reach full power); obviously I don&#x27;t need this function, but it would be great if you are just getting started with these brushes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like that the head on these does not leave a huge crevice for paste and water to get caught in and grow - which was an issue with the e-series (BTW, if you have an e-series, clean out undre the cap with bleach each time you swap heads, and you won&#x27;t have any funk growing).  It is great to have a brush that won&#x27;t get funky!  The special bonus pack is great since you get a second head and a handy case.  This brush does change on my old base (although it does come with its own base as well).  It is nice to know that I have an extra base if I need it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only things that I don&#x27;t necessarily love about this brush is that the head is a little smaller than the e-series, but there are bigger heads that you can get.  Also, this brush is a little louder than the e-series, but it isn&#x27;t anything that will stop me from using it.</li>
            <li> Good stuff, quickly shipping.</li>
            <li> It is a universal voltage products, completely suitable for China&#x27;s 220 v voltage, is very convenient and brushing your teeth are clean, is really not generally experience, particularly in the us the amazon&#x27;s service is very perfect, also for next time.</li>
            <li> This is NOT just like the other higher-end brushes!! Bought it because it was on sale and I have the $100 Sonicare HealthyWhite already so figured this would be a nice backup since another customer stated they were comparable, just with different heads and this has less features.. NO. This one has a weaker motor that is noticeably weaker and doesn&#x27;t scrub as well! No wonder it&#x27;s cheaper. Really disappointed as I&#x27;m used to the power and force of the HealthyWhite and feel as if this doesn&#x27;t really get into the grooves as well.. threw box away so can&#x27;t return it but wish I could. Going to stick to the higher end one for now and disappointed somebody lied about the comparison between the two brushes.</li>
            <li> still need time to adapt it!</li>
            <li> I really like it。I feel like my teeth are becoming more white。</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m learning how to use it, is not accustomed to!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s been 3 weeks and I&#x27;m still running off the original charge. Self timer is great for brushing long enough. Very comfortable to use. I definitely would recommend this unot!</li>
            <li> Love this brush, and the carry case it comes with is convenient. I had a Sonicare for over 5 years before the internal battery finally died out. Replaced it with another Sonicare because i felt that was a reasonable life span for this kind of produce. It comes with two heads, and I ordered extras for my wife.  The only complaint is that the charging base is kind of lightweight, so it tends to flip over due to twisting forces exerted by the electric cord.</li>
            <li> Nice shopping practice</li>
            <li> very good. much cheaper than in Tianchao</li>
            <li> It is perfect, I like it.</li>
            <li> Never thought this would take the place of my regular toothbrush-but it has.  Just left the dentist feeling clean everytime you brush.  Two minute feature is great.  Now if the replacement heads were cheaper that would be a huge + !</li>
            <li> The simple on-off button is best way to go.  Had another Sonicare with multi-speeds and was cumbersome to turn off and on and to even know which speed you were really on.  The full power is what you are going to want to use anyway.  Brushes and works well.</li>
            <li> Very good and clean.  I love it</li>
            <li> Has a loud sound, but does its job.</li>
            <li> Just like going to the dentist.</li>
            <li> Works great. Same thing as the more expensive version I had before but this doesn&#x27;t have all the modes (which I never used anyway) the only thing I miss is the quadpacer that told me when to switch sections of my mouth. Bought this one because my last one died after 2 1/2 years. Good deal for the price.</li>
            <li> Great product and fast shipping!</li>
            <li> I like this tooth brush and very glad to get the extra brushes.</li>
            <li> They are very good , 5 star rating</li>
            <li> I had never owned an electric toothbrush before this one. I always thought that my manual cleaning was good enough and these things were just a sham to get people&#x27;s money. I was so wrong.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My teeth have never felt cleaner, like just from the dentist clean. This feeling is great and lasts all day. If you have any doubts, let them go. This is a great product at any cost, and especially if you catch it on sale.</li>
            <li> Very poor compared to my previous model.  Seams are irregular, loud handle vibration is matched by reduced power in the mouth, larger and heavier.  This is possibly a defective unit, and will certainly be returned.  Regardless, the carry case is borderline trash and I am unsure it would last a single trip.</li>
            <li> The units works well and is an appropriate size, however, it does not clean as thoroughly as the previous Sonicare toothbrush I had.</li>
            <li> I thought this was a great bargain. However, it is very noisy, unlike the more expensive one. And it doesn&#x27;t indicate whether it is charging.</li>
            <li> I bought this used on *Bay.  It was in perfect shape and appeared to be a return.  As other reviews have mentioned, I found this brush to rattle and sound cheaply made if not actually defective.  I wonder if they all are like this.  I have a Sonicare Healthy White toothbrush and an older model with screw in brushes:  these are solid machines.  I don&#x27;t particularly like Healthy White because of the reminder noise every 30 seconds.  Ahhh!  The older model is a mess to deal with because water gets in the brush and at the base of the handle.  Still, both of these are very serviceable and professional machines, not like the 2 Series Plaque.  I also have a new $15 dollar (ugly green handle) Sonicare battery powered toothbrush.  Lol.  This brush should be used to clean shoes, not put into your mouth.  I despise this brush.  The company should be ashamed to put its name on it.  Vibrates way too much.  This brush is not kin to the others.  It feels like it could knock loose teeth out.  When I find the perfect Sonicare toothbrush I will marry it and live happily ever after.</li>
            <li> Great product at great price.. Would definitely recommend. Your teeth feel cleaner than ever.</li>
            <li> This is a great toothbrush, I purchased it after my dentist recommended it.  I haven&#x27;t had a filling since!</li>
            <li> My GF loves this toothbrush.  It is really good.  The case is great too.</li>
            <li> Good deal; reasonable performance.</li>
            <li> feel like I just gone to dentist</li>
            <li> Delivered in 2 days over Christmas ! I love this. It came with the extra brush head and travel case. Also had a $10 instant manufacturers rebate. Great deal and fantastic toothbrush!</li>
            <li> This is my second Philips Sonicare in eight years.  Cleans better and faster than my previous model, but the charge does not last as long.&lt;br /&gt;Loud , but efficient.</li>
            <li> I cannot get used to it at the begining, but now I cannot stand with my previous toothbrush.</li>
            <li> May be because is the first time I use an electric toothbrush, I feel its vibration amplitude is a bit big, other good, in addition to charging is slow</li>
            <li> too much noise, like I&#x27;m using a electric saw, but effect is ok.</li>
            <li> This is my first electric toothbrush so the first two times I had to get use to it but now I&#x27;m upset I waited so long lol..I love that it lets me know when I&#x27;ve brushed two minutes by shutting off.  It moves quick and yes its a little loud but not terribly so..My teeth definitely feel clean after using it, much cleaner than when I use just a regular toothbrush..I feel good that I&#x27;m taking care of my teeth the best that I can to keep them as healthy as possible.  Its a nice size and I really like the travel case and extra toothbrush head.  You get more for your money with the extras..I recommend this product if you want a quality product at a very reasonable price.</li>
            <li> Very good, I like it.</li>
            <li> The battery lasts less than two weeks as the ads promised.....but pretty powerful and uesful.</li>
            <li> It vibrate slightly, not as good as oral-B.</li>
            <li> good quaility, good price and good gift to my friend</li>
            <li> I love the Sonicare, although the instruction indicate that after 30 seconds it buzzs to let you know to move to another tooth surface and it doesn&#x27;t do this</li>
            <li> Got it for a steal at $39.99. Was previously using a much nicer Oral-B and have no complaints. Will edit this if it fails much earlier than I would expect but for now thoroughly impressed with what I got for the price.</li>
            <li> Talked my husband into it since I have the more advanced model and LOVE it. However, this one is VERY noisy...it took him some time to warm up to it but I regret talking him into it.</li>
            <li> experience is good, except for the big noise, much bigger than expected</li>
            <li> I love it .I works wonderfully . My check ups at the dentist is always perfect now that I use the Philips Sonicare.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  Thank you Virginia L. Drury</li>
            <li> My first electro toothbrush. I think it goes well as expected.</li>
            <li> This device makes your teeth feel like they do after a cleaning by your hygenist.  All in 2 minutes at home.</li>
            <li> Works as advertised. Much lighter than the elite e series. Feels cheaper, but does the job.</li>
            <li> Nice but a little abrasive. I wish you could change the pressure, the vibration is almost to intense</li>
            <li> When using the toothbrush, I feel like my mouth is getting a massage. I don&#x27;t think my teeth have every felt so clean.</li>
            <li> The sonicare is good to use,but the toothbrush head is expensive</li>
            <li> Cheap, practical,Great!</li>
            <li> is okie.. the brush is too small</li>
            <li> They are great while theywork, but horrible lifespan and reliability.&lt;br /&gt;I bought 2 of this and 2 of them die within 6 months.</li>
            <li> Outstanding value! I purchased it as a travel version, but my other Sonicare promptly crashed/gave up the ghost.....it&#x27;s now my go-to-brush until I can get another! I&#x27;ve been a Sonicare user for years.....this represents an OUTSTANDING value.</li>
            <li> I really couldn&#x27;t be happier with this. I was having trouble brushing my teeth enough and this has helped a ton. It slowly ramps up over the first dozen times you use it to get you use to the strong pulsing. I really feel like my teeth are much cleaner after using this and I actually look forward to brushing my teeth. (It&#x27;s like getting a nice buzzing gum massage)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;GREAT value for your money. If you are on the fence, get this.</li>
            <li> full battery could just last 7 times...</li>
            <li> It makes a lot of noise...Not recommend it if you are sensitive to noise.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to use and clean well</li>
            <li> Bought this one for daughter  - I have one, too. I use it twice a day - I&#x27;m pleased with the results, and so is my dentist. Cord management is becoming an issue in the bathroom with 2 toothbrushes, flosser, razor, Kindle, WiFi extender, &amp; hair dryer, We need a universal charger! Replacement heads are overpriced.</li>
            <li> The battery is full use of time is short, can only use about 3 days.</li>
            <li> The sonicare makes my teeth extremely clean. I really like it. But it&#x27;s so noisy when it&#x27;s working. It must be perfect if it can get quieter!</li>
            <li> Simple and convenient</li>
            <li> Is very good, is I have ever used the best goods, thank amazon!</li>
            <li> Just one use and it&#x27;s already awesome! I just dont like how loud it is but it&#x27;s okay as long as it works.</li>
            <li> I had one of the first soicare and used it for 10 years. I was disappointed with this one in that it is not nearly as powerful as my old one.</li>
            <li> good price~&lt;br /&gt;good item~</li>
            <li> it seems that the brush head is not compatiable for the body, and makes big noise that i can not bear. Now I met another problem, the brush head always fall off when I use it.</li>
            <li> Works great. Nice charge base that has no metal contacts to get wet.</li>
            <li> this toothbrush was recommended by my dentist for gum care and it really works, very comfortable and easy to use, battery lasts full two weeks before recharge is necessary but you could always just store your brush on the charger</li>
            <li> The machine already stops working within such a short time. Quite disappointed</li>
            <li> This item was purchased as a gift for my niece. She loves it. So now I must order one for myself!</li>
            <li> My kid really likes it and uses  twice a day. The brush does not seem to be robust and we need to replace the brush head in less than three months.</li>
            <li> Enjoy brushing! Makes my teeth feel really clean!</li>
            <li> This was our fourth Sonicare toothbrush, but it is vastly inferior to the other three.  As other one-star reviewers have mentioned, it vibrates loudly, but it does not clean nearly as effectively as the better ones.  At first I thought, well, maybe this one needs a &amp;#34;break in&amp;#34; period, but, it never changed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A number of the favorable reviewers have suggested that it is nearly identical to the fancier Sonicare units, just without the bells &amp; whistles.  I disagree.  True, it does not have the bells &amp; whistles (a good thing, IMHO), but, it just doesn&#x27;t work well at all, and the vibration is really annoying.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One test you can perform is to place the brush head under a gentle stream of water from a faucet, and observe what happens to the water when the toothbrush is activated.  Our other units, models HX6711 and HX5711, both noticeably disrupt the flow; it&#x27;s actually pretty impressive.  This one doesn&#x27;t do much at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Either of those models would be far superior to this one; it&#x27;s really disappointing that Philips makes and sells this.  Unfortunately, I missed the return deadline due to thinking that it would improve, so I&#x27;m stuck with it ... triple argh.</li>
            <li> Decent item but the brushes don&#x27;t sit flush against the base. There is a small gap there that collects debris. No matter how hard I push down, it won&#x27;t stay sealed. It hasn&#x27;t caused a problem yet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It works well and gives a clean feeling when you are done.</li>
            <li> I purchased this item just after Christmas. It came with a $10 coupon from Philips Sonicare. I checked around different sites like Target but the price was always higher due to mailing costs at the other sites and they didn&#x27;t include the extra head and the travel case. I couldn&#x27;t chose the color and the brush will have to tossed when the battery dies, but it was a great purchase for the price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For years I had been told at my dental checkups to get away from the cheap manual brushes and buy one of these. I used my brother&#x27;s old Braun for a while before I ran out of brush heads. But I had read this product was superior and I decided I didn&#x27;t want to go to the dentist for cleanings every three months. I had been unemployed and dental insurance was not a priority. But after not going to the dentist for two years, my gums were in trouble and I was told I needed cleanings every three months as well as using prescription mouthwash every night.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I just had my first cleaning since November of last year and I was told I don&#x27;t have to come back for six months!! I have been using this brush once a day, just before bed, ever since it arrived in early January. In less than 2 months time, it has helped get rid of plaque and improve my gums and almost completely eliminate any gum bleeding. Even better, it has a much better reach than my manual toothbrush. I have a small mouth and it is very hard to reach the back teeth on both sides.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some of the more expensive models look great but most people don&#x27;t need all the extras. This has a 2 minute timer and the charger flashes when it is charging. I like the plastic cover you can put back on the toothbrush when you return it to the charger. I would have liked the UV cleaning systems but at least the brush head is covered. When the battery goes, I will certainly buy this model again if it is still available.</li>
            <li> The noise is large, the use of good</li>
            <li> It make too much noise after 2 month used.</li>
            <li> My dental hygienist had been telling me to get a Sonicare toothbrush for a while but I kept forgetting soon after I left the dentist, so finally, after a visit, I went directly to my computer and ordered one from Amazon.  I didn&#x27;t know if I&#x27;d like it so I went with a less expensive option, and I absolutely love it.  And when I went back for my cleaning 6 months later, my hygienist was very happy with the results!&lt;br /&gt;The charging station is a little bit flimsy and easy to knock over, but the charge lasts quite a while, so I pull it out to charge it about once a week and then put it away so I don&#x27;t have to look at it on the bathroom counter.  The toothbrush is somewhat loud as other reviewers mentioned, but it doesn&#x27;t bother me (maybe because I&#x27;ve never had another, quieter electronic toothbrush).  I think this toothbrush is absolutely worth the price.  I also liked that it came with an extra head and a travel case.</li>
            <li> I love this product. It is very convenient.</li>
            <li> The sonic feature may be the difference, but it feels more thorough than previous power toothbrushes.</li>
            <li> Bought for 21 yr old son, it is louder than our Oral B ones, but he said it doesn&#x27;t bother him. Head shape is different too, Oral B is round, this one is not. For the money it was a good purchase.</li>
            <li> it is great! The delivery is fast. I bought it for my mom, and she likes it.</li>
            <li> works great, my teeth getting whiter and whiter</li>
            <li> I have a great history with Sonicare. My original Sonicare 1 lasted over 15 years. Pretty remarkable. I recently replaced it with a Sonicare 2 Series. Still a great toothbrush. I think it does a better job than my original one. And it is lighter and more compact. I opted for the one with the carrying case because I like to take my Sonicare on trips. Although, $25 extra for the plastic carrying case and an additional toothbrush head is a little steep. But if this one lasts even half as long, it is still a good value.</li>
            <li> This is a decent entry level toothbrush. My only complaint is that it&#x27;s a little noisier than the previous models I&#x27;ve owned from Sonicare.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure how to feel about this brush as I don&#x27;t feel like it&#x27;s actually cleaning my teeth.. It&#x27;s kinda like a vibrator for your teeth! That&#x27;s all it does, vibrates. Wish I knew that before purchasing it cuz I thought it&#x27;d be a souped up electric toothbrush that actually rotates and scrubs my teeth.. but it doesn&#x27;t!</li>
            <li> Little bit louder than other Sonicare but it&#x27;s not a big issue.</li>
            <li> This is the first electric toothbrush I&#x27;ve ever owned.  It took some getting used to, but my dentist was right, my teeth feel like they were just cleaned at the dentist&#x27;s office every day!  Good price and came with an extra brush and travel case.  Great purchase.</li>
            <li> It vibrates/oscillates so violently that your hand is even shaking while holding it!&lt;br /&gt;The brush is too small and does not clean efficiently.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And because of the extremely strong vibration, you tend to injury your gum if you press down too hard!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Summary: Do not buy this. Spend a little bit more and get a higher end model!</li>
            <li> I would give this 5 stars if it wasn&#x27;t so loud.  I would not have bought it if I&#x27;d known this; however other than that no problems, I really like the included travel case and I&#x27;m confident it will be great for my teeth and gums.</li>
            <li> I bought this product on thanksgiving deal for 39.95, and 2 days later, it becomes 29.95. It&#x27;s cheating!!!!</li>
            <li> I wanted to love this, I really did. Before purchasing this model I had been using a Sonicare Essence toothbrush for around 6 years.  Was very happy with the Essence but wanted to get a new model because the mold that grows inside the brush heads for the Essence was grossing me out. Also liked the look of the 2 series as it appeared to be slimmer.  A breakdown of the 2 series:  Pros: Lightweight, small charger base, nice case, good clean.  Cons: Extremely loud, vibrations CRAZY intense, toothbrush does not stay exactly put on the charger base and swivels around a bit. I was honestly worried about my front teeth coming loose that&#x27;s how much this thing vibrates. Now, I&#x27;m not sure if maybe I got a defective one, as I noticed it wasn&#x27;t holding it&#x27;s charge very long and also didn&#x27;t stay on for the full two minutes. If the connection between the brush heads and the toothbrush was just a little bit more snug, I think that would fix the problem with the outrageously loud and intense action.  Anyway, I kind of was hoping I could save some money and get this model but I may have to upgrade to the Easy Clean if it means  being able to enjoy brushing my teeth instead of dreading it.  UPDATE:  Returned this model and purchased the Easy Clean with sensitive brush heads. SO much happier! The difference is night and day. If you want a no-frills, simple and yet effective Sonicare, I&#x27;d really suggest spending the extra 30 bucks and getting the Easy Clean.</li>
            <li> nice price!&lt;br /&gt;high rate even i have not got it yet ^-^</li>
            <li> vibrates like hell (they are meant too though), only issue I had is the head piece has a bur in the plastic that scratched the inside of my gums...  can easily grind it off or sand it etc but shouldn&#x27;t be there to begin with.</li>
            <li> It is not quite as powerful as my last Sonicare toothbrush.</li>
            <li> The travel case holds two brush heads with brush covers in the travel case. The charger on the other hand does not fit in the case. The good news is that the charge on the toothbrush lasts a long time. If you are going to be traveling for less than a week, you should be able to leave the charger at home. You can get past the ramp-up on this toothbrush by pressing on/off multiple times if you are already using an electric toothbrush and this is just a replacement. This does a nice job of leaving your teeth feeling clean.</li>
            <li> Too loud. I don&#x27;t think I could last 2 minutes of this rattling. All the pieces where in the box. It&#x27;s not worth  $40. I&#x27;m probably going to have to return it. Maybe I got a defective one, like others have posted: there&#x27;s a significant gap between the handle and brush head. It&#x27;s annoying.</li>
            <li> Very happy with the purchase. Bought it to replace the old model healthy white (which quit working after 2 years, it turns itself on for no reason in the middle of the night). Decided to go with a lower model after reading the reviews on this page, and very happy I did so. It has the same cleaning power as the pricier versions and I love to new brush heads that came with this one. I miss the quad pacer a little bit, but it is not a big problem. Overall very happy with the purchase!</li>
            <li> Returning it. It must be defective. The shrill buzzing is so loud I wouldn&#x27;t use it without ear protection.</li>
            <li> Vibration is very big, the noise is very large</li>
            <li> very awesome !! I really love it</li>
            <li> The product is good, but the noise is too big, the other two kinds of mode conversion is very inconvenient</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve owned Phillips Sonicare tooth brushes for over 10 years.  This one us very under powered even when fully charged.. It comes with two brush heads and a travel case worth what I paid - there was a $10 off coupon at the time.  But please don&#x27;t buy this one.</li>
            <li> The noise is relatively large, but sonic toothbrush with very practical, if can reduce the noise will be very perfect.</li>
            <li> Accent slightly, other good</li>
            <li> I love it, very good toothbrush</li>
            <li> 噪音比较大，相比6730,声音大多了。&lt;br /&gt;noise lot more than 6730.</li>
            <li> Great product. This is my first time using a electric toothbrush, and I am glad to make that decision!&lt;br /&gt;For new users, it will get your gums sore, because of the vibrations and whatnot, but it has a easy start, which slowly eases you into the fast bristle movement.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is a simple, basic model, so it does not have the fancy bells and whistles, compared to the more expensive models. But, for me, I just need a toothbrush that can just simply brush my teeth. Great product, 5 out of 5!</li>
            <li> Best purchase I&#x27;ve ever made!</li>
            <li> I m very happy with my purchase. Only complaint that battery takes 2 days to re charge But it lasts much longer when fully charged as Compared to Oral B which my wife uses.&lt;br /&gt;The special travel case is a life saver. In my last trip to Thailand 5 months ago my sonic toothbrush died as there was no travel case but this time it was neat and 100% working thanks to the special case it s worth the price.&lt;br /&gt;Also I like about this toothbrush is if you apply too much pressure the pulse will stop so it reminds you to be gentle on your gums and teeth.&lt;br /&gt;Now I cannot even think of going back to manual brushing.</li>
            <li> I received excatly the date promised.As the basic type of Sonicare,it is ok.But it&#x27;s really too noise even woke my roomates next door!!!&lt;br /&gt;My question is , why the product I received showed HX6210 on the bottem?</li>
            <li> hx6212 basic model . but i feel it is ok. i bought a hx6730 in china for my gf. hx6730 is more quiet and in clean mode it will tip you to change side each 30s</li>
            <li> No need to buy the more expensive versions. This works great! It is a little loud, but its not an issue. I brush twice a day and can go three weeks before needing to charge at all.</li>
            <li> After 4 years my original Phillips Sonicare gave out.  Not bad for one who brushes their teeth several times a day.  It&#x27;s a great product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using a different brand for some years now, the one with the little round head, but thought I&#x27;d give this a shot, the price was right.  The head on the brush is small enough to get around in my mouth and after getting used to the sound, I really do like the way my teeth felt.  I will be seeing my hygienist next month, I&#x27;m curious to see what she says.  I can&#x27;t at this time give it 5 stars, only because I need to spend a little more time with it, plus I want to see if the little space where the head joins the handle is going to be gross with time.  I will update my review.</li>
            <li> Nice for the replacement. Thanks.</li>
            <li> This new model replaced and older Phillips model.  The new model had a different design that sheds water instead of pooling it in the older magnet pocket (which always caused the growth of mold unless the brush head was removed each time and the cavity allowed to dry).  The frequency of the brush movement seems greater than the older model.  This new model also has 30-second and 2-minute alarms as well as a break in program.  CAUTION: I measured a sound level of 80 dB six inches from my iPad running a sound level ap with an ambient (room) level of about 40 dB.</li>
            <li> Very good, very practical, I very love</li>
            <li> Noise is a bit over my expectation as I had a sonicare diamondclean. But over all it is easy to use</li>
            <li> my friend like it ,very good</li>
            <li> it makes too big noise,I can&#x27;t use it if there are others</li>
            <li> it makes so much noisy .</li>
            <li> I purchased this for my Son and he loves it!</li>
            <li> Same as most stated. Had the earlier version which beside head cost..I prefer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is slimmer, more compact heads, cleaner also cheaper..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think the new 1 goes beyond sonic to cheap with the vibration. Nice as a muscle relaxer...</li>
            <li> bought it with coupon and sale price, worth every penny!</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s too noisy somehow,  dont expect too much on it, but since it is a basic model, it does its job well.&lt;br /&gt;guess i will save some money to buy a quieter one later</li>
            <li> i have brought many send to my family,i think it is helpful.</li>
            <li> Feels like I got my teeth polished at the dentist. Haven&#x27;t had any issues with it yet.</li>
            <li> Sorry Philips..&lt;br /&gt;Just comparing the technology: Oral B is rotation and Philips is vibration ...&lt;br /&gt;For me the rotation is away better  (faster, feels more cleaner and more satisfactory)&lt;br /&gt;the job is OK. the price for this piece is great.&lt;br /&gt;2 stars for the technology and charging time.&lt;br /&gt;5 stars for the design (good shape, good handling and very slim).&lt;br /&gt;5 stars for the price.&lt;br /&gt;so 4</li>
            <li> It is cheaper and useful</li>
            <li> minus one star is that it can keep my teeth white. Otherwise, it works good.</li>
            <li> It is very noisy compared to my older model HX6911 Flex Care toothbrush.</li>
            <li> First electric toothbrush I&#x27;ve ever had.  So far it has worked well and I feel like I&#x27;ve just walked out of the dentist office</li>
            <li> I bought this to see how I would like an electric tooth brush. I didn&#x27;t care too much for it and went back to manual.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve wanted one of these for awhile, but have limited counter space.  I was thrilled when I found this model, that charges for two weeks at a time, and comes in a travel case, with two toothbrush heads...which makes it perfect for travel as well.  I am LOVING this product.</li>
            <li> Amazing product. Trust Amazon as usual</li>
            <li> The unit I bought works fine but I was very disapointed to find that it did not have the feature (quadpacer?) that pauses briefly every 30 seconds so you know when to move to the next area of your mouth.  My old Sonicare had that feature and I thought all the models came with that feature.  Why wouldn&#x27;t they?</li>
