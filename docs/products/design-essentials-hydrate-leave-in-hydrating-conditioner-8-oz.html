            <li> I have been using this conditioner for about 3 years and all i have to say that as long as its out in the Market i will keep on purchasing it :)  Really love it !</li>
            <li> Wonderful product! This leave-in hydrating conditioner is just that, Hydrating! It&#x27;s like a big drink of water for thirsty hair! I can&#x27;t, won&#x27;t live without it! Try it! You will love it too! Thanks fab@50</li>
            <li> This leave-in conditioner makes your hair much more manageable for styling and helps to protect it from the heat such as blow-drying and flat-ironing.</li>
            <li> Very good for black hair especially for those transitioning from relaxed to natural. Hydrates the hair really well and really brings out the waves in my natural hair. Very good leave in conditioner</li>
            <li> This is an excellent product. It is thick and not watery or thin and leaves my hair soft.  I would recommend it to my friends.</li>
            <li> this stuff is hands down the best thing that has ever happened to my hair. You can&#x27;t even purchased this anywhere and I&#x27;ve looked and only my hair stylist had this but the price he paid for it was more than I paid for on Amazon. I have you recommend and I will buy tons of this product. It smells freakin amazingly heavenly and delicious but not edible delicious lol</li>
            <li> I didnt like this at all, I don&#x27;t know if it works because I stop using it after 2 days.. It makes your hair white, the cream do not absorb in your hair, it leaves your hair looking white(where you can see the cream just laying on top of your hair) and made hair very nappy(frizzy)looking.. Don&#x27;t like it and wont be using this any more.. I&#x27;m ma because I like DE products. I also didn&#x27;t like the everyday Moisturizing cream it did the same thing.... Wasted my MONEY..</li>
            <li> leaves hair with a sticky feeling</li>
            <li> Only use this product......Design Essentials! Any of these hair items from Design Essential will have your hair looking Fabulous!😍</li>
            <li> I love all Design Essential products.  It is great for the hair and keeps it hydrated and managable.  Will order again.</li>
            <li> See my review of Miss Jessie&#x27;s Curly Buttercreme.  I use the two products together and I love the way my TWA looks (shiny) and feels (soft) afterward.  So now, I&#x27;ve reduced my post-shampoo routine from using four products to needing only two.  And, I&#x27;m glad that it&#x27;s a leave-in conditioner instead of a rinse out.  That assures that my hair is in good condition throughout the day.</li>
