            <li>This is the best price I&#x27;ve ever found it for.</li>
            <li>Best smell.  </li>
            <li>this stuff is wonderful, the best flexible spray i&#x27;ve ever used..&amp; it IS flexible!</li>
            <li>If this was unscented, it would be perfect, but as it is, I tossed it!</li>
            <li>Why change a perfect hairspray!!!!</li>
            <li>Received promptly, in perfect packaging.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the best I&#x27;ve found.  </li>
            <li>My husband bought this on accident and it turned out to be a good thing!  </li>
            <li>, I am happy with dove hair spray , its great</li>
            <li>Lol.  </li>
            <li>It smells just like cinnamon and is easily the best smelling hairspray I have ever encountered.</li>
            <li>Look elsewhere if you need a good hairspray.  </li>
            <li>The price was good</li>
            <li>It serves its purpose for a good price.</li>
            <li>This hairspray works awesome...has great hold without being sticky or crunchy and gives hair a nice shine to it....</li>
            <li>I have used Dove hairspray for years and loved it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a fairly patient person...</li>
            <li>I love this product!</li>
            <li>they came out with the HAIRSPRAY which was AMAZING</li>
            <li>It has kind of a baby powder/flower combination smell...</li>
            <li>it says \\&quot;Flexible Hold\\&quot; which does infer that it has some kind of hold.</li>
            <li>First, the good: this product smells great.</li>
            <li>It has a great fresh scent and does not have that crunchy feeling.</li>
            <li>BUT, it smells SOOO strong!</li>
            <li>Thanks for my product its great</li>
            <li>Why on earth did Dove change this product, the blue version before this was PERFECT.</li>
            <li>Dove needs to either reformulate this hairspray or reconsider the spraying mechanism to make it more user-friendly.</li>
            <li>I love this hairspray.</li>
            <li>I love this product.  </li>
            <li>I love the super-fine mist and the fact that this product works without making my hair crunchy.</li>
            <li>I can still smell this stuff in the bathroom more than an hour after spraying just a teeny bit of it.</li>
            <li>Seller reshipped immediately and second product received and worked perfectly.</li>
            <li>Very happy and will definitely purchase from this seller again.</li>
            <li>Also, I payed more for shipping than the product.</li>
            <li>so I ran to the drugstore to buy some more.</li>
            <li>but I am still able to run my fingers through it.</li>
            <li>This hairspray feels like it&#x27;s barely spraying on because the mist is so fine, but then the hold is great!</li>
            <li>Also, the spray comes out in a nice, fine mist for light and even application -- when it works, that</li>
            <li>but it is strong and becomes more cloying</li>
            <li>Light hold and a nice clean smell.  </li>
            <li>Omg I loved it soooo much.</li>
            <li>The scent is very light and fresh!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s got great hold, but the smell is so strong it nearly suffocates you.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very light, has a soft, clean scent (light, in my opinion) and yet gives my very fine hair a fair amount of body.</li>
            <li>it does the  job perfect for me hold nice with out my hair being hard, it holds but still has volume.</li>
            <li>I discovered dove ORGAN AL CLEAN SCENT deodorant as a teenager and fell in love with the scent.</li>
            <li>This is the first time I have ever bought this kind of hairspray.</li>
            <li>I liked to older version better.</li>
            <li>This hair spray is fine, but I miss my salon brands.  </li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t believe how quickly I received it!</li>
            <li>Not enough hold but smells great</li>
            <li>It is a light hold</li>
            <li>It is great, IMHO, as described above.  </li>
            <li>The old formula kept my curls gorgeous all day.</li>
            <li>The hairspray itself is not very strong if you need good hold for your style, and the more you spray, the more you can tell you&#x27;re wearing hairspray.  </li>
            <li>Great spray, has a natural look and holds pretty well</li>
            <li>This was the first time I have used this product, and I enjoyed it.  </li>
            <li>Originally I had 5 stars on this product.  </li>
            <li>Love the soft &amp; touchable yet firm hold, and it smells great!</li>
            <li>I love this scent so much I wish they would make it into a perfume&amp;#34; and boom</li>
            <li>So I tried applying much more, and of course my hair very crunchy - but even then, zero hold.</li>
            <li>After using it just 3 times, the bottle broke and even though it is basically full, no liquid will come out of it.</li>
            <li>so if you are looking for a super hold spray this one is not for you.</li>
            <li>I live in a humid climate (year round) and this is the best spray I&#x27;ve found.  </li>
            <li>I buy this brand because I have a wheat allergy and almost the whole line is wheat free.  </li>
            <li>The product works very well to have a light \\&quot;natural\\&quot; hold, but the smell leaves something to be desired.  </li>
            <li>disregard the text on the can that reads, &amp;#34;If dispenser clogs, rinse in warm water.&amp;#34; The spray mechanism clogs constantly.</li>
            <li>It was worth giving this product a try, but I will wait for version 2.0 before buying again.</li>
            <li>As in, I literally feel like I can&#x27;t breathe after spraying even the tiniest bit, and I have to walk somewhere else to get fresh air.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been a loyal Dove customer for years and years, and loved the previous flexible hold hairspray.</li>
            <li>This hairspray has a pleasant enough smell as far as hairspray scents go</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not really a bad smell, it is just VERY strong/intense.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It was exactly what I wanted.&lt;br /&gt;Veva</li>
            <li>And that intense smell sits on your hair and lingers for HOURS, so forget about wearing your favorite perfume unless you want to smell like a total train wreck.</li>
            <li>If you can get past that then it&#x27;s a good hairspray.</li>
            <li>Provides even more body and hold in a dry climate.  </li>
            <li>and I would certainly buy it again&lt;</li>
            <li>I ruined an hour&#x27;s worth of curling my 4 year old&#x27;s hair by over-spraying.  </li>
            <li>thanks</li>
            <li>dear lord, it&#x27;s like baby powder on steroids, an intense powdery perfume that assaults your nose and threatens to choke you.</li>
            <li>but this is way too much.</li>
            <li>It works really well</li>
            <li>HOWEVER, I&#x27;ve had 3 cans of this spray that I ended up tossing out because they continuously get clogged and absolutely unusable.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve adapted to using the product by rinsing the sprayer head under warm running water every few seconds.</li>
            <li>It is quite windy where I live, so if I put no spray on my hair, my hairdo lasts all of 5 seconds before the first gust of wind hits it.</li>
            <li>Makes my hair dry, dull and sticky - WHY did DOVE change the old PERFECT product?!?!?!?!?</li>
            <li>tried rinsing both before and after each use with hot water, using a pin to clear the spray nozzle, wiping the nozzle with alcohol before and after each use..</li>
            <li>my curls are gone within an hour, and normally my hair holds curl really well with just a touch of hairspray.</li>
            <li>The old spray dried quickly and soft but had way better hold.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this hairspray product.</li>
            <li>It leaves your hair feeling soft and I really like that.</li>
            <li>The only down side is that the scent is pretty strong, but at least it has a nice scent.</li>
            <li>This is my new go to hair spray.</li>
            <li>Never heavy or clumpy.</li>
            <li>I used the old hairspray for years</li>
            <li>Also, the hold is much weaker, the spray is sticky, and where it lands on skin it forms a solid immovable crust.</li>
            <li>It leaves my hair soft and lustrous.</li>
            <li>so, you know that old expression...</li>
            <li>Any time I spray more than 4 or 5 shots in a row, or hold down the sprayer for for than a couple seconds, the spray head clogs, sending hairspray out in globs and eventually just streaming down the side of the can.</li>
            <li>Please bring back the old hairspray.</li>
            <li>Unlike several other reviewers, I rather like the scent of the product; however, I agree that it is unusually strong and could stand being toned down.</li>
            <li>it was the same as The flexible hold hairspray in the old blue can.</li>
            <li>hair is short, fine and thin so, while I would prefer never to wear hair spray, it is pretty much a \\&quot;must have\\&quot; for me, at least if I want to look halfway put together when I go to work, out to eat, etc.</li>

            <li> Thought the &amp;#34; new&amp;#34; Pink one would be the same except for the color change from blue to pink.&lt;br /&gt;What</li>
            <li> I used it the first time and thought the smell was weird (old perfume?).  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it for a long time.</li>
            <li> It is somewhat sticky; if I touch it at all while still wet I definitely need to wash my hands.  </li>
            <li> I like Dove and their products, but if they don&#x27;t make a similar hairspray with less scent, looks like a brand switch is in my future.</li>
            <li> Sometimes to \\&quot;scrunch\\&quot; a little extra shape.  </li>
            <li> Sending it back tomorrow and will try to fine the Blue one online.&lt;br /&gt;Sorry, I hate to change brands once I find something that works but no choice with this one.</li>
            <li> and I love all dove products, besides my bad experience with delivery</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in my 20s and really do not want that smell on me all day.</li>
            <li> THEN they discontinued it and came out with THAT PINK LID and changed the formula and SCENT</li>
            <li> Oh well, it doesn&#x27;t work anyway, so there&#x27;s really no reason to use the rest of it, even if I could.</li>
            <li> Please consider going back to the old formula as this new hair spray scent is quite unpleasant.  </li>
            <li> I see from Amazon and other sites that I&#x27;m not alone in my opinion.</li>
            <li> that smell\\&quot; when I use it in the upstairs bathroom, it competes with any other scented product you might use (perfume, lotion, doedorant, etc.), and sometimes gives me a headache to use.</li>
            <li> Due to reading the ingred.</li>
            <li> I usually use the \\&quot;Extra Hold/Extra Strong\\&quot; version of this hairspray.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t weigh hair down.  </li>
            <li> My room mates down stairs</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a bit ridiculous, but it beats having sticky hairspray running down my arm.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am frugal and like the product enough to deal with its shortcomings for now instead of just throwing the remainder of it in the trash.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like that stiff feeling you get from other hairsprays.</li>
            <li> It smells like hairspray... not pleasant but not gross.  </li>
            <li> However, this product would have to be heavily discounted before I would buy it again.</li>
            <li> This does not have hold at all and the smell is too harsh.</li>
            <li> my hair does not feel stiff when I use this product.</li>
            <li> This version smells terrible and is far from &amp;#34;flexible hold&amp;#34;, it leaves my hair feeling stiff and crusty, gross.</li>
            <li> The smell is nauseatingly strong and sickeningly sugary!</li>
            <li> It holds my style in place without a hard finish.  </li>
            <li> The nozel is not clogged because it still works with other hairsprays, so something is actually wrong with the mechanism in the bottle.</li>
            <li> I hate this new formulae.</li>
            <li> Worse it feels  sticky in my hair.</li>
            <li> Unlike other customers I don&#x27;t think this has a bad smell</li>
            <li> Too bad, because I do like the spray...maybe I&#x27;ll break down and try the non-aerosol version.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately the product did not work.</li>
            <li> Since the recent change of the formula, this hairspray is now horrible!</li>
            <li> I always buy a few cans of this product because I hate to run out of it.  </li>
            <li> I am with the other reviewer, this product smells awful.  </li>
            <li> The scent is heavy and awful.</li>
            <li> but sadly it&#x27;s time to find another brand!</li>
            <li> It has an unpleasant powdery smell.  </li>
            <li> It looks bad if you overspray, trust me.  </li>
            <li> Sticky with a bad smell.</li>
            <li> As a hairspray, this item is pathetically bad.</li>
            <li> Too bad Amazon can&#x27;t ship this to HI; their price is the best!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t escape from it all day and it makes me sick!</li>
            <li> Awful!!</li>
            <li> This has a horrible smell.  </li>
            <li> This is the worst product I&#x27;ve ever bought.</li>
            <li> HATE IT!!!</li>
            <li> Which was terrible!</li>
            <li> It is AWFUL!!</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> This was the first time I have used this product, and I enjoyed it.  Light hold and a nice clean smell.  Not sticky or overpowering.  Also seems to make my hair shinier.</li>
            <li> Thanks for my product its great and I love all dove products, besides my bad experience with delivery , I am happy with dove hair spray , its great it does the  job perfect for me hold nice with out my hair being hard, it holds but still has volume.</li>
            <li> This hairspray has a pleasant enough smell as far as hairspray scents go but it is strong and becomes more cloying the longer you wear it.  You definitely will not want to sleep with this spray in your hair. My husband HATES the smell of this spray!  The hairspray itself is not very strong if you need good hold for your style, and the more you spray, the more you can tell you&#x27;re wearing hairspray.  It looks bad if you overspray, trust me.  I ruined an hour&#x27;s worth of curling my 4 year old&#x27;s hair by over-spraying.  Look elsewhere if you need a good hairspray.  Me, I&#x27;m going back to using Rave brand non-aerosol, an oldie but goodie.</li>
            <li> Why on earth did Dove change this product, the blue version before this was PERFECT. This version smells terrible and is far from &amp;#34;flexible hold&amp;#34;, it leaves my hair feeling stiff and crusty, gross.</li>
            <li> I love this product! I&#x27;ve used it for a long time. This is the best price I&#x27;ve ever found it for. Guess I will do all of my shopping on-line. I couldn&#x27;t believe how quickly I received it!</li>
            <li> This hairspray lives up to the name &amp;#34;flexible hold&amp;#34; as it does an admirable job of holding my style and flyaways in place without making my head look like a papier-mâché project. Unlike several other reviewers, I rather like the scent of the product; however, I agree that it is unusually strong and could stand being toned down. Also, the spray comes out in a nice, fine mist for light and even application -- when it works, that is.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t disregard the text on the can that reads, &amp;#34;If dispenser clogs, rinse in warm water.&amp;#34; The spray mechanism clogs constantly. Any time I spray more than 4 or 5 shots in a row, or hold down the sprayer for for than a couple seconds, the spray head clogs, sending hairspray out in globs and eventually just streaming down the side of the can. I&#x27;ve adapted to using the product by rinsing the sprayer head under warm running water every few seconds. It&#x27;s a bit ridiculous, but it beats having sticky hairspray running down my arm.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am frugal and like the product enough to deal with its shortcomings for now instead of just throwing the remainder of it in the trash. However, this product would have to be heavily discounted before I would buy it again. Dove needs to either reformulate this hairspray or reconsider the spraying mechanism to make it more user-friendly. It was worth giving this product a try, but I will wait for version 2.0 before buying again.</li>
            <li> I like Dove products . The price was good and I would certainly buy it again&lt;br /&gt;It was exactly what I wanted.&lt;br /&gt;Veva Stanley</li>
            <li> Best smell.  Provides protection from humidity.  Doesn&#x27;t weigh hair down.  I&#x27;ve used it on straightened hair.  It works when curling hair also.</li>
            <li> I used Dove Damage Therapy extra hold hairspray for years. All of the sudden, here comes the &amp;#34;new&amp;#34; and improved (not) Dove. Awful!! Sticky with a bad smell. Please bring back the old hairspray. If it ain&#x27;t broke, don&#x27;t fix it.</li>
            <li> This is the first time I have ever bought this kind of hairspray. It sprays evenly. Holds my style well. The only down side is that the scent is pretty strong, but at least it has a nice scent.</li>
            <li> I buy this brand because I have a wheat allergy and almost the whole line is wheat free.  This hair spray is fine, but I miss my salon brands.  It smells like hairspray... not pleasant but not gross.  It is somewhat sticky; if I touch it at all while still wet I definitely need to wash my hands.  It serves its purpose for a good price.</li>
            <li> I used it the first time and thought the smell was weird (old perfume?).  I used it again the next day thinking the smell would grow on me.  Well the smell lingered all day and i just wanted to go home and wash my hair. Returned it and bought Garnier Fructis instead. The scent is very light and fresh!</li>
            <li> The product works very well to have a light \\&quot;natural\\&quot; hold, but the smell leaves something to be desired.  It has kind of a baby powder/flower combination smell... I&#x27;m in my 20s and really do not want that smell on me all day.</li>
            <li> I love this hairspray. It leaves your hair feeling soft and I really like that. I don&#x27;t like that stiff feeling you get from other hairsprays. Unlike other customers I don&#x27;t think this has a bad smell and I would recommend this to anyone.</li>
            <li> this stuff is wonderful, the best flexible spray i&#x27;ve ever used..&amp; it IS flexible!</li>
            <li> Not enough hold but smells great</li>
            <li> i like the flexible hold that truly is.  my hair does not feel stiff when I use this product. thanks</li>
            <li> Stinky smell, but works well. Takes days for me to get the smell out so I don&#x27;t use it too often</li>
            <li> My husband bought this on accident and it turned out to be a good thing!  Love the soft &amp; touchable yet firm hold, and it smells great!</li>
            <li> I liked to older version better. This does not have hold at all and the smell is too harsh. I feel like I have put perfume in my hair.</li>
            <li> This has a horrible smell.  Would not use it or recommend it to any one.  It will go in the garbage.</li>
            <li> Please consider going back to the old formula as this new hair spray scent is quite unpleasant.  I see from Amazon and other sites that I&#x27;m not alone in my opinion.</li>
            <li> I love this product.  It holds my style in place without a hard finish.  I would highly recommend this hairspray product.</li>
            <li> This hairspray works awesome...has great hold without being sticky or crunchy and gives hair a nice shine to it....BUT, it smells SOOO strong! It&#x27;s not really a bad smell, it is just VERY strong/intense. My room mates down stairs ask \\&quot;what&#x27;s that smell\\&quot; when I use it in the upstairs bathroom, it competes with any other scented product you might use (perfume, lotion, doedorant, etc.), and sometimes gives me a headache to use. If this was unscented, it would be perfect, but as it is, I tossed it!</li>
            <li> This hairspray feels like it&#x27;s barely spraying on because the mist is so fine, but then the hold is great! Never heavy or clumpy.</li>
            <li> I love the super-fine mist and the fact that this product works without making my hair crunchy. HOWEVER. The smell... dear lord, it&#x27;s like baby powder on steroids, an intense powdery perfume that assaults your nose and threatens to choke you. As in, I literally feel like I can&#x27;t breathe after spraying even the tiniest bit, and I have to walk somewhere else to get fresh air. And that intense smell sits on your hair and lingers for HOURS, so forget about wearing your favorite perfume unless you want to smell like a total train wreck. I can still smell this stuff in the bathroom more than an hour after spraying just a teeny bit of it. For the record, I like baby powder, baby powder-scented deodorant, etc... but this is way too much. I like Dove and their products, but if they don&#x27;t make a similar hairspray with less scent, looks like a brand switch is in my future.</li>
            <li> I would give no stars of that was an option. I have been using dove for YEARS. I grew up to only using dove soap. I discovered dove ORGAN AL CLEAN SCENT deodorant as a teenager and fell in love with the scent. I used to say &amp;#34;Omg I love this scent so much I wish they would make it into a perfume&amp;#34; and boom they came out with the HAIRSPRAY which was AMAZING Omg I loved it soooo much. It was my signature scent I didn&#x27;t even need perfume !  Lol.  THEN they discontinued it and came out with THAT PINK LID and changed the formula and SCENT ughhhh.......dove please go back to basics</li>
            <li> I bought this thinking it was the same as The flexible hold hairspray in the old blue can. But it def is not the same. I hate this new formulae. The scent is heavy and awful. Worse it feels  sticky in my hair. The old spray dried quickly and soft but had way better hold. What was Dove thinking?????  Why change a perfect hairspray!!!! I used the old hairspray for years but sadly it&#x27;s time to find another brand! Any suggestions?</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s got great hold, but the smell is so strong it nearly suffocates you.  If you can get past that then it&#x27;s a good hairspray.</li>
            <li> Received promptly, in perfect packaging. Unfortunately the product did not work. Seller reshipped immediately and second product received and worked perfectly. Very happy and will definitely purchase from this seller again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been a loyal Dove customer for years and years, and loved the previous flexible hold hairspray. What happened?? What on earth were they thinking? Since the recent change of the formula, this hairspray is now horrible! The smell is nauseatingly strong and sickeningly sugary! I can&#x27;t escape from it all day and it makes me sick! Is this a hairspray or a perfume? The job of this product is to fix hair, not to choose my perfume for me and drown out anything else I might be wearing! Also, the hold is much weaker, the spray is sticky, and where it lands on skin it forms a solid immovable crust. This is the worst product I&#x27;ve ever bought. I&#x27;m jumping ship and switching brands. On the Dove website, this ranks just above 1 star out of 153 reviews! Seems like they&#x27;ve lost a LOT of customers. What a shame!</li>
            <li> YUCK! HATE IT!!! Makes my hair dry, dull and sticky - WHY did DOVE change the old PERFECT product?!?!?!?!? The old formula kept my curls gorgeous all day.</li>
            <li> First, the good: this product smells great. It smells just like cinnamon and is easily the best smelling hairspray I have ever encountered. The problem is, I&#x27;m looking for hairspray, not perfume. As a hairspray, this item is pathetically bad. It has basically zero hold - my curls are gone within an hour, and normally my hair holds curl really well with just a touch of hairspray. So I tried applying much more, and of course my hair very crunchy - but even then, zero hold. After using it just 3 times, the bottle broke and even though it is basically full, no liquid will come out of it. The nozel is not clogged because it still works with other hairsprays, so something is actually wrong with the mechanism in the bottle. Oh well, it doesn&#x27;t work anyway, so there&#x27;s really no reason to use the rest of it, even if I could.</li>
            <li> I did not like this item. Due to reading the ingred., I found that this product had alcohol in it, which was the dryinging alcohol. Also, I payed more for shipping than the product. Which was terrible! Never open this.</li>
            <li> I usually use the \\&quot;Extra Hold/Extra Strong\\&quot; version of this hairspray. My last can of it was about to run out so I ran to the drugstore to buy some more. I bought this \\&quot;Flexible Hold/Strong\\&quot; version by mistake and didn&#x27;t realize it until I got it home and used it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With the \\&quot;Extra Hold\\&quot; spray, I generally only have to spray my hair once and I&#x27;m done. This stuff, I kept spraying and spraying, wondering why it wasn&#x27;t holding--my hair was still hanging on my forehead. Then I looked at the can. D&#x27;oh!!! But, still, I thought...it says \\&quot;Flexible Hold\\&quot; which does infer that it has some kind of hold. But damned if I could see or feel it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair is short, fine and thin so, while I would prefer never to wear hair spray, it is pretty much a \\&quot;must have\\&quot; for me, at least if I want to look halfway put together when I go to work, out to eat, etc. It is quite windy where I live, so if I put no spray on my hair, my hairdo lasts all of 5 seconds before the first gust of wind hits it. Well, it took about the same length of time for the wind to undo my &#x27;do wearing this spray. Why even sell a hairspray that doesn&#x27;t hold?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have already gone back to the store and bought 2 cans of the Extra Hold. I will give away the Flexible Hold to a neighbor or friend with \\&quot;heavier\\&quot; hair since I&#x27;ve already used it and can&#x27;t return it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I definitely won&#x27;t be buying anymore of this version of the spray.</li>
            <li> Great spray, has a natural look and holds pretty well</li>
            <li> This is my new go to hair spray. It has a great fresh scent and does not have that crunchy feeling. It is a light hold so if you are looking for a super hold spray this one is not for you. I can curl or scrunch my hair and then I put this in and it keeps my hair together but I am still able to run my fingers through it. Lasts all day too.</li>
            <li> I always buy a few cans of this product because I hate to run out of it.  It leaves my hair soft and lustrous. Please don&#x27;t stop making this product.</li>
            <li> I have used Dove hairspray for years and loved it. Thought the &amp;#34; new&amp;#34; Pink one would be the same except for the color change from blue to pink.&lt;br /&gt;What a mistake!!!&lt;br /&gt;The smell is nauseating and overpowering. I don&#x27;t NEED the smell just the HOLD to my hairstyle.&lt;br /&gt;Dove, what were you thinking? Sending it back tomorrow and will try to fine the Blue one online.&lt;br /&gt;Sorry, I hate to change brands once I find something that works but no choice with this one. It is AWFUL!!</li>
            <li> I am with the other reviewer, this product smells awful.  It has an unpleasant powdery smell.  It works really well but the smell is going to make me take it back and exchange it for the Dove hairspray in the blue can.</li>
            <li> I live in a humid climate (year round) and this is the best spray I&#x27;ve found.  It&#x27;s very light, has a soft, clean scent (light, in my opinion) and yet gives my very fine hair a fair amount of body. I use it as a spray when putting in the \\&quot;velcro\\&quot; rollers, and/or when finished styling;  Sometimes to \\&quot;scrunch\\&quot; a little extra shape.  It&#x27;s the best I&#x27;ve found.  Provides even more body and hold in a dry climate.  Too bad Amazon can&#x27;t ship this to HI; their price is the best!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;updated:  Aug 5, 2013 - Originally I had 5 stars on this product.  It is great, IMHO, as described above.  HOWEVER, I&#x27;ve had 3 cans of this spray that I ended up tossing out because they continuously get clogged and absolutely unusable.  I&#x27;m a fairly patient person... tried rinsing both before and after each use with hot water, using a pin to clear the spray nozzle, wiping the nozzle with alcohol before and after each use.. Nothing worked....so, you know that old expression...fool me once, shame on you... fool me twice, shame on me.  Well, three strikes and you&#x27;re out!  Too bad, because I do like the spray...maybe I&#x27;ll break down and try the non-aerosol version.  Maybe.</li>
