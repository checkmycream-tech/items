            <li>Take my review with a grain of salt because I honestly have not figured it out yet.</li>
            <li>but I honestly do nit see the purpose.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure.</li>
            <li>so I would not recommend it for traveling, but I love using it in the shower.</li>
            <li>Whoever packed my order should have known better.</li>
            <li>LOVE THE WAY IT TINGLES</li>
            <li>I have many skin problems including breakouts on my face and rashes on my body.  </li>
            <li>I used another salt bar and it had many crystals</li>
            <li>I need to research this more</li>
            <li>okay?</li>
            <li>Glad I purchased it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so glad I was able to find the soap, I will certainly purchase more of them.</li>
            <li>Easy to smooth and use as you want.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Although the bar itself is smooth, I do not recommend anyone trying to wash-scrub with this bar as though it were soap--</li>
            <li>I like other salt products better, but this is fairly inexpensive and lasts a while.&lt;br /&gt;Would have given it 4 stars except for the following:&lt;br /&gt;Be</li>
            <li>This is another product I am loving so far that I purchased from amazon.com.</li>
            <li>if you rinse you face quickly</li>
            <li>The product came quickly and was packaged well.  </li>
            <li>WOW!!!!!</li>
            <li>Great for removing dead skin.</li>
            <li>I love this product as a natural deodorant.  </li>
            <li>It leaves my skin so soft and creamy, and so very clean.</li>
            <li>I had been seeking the correct deodorant for a long time--this is an amazing</li>
            <li>The skin problems have all disappeared and my skin is beautiful and soft since I am not using harsh chemical on it and the natural oils are able to stay on my skin.  </li>
            <li>I simply wet my face with warm water and lather my hands with the salt bar.</li>
            <li>I find that it doesn&#x27;t sting or scratch if you put the salt on your hands first.</li>
            <li>Exactly as described.</li>
            <li>I have ordered several of these soaps, and I really love all of them.</li>
            <li>having been said, it is exactly what it is supposed to be...</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t comment more since it was given out as a present.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s devoid of harmful chemicals, yet still is an effective deodorant.  </li>
            <li>Good for sensitive faces of used carefully.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Using this natural salt loaded with minerals and lacking the chemistry of the modern alternatives, I was able to keep my oily completion in-check using the natural effect of salt.</li>
            <li>but this one is mostly crystal free but be careful not to use it directly on the skin.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Quality of salt stone is good; it lasts a long time if not left in a puddle of water.</li>
            <li>It really works on getting rid of the smell from my armpit.</li>
            <li>I use it two or three times a day, dab it with water and rub it gently on your skin.</li>
            <li>It has a few good uses and benefits I have found in the short period of time</li>
            <li>I liked the fact that I did not notice hardly any stinging when I had it on my face.</li>
            <li>the salt particles will scratch you (badly, if you are not careful, so do not leave it where a child can use it); it is best used by first wetting the bar, then using your hands, a washcloth, or buff to apply to skin.</li>
            <li>This product completely erased a face full of acne in about 8 days total, and it has yet to return.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and you will have a clear face in days!</li>
            <li>And in case you were wondering; this doesn&#x27;t dry-out my oily skin, but helps it achieve a natural balance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>anywhere I have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>This is a natural product there will be irregularities.</li>
            <li>Mine arrived in old cellophane wrap, no label.</li>
            <li>I have noticed that the salt bar makes my skin so soft.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t apply it directly to your skin</li>
            <li>My skin cleared up 76% so far in 2 to 3 weeks.  </li>
            <li>personally, I find Dead Sea bath salts to be better (check my other reviews), but this bar is okay for spot-treating small areas.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It makes my skin smooth and clears up any icky spots I have.</li>
            <li>well I have only used it 1 time so far</li>
    </ol>

            <li> All significant bumps or blemishes dried up in a few days.</li>
            <li> used this product initially 5-7 times a day to just dry out what was present on my skin at the time I started to use the salt.</li>
            <li> but if you drag across your skin you just have to make sure there isn&#x27;t any rough irritating edges.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;The bar will last for a long time.  </li>
            <li> I have tried on my face after washing it to see if it would heal some little red spots I developed after plucking the hair off my face to see if the salt would heal it,</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t last as long as the other viewers said, but i think it still last long enough for the price.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t use it like a normal soap bar either, I tried to get very little on my hands and use my hands to pat my skin...</li>
            <li> Salt killed the bacteria on my skin and allowed for natural healing.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m just not brave enough to use it very often, is all!</li>
            <li> I purchased it because I have skin issues that do not clear up by it self.</li>
            <li> As for deo, yes I still sweat, it is only a deodorant, but since using it daily my underarms need less attention than ever before.</li>
            <li> Dry ones or acne prone areas.</li>
            <li> Rub it between my wet hands and then over my still wet body parts, face, neck, back...</li>
            <li> Limits bacterial growth for less acne if used daily.</li>
            <li> Be careful and not let it put cuts on your hands.</li>
            <li> but when I use a rag not really seeing the benefits.  </li>
            <li> The bar was to rough against the skin.</li>
            <li> As other reviewers have stated, has sharp grains in it that abrade the underarms, then puts \\&quot;salt in the wound.\\&quot;  I do like that</li>
            <li> This has been such as simple solution after years of expensive \\&quot;treatment systems\\</li>
            <li> When I shave under my arms, I will wait at least a few hours or the following morning to apply it.  </li>
            <li> their product (twice in less than a week)</li>
            <li> Can be harsh on delicate skin, so do not leave it on too long if you do not want a skin reaction.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s heavy</li>
            <li> I used this everyday since I brought it.</li>
            <li> wanted a small chunk for travelling and my husband chopped off a little over an inch from one end--</li>
            <li> Not sure what you might want to use this for</li>
            <li> It is actualy salt rock that you leave in the tub for it to dissolve slowly.  </li>
            <li> Looked awful like it was very old.</li>
            <li> Clears up bad skin!&lt;br /&gt;Use</li>
            <li> This literally scratched my skin, and it burned very badly.</li>
            <li> It looked disgusting.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> This product completely erased a face full of acne in about 8 days total, and it has yet to return.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Using this natural salt loaded with minerals and lacking the chemistry of the modern alternatives, I was able to keep my oily completion in-check using the natural effect of salt. All significant bumps or blemishes dried up in a few days. This has been such as simple solution after years of expensive \\&quot;treatment systems\\&quot; that yield only some results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used this product initially 5-7 times a day to just dry out what was present on my skin at the time I started to use the salt. To use the salt I simply wet my face with warm water and lather my hands with the salt bar. I would rub my salt water hands into my skin, and once I felt the presence of the salt via the sensation I would let it sit for 60-90 seconds. After I would rise my face until the next time I washed up. (yes that is it!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Once my face cleared up, I reduced the number of times a day to 3-4. However, 2 might even be sufficient. And in case you were wondering; this doesn&#x27;t dry-out my oily skin, but helps it achieve a natural balance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;NOTE:&lt;br /&gt;These bars are now 9 ounces and used to be 10 ounces. Lets hope these don&#x27;t keep shrinking!!</li>
            <li> Great to use as a foot Pumas.  Be careful and not let it put cuts on your hands.</li>
            <li> Great for removing dead skin.</li>
            <li> Clears up bad skin!&lt;br /&gt;Use this with some hemp based some and you will have a clear face in days!</li>
            <li> I like this product and will get it again I&#x27;m sure. I keep it in the shower and wash and/or rinse off with it. It is scratchy; you can&#x27;t use it to scrub your body - and it is salt, not soap, like my title reads. It&#x27;s heavy so I would not recommend it for traveling, but I love using it in the shower.</li>
            <li> I use like it says in the instructions and works wonderfully. I am very happy with the product and I recommend it</li>
            <li> I love this product as a natural deodorant.  Since it is salt; however, it may sting if you use it just after shaving.  When I shave under my arms, I will wait at least a few hours or the following morning to apply it.  Otherwise, I apply it immediately after bathing, and again in the morning.  No perspiration and no toxic aluminum!  Love it!</li>
            <li> I use this as a final rinse before getting out of the shower or bath. Rub it between my wet hands and then over my still wet body parts, face, neck, back...anywhere I have sensitive skin. I also use it after shaving for deodorant. I find that it doesn&#x27;t sting or scratch if you put the salt on your hands first. It makes my skin smooth and clears up any icky spots I have. Dry ones or acne prone areas. As for deo, yes I still sweat, it is only a deodorant, but since using it daily my underarms need less attention than ever before.</li>
            <li> Not sure what you might want to use this for but if you drag across your skin you just have to make sure there isn&#x27;t any rough irritating edges.  Easy to smooth and use as you want.  This is a natural product there will be irregularities.</li>
            <li> Exactly as described. Good for sensitive faces of used carefully. Wet hands, turn salt bar over and over several times, gently apply to wet face, rinse  well. Limits bacterial growth for less acne if used daily.</li>
            <li> I love this soap! It leaves my skin so soft and creamy, and so very clean. I have ordered several of these soaps, and I really love all of them. I&#x27;m so glad I was able to find the soap, I will certainly purchase more of them. Thank you!</li>
            <li> This literally scratched my skin, and it burned very badly. I didn&#x27;t use it like a normal soap bar either, I tried to get very little on my hands and use my hands to pat my skin...it didn&#x27;t make a difference. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this for a bath</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t buy this. Mine arrived in old cellophane wrap, no label. The soap was faded and all dented up.Looked awful like it was very old. Would&#x27;t pay 50 cents for it. Perhaps its nice if you dare use it. It looked disgusting.Whoever packed my order should have known better.</li>
            <li> This is another product I am loving so far that I purchased from amazon.com. I like salt for different reasons. It has a few good uses and benefits I have found in the short period of time I have had this. I have tried as deodorant  a couple of times and did not notice any odor after using it for the day, but you do have to wash and reapply the next day or whenever you can tell its time. I have tried on my face after washing it to see if it would heal some little red spots I developed after plucking the hair off my face to see if the salt would heal it, well I have only used it 1 time so far so I cannot tell yet if it worked. I am going to continue trying it for this . I liked the fact that I did not notice hardly any stinging when I had it on my face. I have noticed that the salt bar makes my skin so soft. I would like to make another purchase of this again !</li>
            <li> I had been seeking the correct deodorant for a long time--this is an amazing find!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wanted a small chunk for travelling and my husband chopped off a little over an inch from one end--perfect!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bar will last for a long time.  (And yes, I have tried it as soap in the shower.)</li>
            <li> LOVE THE WAY IT TINGLES AND MAKES MY SKIN FEEL SO GOOD AND SOFT AND ACTUALY HELPS ME BREATHE BETTER!!!!!! WOW!!!!! I RUN IT UNDER THE FAUCET IN BATH WITH VERY WARM WATER!!!!!!</li>
            <li> I use this product for my face and my body.  I have many skin problems including breakouts on my face and rashes on my body.  The skin problems have all disappeared and my skin is beautiful and soft since I am not using harsh chemical on it and the natural oils are able to stay on my skin.  Salt killed the bacteria on my skin and allowed for natural healing.  I bought a bar for my daughter and her acne has cleared up.  Remember when you were told that acne is caused by bacteria in clogged pores?  Well this kills the bacteria.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The downside is that while the salt is on your skin, it stings.  if you rinse you face quickly the sting goes away.  I used another salt bar and it had many crystals but this one is mostly crystal free but be careful not to use it directly on the skin.  Rub it between your palms like regular soap and apply to your face or body.  Works like a charm.</li>
            <li> I used this everyday since I brought it. It really works on getting rid of the smell from my armpit. It didn&#x27;t last as long as the other viewers said, but i think it still last long enough for the price.</li>
            <li> Take my review with a grain of salt because I honestly have not figured it out yet.Don&#x27;t apply it directly to your skin but when I use a rag not really seeing the benefits.  I need to research this more but I honestly do nit see the purpose.</li>
            <li> For those who have not realized yet, this is not soap, okay? It is a smoothed &amp; shaped piece of salt rock used for treating skin conditions (like eczema &amp; acne).&lt;br /&gt;That having been said, it is exactly what it is supposed to be... personally, I find Dead Sea bath salts to be better (check my other reviews), but this bar is okay for spot-treating small areas.&lt;br /&gt;Although the bar itself is smooth, I do not recommend anyone trying to wash-scrub with this bar as though it were soap-- the salt particles will scratch you (badly, if you are not careful, so do not leave it where a child can use it); it is best used by first wetting the bar, then using your hands, a washcloth, or buff to apply to skin. Can be harsh on delicate skin, so do not leave it on too long if you do not want a skin reaction.&lt;br /&gt;Great for sore, achy feet-- and because feet are tougher, you can actually scrub with the bar there!&lt;br /&gt;Quality of salt stone is good; it lasts a long time if not left in a puddle of water. It is salt, and will corrode items if left someplace it shouldn&#x27;t be.&lt;br /&gt; Item was well packaged, shipped fast.&lt;br /&gt;Overall-  I like other salt products better, but this is fairly inexpensive and lasts a while.&lt;br /&gt;Would have given it 4 stars except for the following:&lt;br /&gt;Be warned-- this company harassed me via email demanding a review their product (twice in less than a week) starting the day it arrived; I had only just received the bar, with no chance to even try it (which I told them). Had to send them a return email removing me from their list, but I am under the impression they would have continued for a while, had I not done so...</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t like. The bar was to rough against the skin.</li>
            <li> It is actualy salt rock that you leave in the tub for it to dissolve slowly.  Can&#x27;t comment more since it was given out as a present.</li>
            <li> As other reviewers have stated, has sharp grains in it that abrade the underarms, then puts \\&quot;salt in the wound.\\&quot;  I do like that it&#x27;s devoid of harmful chemicals, yet still is an effective deodorant.  I&#x27;m just not brave enough to use it very often, is all!</li>
            <li> I am very glad I purchased this salt soap bar.  I purchased it because I have skin issues that do not clear up by it self. I use it two or three times a day, dab it with water and rub it gently on your skin. My skin cleared up 76% so far in 2 to 3 weeks.  The product came quickly and was packaged well.  Glad I purchased it.</li>
