            <li>one of the best blending sponges i&#x27;ve come across.</li>
            <li>blends perfectly</li>
            <li>They are good quality and an excellent deal.</li>
            <li>I use them to blend out my foundation under my eyes and around my hair line or on clients that prefer a lighter application of foundation and this does the job beautifully.</li>
            <li>Great price....</li>
            <li>also they blend my makeup in really good</li>
            <li>love it for blending and contouring!</li>
            <li>I love them!</li>
            <li>they give your foundation a soft glow giving your face a flawless look,</li>
            <li>okay.</li>
            <li>okay</li>
            <li>I use these face puff sponges for my countouring kit, and I love them.</li>
            <li>and I have yet to find a better price than this.</li>
            <li>They still work ok tho.</li>
            <li>I was mostly concerned about the quality</li>
            <li>Hope this helps :3</li>
            <li>I recommend them if your looking for a cheap dupe of the beauty blender</li>
            <li>I am very disapointed!!!</li>
            <li>However, they are pretty and I use them all for decor now :)</li>
            <li>Love these facial sponges, just wish it came in more then two colors...</li>
            <li>Pretty colors!</li>
            <li>and I love how easy they make it to blend and apply different foundations and concealers so everything worked out.</li>
            <li>We tried to save some money with these versus going with another high-priced sponge like those found at Sephora, but it proved to not be worth the savings.  </li>
            <li>Great for small makeup touch ups</li>
            <li>Love the different colors and the feel.</li>
            <li>So much easier to use under your eyes instead of brushes and so much softer!</li>
            <li>you very much&lt;br /&gt;Looking</li>
            <li>I went ahead and got the real BB.</li>
            <li>I had heard so much about these sponges, so I decided to try them.</li>
            <li>, I was looking forward to all the cute colors, but I just got 2 pink and 3 light blue.</li>
            <li>I purchased these and as a makeup artist I totally regret getting these instead of the original ones</li>
            <li>These sponges have a stiff feel to them and absorb way more makeup than the pricey ones.  </li>
            <li>These sponges are so soft!</li>
            <li>There really soft I like them and the colors</li>
            <li>but I got 3 hot pink and 3 light orange and was a little surprised because in the picture those colors weren&#x27;t shown but the color doesn&#x27;t matter to me</li>
            <li>They are hard and do not apply makeup easily.</li>
            <li>I ordered 6 of the teardrop shape and was hoping to get at least one light pink</li>

            <li> There really soft I like them and the colors</li>

            <li> These makeup blenders were not what I expected ...</li>
            <li> So whatever is saved on the sponges will easily be spent on used makeup.</li>
            <li> What a waste of money!</li>
            <li> I got the six pack of random, but still getting two colors was bummer for us as we all use different colors and like the way they look in the glass storage jar.</li>
            <li> It takes forever to ship and when i received it it was so hard, i cant even use it.</li>
            <li> honestly it&#x27;s not like I lost a lot of money</li>
            <li> yet kinda disappointed about that...</li>
            <li> the smell is just very unpleasant</li>
            <li> so CHINERISH - you know that horrible smell of Made in China</li>
            <li> Horrible.</li>

            <li> its okay but  It smells so CHINERISH - you know that horrible smell of Made in China products.&lt;br /&gt;Does everything have to be made over there though</li>
            <li> Horrible. Do not buy.</li>
            <li> I use these face puff sponges for my countouring kit, and I love them. I like the different colors so I can remember what I use for each shade. They are good quality and an excellent deal. I feel they are well made and I have yet to find a better price than this.</li>
            <li> So much easier to use under your eyes instead of brushes and so much softer! These are wonderful! They came earlier than anticipated and I would definitely recommend.</li>
            <li> one of the best blending sponges i&#x27;ve come across. i gave some to my daughter and she loves them as well.  blends perfectly</li>
            <li> I hope im going to like them but they haven&#x27;t even gotten to my house yet kinda disappointed about that... But I cant wait until they get here</li>

            <li> My order came with 4 and it was suppost to be 6</li>
            <li> Pretty colors! Love the different colors and the feel. They don&#x27;t feel soft enough to apply foundation because it just seems to soak up my foundation after I wet the sponges. However, they are pretty and I use them all for decor now :)</li>
            <li> Great for small makeup touch ups</li>
            <li> I did not get what I ordered. They were different shapes and I only got five, I was looking forward to all the cute colors, but I just got 2 pink and 3 light blue. They still work ok tho.</li>
