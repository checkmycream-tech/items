    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>This is the best I ever had.</li>
            <li>, I&#x27;m just very happy with what I have.</li>
            <li>it also hv notches dentents on the lever so you can give excellent fades</li>
            <li>and I am happy with it.</li>
            <li>Great product.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m happy to report, after a couple uses and using the grease, they&#x27;re not quite as noisy.</li>
            <li>but Im a 29yr experienced barber and</li>
            <li>I bought these clippers for myself about 6 months ago and they arrived in good condition, still works great</li>
            <li>I do not recommend this item it looks good</li>
            <li>And after all the times I used it never did the haircut look good.</li>
            <li>Looks nice and you can tell they are quality built.</li>
            <li>I have to cut hair with these things they keep catching and pulling.  </li>
            <li>I do reccomend that clipper and think it is superior in many ways to this one.</li>
            <li>It cuts very smooth and effective.</li>
            <li>know good clippers when I use them, by the way Conair is the maker of these frofex/babyliss pro clippers and they&#x27;re doing a great job manufacturering professional barbering tools.</li>
            <li>Like you ever need better combs.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>so I bought this Wahl clipper (Wahl 5-star Magic Clip Clipper).   </li>
            <li>I am extremely satisfied with this Forfex.</li>
            <li>and I love it.  </li>
            <li>I was more than pleased with the quality of cut that it gave.</li>
            <li>I find myself going over spots more than 3 or 4 times when I&#x27;m shaving my head.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Would have rated 5 stars if it came with more guards.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>As I stated before, for the price, it&#x27;s ok</li>
            <li>I was able to \\&quot;mcgyver\\&quot;</li>
            <li>I owned a cheaper version of the Babyliss clipper for years which gave much better results.</li>
            <li>Also the gaurds aren&#x27;t an issue if you&#x27;re a professional barber bc most of us don&#x27;t use them anyway since the andis guards fit these and are the best.</li>
            <li>I had been using a Forfex Professional cutter with great results.</li>
            <li>Other than that, the set and transaction was great!</li>
            <li>Update:&lt;br /&gt;After a year, the clippers are still going strong.</li>
            <li>I have used it a couple of times and get a smooth even cut.</li>
            <li>If you need additional clipper comb guide sizes, Andis has a set of 7 ranging from 1/16\\&quot; to 1\\&quot; for about $12.00 that fit the Forfex, I found a set at Sally Beauty.</li>
            <li>I replaced this unit with a Wahl Balding clipper also available here on Amazon.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used it just twice, but I&#x27;m very pleased so far.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used it just twice, but I&#x27;m very pleased so far.</li>
            <li>We can&#x27;t return them and a replacement blade and guard costs an arm and a leg (more than we originally paid for the whole unit).&lt;br /&gt;Too</li>
            <li>I have the Conair Pro version of this clipper and they are great, mine came with the metal cutting blade instead of the ceramic and they cut flawless, if you&#x27;re hving problems with the ceramic blade replace it with an oster fast feed blade which also fits this clipper or the forfex metal tooth blade.</li>
            <li>The only reason I didn&#x27;t give them 5 stars is because it doesn&#x27;t cut as good as I thought it would.</li>
            <li>I got this item on sale/clearance almost 1/3 the full retail price.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s better than the fast feed in my opinion,</li>
            <li>The folks at Beauty Appliance were great to deal with: when I noticed that the sealed bag of clipper guides included were missing the all important #1 (1/8\\&quot;) guide I emailed them.  </li>
            <li>I have the older metal ones that still work so much better than</li>
            <li>&quot; These were such a great price and the reviews were pretty stellar that I couldn&#x27;t pass them up for my husband to trim his beard and clip his dome.</li>
            <li>The Babyliss Pro FX686 cuts through my hair like a hot knife through butter!  </li>
            <li>Ironically, these are not same cheap plastic combs but somebody invested time making them look better.</li>
            <li>Fortunately, some old combs from some Andis Walmart clipper fit here.     </li>
            <li>, right?</li>
            <li>Right.</li>
            <li>My older clipper was a plastic snap fit and it would come off during the job.  </li>
            <li>German craftsmanship at its legendary high level; instructions that assume you really want it to last.  </li>
            <li>They feel solid, are very quiet and produced a great haircut.  </li>
            <li>I liked them so much that I ordered a second set.</li>
            <li>FX686 to use here at home and needless to say I am still impressed with the product.</li>
            <li>I would have rated higher if they were intact.</li>
            <li>First, I must say, the box the clippers was shipped in was as flimsy as a Kleenex.</li>
            <li>aside, the clippers are exactly as described.</li>
            <li>BUT the guards are pretty flimsy.</li>
            <li>I broke two of them already, I&#x27;ve never broken a conair guard!</li>
            <li>These clippers have a good feel and they are heavy duty.</li>
            <li>The first time I used them I noticed right away that these were a far better quality of clipper than my old Oster.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not sure that the ceramic top blade is such a good idea.</li>
            <li>I shave my own head at least once a week to keep it looking smooth</li>
            <li>I got this for my special needs son because he doesn&#x27;t like loud noise&#x27;s.  </li>
            <li>a bit mangy (normally, this would be funny, but since it is &gt;90 days, not so funny).</li>
            <li>Occasionally, I&#x27;ll cut my nephew&#x27;s hair or my dad&#x27;s hair, but still pretty light usage compared to a barber shop or salon.</li>
            <li>I would like to give this clipper 1 star just because they tried to be smart with the combs.</li>
            <li>Four guide combs, a cleaning brush and oil are included in the box - overall this is a great product and if you can find it for less than $60</li>
            <li>Oster Fast Feed blades can be used with these clippers and vice versa.  </li>
            <li>Check around on the internet and they are priced over twice as much on some websites.  </li>
            <li>(I really like the clippers themselves).</li>
            <li>I really like the clippers</li>
            <li>, they cut really well.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I had Amazon Prime and was able to get 3 of these without paying for shipping, otherwise I&#x27;d be a lot more frustrated.  </li>
            <li>Product is great, accessories come broken</li>
            <li>Both sets came fairly fast...</li>
            <li>This clipper also lets you zero gap your blade as well which the fast feeds do not, so with that being said about this quality clipper</li>
            <li>They are nice and heavy and were really stunning.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I wanted to replace the Conair because of how loud they were, but this Forfex unit is not any more quiet.</li>
            <li>Stay away from this product pay the extra money for something useful!</li>
            <li>Overall, I stick to my original rating;</li>
            <li>Cut well enough but the trimmer guides a unique to this clipper and are made with a brittle plastic.  </li>
            <li>I figured instead of sending them back right away, I&#x27;d try and unscrew the blade and figure out why it was making so much noise.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>Speedy delivery however very dissapointed with the results from this so called professional clipper.</li>
            <li>I normally purchase this brand of clippers and have no problems....</li>
            <li>My cousin was looking for new clippers</li>
            <li>the new \\&quot;ceramic\\&quot;    Forfex, stick with what works and dump the \\&quot;ceramic\\&quot; idea please.</li>
            <li>I thought that maybe this unit would be a little longer lasting and durable so decided to spend a bit more and give it a shot.</li>
            <li>It is very quiet and work&#x27;s very well.  </li>
            <li>I bought these to replace a 10 year old Oster clipper set.  </li>
            <li>I may be in a rut, but I review only those products I really like.  </li>
            <li>I have been a professional cosmetologist for 8 years</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been a professional barber for about 13 years, and swear by the Andis Masters for fading.  </li>
            <li>I really like these spring-loaded guides, but the teeth are too fragile.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m surprised it made it...</li>
            <li>The clippers them self were extremly loud when I turned them on.</li>
            <li>( I am a professional stylist.)</li>
            <li>It is very well made and feels solid.</li>
            <li>a must hv in your professional arsenal or for beginners.</li>
            <li>2 days later the missing guide and more arrived via UPS.  </li>
            <li>Not good, but not awful</li>
            <li>As stylist we do this often to either add a new clipper blade or align everything back up.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only used the unit once so far.</li>
            <li>the only negative thing is that the teeth on the plastic comb guard breaks easily.</li>
            <li>on, the clippers are not loud at all which is great for my 6 year old who hated my old loud clippers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Paid 3x$ and I am happy with it. However, the combs delivered with this one pull my hair off. Ironically, these are not same cheap plastic combs but somebody invested time making them look better. Like you ever need better combs. Those that go with 10$ clippers simply work. Fortunately, some old combs from some Andis Walmart clipper fit here.     I would like to give this clipper 1 star just because they tried to be smart with the combs. But for this price and clipper that works, I cannot.</li>
            <li> I got this for my special needs son because he doesn&#x27;t like loud noise&#x27;s.  It is very quiet and work&#x27;s very well.  I would say this would work for all. Love it.</li>
            <li> When we took these babies out of the box it was all, \\&quot;Ooooh, ahhhhhh!\\&quot; but now 3 months later it&#x27;s all \\&quot;Arrrrghhh!\\&quot; These were such a great price and the reviews were pretty stellar that I couldn&#x27;t pass them up for my husband to trim his beard and clip his dome. They are nice and heavy and were really stunning.&lt;br /&gt;He went about 2 months until one of the guards shattered when he took it off the clippers. Not good, but not awful, right? Right. Today (92 days after we bought &#x27;em) half of the ceramic blade shattered so he had to go to work looking a bit mangy (normally, this would be funny, but since it is &gt;90 days, not so funny). We can&#x27;t return them and a replacement blade and guard costs an arm and a leg (more than we originally paid for the whole unit).&lt;br /&gt;Too bad these didn&#x27;t work out--they were a beauty.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have these clippers but I see alot of people talk about the blades and guards for these clippers and there is a solution.  Oster Fast Feed blades can be used with these clippers and vice versa.  You can also use Andis guide combs with Oster clippers as well as these Forfex clippers.  For those having blade and guide comb issues I would suggest doing this!!!!</li>
            <li> This is a quality unit.  I have used it a couple of times and get a smooth even cut.</li>
            <li> I bought these to replace a 10 year old Oster clipper set.  The first time I used them I noticed right away that these were a far better quality of clipper than my old Oster.  They feel solid, are very quiet and produced a great haircut.  The folks at Beauty Appliance were great to deal with: when I noticed that the sealed bag of clipper guides included were missing the all important #1 (1/8\\&quot;) guide I emailed them.  I got a prompt email apology and 2 days later the missing guide and more arrived via UPS.  The price on Amazon (vendor is Beauty Appliance) is a steal!  Check around on the internet and they are priced over twice as much on some websites.  Highly recommend. If you need additional clipper comb guide sizes, Andis has a set of 7 ranging from 1/16\\&quot; to 1\\&quot; for about $12.00 that fit the Forfex, I found a set at Sally Beauty.</li>
            <li> This is the best I ever had. it cuts even. you only need to run though the hair once. I hope this product included a 3/8 in spacer.</li>
            <li> I may be in a rut, but I review only those products I really like.  This is one of those!    It may be that my older clipper was getting dull, but this does a supreior job without going over and over.  I especially like the spring loading of the cutting comb.  My older clipper was a plastic snap fit and it would come off during the job.  I am no longer worried the comb will come off and I will find a patch that has to be matched up.    I would make this a 5 star except the cord is very very heavy and I feel I am wrestling with it during the trim job.    Great product.  I would buy again.</li>
            <li> I have been cutting my own hair since 2005 about twice a month. I had been using a Forfex Professional cutter with great results. Earlier this year it started acting up so I bought this Wahl clipper (Wahl 5-star Magic Clip Clipper).   The wahl clipper is able to give you a closer cut but it is difficult to avoid nicks and cuts. After a couple of months I became so frustrated that I went and bought another forfex, (Babyliss Pro Fx686 Forfex Professional Pivot Motor Clipper with Ceramic Blade Set)  I am extremely satisfied with this Forfex. the only negative thing is that the teeth on the plastic comb guard breaks easily.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it just twice, but I&#x27;m very pleased so far.  German craftsmanship at its legendary high level; instructions that assume you really want it to last.  I&#x27;ve never used a clippers before, so I can&#x27;t compare it to anything else, I&#x27;m just very happy with what I have.</li>
            <li> I have been a professional cosmetologist for 8 years and I purchased this same make and model (FX686) in 2003 and it still works. I was tired of bringing my equipment back and forth to work so I purchased another Forfex FX686 to use here at home and needless to say I am still impressed with the product.</li>
            <li> I bought these clippers for myself about 6 months ago and they arrived in good condition, still works great and I love it.  My cousin was looking for new clippers and I recommended these. We bought first one and it arrived with 3mm attachment broken. We returned that one and bought another one. 2nd one arrived with 3mm and 6mm attachments shattered in peaces. I wrote an email to seller and NEVER got response back. Returned that one.  Bought 3rd set, thinking I just had bad luck (I really like the clippers themselves). 3rd set arrived with 2 attachments broken again.  I really like the clippers, they cut really well. But unfortunately, I have to give it 1 star. Customer service is, well, there&#x27;s no customer service. I&#x27;m glad I had Amazon Prime and was able to get 3 of these without paying for shipping, otherwise I&#x27;d be a lot more frustrated.  Beware of this item. Product is great, accessories come broken</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it just twice, but I&#x27;m very pleased so far. We bought it so we can start cutting our kids hair, so far it works well.  I&#x27;ll update after 6 months.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been a professional barber for about 13 years, and swear by the Andis Masters for fading.  I believe these are truly comparable. I was more than pleased with the quality of cut that it gave. I liked them so much that I ordered a second set. Both sets came fairly fast... less than a week with standard shipping. My only issue was the fact that the #1 guide in BOTH sets werr broken in the box. I really like these spring-loaded guides, but the teeth are too fragile. I would have rated higher if they were intact. Other than that, the set and transaction was great!</li>
            <li> These clippers have a good feel and they are heavy duty. Looks nice and you can tell they are quality built. The only reason I didn&#x27;t give them 5 stars is because it doesn&#x27;t cut as good as I thought it would. I&#x27;m not sure if it is because of the ceramic blades or what? I find myself going over spots more than 3 or 4 times when I&#x27;m shaving my head.</li>
            <li> I do not recommend this item it looks good but when it comes to actual use its a piece of crap.  It would be really hard to actually move the blade up and it would take too long to actual cut hair. And after all the times I used it never did the haircut look good. And after about 10 cuts the blade broke.  Stay away from this product pay the extra money for something useful!</li>
            <li> First, I must say, the box the clippers was shipped in was as flimsy as a Kleenex. I&#x27;m surprised it made it...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That aside, the clippers are exactly as described. You can tell from the heft that these are not entry level clippers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When on, the clippers are not loud at all which is great for my 6 year old who hated my old loud clippers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Included are 4 guards which go up to 1/2\\&quot;, some oil and a brush for cleaning out hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Would have rated 5 stars if it came with more guards.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I&#x27;m satisfied.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cheers.</li>
            <li> I normally purchase this brand of clippers and have no problems.... However, this one that I got from amazon was no good. The clippers them self were extremly loud when I turned them on. I have had this brand and model before and they are normally very quiet. ( I am a professional stylist.) when I moved the lever to adjust the blade, it got even louder. The noise was so loud that the entire salon looked over at me because they sounded so bad. I figured instead of sending them back right away, I&#x27;d try and unscrew the blade and figure out why it was making so much noise. As stylist we do this often to either add a new clipper blade or align everything back up. I couldn&#x27;t even unscrew the screws because they were in so tight. I had my boss and sales rep take a look and try to unscrew them, but it just made things worst. So needless to say I am out $60 because I couldn&#x27;t use them. I won&#x27;t ever purchase something like this again.</li>
            <li> I like it and it works however it makes a buzzing noise and it appears to have been used before. I have 2 just like it and no problem with them.</li>
            <li> I shave my own head at least once a week to keep it looking smooth and I usually use a 0 or 1 blade.   After using a middle of the road clipper the last few years, I finally decided to take the plunge and buy a Professional grade clipper. The Babyliss Pro FX686 cuts through my hair like a hot knife through butter!  This clipper is not as noisy as other brands I&#x27;ve owned but you can feel the power as it cuts.  The ceramic blade adjusts from a 0 to a 1 (there are five possible lengths in between) and I like the fact that the adjustment lever locks into place so you can&#x27;t accidently change it midway through cutting your hair.  Four guide combs, a cleaning brush and oil are included in the box - overall this is a great product and if you can find it for less than $60 it&#x27;s a steal!</li>
            <li> I got this item on sale/clearance almost 1/3 the full retail price. I&#x27;ve only used the unit once so far. It is very well made and feels solid. It cuts very smooth and effective. However, my complaint is that it is loud and vibrates quite a bit. In those two regards, it&#x27;s along the same lines as the $15 Conair clippers I got from the national bigbox store two years ago. I wanted to replace the Conair because of how loud they were, but this Forfex unit is not any more quiet. As I stated before, for the price, it&#x27;s ok and I&#x27;ll keep the unit, otherwise, I&#x27;d want to return it for a refund.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1-year Update:&lt;br /&gt;After a year, the clippers are still going strong. I cut my hair about once every two weeks. Occasionally, I&#x27;ll cut my nephew&#x27;s hair or my dad&#x27;s hair, but still pretty light usage compared to a barber shop or salon. I&#x27;m happy to report, after a couple uses and using the grease, they&#x27;re not quite as noisy. I&#x27;d give back one star in my rating BUT the guards are pretty flimsy. I broke two of them already, I&#x27;ve never broken a conair guard! On top of that, I have been unable to find replacements. I was able to \\&quot;mcgyver\\&quot; the guards from my previous clippers to work with the Forfex. Overall, I stick to my original rating; strong/durable clippers (minus the guards), not as noisy after a couple uses.</li>
            <li> Speedy delivery however very dissapointed with the results from this so called professional clipper. I owned a cheaper version of the Babyliss clipper for years which gave much better results.</li>
            <li> I have noticed that everyone seems to be wanting to go ceramic with everything, why?  It&#x27;s not that \\&quot;great\\&quot;.  Everytime I have to cut hair with these things they keep catching and pulling.  I have the older metal ones that still work so much better than the new \\&quot;ceramic\\&quot;    Forfex, stick with what works and dump the \\&quot;ceramic\\&quot; idea please.</li>
            <li> My wife shaves my head with a clipper weekly. We typically buy a clipper from a local store in the $10-$20 range and usually do so about every 6-12 months. I thought that maybe this unit would be a little longer lasting and durable so decided to spend a bit more and give it a shot. After trying this unit out, we returned it. It was very sharp feeling and uncomfortable on my head. The cut was below average in quality as well. I&#x27;m not sure that the ceramic top blade is such a good idea. The unit also arrived with a tooth broken on one of the guides which I typically use on my beard. I don&#x27;t reccomend this clipper.  I replaced this unit with a Wahl Balding clipper also available here on Amazon. I do reccomend that clipper and think it is superior in many ways to this one.</li>
            <li> This review is in my wife name bc I used her Amazon account to write this but Im a 29yr experienced barber and know good clippers when I use them, by the way Conair is the maker of these frofex/babyliss pro clippers and they&#x27;re doing a great job manufacturering professional barbering tools. I have the Conair Pro version of this clipper and they are great, mine came with the metal cutting blade instead of the ceramic and they cut flawless, if you&#x27;re hving problems with the ceramic blade replace it with an oster fast feed blade which also fits this clipper or the forfex metal tooth blade. This clipper also lets you zero gap your blade as well which the fast feeds do not, so with that being said about this quality clipper it&#x27;s better than the fast feed in my opinion, Oh yeah it also hv notches dentents on the lever so you can give excellent fades/tapers another plus on this clipper a must hv in your professional arsenal or for beginners. Also the gaurds aren&#x27;t an issue if you&#x27;re a professional barber bc most of us don&#x27;t use them anyway since the andis guards fit these and are the best.</li>
            <li> Cut well enough but the trimmer guides a unique to this clipper and are made with a brittle plastic.  I dropped a guide on the floor and the tines broke off.  Universal guides do not fit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d buy a Wahl next time.</li>
