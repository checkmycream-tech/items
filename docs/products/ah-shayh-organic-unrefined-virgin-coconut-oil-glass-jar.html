            <li>I love coconut oil, this is good quality however it was overpriced</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s really nice.  </li>
            <li>I think the jar is good but the top of it may not be.  </li>
            <li>I would apply at bedtime and as the sun rose my skin would be thirsty for hydration.  </li>
            <li>Use it as a Conditioner, Place Jar in warm water to Liquefy, then apply 2 teaspoons to the Hair 1 to 2 Hours before Washing&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Ive used alot of natural products and this is honestly the best Coconut oil I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li>It delivered fine, smells good.</li>
            <li>The price is suitable for the quality of this product...</li>
            <li>I wonder if this brand has some kind of magic maybe.</li>
            <li>ok ok ok ok!</li>
            <li>It was vibrant and a beautiful hue.  </li>
            <li>I mostly use this for my skin.</li>
            <li>I also cook with the Coconut Oil and love how it accents my food.  </li>
            <li>ENJOY!</li>
            <li>When I received it in the mail, i love the coconut smell to it.</li>
            <li>Love  this.</li>
            <li>Bought this, love it.</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re going to use coconut be sure it&#x27;s organic and Unrefined, like this one.</li>
            <li>It might be more then a year to use just one of the jars i ordered.</li>
            <li>This is the best stuff for skin-leaves it soft and silky smooth.  </li>
            <li>There are better coconut oils on the market, and this one liquefies almost immediately upon contact with skin.&lt;br /&gt;Waste of money to me.</li>
            <li>I use it all over, but love it on my face before hitting the bed at night.  </li>
            <li>i love it</li>
            <li>and I am in love.  </li>
            <li>Love this stuff I put on my face my body my hair</li>
            <li>I love this stuff.</li>
            <li>it literally MELTS on your finger :)</li>

            <li>I LOVE this stuff.  </li>
            <li>It has become better for the hair with no split ends.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this one over all others.</li>
            <li>just love this product...</li>
            <li>I personally love the product and will continue to use it.</li>
            <li>In just a couple of weeks, my feet look and feel so much better.</li>
            <li>This is excellent quality and lasts a long time</li>
            <li>it feels awesome going on the skin - but is harder to get out of the jar if refrigerated.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;I would definitely recommend this to everybody that wants a GREAT product, great VALUE for your money, and a versatile  product!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Buy it....</li>
            <li>It smells really good and was reasonably priced so as soon as I run out</li>
            <li>The oil is easy to apply.</li>
            <li>easily came off..</li>
            <li>it smells AMAZING and AUTHENTIC (just like real coconut)!!!&lt;br /&gt;2)</li>
            <li>did I say that it smells AMAZING and AUTHENTIC (just like real coconut)!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It came quickly, it is easy to go on the skin, hair or for any purpose you would like.  </li>
            <li>Kudos to the manufacturer For bringing us a natural product That is amazing!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m loyal to this oil over all others!</li>
            <li>It smells FANTASTIC - if kept in the refrig</li>
            <li>SInce I started using this product my skin is always smooth and blemish free.  </li>
            <li>you don&#x27;t even need to spray yourself with chemically filled perfume after.  </li>
            <li>I can even put a light coating on my face, And I have oily skin already</li>
            <li>I never leave reviews but this is such a great product that i had to.</li>
            <li>It is not too greasy and spreads so smoothly.</li>
            <li>But give it a stir, it does melt fast, in your hands or in a warm room.  </li>
            <li>This coconut oil is a great scalp treatment for my boyfriend&#x27;s dermatitis and has battled my acne (chest, back and face).</li>
            <li>but so far so good.  </li>
            <li>Ok, this product is seriously the best skin care product I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li>Ancient knowledge in a modern world to stay &amp; feel young &amp; beautiful.</li>
            <li>I will be back for more! :-)</li>
            <li>excited about that)&lt;br</li>
            <li>It has a very light, subtle and refreshing scent--I cannot get over how great it smells.  </li>
            <li>It made my hair soft and I&#x27;m in love with this product!</li>
            <li>I have also applied it to my Face, made it Nice and Soft...</li>
            <li>Coconut Oil is a Good Addition to my Physical Activity Exercise and Weight Loss Programs.</li>
            <li>The company was steadfast on contacting me to make this issue right.  </li>
            <li>Thank you Ah Shayh for your professionalism and taking your customer&#x27;s experience serious enought with GREAT understanding and wanting your brand&#x27;s name to reflect the quality you strive to exemplify!</li>
            <li>it absorbs quickly.</li>
            <li>currently pregnant</li>
            <li>It is is a slightly acidic oil, I think around 4 on the pH scale, so it&#x27;s great for your skin and hair.  </li>
            <li>At first I wasn&#x27;t sure because it smells like real coconut</li>
            <li>It was extremely HOT!  </li>
            <li>The only problem (if you even want to call it a problem) is that you need to have a towel of some kind underneath the jar.</li>
            <li>My problem has always been finding a lotion that is actually completely absorbed by the skin...</li>
            <li>I never used Coconut Oil of any kind, I like Coconut but not a Big Fan</li>
            <li>It is incredibly versatile and has replaced many of my bathroom products and a little goes a LONG way</li>
            <li>It came right on time.</li>
            <li>I applaud their persistent customer service follow through to ensure my experience with their product is a positive one!  </li>
            <li>That aside, this particular Ah Shayh coconut oil is fantastic.  </li>
            <li>my skin looks less tires more healthy</li>
            <li>It works great for both of us because my baby and I have sensitive and dry skin.</li>
            <li>It has just one simple ingredient, which makes me feel much better while being pregnant.</li>
            <li>I am pregnant and have been looking for a pure organic coconut oil that came in a glass jar.  </li>
            <li>Makes it very soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Coconut Oil is a Natural Energy Source, it contains High levels of Healthy type of</li>
            <li>If this company would sell for cheaper price I would be the first one to buy.</li>
            <li>and I wished I had looked more thoroughly at local places because after this purchase I found some for a lot cheaper.</li>
            <li>The container does not say you need to refrigerate it - but DO NOT keep in a hot place - it liquifies.    </li>
            <li>IT DOES EXACTLY</li>
            <li>but this is my absolute fav!  </li>
            <li>I am a professional makeup artist and feel comfortable using it on my clients.</li>
            <li>It was exactly as advertised.  </li>
            <li>; this is part of the reason why I purchased this coconut oil in the first place.</li>
            <li>I was in total doubt that the company would do much more</li>
            <li>As presented- Thanks!</li>
            <li>Thats because the first batch was in the summer.</li>
            <li>I have used many different coconut oil products.</li>
            <li>After some time, I researched other methods and came across Ah Shayh and their amazing Coconut Oil (and Shea Butter).</li>
            <li>Fat called MCTs \\&quot;Medium Chain Triglycerides\\&quot; Pure Form of Coconut Oil, MCTs are different from other Fats primarily because they are digested much more easily and efficiently.</li>
            <li>I love this stuff i use for my really long hair and skin</li>
            <li>The jar that it comes in is a decent size and will probably last me more than a year.</li>
            <li>The organic oil keeps me hair so soft and healthy with only a tiny amount, I absolutely love it.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this to any one, but especially to people who are pregnant or have sensitive skin, it&#x27;s truly a lovely non-toxic alternative to lotion.  </li>
            <li>Made my hair super soft and shiny.</li>
            <li>So it is perhaps pure organic as it states.</li>
            <li>Pure, radiant skin!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>For rough, dry, cracked feet, it works great.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s solid at room temperature but melts in your hand, Smooths on really easy, And even though it&#x27;s an oil it absorbs into your skin really fast.</li>
            <li>/&gt;But most importantly, when I had purchased my first jar from Ah Shayh, the USPS delivery guy must have totally mishandled it because despite their careful packaging the jar was SHATTERED.</li>
            <li>Really appreciate this product coming in a glass jar.</li>
            <li>beside the moisture it puts back into the skin - it helped to keep my scar light in color.    </li>
            <li>This one is also much smoother.</li>
            <li>I really like the way this absorbs into hair and skin.  </li>
            <li>It worked very well but does not take the issue away.</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s what really sold me on this product...</li>
            <li>The odor and texture are very pleasing.</li>
            <li>Use it straight</li>
            <li>a little goes a long way my hair looks great</li>
            <li>This makes them an extremely efficient Energy Source much more than Sugar.</li>
            <li>For me works best to smooth out some of the other lotions I use that lack a little lubricity, goes on smooth leaves skin texture with a richness even in those tough cracked areas.</li>
            <li>My skin has never been so soft and it&#x27;s the first moisturizer I&#x27;ve used that doesn&#x27;t break me out.</li>
            <li>: Use it as a Moisturizer Lotion, Place Jar in warm water to Liquefy, Massage small amounts onto the Skin&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I definitely think its alot better than doing oil treatments in the salon or using daily conditioners.</li>
            <li>HIGHLY RECOMMEND -</li>
            <li>have been meaning to leave a rave review, but have been very busy</li>
            <li>This product its&#x27; very soft</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a very natural smell that is almost addicting.  </li>
            <li>so not sure if there are any better ones out there</li>
            <li>I intend to reuse it for my next coconut oil purchase because my hand fits much better in this glass jar than my other brand</li>
            <li>In my original rating I gave this product a one star due to the state of the product being liquefied upon receipt.  </li>
            <li>Clearly, it did not.  </li>
            <li>but it makes my skin feel soft.</li>
            <li>Recommend for soft faces and hands.</li>
            <li>Your skin just feels soft, It doesn&#x27;t feel all goopy and coated like lotion, And</li>
            <li>I like that it&#x27;s all natural</li>
            <li>I wanted to use natural options and this has worked out well for me.</li>
            <li>so if your naturally oily, it may not work for you.</li>
            <li>my skin is soft</li>
            <li>Leaves skin silky soft.</li>
            <li>I like natural remedies and products for my hair.</li>
            <li>, I was surprised to see that \\&quot;Organic Unrefined Virgin Coconut</li>
            <li>Keeps my natural hair soft and smoothe.  </li>
            <li>Would recommend this item to anyone with natural hair.</li>
            <li>Compare to Pure Unrefined Shea butter, this did not work well for my dry skin.</li>
            <li>Try a small amount first then buy a large jar.</li>
            <li>- I&#x27;m a biochem major</li>
            <li>That would have been a real mess to clean up.</li>
            <li>I apply the oil to my face several times per week and have noticed that it helps clear away blemishes.</li>
            <li>Well, it was messy, but now my skin is back to it&#x27;s glowing radiant smooth self about a month later.</li>
            <li>Feels a little oily at first, but give it time to soak in</li>
            <li>It is hard in cool weather.</li>
            <li>Has a very smooth texture, hard to explain but noticeably different than other products.</li>
            <li>I have really curly hair and a mixed skin complexion and this product is extremely versatile for my needs.  </li>
            <li>i would gently massage the coconut oil into my at the time oversized glands on my neck and it helped the swelling go down.  </li>
            <li>than have me return it for a partial refund, however Ah Shayh responded within 24 hours and had a new jar shipped out and on my doorstep within the week.</li>
            <li>It did not hydrate my skin, it did not leave it &amp;#34;soft and smooth&amp;#34;, it was not long lasting.  </li>
            <li>This is one of the few pure, virgin, unrefined coconut oils out there that come in a GLASS jar.</li>
            <li>and I can&#x27;t live without it.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s moisturizing but not too sticky like the other tummy</li>
    </ol>

            <li> Really good addition for a skin rubber to have in their massage tool chest.  </li>
            <li> It smells great on top of everything.  </li>
            <li> This product smells good and feels amazing on my skin.</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with this product.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff and the smell is very nice.</li>
            <li> IT was absolutely FANTASTIC!!  </li>
            <li> You will love!</li>
            <li> Love it!</li>
            <li> it smells AMAZING...</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a light oil, so it is great for moisturizing, even your face.  </li>
            <li> I love coconut oil, this is good quality however it was overpriced</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really nice.  </li>
            <li> I think the jar is good but the top of it may not be.  </li>
            <li> I would apply at bedtime and as the sun rose my skin would be thirsty for hydration.  </li>
            <li> Use it as a Conditioner, Place Jar in warm water to Liquefy, then apply 2 teaspoons to the Hair 1 to 2 Hours before Washing&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Ive used alot of natural products and this is honestly the best Coconut oil I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li> It delivered fine, smells good.</li>
            <li> The price is suitable for the quality of this product...</li>
            <li> I wonder if this brand has some kind of magic maybe.</li>
            <li> ok ok ok ok!</li>
            <li> It was vibrant and a beautiful hue.  </li>
            <li> I mostly use this for my skin.</li>
            <li> I also cook with the Coconut Oil and love how it accents my food.  </li>
            <li> ENJOY!</li>
            <li> When I received it in the mail, i love the coconut smell to it.</li>
            <li> Love  this.</li>
            <li> Bought this, love it.</li>
            <li> I love this product.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re going to use coconut be sure it&#x27;s organic and Unrefined, like this one.</li>
            <li> It might be more then a year to use just one of the jars i ordered.</li>
            <li> This is the best stuff for skin-leaves it soft and silky smooth.  </li>
            <li> There are better coconut oils on the market, and this one liquefies almost immediately upon contact with skin.&lt;br /&gt;Waste of money to me.</li>
            <li> I use it all over, but love it on my face before hitting the bed at night.  </li>
            <li> i love it</li>
            <li> and I am in love.  </li>
            <li> Love this stuff I put on my face my body my hair</li>
            <li> I love this stuff.</li>
            <li> it literally MELTS on your finger :)</li>
            <li> buy it NOW :)</li>
            <li> I really love this product.  </li>
            <li> I LOVE this stuff.  </li>
            <li> It has become better for the hair with no split ends.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this one over all others.</li>
            <li> just love this product...</li>
            <li> I personally love the product and will continue to use it.</li>
            <li> In just a couple of weeks, my feet look and feel so much better.</li>
            <li> This is excellent quality and lasts a long time</li>
            <li> it feels awesome going on the skin - but is harder to get out of the jar if refrigerated.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;I would definitely recommend this to everybody that wants a GREAT product, great VALUE for your money, and a versatile  product!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Buy it....</li>
            <li> It smells really good and was reasonably priced so as soon as I run out</li>
            <li> The oil is easy to apply.</li>
            <li> easily came off..</li>
            <li> it smells AMAZING and AUTHENTIC (just like real coconut)!!!&lt;br /&gt;2)</li>
            <li> did I say that it smells AMAZING and AUTHENTIC (just like real coconut)!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It came quickly, it is easy to go on the skin, hair or for any purpose you would like.  </li>
            <li> Kudos to the manufacturer For bringing us a natural product That is amazing!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m loyal to this oil over all others!</li>
            <li> It smells FANTASTIC - if kept in the refrig</li>
            <li> SInce I started using this product my skin is always smooth and blemish free.  </li>
            <li> you don&#x27;t even need to spray yourself with chemically filled perfume after.  </li>
            <li> I can even put a light coating on my face, And I have oily skin already</li>
            <li> I never leave reviews but this is such a great product that i had to.</li>
            <li> It is not too greasy and spreads so smoothly.</li>
            <li> But give it a stir, it does melt fast, in your hands or in a warm room.  </li>
            <li> This coconut oil is a great scalp treatment for my boyfriend&#x27;s dermatitis and has battled my acne (chest, back and face).</li>
            <li> but so far so good.  </li>
            <li> Ok, this product is seriously the best skin care product I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> Ancient knowledge in a modern world to stay &amp; feel young &amp; beautiful.</li>
            <li> I will be back for more! :-)</li>
            <li> excited about that)&lt;br</li>
            <li> It has a very light, subtle and refreshing scent--I cannot get over how great it smells.  </li>
            <li> It made my hair soft and I&#x27;m in love with this product!</li>
            <li> I have also applied it to my Face, made it Nice and Soft...</li>
            <li> Coconut Oil is a Good Addition to my Physical Activity Exercise and Weight Loss Programs.</li>
            <li> The company was steadfast on contacting me to make this issue right.  </li>
            <li> Thank you Ah Shayh for your professionalism and taking your customer&#x27;s experience serious enought with GREAT understanding and wanting your brand&#x27;s name to reflect the quality you strive to exemplify!</li>
            <li> it absorbs quickly.</li>
            <li> currently pregnant</li>
            <li> It is is a slightly acidic oil, I think around 4 on the pH scale, so it&#x27;s great for your skin and hair.  </li>
            <li> At first I wasn&#x27;t sure because it smells like real coconut</li>
            <li> It was extremely HOT!  </li>
            <li> The only problem (if you even want to call it a problem) is that you need to have a towel of some kind underneath the jar.</li>
            <li> My problem has always been finding a lotion that is actually completely absorbed by the skin...</li>
            <li> I never used Coconut Oil of any kind, I like Coconut but not a Big Fan</li>
            <li> It is incredibly versatile and has replaced many of my bathroom products and a little goes a LONG way</li>
            <li> It came right on time.</li>
            <li> I applaud their persistent customer service follow through to ensure my experience with their product is a positive one!  </li>
            <li> That aside, this particular Ah Shayh coconut oil is fantastic.  </li>
            <li> my skin looks less tires more healthy</li>
            <li> It works great for both of us because my baby and I have sensitive and dry skin.</li>
            <li> It has just one simple ingredient, which makes me feel much better while being pregnant.</li>
            <li> I am pregnant and have been looking for a pure organic coconut oil that came in a glass jar.  </li>
            <li> Makes it very soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Coconut Oil is a Natural Energy Source, it contains High levels of Healthy type of</li>
            <li> If this company would sell for cheaper price I would be the first one to buy.</li>
            <li> and I wished I had looked more thoroughly at local places because after this purchase I found some for a lot cheaper.</li>
            <li> The container does not say you need to refrigerate it - but DO NOT keep in a hot place - it liquifies.    </li>
            <li> IT DOES EXACTLY</li>
            <li> but this is my absolute fav!  </li>
            <li> I am a professional makeup artist and feel comfortable using it on my clients.</li>
            <li> It was exactly as advertised.  </li>
            <li> ; this is part of the reason why I purchased this coconut oil in the first place.</li>
            <li> I was in total doubt that the company would do much more</li>
            <li> As presented- Thanks!</li>
            <li> Thats because the first batch was in the summer.</li>
            <li> I have used many different coconut oil products.</li>
            <li> After some time, I researched other methods and came across Ah Shayh and their amazing Coconut Oil (and Shea Butter).</li>
            <li> Fat called MCTs \\&quot;Medium Chain Triglycerides\\&quot; Pure Form of Coconut Oil, MCTs are different from other Fats primarily because they are digested much more easily and efficiently.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff i use for my really long hair and skin</li>
            <li> The jar that it comes in is a decent size and will probably last me more than a year.</li>
            <li> The organic oil keeps me hair so soft and healthy with only a tiny amount, I absolutely love it.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this to any one, but especially to people who are pregnant or have sensitive skin, it&#x27;s truly a lovely non-toxic alternative to lotion.  </li>
            <li> Made my hair super soft and shiny.</li>
            <li> So it is perhaps pure organic as it states.</li>
            <li> Pure, radiant skin!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> For rough, dry, cracked feet, it works great.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s solid at room temperature but melts in your hand, Smooths on really easy, And even though it&#x27;s an oil it absorbs into your skin really fast.</li>
            <li> /&gt;But most importantly, when I had purchased my first jar from Ah Shayh, the USPS delivery guy must have totally mishandled it because despite their careful packaging the jar was SHATTERED.</li>
            <li> Really appreciate this product coming in a glass jar.</li>
            <li> beside the moisture it puts back into the skin - it helped to keep my scar light in color.    </li>
            <li> This one is also much smoother.</li>
            <li> I really like the way this absorbs into hair and skin.  </li>
            <li> It worked very well but does not take the issue away.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s what really sold me on this product...</li>
            <li> The odor and texture are very pleasing.</li>
            <li> Use it straight</li>
            <li> a little goes a long way my hair looks great</li>
            <li> This makes them an extremely efficient Energy Source much more than Sugar.</li>
            <li> For me works best to smooth out some of the other lotions I use that lack a little lubricity, goes on smooth leaves skin texture with a richness even in those tough cracked areas.</li>
            <li> My skin has never been so soft and it&#x27;s the first moisturizer I&#x27;ve used that doesn&#x27;t break me out.</li>
            <li> : Use it as a Moisturizer Lotion, Place Jar in warm water to Liquefy, Massage small amounts onto the Skin&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I definitely think its alot better than doing oil treatments in the salon or using daily conditioners.</li>
            <li> HIGHLY RECOMMEND -</li>
            <li> have been meaning to leave a rave review, but have been very busy</li>
            <li> This product its&#x27; very soft</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a very natural smell that is almost addicting.  </li>
            <li> so not sure if there are any better ones out there</li>
            <li> I intend to reuse it for my next coconut oil purchase because my hand fits much better in this glass jar than my other brand</li>
            <li> In my original rating I gave this product a one star due to the state of the product being liquefied upon receipt.  </li>
            <li> Clearly, it did not.  </li>
            <li> but it makes my skin feel soft.</li>
            <li> Recommend for soft faces and hands.</li>
            <li> Your skin just feels soft, It doesn&#x27;t feel all goopy and coated like lotion, And</li>
            <li> I like that it&#x27;s all natural</li>
            <li> I wanted to use natural options and this has worked out well for me.</li>
            <li> so if your naturally oily, it may not work for you.</li>
            <li> my skin is soft</li>
            <li> Leaves skin silky soft.</li>
            <li> I like natural remedies and products for my hair.</li>
            <li> , I was surprised to see that \\&quot;Organic Unrefined Virgin Coconut</li>
            <li> Keeps my natural hair soft and smoothe.  </li>
            <li> Would recommend this item to anyone with natural hair.</li>
            <li> Compare to Pure Unrefined Shea butter, this did not work well for my dry skin.</li>
            <li> Try a small amount first then buy a large jar.</li>
            <li> - I&#x27;m a biochem major</li>
            <li> That would have been a real mess to clean up.</li>
            <li> I apply the oil to my face several times per week and have noticed that it helps clear away blemishes.</li>
            <li> Well, it was messy, but now my skin is back to it&#x27;s glowing radiant smooth self about a month later.</li>
            <li> Feels a little oily at first, but give it time to soak in</li>
            <li> It is hard in cool weather.</li>
            <li> Has a very smooth texture, hard to explain but noticeably different than other products.</li>
            <li> I have really curly hair and a mixed skin complexion and this product is extremely versatile for my needs.  </li>
            <li> i would gently massage the coconut oil into my at the time oversized glands on my neck and it helped the swelling go down.  </li>
            <li> than have me return it for a partial refund, however Ah Shayh responded within 24 hours and had a new jar shipped out and on my doorstep within the week.</li>
            <li> It did not hydrate my skin, it did not leave it &amp;#34;soft and smooth&amp;#34;, it was not long lasting.  </li>
            <li> This is one of the few pure, virgin, unrefined coconut oils out there that come in a GLASS jar.</li>
            <li> and I can&#x27;t live without it.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s moisturizing but not too sticky like the other tummy</li>
            <li> It just melts into your skin unlike any other coconut oil I&#x27;ve tried and leaves my skin so soft.  </li>
            <li> thing is that when I received it, felt like some of the product seeped out (though not by much),  so not entirely clean and dry upon arrival.  </li>
            <li> the texture is hard at first and as soon as you press your finger on it</li>
            <li> I live in the wilderness where we are having a heavy drought.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had problems with dry skin/eczema my entire life.</li>
            <li> I ordered this oil for different skin issues, one being dry skin.</li>
            <li> My hair is long but brittle and dry because of the constant use of my flat iron and blow dryer, after using it</li>
            <li> Then I had stayed out in the sun too long and burned.</li>
            <li> It stays moisturized for a long time though.</li>
            <li> In all fairness I have mixed it with other ingredience for hair care without washing with water.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used this very long</li>
            <li> Also, I have dry skin</li>
            <li> Immediately after I apply it, my skin become dry in five minutes.</li>
            <li> Took a little getting use to, only because it was harder than what I had expected.  </li>
            <li> I actually had to transfer it to a mason jar because it was just being wasted by everywhere but myself.  </li>
            <li> but it is harder to use.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical at first about placing this product on my face as I have read reviews that coconut oil causes breakouts, but I soon realized that these people were just having a skin \\&quot;detox\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> This was due to the Las Vegas weather conditions.  </li>
            <li> Use it in Place of Butter, Margarine, Shortening or other Cooking Oils for Baking and Frying in Temperatures up to 350F</li>
            <li> Also MCTs don&#x27;t add to Fat Cells or form Artery Hardening Plaque as readily as other Fats.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;ve always worked immediately, but after a few hours leave me just as dry as I was before applying the product.</li>
            <li> I would apply after shower and within a few hours my skin was dry and scaly.  </li>
            <li> The cap can&#x27;t be closed tightly...</li>
            <li> For that same reason I hardly use skin products even though I should.</li>
            <li> (I use this everyday multiple times a day and have had the same jar for approximately 3 months).</li>
            <li> Oil\\&quot; comes congealed into a White Thick Paste with the aroma of Coconut.</li>
            <li> My cats refuse to eat sub-standard coconut oil, but they gobbled this brand down.  </li>
            <li> I mean it&#x27;s the second brand I buy</li>
            <li> and it was just a mess.  </li>
            <li> I will try it on my hair because half jar may go wasted.</li>
            <li> A little goes along way</li>
            <li> and it is pale in comparison.  </li>
            <li> and I only have to reapply after showering or long spells in cold weather.  </li>
            <li> I wash with raw honey and then put a fingernail sized amount of this virgin coconut oil on while my skin is still damp.</li>
            <li> or I started to mix 2 parts raw shea butter with one part coconut oil and whip it.</li>
            <li> Melt small amount the microwave.</li>
            <li> It also supposedly has anti-microbial properties, but I&#x27;m not sure how proven that is.  </li>
            <li> I read a review about how its very messy and the oil goes everywhere…</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s serious customer</li>
            <li> AND i recently was hospitalized for a bad case of tonsillitis...</li>
            <li> I mean, I look like I&#x27;m 14 again!</li>
            <li> I mean!</li>
            <li> But it does mean the quality of this product is questionable.</li>
            <li> oh and was the least expensive here on amazon!  </li>
            <li> And I&#x27;m used to the fake coconut smell, but after using it I&#x27;m hooked.</li>
            <li> It is on the expensive side for Organic unrefined Virgin Coconut oil.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m addicted to it!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve failed badly.</li>
            <li> Well, I was wrong!</li>
            <li> I was very skeptical about purchasing the organic coconut oil.</li>
            <li> I use it as an shave, aftershave, after shower care product, sunscreen, deodorant base, frizz tamer as well as an oil to mix in with my heavier DIY lotions at home.</li>
            <li> You won&#x27;t be disappointed!</li>
            <li> This was the worst coconut oil that I have purchased.  </li>
            <li> My feet were in the worst shape till I tried the Organic Unrefined Virgin Coconut Oil.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Excellent product for hair &amp; all your skin needs. Ancient knowledge in a modern world to stay &amp; feel young &amp; beautiful.</li>
            <li> I did put coconut oil on my hair for 2 hours.It made my hair silky. It is not greasy and no smell. Excellent product. I won&#x27;t buy from this company ONLY because of price. I am going to buy 8 L for cheaper price  from different company so I can use intensively and  hair and for cooking. If this company would sell for cheaper price I would be the first one to buy.</li>
            <li> I mostly use this for my skin. I put it on my face, neck, everywhere... it absorbs quickly. My dog loves this, too!!</li>
            <li> I love coconut oil, this is good quality however it was overpriced and I wished I had looked more thoroughly at local places because after this purchase I found some for a lot cheaper.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used this very long but it makes my skin feel soft. Recommend for soft faces and hands. Really appreciate this product coming in a glass jar.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had problems with dry skin/eczema my entire life. I&#x27;ve used every \\&quot;top\\&quot; moisturizing cream. They&#x27;ve always worked immediately, but after a few hours leave me just as dry as I was before applying the product. After some time, I researched other methods and came across Ah Shayh and their amazing Coconut Oil (and Shea Butter). Ah Shayh&#x27;s products keep me moisturized ALL day and I only have to reapply after showering or long spells in cold weather.  I also cook with the Coconut Oil and love how it accents my food.  ENJOY!</li>
            <li> When I received it in the mail, i love the coconut smell to it. it just smells like it just been cracked opened. I used it as a lotion and for my hair. My hair is long but brittle and dry because of the constant use of my flat iron and blow dryer, after using it I felt a big difference in the softness it made my hair feel. I leave it on for 30mins-1Hr and wash it off aftwards, twice a week. I definitely think its alot better than doing oil treatments in the salon or using daily conditioners.</li>
            <li> Love  this.Stuff. Made my hair super soft and shiny. Use about twice a week. Melt small amount the microwave. Comb through hair and let it sit for about an hour. Shampoo out.</li>
            <li> I was very skeptical about purchasing the organic coconut oil. The claims that are made just seemed so unreal.  I had recent abdominal surgery and I began using it on my scar - FANTASTIC!!!  IT was absolutely FANTASTIC!!  beside the moisture it puts back into the skin - it helped to keep my scar light in color.    Then I had stayed out in the sun too long and burned. I had read to put organic virgin coconut oil on a sunburn.  I thought well I will give it a try since it was in my cabinet!  From the minute I put the coconut oil on - the burning tightness of a sunburn went away.  Now please note that you do have to reapply later - its not a one time fix for a sunburn.  But I will say that I never blistered or peeled and my skin was the color of a tomato.  I probably had every bit of 2nd degree sunburn - maybe bordering 3rd degree.    It smells FANTASTIC - if kept in the refrig it feels awesome going on the skin - but is harder to get out of the jar if refrigerated.  The container does not say you need to refrigerate it - but DO NOT keep in a hot place - it liquifies.    HIGHLY RECOMMEND - IT DOES EXACTLY WHAT THEY SAY IT DOES oh and was the least expensive here on amazon!  I am ordering more!!</li>
            <li> Great Quality. Would like larger size for same size. Went to Costco after purchase on line and saw larger size cheaper, but I don&#x27;t know about the costco quality.</li>
            <li> Bought this, love it. Great product...love the coconut smell and sheen it gave my hair. A little goes along way...will recommend anyone to purchase this product.</li>
            <li> I was impressed.  It was vibrant and a beautiful hue.  My cats refuse to eat sub-standard coconut oil, but they gobbled this brand down.  I bought a different brand this last time and it is pale in comparison.  This one is also much smoother.</li>
            <li> I love this product. I no longer use lotion to mosturize. Im running low on my current batch &amp; is about to order another one. Great smell .&lt;br /&gt;Does this product have a shelf life???</li>
            <li> I have used a variety of coconut oils but this is my absolute fav!  I have really curly hair and a mixed skin complexion and this product is extremely versatile for my needs.  I apply Ah Shayh Coconut oil to my skin as my daily lotion and to my hair nightly.  SInce I started using this product my skin is always smooth and blemish free.  I&#x27;ve used it on a burn from cooking, on cuts AND i recently was hospitalized for a bad case of tonsillitis... i would gently massage the coconut oil into my at the time oversized glands on my neck and it helped the swelling go down.  The price is suitable for the quality of this product...it is unrefined virgin coconut oil.. and TRUST ME it smells AMAZING... you don&#x27;t even need to spray yourself with chemically filled perfume after.  You will love!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll never use regular lotion again. At first I wasn&#x27;t sure because it smells like real coconut And I&#x27;m used to the fake coconut smell, but after using it I&#x27;m hooked. It&#x27;s solid at room temperature but melts in your hand, Smooths on really easy, And even though it&#x27;s an oil it absorbs into your skin really fast. Your skin just feels soft, It doesn&#x27;t feel all goopy and coated like lotion, And I like that it&#x27;s all natural and I don&#x27;t have to worry about chemicals on my skin. If you&#x27;re going to use coconut be sure it&#x27;s organic and Unrefined, like this one. I also like that it comes in a glass jar instead of plastic. If you want you can microwave it for 20 seconds and put it on as an oil. It will actually stay melted for about a day. This stuff is just awesome. I&#x27;ll never use anything else. Even my son and husband use it, As it does not smell all girly. I can even put a light coating on my face, And I have oily skin already And it&#x27;s just great. Kudos to the manufacturer For bringing us a natural product That is amazing!</li>
            <li> great product moisturizes skin nicely and smells great. It works great as a suntan lotion also. I would definitely recommend</li>
            <li> It might be more then a year to use just one of the jars i ordered. My skin has never been so soft and it&#x27;s the first moisturizer I&#x27;ve used that doesn&#x27;t break me out.</li>
            <li> I really like the way this absorbs into hair and skin.  It smells amazing and is a great barrier at night during diaper changes to prevent diaper rash.  I wanted to use natural options and this has worked out well for me.</li>
            <li> I never leave reviews but this is such a great product that i had to. Ive used alot of natural products and this is honestly the best Coconut oil I&#x27;ve ever used. I use it all over my body and face.It is not too greasy and spreads so smoothly. I am a professional makeup artist and feel comfortable using it on my clients. Everyone I use it on always asks about it. Truly a great value and product.</li>
            <li> I bought this after watching a YouTube video of a girl who swore by it. I do like this product &amp; use it on my skin. Although this product can be used on skin during day as it is an oil. Also, I have dry skin so if your naturally oily, it may not work for you. It seems this one jar will last me forever too based on how I use it...</li>
            <li> This is the best stuff for skin-leaves it soft and silky smooth.  I have recommended it to everyone I know.</li>
            <li> I ordered this oil for different skin issues, one being dry skin. This stuff is awesome . I am totally hooked and so is my teenage daughter.</li>
            <li> I loved this product.  It was exactly as advertised.  I will order it again after I&#x27;ve used it all.  The only problem (if you even want to call it a problem) is that you need to have a towel of some kind underneath the jar. I had several drips going on when I applied it and almost spilled it once.  That would have been a real mess to clean up.</li>
            <li> It is on the expensive side for Organic unrefined Virgin Coconut oil. I have some I bought from Wholefoods for cooking. I bought this product because I read the rent and raving good reviews. I wonder if this brand has some kind of magic maybe. I have eczema on my hand. I have tried Shea Butter before. It worked very well but does not take the issue away. It stays moisturized for a long time though. Compare to Pure Unrefined Shea butter, this did not work well for my dry skin. Immediately after I apply it, my skin become dry in five minutes. I apply it to hand, body. It irritates my skin. I have not tried it on my face and I don&#x27;t think so. I will try it on my hair because half jar may go wasted. It delivered fine, smells good. So it is perhaps pure organic as it states. I think it is only that Coconut oil is not for my skin. I maybe allergic to it. But it does mean the quality of this product is questionable. I vote for three stars because it did not work for me. Try a small amount first then buy a large jar. That is what I learned from this experience.</li>
            <li> My daughter bought this for me  because she uses it.  I use it to take off my eye makeup, as a moisturizer after my shower.  It&#x27;s really nice.  I bought some for my sister, when she got it in the mail, i was liquid.  Mine was solid, I don&#x27;t know if hers hardened or not.</li>
            <li> There are better coconut oils on the market, and this one liquefies almost immediately upon contact with skin.&lt;br /&gt;Waste of money to me.</li>
            <li> This is excellent quality and lasts a long time</li>
            <li> Took a little getting use to, only because it was harder than what I had expected.  But give it a stir, it does melt fast, in your hands or in a warm room.  Makes my skin feel amazing!!  I use it all over, but love it on my face before hitting the bed at night.  Feels a little oily at first, but give it time to soak in and it&#x27;s great.  I would recommend buying this product, espicially for the price!</li>
            <li> I love this stuff i use for my really long hair and skin a little goes a long way my hair looks great my skin is soft i even do a face wash with this about once a week my skin looks less tires more healthy i love it</li>
            <li> This saved me during my pregnancy. I used it every day to ward of any stretch marks and I drank lots of water. I believe this is the reason why I didn&#x27;t get any stretch marks, that and lots of water and keeping my weight in check. I love this stuff and the smell is very nice.</li>
            <li> This is the best!! Great conditioner for skin and hair. Can us daily after showers. Leaves skin silky soft. You won&#x27;t be disappointed!</li>
            <li> I am pregnant and have been looking for a pure organic coconut oil that came in a glass jar.  It was quite a search, but I found the Ah Shayh brand and I am in love.  It just melts into your skin unlike any other coconut oil I&#x27;ve tried and leaves my skin so soft.  I have been using it on my legs, my chest and my ever growing belly.  It smells great on top of everything.  I would highly recommend this to any one, but especially to people who are pregnant or have sensitive skin, it&#x27;s truly a lovely non-toxic alternative to lotion.  It has just one simple ingredient, which makes me feel much better while being pregnant.</li>
            <li> It made my hair soft and I&#x27;m in love with this product! It smells really good and was reasonably priced so as soon as I run out I will be back for more! :-)</li>
            <li> Love this stuff I put on my face my body my hair it&#x27;s good for everything. You can even eat 2 to 4 teaspoons about a day of it and its suppose to help you lose weight . This stuff is great for my fellow sisters of color it makes that already great chocolate skin tone look radiant and your skins becomes even more softer</li>
            <li> This oil smells like a coconut pastry. Every time I apply it, I start craving a coconut cookie or a coconut cake. The oil is easy to apply. The jar that it comes in is a decent size and will probably last me more than a year. I apply the oil to my face several times per week and have noticed that it helps clear away blemishes.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff. I use it on my face each night after I get out of the shower. And it smells delicious too!</li>
            <li> I think has helped cure my skin ailments; the flaking stays away while I use it.</li>
            <li> This is one of the few pure, virgin, unrefined coconut oils out there that come in a GLASS jar. Do research on what plastic can and will do to your products and health - I&#x27;m a biochem major and I did plenty of database research to realize I will never buy products that come in plastic jars again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been meaning to leave a rave review, but have been very busy; this is part of the reason why I purchased this coconut oil in the first place. It is incredibly versatile and has replaced many of my bathroom products and a little goes a LONG way (I use this everyday multiple times a day and have had the same jar for approximately 3 months). I use it as an shave, aftershave, after shower care product, sunscreen, deodorant base, frizz tamer as well as an oil to mix in with my heavier DIY lotions at home. This coconut oil is a great scalp treatment for my boyfriend&#x27;s dermatitis and has battled my acne (chest, back and face). I was skeptical at first about placing this product on my face as I have read reviews that coconut oil causes breakouts, but I soon realized that these people were just having a skin \\&quot;detox\\&quot;. I have never had acne in my 24 years and with a massive cystic breakout this winter, I was ready to suffer this \\&quot;detox\\&quot; - no matter how messy the healing crisis was. Well, it was messy, but now my skin is back to it&#x27;s glowing radiant smooth self about a month later. I wash with raw honey and then put a fingernail sized amount of this virgin coconut oil on while my skin is still damp. I mean, I look like I&#x27;m 14 again! Pure, radiant skin!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But most importantly, when I had purchased my first jar from Ah Shayh, the USPS delivery guy must have totally mishandled it because despite their careful packaging the jar was SHATTERED. I was in total doubt that the company would do much more than have me return it for a partial refund, however Ah Shayh responded within 24 hours and had a new jar shipped out and on my doorstep within the week. That&#x27;s what really sold me on this product... I mean! That&#x27;s serious customer service.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I definitely recommend and will be buying from them again &amp; again.</li>
            <li> I like this product.  I mean it&#x27;s the second brand I buy so not sure if there are any better ones out there but so far so good.  I read a review about how its very messy and the oil goes everywhere… and I thought it&#x27;s oil! and people just like to complain.  Well, I was wrong! This product its&#x27; very soft and it seems very good but i had it all over my clothes, my hands and it was just a mess.  I actually had to transfer it to a mason jar because it was just being wasted by everywhere but myself.  I think the jar is good but the top of it may not be.  Anyway, over all I like it.</li>
            <li> like the smell, but leak! The cap can&#x27;t be closed tightly... easily came off..</li>
            <li> I like natural remedies and products for my hair. I&#x27;ve wanted to try using coconut oil for a while now and when I found this one I was ecstatic. It came right on time. The organic oil keeps me hair so soft and healthy with only a tiny amount, I absolutely love it. I smell my hair now and I think of the ocean. Love it!</li>
            <li> I am giving one star because the one reason why I purchased this was to hydrate my skin.  Clearly, it did not.  Perhaps I received a dud from Ah Shayh; I hope so.  This was the worst coconut oil that I have purchased.  It did not hydrate my skin, it did not leave it &amp;#34;soft and smooth&amp;#34;, it was not long lasting.  I would apply after shower and within a few hours my skin was dry and scaly.  I would apply at bedtime and as the sun rose my skin would be thirsty for hydration.  The one upside, you ask? The jar.  I intend to reuse it for my next coconut oil purchase because my hand fits much better in this glass jar than my other brand (that is also in a glass jar).  Oh, I am Caucasian...perhaps this will help someone in regards to my skin type.</li>
            <li> Ok, this product is seriously the best skin care product I&#x27;ve used. My problem has always been finding a lotion that is actually completely absorbed by the skin...I&#x27;ve failed badly. For that same reason I hardly use skin products even though I should. This product is really great in EVERY way...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1) it smells AMAZING and AUTHENTIC (just like real coconut)!!!&lt;br /&gt;2) the texture is hard at first and as soon as you press your finger on it it literally MELTS on your finger :)&lt;br /&gt;3) it is reaaaaaaaly moisturizing and smells so good on your body.&lt;br /&gt;4) You can use it on your hair as well.&lt;br /&gt;5) You can also use it when cooking...(That I am still to try....excited about that)&lt;br /&gt;6) It has no alcohol (it&#x27;s literally 100% coconut oil) so you know it is great for you.&lt;br /&gt;7) and oh yeah...did I say that it smells AMAZING and AUTHENTIC (just like real coconut)!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would definitely recommend this to everybody that wants a GREAT product, great VALUE for your money, and a versatile  product!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Buy it....buy it NOW :)</li>
            <li> This product smells good and feels amazing on my skin. Makes it very soft and smooth. ok ok ok ok!</li>
            <li> In my original rating I gave this product a one star due to the state of the product being liquefied upon receipt.  This was due to the Las Vegas weather conditions.  It was extremely HOT!  The company was steadfast on contacting me to make this issue right.  I applaud their persistent customer service follow through to ensure my experience with their product is a positive one!  They sent me a replacement product that did not liquefy.  My rating has changed and I would suggest this product to friends and family with a five star rating.  Thank you Ah Shayh for your professionalism and taking your customer&#x27;s experience serious enought with GREAT understanding and wanting your brand&#x27;s name to reflect the quality you strive to exemplify!</li>
            <li> I really love this product.  It came quickly, it is easy to go on the skin, hair or for any purpose you would like.  Would def recommend to anyone!</li>
            <li> Was excellent. Only with they would ship to canada</li>
            <li> I never used Coconut Oil of any kind, I like Coconut but not a Big Fan, I was surprised to see that \\&quot;Organic Unrefined Virgin Coconut Oil\\&quot; comes congealed into a White Thick Paste with the aroma of Coconut. An Oil that is Good for just about Everything. One Tablespoon has 130 Calories, I have used it for Baking and Cooking instead of Butter with Excellent Results and the taste of Coconut is not that noticeable. I have also applied it to my Face, made it Nice and Soft...Next I want to try it on my Scalp, I want to see if it will Grow Thicker Hair...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Coconut Oil is Recommended as a Supplement, Take 1 Tablespoon 1 to 4 Times daily, maybe use it as a Spread or added to Salad Dressings and Smoothies&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;FOR COOKING: Use it in Place of Butter, Margarine, Shortening or other Cooking Oils for Baking and Frying in Temperatures up to 350F Degrees&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;FOR SKIN CARE: Use it as a Moisturizer Lotion, Place Jar in warm water to Liquefy, Massage small amounts onto the Skin&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;FOR HAIR CARE: Use it as a Conditioner, Place Jar in warm water to Liquefy, then apply 2 teaspoons to the Hair 1 to 2 Hours before Washing&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Coconut Oil is a Natural Energy Source, it contains High levels of Healthy type of Fat called MCTs \\&quot;Medium Chain Triglycerides\\&quot; Pure Form of Coconut Oil, MCTs are different from other Fats primarily because they are digested much more easily and efficiently. This makes them an extremely efficient Energy Source much more than Sugar. Also MCTs don&#x27;t add to Fat Cells or form Artery Hardening Plaque as readily as other Fats. Coconut Oil is a Good Addition to my Physical Activity Exercise and Weight Loss Programs. I like Extra Virgin Coconut Oil to the point that has become a Staple in my Kitchen! ...Thank You D.D.</li>
            <li> As presented- Thanks!</li>
            <li> I LOVE this stuff.  Let me start by simply talking about coconut oil in and of itself.  It&#x27;s a light oil, so it is great for moisturizing, even your face.  It is is a slightly acidic oil, I think around 4 on the pH scale, so it&#x27;s great for your skin and hair.  It also supposedly has anti-microbial properties, but I&#x27;m not sure how proven that is.  That aside, this particular Ah Shayh coconut oil is fantastic.  It has a very light, subtle and refreshing scent--I cannot get over how great it smells.  It&#x27;s a very natural smell that is almost addicting.  It makes me never want to put anything else on my skin, such as commercial lotions with tons of fragrances.  I use this stuff as a body moisturizer, hair conditioner, sun bathing oil, after sun lotion, etc.  I&#x27;m addicted to it!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried many brands of coconut oil and this is the best. The odor and texture are very pleasing. Use it straight or I started to mix 2 parts raw shea butter with one part coconut oil and whip it. Luxurious!</li>
            <li> In all fairness I have mixed it with other ingredience for hair care without washing with water. I live in the wilderness where we are having a heavy drought.&lt;br /&gt;I did this during the summer with food grade coconut oil. I have not washed my hair with water since July. It has become better for the hair with no split ends. It curls well and holds the curls. Now I can grow and keep it long.&lt;br /&gt;I have just started using this product. The coconut oil has blended well but it is harder to use. Thats because the first batch was in the summer. It is hard in cool weather.</li>
            <li> Good product.  No complaints.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Only thing is that when I received it, felt like some of the product seeped out (though not by much),  so not entirely clean and dry upon arrival.  Otherwise, no big deal.</li>
            <li> Really good addition for a skin rubber to have in their massage tool chest.  For me works best to smooth out some of the other lotions I use that lack a little lubricity, goes on smooth leaves skin texture with a richness even in those tough cracked areas. I am very pleased with this product.</li>
            <li> I have used many different coconut oil products. I use in my hair, and as body and face lotion. I absolutely love this one over all others. Has a very smooth texture, hard to explain but noticeably different than other products. I&#x27;ve bought for family and friends and they concur. I&#x27;m loyal to this oil over all others!</li>
            <li> Love this stuff!! Great product!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m on my 2nd jar already.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m currently pregnant and I can&#x27;t live without it.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s moisturizing but not too sticky like the other tummy butters.&lt;br /&gt;Smells wonderful and it&#x27;s great on my face too.&lt;br /&gt;I just love this product...</li>
            <li> This is my second time purchasing this product. I use it as a head to toe moisturizer and recently I have been using this on my baby. It works great for both of us because my baby and I have sensitive and dry skin. The coconut oil doesn&#x27;t stain clothing and does not make me feel greasy, it actually absorbs onto my skin. I personally love the product and will continue to use it. The downer is the added cost for the shipping and handling fee to Canada.</li>
            <li> Great product - never tried coconut oil before but I will definitely order again - received item on time</li>
            <li> For rough, dry, cracked feet, it works great. My feet were in the worst shape till I tried the Organic Unrefined Virgin Coconut Oil. In just a couple of weeks, my feet look and feel so much better. It works almost instantly. My son tried it and after 2 applications, he ordered one for himself.</li>
            <li> This is the best for hair care.  Keeps my natural hair soft and smoothe.  Would recommend this item to anyone with natural hair.</li>
    </ol>
