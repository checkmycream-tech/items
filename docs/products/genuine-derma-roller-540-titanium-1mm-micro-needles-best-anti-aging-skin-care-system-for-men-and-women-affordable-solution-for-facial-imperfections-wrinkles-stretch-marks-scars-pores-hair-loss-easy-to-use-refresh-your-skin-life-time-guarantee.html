            <li>I originally purchased it for stretch marks treatment</li>
            <li>Worth the money!</li>
            <li>This item not only is of great quality, craftsmanship and came very quickly, but the customer service (which was absolutely amazing) contributed to the experience overall.</li>
            <li>my eyebrows grow thicker and full.</li>
            <li>and I got the 1 mm, but the experience was not bad at all</li>
            <li>I got a derma roller from Fine Beauty a few weeks ago, and it works great.  </li>
            <li>Fast shipment and seems to be a good product so far.</li>
            <li>The roller is a high quality, very clean, and shipping was super quick.</li>
            <li>Good directions for keeping clean and ready for next use.</li>
            <li>Using this roller following up with hydraulic acid,  a retinol night cream and rose hip oil as a moisturizer.  </li>
            <li>Most of these rollers are delivered from manufacturers too far away to receive prompt service.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I went with the 1mm rather than one of the smaller ones that are available.  </li>
            <li>The Derma Roller arrived quickly after ordering from eFine and was exactly as advertised.  </li>
            <li>Super fast shipping!</li>
            <li>The item arrived quickly and was exactly as described.  </li>
            <li>The service is friendly and fast as well.</li>
            <li>About a month ago I received the genuine derma roller and began using it with my normal night cream.  </li>
            <li>The cream absorbs super fast into my skin.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product as a cost effective simple way to fight the signs of aging.</li>
            <li>it really works!  </li>
            <li>Could feel difference from first use.</li>
            <li>Packaging was consistent to ensure sterile product.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m hesitant to try it the first time</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had several friends use the derma roller and their skin looks phenomenal.  </li>
            <li>My first time using this type of devise.</li>
            <li>I do have to admit at first the derma roller</li>
            <li>Derma-rolling is pretty revolutionary, since it is an alternative to so many different kinds of skin care regimens.</li>
            <li>the different types of treatments, and while many say to start with a .50 mm.</li>
            <li>The science behind the roller makes wearing a clay mask that much more effective.</li>
            <li>dreaded &amp;#34;11&amp;#34; are a bit less prominent!</li>
            <li>Next day used it on my face and neck - really easy and convenient to use.</li>
            <li>I noticed the changes on my hips right away with new skin coming through.  </li>
            <li>This roller not only reduces the fine lines around my eyes but is smoothing out the skin area on my chin.</li>
            <li>I have been using a popular night time firming cream with little results.  </li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>Husband wants one too to see if it can help stimulate hair growth.  </li>
            <li>I used it last night and it did a fantastic job.  </li>
            <li>, I just did not roll over that area as much as was directed on the box, and eventually I got used to it.  </li>
            <li>Not only is my skin not dry, but my skin is looking more youthful.  </li>
            <li>Item is really high</li>
            <li>She promptly sent me a new one.</li>
            <li>Used in on my forehead first - the next day, skin looked a bit smoother!</li>
            <li>After only 2 uses, I&#x27;m seeing a very noticeable diminishing of sun damage and a couple of old chickenpox scars.</li>
            <li>It may take a while before I get wow results</li>
            <li>but so far it does all that it says it will do</li>
            <li>The item came fast and I will definitely recommend to friends and family.</li>
            <li>This morning my face feels so soft</li>
            <li>Pleasantly surprised by the entire experience from order to customer service quality.</li>
            <li>The roller is super simple to use, I apply some night cream and  roll  an x pattern over my trouble area&#x27;s.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m using this on face and scarring/ discoloration left by surgical tape near my hips from C-section last year.  </li>
            <li>My fine lines are disappearing, and small dark spots are fading away.  </li>

            <li> My fine lines are disappearing, and small dark spots are fading away.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve read a lot about using derma rollers to help with wrinkles not only on your face, but hands and legs as well, and the science behind it seems logical to me.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t recommend such a weak size.</li>
            <li> I can create an update on the status on that in a few weeks.  </li>
            <li> Use according to directions doing small areas at a time</li>
            <li> I am anxious to see the results!</li>
            <li> But seriously, check YouTube.</li>
            <li> I got my derma roller yesterday and use it the same night, I thought that it was going to be a painful experience because every one recommend to use the 0.5mm</li>
            <li> I received a roller weeks ago from another brand, and was unhappy due to a defect.</li>
            <li> was a little painful to use</li>
            <li> It does seem to improve the effectiveness of those expensive serums.</li>
            <li> The worst part is that the rollers often state they are &amp;#34;ad-ons&amp;#34; but when one goes to order one, that &amp;#34;ad on&amp;#34; badge often changes to a regular purchase.</li>

            <li> I have used this Roller and love it!  I received it from Lana Cole, and it has made huge change to my skin.  I do not need to moisturize as often as I used to.  Not only is my skin not dry, but my skin is looking more youthful.  My friends have been asking me if I been using Botox.  I would recommend the Genuine Derma Roller 540 Titanium to everyone.</li>
            <li> Nice! I love the packaging, shipping came fast and easy. Great customer service too! I would definitely purchase again. I use this before applying my hyaluronic acid serum and my face has gone through great improvement within just a couple of days. I had some fine lines appearing around the corners of my mouth, i just rolled them away. It may take a while before I get wow results but so far it does all that it says it will do</li>
            <li> Fast shipment and seems to be a good product so far. Thanks</li>
            <li> I love this derma roller! I used it once and my face already feels healthier, and younger. It runs smoothly and is virtually pain free. The item came fast and I will definitely recommend to friends and family.</li>
            <li> Get one....it really works!  After only 2 uses, I&#x27;m seeing a very noticeable diminishing of sun damage and a couple of old chickenpox scars.</li>
            <li> Excellent and honest seller and a smooth transaction. the Derma Roller is a wonderful product that I tried a couple of times and already feel some improvement in my skin. I totally recommend purchasing one from this seller and trying it out.</li>
            <li> This makes my skin feel great!  The roller doesn&#x27;t hurt at all.  It makes you feel like you had a mini massage. I hope to see results soon. I will continue to update.</li>
            <li> So happy with the quick delivery. The derma roller is light, easy to hold and use. Very happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li> The Derma Roller arrived quickly after ordering from eFine and was exactly as advertised.  I&#x27;ve read a lot about using derma rollers to help with wrinkles not only on your face, but hands and legs as well, and the science behind it seems logical to me.  I&#x27;m excited to see the results. I use the roller at night and follow up with a retinol night cream.  As others have stated, I&#x27;m glad I went with the 1mm size.  It&#x27;s not painful at all, and you can easily control the pressure as you roll.</li>
            <li> Already seeing my wrinkles on my face going away.  Going to start using on my legs to see if it works there also.  Husband wants one too to see if it can help stimulate hair growth.  Will keep you posted on legs and husband&#x27;s hair.</li>
            <li> Jury still out if it&#x27;s helping with the wrinkles.  Arrived perfectly on time though and item seems better made than one I previously ordered and broke after 6 months.</li>
            <li> Great purchase. The derma roller came wrapped up into a sealed pouch and a case. I originally purchased it for stretch marks treatment and I am really happy by this derma roller. Easy to use, will buy again from this company.</li>
            <li> Great seller and exciting product! Could feel difference from first use.</li>
            <li> Bought the 1mm thinking it might hurt since but didn&#x27;t hurt at all.  I&#x27;m using this on face and scarring/ discoloration left by surgical tape near my hips from C-section last year.  I noticed the changes on my hips right away with new skin coming through.  Yay!  I can wear a bikini soon:)</li>
            <li> Packaging was consistent to ensure sterile product. Good directions for keeping clean and ready for next use. Working my way up to deeper penetrations. See improvement just from a couple of uses.</li>
            <li> Easy to handle and use at home</li>
            <li> I got my derma roller yesterday and use it the same night, I thought that it was going to be a painful experience because every one recommend to use the 0.5mm and I got the 1 mm, but the experience was not bad at all just got  some tingling and my face turned red, but only last for about 2 hours. This morning my face feels so soft I can not stop touching it. I definitely going to keep using it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m hesitant to try it the first time but it actually works out well with me. It removes blemishes and I&#x27;m seeing better results as the day goes by. I definitely recommend this product. Cathy M.</li>
            <li> Quality of product exceeded my expectations and delivery was as scheduled!  I&#x27;ve had several friends use the derma roller and their skin looks phenomenal.  It can take several weeks to see results but you can feel and begin to see results within the 1st use.</li>
            <li> Love this product. It does what it says. It does take time getting use to it. The service is friendly and fast as well. I would order from this company again.</li>
            <li> Super fast shipping! Item is really high quality!&lt;br /&gt;I plan on using this for my face, body, and scalp. I will be purchasing more since I have a lot of surface area to cover!</li>
            <li> My wife said she loves it after the firist use</li>
            <li> Great packaging - safety sealed, nice case. Good quality, love the shape the shape/curve of the handle and the way it it made -fits my hand perfectly! Used in on my forehead first - the next day, skin looked a bit smoother! dreaded &amp;#34;11&amp;#34; are a bit less prominent! Next day used it on my face and neck - really easy and convenient to use. Put Vit C serum on after and my skin just soaked it up. I am so very pleased with this unit and looking forward to the ongoing results! F/u email was very nice as well!</li>
            <li> Begin to see results after 2 weeks of use on my neck</li>
            <li> Great tool for at home facials</li>
            <li> This derma roller is comfortable and easy to use. While the jury is still out on what it does for wrinkles, immediate results were seen on skin softness, and pores were noticeably smaller.</li>
            <li> Love the item, skin looks more rejuvenated. Would recommend.</li>
            <li> The item arrived quickly and was exactly as described.  Their Customer service is superb.  I used it last night and it did a fantastic job.  Use according to directions doing small areas at a time and it will take you about 15  min or so. This morning I noticed a visible difference in my skin.  I can&#x27;t believe it.  I have tried everything under the sun.  Using this roller following up with hydraulic acid,  a retinol night cream and rose hip oil as a moisturizer.  Wonderful!!</li>
            <li> My first time using this type of devise. It does seem to improve the effectiveness of those expensive serums. I am glad I purchased this.</li>
            <li> I am anxious to see the results!</li>
            <li> I have begun to get fine lines around my eyes and between my eyebrows.  I have been using a popular night time firming cream with little results.  About a month ago I received the genuine derma roller and began using it with my normal night cream.  The results were almost immediate, the fine lines began to diminish!  One of the ladies I work with noticed the results right away!! I was thrilled!!  My skin not only looks firmer, but feels firmer too.  The roller is super simple to use, I apply some night cream and  roll  an x pattern over my trouble area&#x27;s.  The cream absorbs super fast into my skin.  I do have to admit at first the derma roller was a little painful to use, I just did not roll over that area as much as was directed on the box, and eventually I got used to it.  This is now definitely part of my night time beauty regime.  I highly recommend this product as a cost effective simple way to fight the signs of aging.</li>
            <li> Perfect for your beauty care!</li>
            <li> this product has been one of the best things since push up bras it has made my life easier the price was good. i use it on my before putting on skin firming serum or my fat reducing products on my,belly. i  see results within a week. my eyebrows grow thicker and full. i love this beauty gadget</li>
            <li> Pleasantly surprised by the entire experience from order to customer service quality. The roller is a gem. Why? Most of these rollers are delivered from manufacturers too far away to receive prompt service. The worst part is that the rollers often state they are &amp;#34;ad-ons&amp;#34; but when one goes to order one, that &amp;#34;ad on&amp;#34; badge often changes to a regular purchase. This item not only is of great quality, craftsmanship and came very quickly, but the customer service (which was absolutely amazing) contributed to the experience overall. Regardless, this roller is fantastic. I received a roller weeks ago from another brand, and was unhappy due to a defect. Not the case here. Derma-rolling is pretty revolutionary, since it is an alternative to so many different kinds of skin care regimens. I suggest you look up on YouTube the different types of treatments, and while many say to start with a .50 mm. I don&#x27;t recommend such a weak size. Start with a 1.0 mm for effective results. 1.50mm is the one I plan to buy next from this seller. I also use this for minoxidil hair treatment. I can create an update on the status on that in a few weeks.  But seriously, check YouTube. This is a wonderful product that I highly recommend, and at a great price-point one cannot deny.  ​</li>
            <li> I received emails from this seller before I received the product, which never happens! I was so pleased.  The roller is a high quality, very clean, and shipping was super quick. Definitely buy this if you&#x27;re considering. Worth the money!</li>
            <li> I have been using this for 3 weeks and am starting to notice improvement. My skin feels healthy and has a glow to it that it never had before.</li>
            <li> I got a derma roller from Fine Beauty a few weeks ago, and it works great.  I&#x27;m glad I went with the 1mm rather than one of the smaller ones that are available.  It rolls smoothly, and doesn&#x27;t hurt when I use it.  I use it every three or four days, and my face already looks and feels healthier, and younger.  My fine lines are disappearing, and small dark spots are fading away.  I like this product a lot, and I also like this seller.</li>
            <li> I love love love this roller.  I have been using this for about a year. I left mine at a hotel when on vacation with my daughter in Italy. She promptly sent me a new one. This roller not only reduces the fine lines around my eyes but is smoothing out the skin area on my chin. I cleanse then roll then apply my creams. I feel the skin products are delivered more effectively than describes on the roller packaging by rolling first.</li>
            <li> Such a well made dermaroller. I love that it&#x27;s made with titanium. The science behind the roller makes wearing a clay mask that much more effective.</li>
