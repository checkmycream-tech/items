            <li>I love this tool!  </li>
            <li>I love this product!  </li>
            <li>Best of all you don&#x27;t have to soak your feet first.  </li>
            <li>And the lotion is amazing..</li>
            <li>but this has held up nicely.</li>
            <li>The cream is nice, but I had sufficient callus removal cream already.  </li>
            <li>now I can just paint my own toe nails.  </li>
            <li>I still use my PedEgg to get thru that first layers of more hardened skin but this done THE BEST job of smoothing my skin afterward.</li>
            <li>But a great surprise to be able to so easily work on my feet.  </li>
            <li>The sanding screens are easy to change out and they do a good job.  </li>
            <li>Very easy to use</li>
            <li>Seems more effective than using pumice stone in the shower.  </li>
            <li>By far thee best foot kit ever.</li>
            <li>This product seems to be nothing more then drywall screen fitted to a nice easy to use handle, but it works pretty good!  </li>
            <li>You know how you find a product that&#x27;s too good to be true</li>
            <li>and the cream that came in the package is very good true, though I bought also Sole Food great cream too.</li>
            <li>The cream is fine, but Cerave lotion (the kind in the tub) or Eucerin works better.</li>
            <li>Looks like my heels are getting to look better using this product.  </li>
            <li>Works even better if used overnight, just wear a pair of cotton socks after applying the cream.</li>
            <li>Love this item, works wonders</li>
            <li>Have tried many...</li>
            <li>I have bought more things to get rid of the callus.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m ordering more for family and friends.  </li>
            <li>I have tried numerous products and creams, but this is the best.</li>
            <li>Also, because the callous was reduced, my foot felt better.</li>
            <li>my feet look better than they have in years.</li>
            <li>I have to keep touching them and this tool allows the balm that is included in the kit to absorb into your heels to make them even softer.</li>
            <li>Although simple, this is a GREAT product!</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>I love it .The</li>
            <li>Most of these callus files break after a while</li>
            <li>I tried many different files on the market &amp; this is the safest, giving the best results.</li>
            <li>I ordered two more for my sister and aunt.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>Works better than anything I&#x27;ve ever tried before.</li>
            <li>but it does a great job much easier.</li>
            <li>I would get it again for sure</li>
            <li>Works better then a pumice stone.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll recommend the tool over a pumice stone, you could do better with the cream.</li>
            <li>they are 100% better after using this.</li>
            <li>Heal cream is just okay.</li>
            <li>Ahhh so glad to have this again.</li>
            <li>The softening cream works fine, but would be better if it had some type of tea tree scent.  </li>
            <li>Men will like this product more so than I originally thought.</li>
            <li>so easy to become a product junky</li>
            <li>God knows I tried dozens of products with no success, until one day I was searching on YouTube and found a woman video telling this was the best product ever...</li>
            <li>and I love how quick and easy it is.</li>
            <li>It does the job with little effort but the best surprise is the cream.  </li>
            <li>Great Christmas present for both men and women!!</li>
            <li>This is a fabulous tool and doesn&#x27;t cut into the skin like the PedEgg.  </li>
            <li>and thats fantastic.</li>
            <li>This works fantastic .</li>
            <li>Fantastic product.</li>
            <li>The best out there for both light and heavy callus.</li>
            <li>Amazing for truly soft feet!!</li>
            <li>I bought my original Sof&#x27;feet about 6 years ago from a Sally&#x27;s Beauty Supply who no longer carries them.  </li>
            <li>Honestly, I&#x27;ve only used it a couple of times but wasn&#x27;t all that impressed so far.  </li>
            <li>I do not have neuropathy myself but keeping my feet moisturized and exfoliated makes them look and feel great while stopping that sensation.that my feet burn if they are simply dry.</li>
            <li>You Know what she was telling the true.</li>
            <li>haven&#x27;t seen my feet look as good as they did in only 10 minutes.</li>
            <li>I have tried so many products nothing has ever helped much.  </li>
            <li>In a nutshell, it is a simple but very effective device that has been well made and reasonably priced.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This product really does what it claims!!</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;ve tried Ped Egg, you would love the Sof&#x27;feet Callus Reducer; works 10 times better and faster with less clean up.  </li>
            <li>I would recommend using the cream after washing your feet as this would help keep your feet soft and supple better.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s actually better than going to get a pedicure from a professional nail salon</li>
            <li>am diabetic also and this set greatly reduces any potential problems when removing stubborn callouses because you have complete control.</li>
            <li>Perfect for the at-home foot pedicure and for those times when the skin gets dry due to weather.</li>
            <li>Super fast shipping.</li>
            <li>My heels are always dry and catching on my bedsheets and everything.</li>
            <li>I have experienced the pure horror of my manicurist having to scrub the heck of my feet trying to get them to look half way decent, but now with Sof feet</li>
            <li>I have tried many different products out there to remove callus.</li>
            <li>Even after one use my feet were so much softer!  </li>
            <li>The cream is no big dealâ€”it seems to be about like putting vaseline or my favorite hand cream on.</li>
            <li>I would not over-work any area, but with consistent care I&#x27;m getting the results I was seeking.</li>
            <li>funny thing is i owned one,and somehow it got broke,finally.......</li>
            <li>The softee cream makes your feet really soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>Very easy to use on dry feet.  </li>
            <li>The cream is very thick, moisturizes well, and has a light pleasant scent.  </li>
            <li>The slicing/buffering mesh screen on this does not have the right angle to really grind off callus.  </li>
            <li>Definitely will buy more and highly recommend.  </li>
            <li>I used this product while visiting my sister-in-law and thought it was awesome - beats other recent pedicure callus removers recently advertised.  </li>
            <li>The screen lasts a very long time and you can reverse it for more wear before replacing.</li>
            <li>It is smooth, easy to use and my feet are already smooth as a baby&#x27;s behind.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product for anyone with calluses to get rid of, it does do exactly that</li>
            <li>the reviews had really helped me in purchasing this product.  </li>
            <li>I would recommend it and as a matter of fact, my mother-in-law wants to purchase one for herself.  </li>
            <li>I have very ticklish feet</li>
            <li>I really like this to remove calluses.</li>
            <li>Lotion cream really helps keep hydration.</li>
            <li>product really works.</li>
            <li>it was the whole kit,  </li>
            <li>but the cream it much too greasy</li>
            <li>I really like the cream</li>
            <li>Forget the &amp;#34;Egg&amp;#34;, cheese grater, pumice (real or faux), even the battery operated gismo.....</li>
            <li>this is the real deal.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 27 and use to love walking barefoot which caused me to have rough feet for years.</li>
            <li>The next day I was pain free.</li>
            <li>My feet turn out very well</li>
            <li>This does work very well.  </li>
            <li>haha....</li>
            <li>My original unit is still going strong because it is sturdy and the plastic handle is about 1/4&amp;#34; thick which makes it strong enough for a man to use.</li>
            <li>I love this product it made my dry feet soft...</li>
            <li>I have tried many different items and this is the only one that has really worked.</li>
            <li>This will remove the unwanted dead callused skin much easier and with a better result.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>Highly Recommend product.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>i highly recommend  this.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>I used this kit and my feet havent felt so soft, smooth, and silky in a long time.</li>
            <li>Not bad for how long it was used.</li>
            <li>a new one on.  </li>
            <li>It was like I had all new feet.</li>
            <li>The drywall screen like callous rasp will smooth hard edges but not sand off deep callouses easily.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t overlook the brief mention that it is designed to be used on dry feet, as it sands your feet fairly aggressively, and you would probably hurt yourself if you used it wet.</li>
            <li>My feet are VERY soft now.</li>
            <li>no more horror :)</li>
            <li>Sof&#x27;feet was the first product that actually removed my calluses and kept my feet soft.</li>
            <li>It was like I was walking on air!!!&lt;br /&gt;Now, when I start to feel a little stab of pain on the bottoms of my feet, I whip out my Sof&#x27;feet Callous Reducer and smooth it away.</li>
            <li>so I was happy to see that no cost cutting had arrived at the doorstep of this company.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>and I nearly kick the person in the face who is doing the pedi.  </li>
            <li>Your feet will be baby soft.</li>
            <li>It smooths and  leaves your feet feeling soft.</li>
            <li>But not like this my feet are baby soft.</li>
            <li>Im definitely sandal ready now.</li>
            <li>I am a retired professional nail tech.</li>
            <li>Wow, did not expect this to work.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve got baby soft feet</li>
            <li>people, don&#x27;t go a day more with your rough feet!!!!!</li>
            <li>I reviewed several and chose this particular one.</li>
            <li>It really gets all the dry skin and makes your feet really soft.</li>
            <li>I think with a regular continued use my feet will be normal again.</li>
            <li>I have tried using it both wet and dry and dry works better.</li>
            <li>I only use it a few times a week now and my feet a super soft .</li>
            <li>You just have to be careful not to do too much at once or you will be tender.</li>
            <li>They still look soft and supple a week later.  </li>
            <li>I have to search no further to keep my heels and toes soft and treated.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have found it more effective than a metal foot file (too rough and uncomfortable) or a pumice stone (not effective enough).</li>
            <li>No other products have ever given me such hope.</li>
            <li>I am 35 years old and have had callouses on my hands as well (inside knuckles of my fingers) since I was a teenager and this has made my hands smoother than any other product I have tried thus far.</li>
            <li>You also don&#x27;t have to use the company&#x27;s replacement screens; just go to Lowe&#x27;s or a similar store and get some dry wall screen sheets and cut them out with some old scissors because it is the same stuff.</li>

            <li> But a great surprise to be able to so easily work on my feet.  </li>
            <li> The sanding screens are easy to change out and they do a good job.  </li>
            <li> Very easy to use</li>
            <li> Seems more effective than using pumice stone in the shower.  </li>
            <li> By far thee best foot kit ever.</li>
            <li> This product seems to be nothing more then drywall screen fitted to a nice easy to use handle, but it works pretty good!  </li>
            <li> You know how you find a product that&#x27;s too good to be true</li>
            <li> and the cream that came in the package is very good true, though I bought also Sole Food great cream too.</li>
            <li> The cream is fine, but Cerave lotion (the kind in the tub) or Eucerin works better.</li>
            <li> Looks like my heels are getting to look better using this product.  </li>
            <li> Works even better if used overnight, just wear a pair of cotton socks after applying the cream.</li>
            <li> Love this item, works wonders</li>
            <li> Have tried many...</li>
            <li> I have bought more things to get rid of the callus.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m ordering more for family and friends.  </li>
            <li> I have tried numerous products and creams, but this is the best.</li>
            <li> Also, because the callous was reduced, my foot felt better.</li>
            <li> my feet look better than they have in years.</li>
            <li> I have to keep touching them and this tool allows the balm that is included in the kit to absorb into your heels to make them even softer.</li>
            <li> Although simple, this is a GREAT product!</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> I love it .The</li>
            <li> Most of these callus files break after a while</li>
            <li> I tried many different files on the market &amp; this is the safest, giving the best results.</li>
            <li> I ordered two more for my sister and aunt.</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> Works better than anything I&#x27;ve ever tried before.</li>
            <li> but it does a great job much easier.</li>
            <li> I would get it again for sure</li>
            <li> Works better then a pumice stone.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll recommend the tool over a pumice stone, you could do better with the cream.</li>
            <li> they are 100% better after using this.</li>
            <li> Heal cream is just okay.</li>
            <li> Ahhh so glad to have this again.</li>
            <li> The softening cream works fine, but would be better if it had some type of tea tree scent.  </li>
            <li> Men will like this product more so than I originally thought.</li>
            <li> so easy to become a product junky</li>
            <li> God knows I tried dozens of products with no success, until one day I was searching on YouTube and found a woman video telling this was the best product ever...</li>
            <li> and I love how quick and easy it is.</li>
            <li> It does the job with little effort but the best surprise is the cream.  </li>
            <li> Great Christmas present for both men and women!!</li>
            <li> This is a fabulous tool and doesn&#x27;t cut into the skin like the PedEgg.  </li>
            <li> and thats fantastic.</li>
            <li> This works fantastic .</li>
            <li> Fantastic product.</li>
            <li> The best out there for both light and heavy callus.</li>
            <li> Amazing for truly soft feet!!</li>
            <li> I bought my original Sof&#x27;feet about 6 years ago from a Sally&#x27;s Beauty Supply who no longer carries them.  </li>
            <li> Honestly, I&#x27;ve only used it a couple of times but wasn&#x27;t all that impressed so far.  </li>
            <li> I do not have neuropathy myself but keeping my feet moisturized and exfoliated makes them look and feel great while stopping that sensation.that my feet burn if they are simply dry.</li>
            <li> You Know what she was telling the true.</li>
            <li> haven&#x27;t seen my feet look as good as they did in only 10 minutes.</li>
            <li> I have tried so many products nothing has ever helped much.  </li>
            <li> In a nutshell, it is a simple but very effective device that has been well made and reasonably priced.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This product really does what it claims!!</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;ve tried Ped Egg, you would love the Sof&#x27;feet Callus Reducer; works 10 times better and faster with less clean up.  </li>
            <li> I would recommend using the cream after washing your feet as this would help keep your feet soft and supple better.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s actually better than going to get a pedicure from a professional nail salon</li>
            <li> am diabetic also and this set greatly reduces any potential problems when removing stubborn callouses because you have complete control.</li>
            <li> Perfect for the at-home foot pedicure and for those times when the skin gets dry due to weather.</li>
            <li> Super fast shipping.</li>
            <li> My heels are always dry and catching on my bedsheets and everything.</li>
            <li> I have experienced the pure horror of my manicurist having to scrub the heck of my feet trying to get them to look half way decent, but now with Sof feet</li>
            <li> I have tried many different products out there to remove callus.</li>
            <li> Even after one use my feet were so much softer!  </li>
            <li> The cream is no big dealâ€”it seems to be about like putting vaseline or my favorite hand cream on.</li>
            <li> I would not over-work any area, but with consistent care I&#x27;m getting the results I was seeking.</li>
            <li> funny thing is i owned one,and somehow it got broke,finally.......</li>
            <li> The softee cream makes your feet really soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> Very easy to use on dry feet.  </li>
            <li> The cream is very thick, moisturizes well, and has a light pleasant scent.  </li>
            <li> The slicing/buffering mesh screen on this does not have the right angle to really grind off callus.  </li>
            <li> Definitely will buy more and highly recommend.  </li>
            <li> I used this product while visiting my sister-in-law and thought it was awesome - beats other recent pedicure callus removers recently advertised.  </li>
            <li> The screen lasts a very long time and you can reverse it for more wear before replacing.</li>
            <li> It is smooth, easy to use and my feet are already smooth as a baby&#x27;s behind.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product for anyone with calluses to get rid of, it does do exactly that</li>
            <li> the reviews had really helped me in purchasing this product.  </li>
            <li> I would recommend it and as a matter of fact, my mother-in-law wants to purchase one for herself.  </li>
            <li> I have very ticklish feet</li>
            <li> I really like this to remove calluses.</li>
            <li> Lotion cream really helps keep hydration.</li>
            <li> product really works.</li>
            <li> it was the whole kit,  </li>
            <li> but the cream it much too greasy</li>
            <li> I really like the cream</li>
            <li> Forget the &amp;#34;Egg&amp;#34;, cheese grater, pumice (real or faux), even the battery operated gismo.....</li>
            <li> this is the real deal.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 27 and use to love walking barefoot which caused me to have rough feet for years.</li>
            <li> The next day I was pain free.</li>
            <li> My feet turn out very well</li>
            <li> This does work very well.  </li>
            <li> haha....</li>
            <li> My original unit is still going strong because it is sturdy and the plastic handle is about 1/4&amp;#34; thick which makes it strong enough for a man to use.</li>
            <li> I love this product it made my dry feet soft...</li>
            <li> I have tried many different items and this is the only one that has really worked.</li>
            <li> This will remove the unwanted dead callused skin much easier and with a better result.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> Highly Recommend product.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> i highly recommend  this.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I used this kit and my feet havent felt so soft, smooth, and silky in a long time.</li>
            <li> Not bad for how long it was used.</li>
            <li> a new one on.  </li>
            <li> It was like I had all new feet.</li>
            <li> The drywall screen like callous rasp will smooth hard edges but not sand off deep callouses easily.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t overlook the brief mention that it is designed to be used on dry feet, as it sands your feet fairly aggressively, and you would probably hurt yourself if you used it wet.</li>
            <li> My feet are VERY soft now.</li>
            <li> no more horror :)</li>
            <li> Sof&#x27;feet was the first product that actually removed my calluses and kept my feet soft.</li>
            <li> It was like I was walking on air!!!&lt;br /&gt;Now, when I start to feel a little stab of pain on the bottoms of my feet, I whip out my Sof&#x27;feet Callous Reducer and smooth it away.</li>
            <li> so I was happy to see that no cost cutting had arrived at the doorstep of this company.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> and I nearly kick the person in the face who is doing the pedi.  </li>
            <li> Your feet will be baby soft.</li>
            <li> It smooths and  leaves your feet feeling soft.</li>
            <li> But not like this my feet are baby soft.</li>
            <li> Im definitely sandal ready now.</li>
            <li> I am a retired professional nail tech.</li>
            <li> Wow, did not expect this to work.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve got baby soft feet</li>
            <li> people, don&#x27;t go a day more with your rough feet!!!!!</li>
            <li> I reviewed several and chose this particular one.</li>
            <li> It really gets all the dry skin and makes your feet really soft.</li>
            <li> I think with a regular continued use my feet will be normal again.</li>
            <li> I have tried using it both wet and dry and dry works better.</li>
            <li> I only use it a few times a week now and my feet a super soft .</li>
            <li> You just have to be careful not to do too much at once or you will be tender.</li>
            <li> They still look soft and supple a week later.  </li>
            <li> I have to search no further to keep my heels and toes soft and treated.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have found it more effective than a metal foot file (too rough and uncomfortable) or a pumice stone (not effective enough).</li>
            <li> No other products have ever given me such hope.</li>
            <li> I am 35 years old and have had callouses on my hands as well (inside knuckles of my fingers) since I was a teenager and this has made my hands smoother than any other product I have tried thus far.</li>
            <li> You also don&#x27;t have to use the company&#x27;s replacement screens; just go to Lowe&#x27;s or a similar store and get some dry wall screen sheets and cut them out with some old scissors because it is the same stuff.</li>
            <li> Finally a product that works on dry cracked heals.</li>
            <li> The worked enough to take some of the dry skin.</li>
            <li> Just buy the 3m dry wall sheets for replacement sheets way cheaper you only need to cut them.</li>
            <li> The thumb screw also has a metal shaft so not all plastic which is another reason that this unit has lasted so long.</li>
            <li> But overall rating is a five due to the performance.</li>
            <li> (then wait for it to dry) after every use.</li>
            <li> It directs user to work on dry skin, and I did just that.</li>
            <li> You just tap the unit to knock out the exfoliated dry skin and continue on then wash or sterilize it with some alcohol when done and air dry.</li>
            <li> He has neuropathy and I have always found that my feet burn if they are simply dry.</li>
            <li> I would wash with anti bacterial soap, &amp; spray with barbicide then let air dry between clients.</li>
            <li> You use it on dry feet.  </li>
            <li> It took all the dry skin from my feet away..</li>
            <li> As a result, you can &#x27;scrub&#x27; and &#x27;push&#x27; and see barely a speck of dead skin being sloshed off.</li>
            <li> I actually got down to my skin on my heels.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It only takes a couple minutes to sand the callouses down.</li>
            <li> can be used wet or dry</li>
            <li> But if you typically shave callouses this may not be enough, or may be step 2 in your routine.</li>
            <li> as well a little goes a long way .</li>
            <li> i was a bit skeptical at first but after reading the review i decided to give this a shot</li>
            <li> This Screen gets down to business.</li>
            <li> It works super fast and does the job of getting rid of that horrible dried callus on the heels of our feet.  </li>
            <li> it is awfull, and I wish the screens lasted a little longer.</li>
            <li> They were all describing issues on the ball of the foot, but I was hurting on the bottom of both my feet just below my little toe.</li>
            <li> My heals have been grossly dried and cracked for about 7 years now.</li>
            <li> All in all, a waste of money.</li>
            <li> product, along with a few others, have finalized my home foot care needs.  </li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t do a thing and half of my lotion was leaked out everywhere and smashed!</li>
            <li> I count the strokes and usually do about 50 before moving on.</li>
            <li> Over the past 8 years, I have purchased every cream, oil on the market.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t rub hard, you won&#x27;t need to and you can cause the equivalent of a carpet burn.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to explain...</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a thick wax feeling cream.</li>
            <li> but I don&#x27;t like how the cream is too thick.</li>
            <li> I tried everything to get rid of my ugly calluses and this is te only thing that has worked for me.</li>
            <li> You will not be sorry you bought this.</li>
            <li> I would even regularly go and get a pedicure to get rid of the unsightly disgusting heel because they turn into pieces of Velcro on the carpet!</li>
            <li> the lotion is really weird, I don&#x27;t use it unless I&#x27;m going to bed and putting socks on (which that&#x27;s what it&#x27;s probably meant for).</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s weird....</li>
            <li> Razors are dangerous.</li>
            <li> Graters are dangerous.</li>
            <li> Hi, this is a bad product in my opinion.</li>
            <li> I have even gone to a pediodrist to have them remove my calluses because they were so painful.</li>
            <li> but I didn&#x27;t think a callous could be this painful.</li>
            <li> I sadly have very bad callouses that build on my feet</li>
            <li> I wanted one for my Dad who has diabetes and was cutting off callouses with a knife (cringe!).</li>
            <li> You will not be disappointed with this purchase.</li>
            <li> I worked on my worst callous and noticed immediately that I was getting results.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> This product is actually what everyone else has been saying about it....VERY GOOD!  I bought it for my husband and OMGod, it is oh so good!  I don&#x27;t regret buying it and the reviews had really helped me in purchasing this product.  I would recommend it and as a matter of fact, my mother-in-law wants to purchase one for herself.  Good stuff!</li>
            <li> I have tried many different products out there to remove callus. I have even gone to a pediodrist to have them remove my calluses because they were so painful. Sof&#x27;feet was the first product that actually removed my calluses and kept my feet soft. It is the Best thing I have purchased in years! Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> Looks like my heels are getting to look better using this product.  I would recommend this kit.  I also use a different foot cream.</li>
            <li> Very easy to use on dry feet.  Seems more effective than using pumice stone in the shower.  If you&#x27;ve tried Ped Egg, you would love the Sof&#x27;feet Callus Reducer; works 10 times better and faster with less clean up.  The cream is very thick, moisturizes well, and has a light pleasant scent.  I would recommend using the cream after washing your feet as this would help keep your feet soft and supple better.  Works even better if used overnight, just wear a pair of cotton socks after applying the cream.</li>
            <li> This product actually works like it says it does... Wonders!!</li>
            <li> Love this item, works wonders</li>
            <li> I used this product while visiting my sister-in-law and thought it was awesome - beats other recent pedicure callus removers recently advertised.  I have received mine, with some Sof&#x27;feet Softening Gel and still think it is awesome. Great Christmas present for both men and women!!</li>
            <li> This is the best foot file I&#x27;ve ever used. It actually works and works well. The cream also works well. It&#x27;s a thick wax feeling cream.</li>
            <li> A truly excellent foot care item.  Have tried many...none work like Sof&#x27;feet!!!</li>
            <li> God knows I tried dozens of products with no success, until one day I was searching on YouTube and found a woman video telling this was the best product ever...You Know what she was telling the true. My feet look great! and the cream that came in the package is very good true, though I bought also Sole Food great cream too.</li>
            <li> I have struggled with callus on my feet for years. I have bought more things to get rid of the callus. Nothing ever worked.&lt;br /&gt;I even at times rubbed my skin and it would bleed. I just received this product and thought I would have the same results as before. What a delightful&lt;br /&gt;surprise. when I used it and I couldn&#x27;t believe the results. I actually got down to my skin on my heels. They were pink.&lt;br /&gt;I haven&#x27;t seen my feet look as good as they did in only 10 minutes. I used the cream that came with the kit. After taking my shower&lt;br /&gt;my feet looked and felt so good. Great results at a great price. I am buying one for my daughter.</li>
            <li> Works well. Also have a Dr. Scholl&#x27;s cheese grater on a handle that works good too. This Screen gets down to business. Men will like this product more so than I originally thought.</li>
            <li> I just received this about 20 minutes ago.  I&#x27;m throwing away my PedEggs.  THIS is the ultimate callus scraper!!!  I have very ticklish feet and I just can&#x27;t do pedis.  My feet jump and I nearly kick the person in the face who is doing the pedi.  This is a fabulous tool and doesn&#x27;t cut into the skin like the PedEgg.  It is smooth, easy to use and my feet are already smooth as a baby&#x27;s behind.  The cream that comes with it smells very nice and feel great on my feet.  I give this 5 stars, plus 5 more stars!</li>
            <li> I have diabetes and diabetes equals calluses!!! I tried everything to get rid of my ugly calluses and this is te only thing that has worked for me. I am so pleased with this product, now I&#x27;m not embarrassed when it comes time for sandal season! I have experienced the pure horror of my manicurist having to scrub the heck of my feet trying to get them to look half way decent, but now with Sof feet no more horror :) how it works well for you!</li>
            <li> My product came but the cream in the jar was cracked and opened.  Item was not packaged well.  The box on the outside was not damaged only the inside product.  Sending it back for a refund.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t do a thing and half of my lotion was leaked out everywhere and smashed!</li>
            <li> I really like this to remove calluses. It&#x27;s a change to not do this in the bath but I can use this in the tub while no water is in it.</li>
            <li> I love this tool!  It works great! Even after one use my feet were so much softer!  I totally recommend it!</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product for anyone with calluses to get rid of, it does do exactly that and thats fantastic.</li>
            <li> This item worked wonderfully for me.  Did the job and my feet feel great.  Try it out you&#x27;ll like it.</li>
            <li> I have bought these for all my girlfriends! You know how you find a product that&#x27;s too good to be true and you want to tell everyone about it and want all your friends to have it? This is definitely that product! Try it...you will not regret it! I promise!</li>
            <li> Honestly, I&#x27;ve only used it a couple of times but wasn&#x27;t all that impressed so far.  I will try it again and give it a fair run.  If anything changes, I will update my review.</li>
            <li> I love this product!  It works super fast and does the job of getting rid of that horrible dried callus on the heels of our feet.  I&#x27;m ordering more for family and friends.  It is even faster than the battery powered versions.  Definitely will buy more and highly recommend.  You will not be sorry you bought this.</li>
            <li> It really gets all the dry skin and makes your feet really soft. It&#x27;s actually better than going to get a pedicure from a professional nail salon</li>
            <li> The device itself is great, except that I have to take it apart and rinse it (then wait for it to dry) after every use. The cream is no big dealâ€”it seems to be about like putting vaseline or my favorite hand cream on.</li>
            <li> This callous reducer gave me immediate results. I have tried numerous products and creams, but this is the best. It directs user to work on dry skin, and I did just that. I worked on my worst callous and noticed immediately that I was getting results. Also, because the callous was reduced, my foot felt better. I would not over-work any area, but with consistent care I&#x27;m getting the results I was seeking. Great product!</li>
            <li> My heals have been grossly dried and cracked for about 7 years now. I have tried so many products nothing has ever helped much.  I have used this kit 4 times and OMG!!!! my feet look better than they have in years. I think with a regular continued use my feet will be normal again. No other products have ever given me such hope.</li>
            <li> I bought my original Sof&#x27;feet about 6 years ago from a Sally&#x27;s Beauty Supply who no longer carries them.  I wanted one for my Dad who has diabetes and was cutting off callouses with a knife (cringe!). I couldn&#x27;t get through to him the danger of that practice so I searched and was glad to see this great set that I bought for him. The unit is the same sturdy tool that I have so I was happy to see that no cost cutting had arrived at the doorstep of this company.&lt;br /&gt;I am diabetic also and this set greatly reduces any potential problems when removing stubborn callouses because you have complete control. I have found it more effective than a metal foot file (too rough and uncomfortable) or a pumice stone (not effective enough). My original unit is still going strong because it is sturdy and the plastic handle is about 1/4&amp;#34; thick which makes it strong enough for a man to use. I have tried using it both wet and dry and dry works better. You just tap the unit to knock out the exfoliated dry skin and continue on then wash or sterilize it with some alcohol when done and air dry. Don&#x27;t rub hard, you won&#x27;t need to and you can cause the equivalent of a carpet burn. I count the strokes and usually do about 50 before moving on. The screen lasts a very long time and you can reverse it for more wear before replacing. You also don&#x27;t have to use the company&#x27;s replacement screens; just go to Lowe&#x27;s or a similar store and get some dry wall screen sheets and cut them out with some old scissors because it is the same stuff. The thumb screw also has a metal shaft so not all plastic which is another reason that this unit has lasted so long. In a nutshell, it is a simple but very effective device that has been well made and reasonably priced.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My Dad has also been using the cream sample in the set and says that he likes it. To cap it off, I bought him a pair of aloe infused moisturizing socks to use after exfoliating and moisturizing. He has neuropathy and I have always found that my feet burn if they are simply dry. I do not have neuropathy myself but keeping my feet moisturized and exfoliated makes them look and feel great while stopping that sensation.that my feet burn if they are simply dry. I do not have neuropathy myself but keeping my feet moisturized and exfoliated makes them look and feel great while stopping that sensation.</li>
            <li> Lov e it!  They work wonders!</li>
            <li> It was very effective.  I would recommend this to anyone that has callus problems.</li>
            <li> people, don&#x27;t go a day more with your rough feet!!!!! I wish I would have known about this years ago, would have saved me a lot of time and money! I can NOT believe how smooth my heels are!!!! I have to keep touching them and this tool allows the balm that is included in the kit to absorb into your heels to make them even softer. I am going to order my sister and niece a kit!</li>
            <li> Finally a product that works on dry cracked heals. Very easy to use and the cream is wonderful. I will be a lifetime user of this product. Your feet will be baby soft. Super fast shipping.</li>
            <li> Although simple, this is a GREAT product! I love it. Lotion cream really helps keep hydration. Excellent purchase. Highly Recommend product.</li>
            <li> I love it .The product really works.It smooths and  leaves your feet feeling soft.I will continue to use it over and over.</li>
            <li> It worked for me. Im never gonna go to Salons for callus removal.</li>
            <li> This product really does what it claims!!</li>
            <li> funny thing is i owned one,and somehow it got broke,finally.......after looking all over trying to replace it, my niece suggested  i go online.And low and behold to my surprise there it was the whole kit,  i ordered it and am very pleased ........  p.s. can be used wet or dry</li>
            <li> I like the callus remover, I like how it works and all.  It seems to be easier on the skin but the cream it much too greasy&lt;br /&gt;and does not soak into the skin.  Therefore it does not seem to do the job it is intended to do.</li>
            <li> I have tried many different items and this is the only one that has really worked. I am very happy with the product and recommend it&lt;br /&gt;for anyone who have feet that are callused or have scaly skin.</li>
            <li> Great for callus removal. The softee cream makes your feet really soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried every callus reducer file you can think of.  This one works the best to keep my feet&lt;br /&gt;smooth in between pedicures.  I like it because you throw away the screen when its worn out and&lt;br /&gt;put a new one on.  Most of these callus files break after a while but this has held up nicely.</li>
            <li> I have to say it - this product rocks. I am really impressed - it works!&lt;br /&gt;The cream that comes with it is awfull, and I wish the screens lasted a little longer. But overall rating is a five due to the performance.</li>
            <li> Amazing for truly soft feet!! You need this!  Nothing else has worked for me. I&#x27;ve tried the spa sleeping with the best foot creams. The worked enough to take some of the dry skin. But not like this my feet are baby soft. Im definitely sandal ready now. Just buy the 3m dry wall sheets for replacement sheets way cheaper you only need to cut them.</li>
            <li> I am a retired professional nail tech. I used this foot file in my salon for 7 years. It is very effective product! Great for self Pedi&#x27;s at home. You will not be disappointed with this purchase. I tried many different files on the market &amp; this is the safest, giving the best results. When my clients left they knew they had a pedicure! Cracks &amp; calluses be gone with regular use. Can&#x27;t comment on the cream, never tried that. Comes apart simply for sanitizing. I would wash with anti bacterial soap, &amp; spray with barbicide then let air dry between clients. Best thing out there. Save yourself some money on pedicures by purchasing one of these!</li>
            <li> Wow, did not expect this to work. But a great surprise to be able to so easily work on my feet.  I would recommend this to anyone who has callused feet. Truly amazing!</li>
            <li> I sadly have very bad callouses that build on my feet and this works well. I still use my PedEgg to get thru that first layers of more hardened skin but this done THE BEST job of smoothing my skin afterward. I am 35 years old and have had callouses on my hands as well (inside knuckles of my fingers) since I was a teenager and this has made my hands smoother than any other product I have tried thus far. And that&#x27;s before the cream! You just have to be careful not to do too much at once or you will be tender.</li>
            <li> This works fantastic . I have been searching everywhere for a callus remover that actually worked like it said it worked. this is it!! I only use it a few times a week now and my feet a super soft . I really like the cream as well a little goes a long way .</li>
            <li> Not as helpful as it described, but still the kit softens my skin and somewhat helped with the callus I guess.</li>
            <li> I use it to maintain the callus buildup on my feet.  It works real good.  This is a good product to use.</li>
            <li> Perfect for the at-home foot pedicure and for those times when the skin gets dry due to weather.</li>
            <li> It works. I ordered two more for my sister and aunt. Love it.</li>
            <li> I am very happy with this product. My feet are VERY soft now. I highly recommend it. Very easy to use as well!</li>
            <li> Works better than anything I&#x27;ve ever tried before. I&#x27;ve got baby soft feet again!!&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been telling everyone about it.</li>
            <li> Great tool for removing calluses. Finally found something that works!</li>
            <li> Hi, this is a bad product in my opinion. The best way to do this is to use a glycolic acid product like Glytone 29.5% Ultra Heel and Elbow Cream.  This will remove the unwanted dead callused skin much easier and with a better result. Just need to use some care with it&#x27;s use like everything else but it does a great job much easier.</li>
            <li> Forget the &amp;#34;Egg&amp;#34;, cheese grater, pumice (real or faux), even the battery operated gismo.....this is the real deal.  It does the job with little effort but the best surprise is the cream.  OMG!  Over the past 8 years, I have purchased every cream, oil on the market.  Some are affective but only if used daily.  I can apply this to my &amp;#34;biscuit&amp;#34; heels and not worry.  They still look soft and supple a week later.  The combo is a gift from a heaven.  Don&#x27;t hesitate......order it now!</li>
            <li> By far thee best foot kit ever. I dont with for this company nor am I trying to scam anyone into buying this product, by writing this review. I&#x27;m 27 and use to love walking barefoot which caused me to have rough feet for years. I used this kit and my feet havent felt so soft, smooth, and silky in a long time. Ive used alot of different tools, loyions, exfoliating creams, etc to help; but nothing helps like this kit....oh and the lotion omg I buying this by itself when I run out.</li>
            <li> The slicing/buffering mesh screen on this does not have the right angle to really grind off callus.  As a result, you can &#x27;scrub&#x27; and &#x27;push&#x27; and see barely a speck of dead skin being sloshed off. The cream is nice, but I had sufficient callus removal cream already.  All in all, a waste of money.</li>
            <li> My feet were killing me.  It felt as if I was walking on rocks.  I Googled &amp;#34;feels like I&#x27;m walking on rocks&amp;#34; and checked out several of the links that came up. None of them described the pain in the area where mine was. They were all describing issues on the ball of the foot, but I was hurting on the bottom of both my feet just below my little toe. There was a link for a callous remover from Amazon but I didn&#x27;t think a callous could be this painful. Eventually I clucked the link and there were some reviews for the product, I think it may have been the Pedi-egg or something but one reviewer was describing the same pain in the same place as mine. So I went to Amazon.com and typed in callous reducer into the search and about a million different kinds popped up. I reviewed several and chose this particular one. BEST MONEY I EVER SPENT!&lt;br /&gt;It only takes a couple minutes to sand the callouses down. And what a difference it made! The next day I was pain free. It was like I had all new feet. It was like I was walking on air!!!&lt;br /&gt;Now, when I start to feel a little stab of pain on the bottoms of my feet, I whip out my Sof&#x27;feet Callous Reducer and smooth it away. Wish I would have discovered this months ago!</li>
            <li> Ladies and gents...this wks...i was a bit skeptical at first but after reading the review i decided to give this a shot it wks.......i highly recommend  this.</li>
            <li> The drywall screen like callous rasp will smooth hard edges but not sand off deep callouses easily. If you need smoothing this is the ticket. But if you typically shave callouses this may not be enough, or may be step 2 in your routine. The cream is fine, but Cerave lotion (the kind in the tub) or Eucerin works better.</li>
            <li> My feet turn out very well</li>
            <li> Fantastic product. The best out there for both light and heavy callus. Razors are dangerous. Graters are dangerous. Handheld battery driven grinders tend to lack the power necessary for tougher calluses. This product is great!</li>
            <li> The sanding screens are easy to change out and they do a good job.  I&#x27;ve used this product for years, and only had to replace the handle recently because the handle broke at the curve/stress point.  Not bad for how long it was used.</li>
            <li> works like a charm!!! ordered for my self, my mom tried and ordered too. I would get it again for sure</li>
            <li> The great reviews were 100% accurate!  Awesome product and great value as a set.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product, along with a few others, have finalized my home foot care needs.  I have to search no further to keep my heels and toes soft and treated.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Its so easy to become a product junky..but this set is a winner on its on!</li>
            <li> Works better then a pumice stone.  This product seems to be nothing more then drywall screen fitted to a nice easy to use handle, but it works pretty good!  Don&#x27;t overlook the brief mention that it is designed to be used on dry feet, as it sands your feet fairly aggressively, and you would probably hurt yourself if you used it wet. The softening cream works fine, but would be better if it had some type of tea tree scent.  I&#x27;ll recommend the tool over a pumice stone, you could do better with the cream.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve searched everywhere and thought I&#x27;d try this because of the reviews.  It works!  Best of all you don&#x27;t have to soak your feet first.  You use it on dry feet.  I got one for me and one for my husband.  Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> This does work very well.  Very simple to use.</li>
            <li> This thing works wonders.  I&#x27;ve had crappy heels my whole life, dried, cracking, sometimes they&#x27;ll hurt. I would even regularly go and get a pedicure to get rid of the unsightly disgusting heel because they turn into pieces of Velcro on the carpet! haha.... they are 100% better after using this. now I can just paint my own toe nails.  I do have to say though... the lotion is really weird, I don&#x27;t use it unless I&#x27;m going to bed and putting socks on (which that&#x27;s what it&#x27;s probably meant for). It&#x27;s hard to explain... it&#x27;s like it doesn&#x27;t soak in and moisturize? I don&#x27;t know... it&#x27;s weird.... I don&#x27;t use it enough to notice if it makes a difference I guess.</li>
            <li> This product does work wonderfully!</li>
            <li> Um, where has this product been all my life?? My heels are always dry and catching on my bedsheets and everything. I do this about once a month and I love how quick and easy it is.</li>
            <li> great product. would buy again. the cream is awesome</li>
            <li> This is a great tool for removing calus from your feet.  Extra filling inserts provided.  Heal cream is just okay.</li>
            <li> The tool works well but I don&#x27;t like how the cream is too thick.</li>
            <li> Ahhh so glad to have this again.</li>
            <li> I love this product it made my dry feet soft... It took all the dry skin from my feet away.. And the lotion is amazing..</li>
