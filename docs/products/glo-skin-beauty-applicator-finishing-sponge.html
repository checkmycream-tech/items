            <li> I really like this soft sponge and use it to apply mineral foundation. Great tool and very similar to the Jane Iredale sponge with a slightly better price:)!</li>
            <li> Great product. Quick ship.</li>
            <li> I love this sponge! It works great, gives great coverage and you can wash and re-use over and over! Perfect!</li>
            <li> I love all things glominerals.  I do not agree with the requirement of a certain number of words and this will be my last review on things purchased.</li>
            <li> I was looking for an on line alternative to the Jane Iredale flocked sponge. This sponge is perfect, great for application of the pressed powder mineral makeup. Can be washed and used over and over.</li>
            <li> I love these flocked sponges.  I use them with my liquid makeup and it gives an airbrushed looked.  You don&#x27;t have to use as much product either.  Update: Nov. 2015-the last batch of these came apart on my face.  I&#x27;ve been using them for years without a problem.  The flocking came off and was left behind on my face and looked like rolled up dead skin everywhere.  I tried 3 different ones and they all did it.  In hoping it was just a bad batch.</li>
            <li> just as good as Jane Iredales....for less money!</li>
            <li> I love this product for putting on my mineral makeup.  It works much better than the brushes for fuller coverage.  You can also throw them in the washing machine for cleaning.</li>
            <li> I needed to replace one I got about 20 years ago. This is basically the same. However, the black plastic holder for it smells awful and makes the sponge smell bad too. I&#x27;ve tried keeping the holder open and the sponge out on the cabinet to diffuse the odor but it hasn&#x27;t worked so far after about a month. I can&#x27;t use my old white holder as it has worn out. That is one of the main reasons I picked this particular one out of several just like it on Amazon. It came with a holder. But the price was good and I needed a new sponge. These sponges are great for smoothing out my mineral powder and powder blush.</li>
            <li> love it &amp;lt;3 this is the best sponge i have ever used ,its soft lightwight and fluffy .  I would highly recommend it</li>
            <li> Ok sponge - not overly excited but did the job.</li>
            <li> This is the best finishing sponge I have ever used.</li>
            <li> Within 2 weeks, the finishing sponge surface began to flake off. Underneath was a cheap sponge. It was good the first week only.  It was more like a one-use product. I am very disappointed in the quality.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using flocked sponges with mineral makeup for over ten years now. It&#x27;s hard to find a good flocked sponge for a reasonable price these days. I decided to buy a couple of these because the price was decent and the packaging looked similar to some really good flocked sponged I had in the past. They were great at first- and then I washed them, the same way I&#x27;ve always washed flocked sponges- and all the flocking came off. Now they are just sponges, and not very soft ones at that. What a drag.</li>
            <li> I use these to apply mineral foundation, and these are also a good size to pop in your bag pre-loaded with makeup for touchups. The included vinyl pouch makes it pretty painless.</li>
            <li> Great little sponge just wish it was a tiny bit more solid.</li>
            <li> THIS IS SO SOFT AND WORKS THE BEST. IT ALLOWS THE MAKEUP TO TRANSFER TO YOUR FACE RATHER THAN JUST SOAKING IT UP</li>
            <li> This sponge started falling apart within the first week of having it.  It &#x27;beaded&#x27; up and had to throw it away</li>
