            <li>Makeup stayed on good and it looked good after spraying.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m good to go for the day.  </li>
            <li>i will say however, the matte is not as good as the dewy.</li>

            <li>Excellent product worth the experience</li>
            <li>LOVE this!  </li>
            <li>I absolutely love these makeup setting sprays!</li>
            <li>I love these!</li>
            <li>I LOVE them!  </li>
            <li>I use the dewy the most!</li>
            <li>so 2 for $13 is amazing.</li>
            <li>Nice size bottle...</li>
            <li>I can see it &#x27;kind of working&#x27; but is nothing</li>
            <li>very happy that it came supper fast.</li>
            <li>I really liked the outcome of the sprays.</li>
            <li>I definitely liked the dewey one better.</li>
            <li>Wow Love it!!!!</li>
            <li>the setting spray gives my foundation a nice smooth finish, unlike mineral powder that just adds cake to my face.</li>
            <li>Love both formulas.</li>
            <li>Although they both seemed to set and kinda press my makeup more into my face, which made my imperfections stand out even more.</li>
            <li>Excelent conditions, both gave me the result i was looking for, nyx is an excelent brand, i just love their products.</li>
            <li>but I don&#x27;t love it.</li>
            <li>and I love how it looked on her skin.</li>
            <li>and I love how that looks on my skin.</li>
            <li>Great product for the price and delivery was very prompt.</li>
            <li>Its an ok setting spray.</li>
            <li>Also I wish there was more product in the bottles.</li>
            <li>, I&#x27;ve mixed the two together for the perfect finish.&lt;br /&gt;2.</li>
            <li>Quite frankly I think the Mac fix+ does a better job, but if you&#x27;re on a budget this is okay.</li>
            <li>the dewy isnt too dewy so thats great, the matte isnt really all that matte looking though in my opinion.</li>
            <li>You also get an option of having a dewy finish or more matte finish.</li>
            <li>I decided to try these setting stays after I saw so many beauty guru&#x27;s review it on YouTube</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m glad I bought them.</li>
            <li>They do as they say and my make up stay in place all day :)</li>
            <li>so you get what you pay for, the dewy makes more effect for me than the mate one</li>
            <li>it works I will be buying more ^.^</li>
            <li>I WILL BUYING MORE PRODUCTS IN YOUR STORE</li>
            <li>But I love the matte finish.</li>
            <li>Love NYX.</li>
            <li>And i love these sprays.</li>
            <li>I have tried it now 3 times, and my makeup did not stay any better than without this stuff.  </li>
            <li>And I love the product I put my makeup on spray it on, went to work for 8 hours</li>
            <li>I like it so much better than a powder.  </li>
            <li>They held the make-up for most of the day.</li>
            <li>I love this product  </li>
            <li>Glad that I bought</li>
            <li>But i like the refreshing feeling</li>
            <li>I really love the dewy finish.</li>
            <li>I love these..its not too expensive...and it sets my makeup...</li>
            <li>My favorite makeup setting spray at an affordable price.  </li>
            <li>I have enjoyed the Makeup Setting Spray I have not had any problems with it.</li>
            <li>Just be sure to hold the bottle about arm&#x27;s length away</li>
            <li>I LOVE this product.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s pretty good for the price</li>
            <li>This brand isn&#x27;t as good; it feels nice when first applied, but makeup still wears off after a full day of work.</li>
            <li>By the end of the day my makeup still looks pretty damn good</li>
            <li>Significantly has changes the look of my makeup!  </li>
            <li>Have not used the Matte finish yet, but Im certain it will be good results</li>
            <li>wow, then again, the price is great</li>
            <li>I love NYX products and heard such great things about these setting sprays.</li>
            <li>I prefer the dewy formula but both work fine.</li>
            <li>I am a tan/olive skin tone with lightly oily skin.</li>
            <li>The bomb for achieving a smooth finish vs. &amp;#34;caked&amp;#34; look with a finishing powder.</li>
            <li>so so far so good.</li>
            <li>So far, so good.  </li>
            <li>I love both of them so much!</li>
            <li>i was excited for these to come in</li>
            <li>Seemed to work as good as comparable high name brand setting sprays, really like the matte finish one!</li>
            <li>this spray I love it it feels wonderful it makes my make up last long all day</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried a good amount of setting sprays and powders in a attempt to make my makeup last a work day.  </li>
            <li>True to everything they say.</li>
            <li>Not bad pricing</li>
            <li>if you have large poors not!!</li>
            <li>Love love love perfect makeup setting spray,  not blotchy at all, and no water marks left behind!</li>
            <li>Haven&#x27;t used them enough to say I love or it&#x27;s just ok ..</li>
            <li>I already had some quick looks on youtube about this products , and some did like it and</li>
            <li>I purchased both the Dewy and Matte finish, I&#x27;ve only used the Dewey and very pleased with the results...</li>
            <li>nothing super exciting</li>
            <li>It leaves makeup with a perfect set and is long lasting.</li>
            <li>If your wondering if this is an miracle in a bottle, no it isn&#x27;t, but it&#x27;s pretty close!</li>
            <li>Setting powders make my skin look dry now that I&#x27;ve left my 20&#x27;s, so I&#x27;ve been on the hunt for the best setting spray.  </li>
            <li>Not only does the MAC stuff smell amazing, it hydrates the skin.</li>
            <li>i have not seen a amazing difference but my make-up does stay longer without falling off and such.</li>
            <li>Honestly this thing ruined my face, I used this thing and the SAME DAY it made my face break out</li>
            <li>But I will say the seller shipped this product super fast!</li>
            <li>Quick delivery and received exactly as promised.</li>
            <li>just right for traveling.</li>
            <li>The price was right.</li>
            <li>Amazing does what it says it does and more it helps with everyday application and it eases the whole process and assist the makeup process</li>
            <li>However I do like the matte spray very much.</li>
            <li>As much as I sweat and take my helmet or hat on and off, my makeup doesn&#x27;t budge!</li>
            <li>I love this product, especially the dewy finish!!</li>
            <li>It was exactly as pictured.</li>
            <li>and this is the first time that I used the dewy finish setting spray</li>
            <li>Smells weird but work amazing!!!</li>
            <li>I was happy with how long it makes your foundation last though.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used the Urban Decay ones and I have to say these are WAY better at keeping my makeup in place.</li>
            <li>but when i used them for the first time i honetly didnt see any difference.</li>
            <li>My first time trying it.</li>
            <li>it does exactly what it says.....</li>
            <li>and I love how they make my face look - especially the dewy one.</li>
            <li>The shipping was extremely fast!</li>
            <li>The flat version is slightly better than the dewy, but I found both to be pretty middle-road.</li>
            <li>I bought one in matte, which really looks great with a matte powder and there is no shine, long lasting and the  dewy which I use with bronzer</li>
            <li>To be honest, the time spent without this spray was a nightmare!</li>
            <li>Compares well to higher priced products and really extends the wear of my makeup.  </li>
            <li>Ive used multiple sprays, and this brand even kicks Urban Decay&#x27;s booty - better in price and quality!</li>
            <li>It works amazing, I definitely will buy again if I can just get a bigger matte finish bottle!</li>
            <li>Got here really fast.</li>
            <li>The spray sets the make up in very well.</li>
            <li>I feel like it didn&#x27;t do much of anything.</li>
            <li>They do what they say they do, although I can&#x27;t tell too much of a difference between the matte and the dewy spray.</li>
            <li>and I really don&#x27;t like them.</li>
            <li>I was really looking forward to the dewy spray, but it just made my face feel so sticky.</li>
            <li>THANKS</li>
            <li>Fast shipping.</li>
            <li>so I don&#x27;t have much time to touch up my make up.  </li>
            <li>My make up really dose stay in place with this setting spray</li>
            <li>Really sets your make as well as add hydration</li>
            <li>so I really cant compare them to anything.</li>
            <li>it really does the job.</li>
            <li>really , but i dont regret it becuase its still working on me</li>
            <li>but really it&#x27;s &amp;#34;depending&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>on your diet and so many other factors during your day or night before.</li>
            <li>The only one better is Urban Decay&#x27;s setting spray, but NYX&#x27;s is a fraction of the cost.  </li>
            <li>Shipping was not only quick but packaged</li>
            <li>I mainly use these just as a pre-foundation spray and on humid days I&#x27;ll spray after I&#x27;ve completed my face.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend both of these items purchased separately or together as I purchased them.</li>
            <li>By far better than any other setting spray out there.</li>
            <li>If you are looking for  a better spray (dewy finish) please just splurge a little and buy MAC fix+ or the MAC charged water.</li>
            <li>Keeps my face right where I put it...for the entire day.</li>
            <li>I live in nyc).</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t like looking like I wear too much foundation, and this helps give my face a healthy, glowing finish that doesn&#x27;t look like I worked so hard in putting my face on in the morning.</li>
            <li>About a few hours into wearing it eased up a bit and made my makeup look more natural.</li>
            <li>Not a super fine mister, have to blend excess with fingers.</li>
            <li>You don&#x27;t want to spray too much, so the bottles last a decent amount of time.  </li>
            <li>Long lasting and beautiful a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li>This is especially helpful in the summer heat and really does make a difference.  </li>
            <li>I was so surprised to come home to these.</li>
            <li>Cant really tell a difference in the lasting power of my makeup when I use this.</li>
            <li>Love this stuff - same quality as the equivalent MAC or Urban Decay spray&#x27;s at much less cost.</li>
            <li>Not only do you get a teeny tiny bottle, but it does absolutely nothing to &amp;#34;set&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also less than other setting sprays on the block, which to be honest, I haven&#x27;t tried the more expensive ones that people rave about.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Throughout the day it can melt a little with the rest of your makeup, but it really does do a decent job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I only recently started using makeup setting spray after trying (and really liking) Urban Decay&#x27;s version.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m getting older and have some dry places after my make up is on.</li>
            <li>Second order so far.</li>
            <li>If there&#x27;s a secret to using this effectively, I&#x27;d love to be let in on it.</li>
            <li>I was a little hesitant in purchasing such a product but after using it the first time, I could see the results in what it does.</li>
            <li>Alas, the sprayer doesn&#x27;t release in a fine mist (hence not five stars) - I just saved my Urban Decay travel size sprayers &amp; fill it with this each month.</li>

            <li> And I love the product I put my makeup on spray it on, went to work for 8 hours</li>
            <li> I like it so much better than a powder.  </li>
            <li> They held the make-up for most of the day.</li>
            <li> I love this product  </li>
            <li> Glad that I bought</li>
            <li> But i like the refreshing feeling</li>
            <li> I really love the dewy finish.</li>
            <li> I love these..its not too expensive...and it sets my makeup...</li>
            <li> My favorite makeup setting spray at an affordable price.  </li>
            <li> I have enjoyed the Makeup Setting Spray I have not had any problems with it.</li>
            <li> Just be sure to hold the bottle about arm&#x27;s length away</li>
            <li> I LOVE this product.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s pretty good for the price</li>
            <li> This brand isn&#x27;t as good; it feels nice when first applied, but makeup still wears off after a full day of work.</li>
            <li> By the end of the day my makeup still looks pretty damn good</li>
            <li> Significantly has changes the look of my makeup!  </li>
            <li> Have not used the Matte finish yet, but Im certain it will be good results</li>
            <li> wow, then again, the price is great</li>
            <li> I love NYX products and heard such great things about these setting sprays.</li>
            <li> I prefer the dewy formula but both work fine.</li>
            <li> I am a tan/olive skin tone with lightly oily skin.</li>
            <li> The bomb for achieving a smooth finish vs. &amp;#34;caked&amp;#34; look with a finishing powder.</li>
            <li> so so far so good.</li>
            <li> So far, so good.  </li>
            <li> I love both of them so much!</li>
            <li> i was excited for these to come in</li>
            <li> Seemed to work as good as comparable high name brand setting sprays, really like the matte finish one!</li>
            <li> this spray I love it it feels wonderful it makes my make up last long all day</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried a good amount of setting sprays and powders in a attempt to make my makeup last a work day.  </li>
            <li> True to everything they say.</li>
            <li> Not bad pricing</li>
            <li> if you have large poors not!!</li>
            <li> Love love love perfect makeup setting spray,  not blotchy at all, and no water marks left behind!</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t used them enough to say I love or it&#x27;s just ok ..</li>
            <li> I already had some quick looks on youtube about this products , and some did like it and</li>
            <li> I purchased both the Dewy and Matte finish, I&#x27;ve only used the Dewey and very pleased with the results...</li>
            <li> nothing super exciting</li>
            <li> It leaves makeup with a perfect set and is long lasting.</li>
            <li> If your wondering if this is an miracle in a bottle, no it isn&#x27;t, but it&#x27;s pretty close!</li>
            <li> Setting powders make my skin look dry now that I&#x27;ve left my 20&#x27;s, so I&#x27;ve been on the hunt for the best setting spray.  </li>
            <li> Not only does the MAC stuff smell amazing, it hydrates the skin.</li>
            <li> i have not seen a amazing difference but my make-up does stay longer without falling off and such.</li>
            <li> Honestly this thing ruined my face, I used this thing and the SAME DAY it made my face break out</li>
            <li> But I will say the seller shipped this product super fast!</li>
            <li> Quick delivery and received exactly as promised.</li>
            <li> just right for traveling.</li>
            <li> The price was right.</li>
            <li> Amazing does what it says it does and more it helps with everyday application and it eases the whole process and assist the makeup process</li>
            <li> However I do like the matte spray very much.</li>
            <li> As much as I sweat and take my helmet or hat on and off, my makeup doesn&#x27;t budge!</li>
            <li> I love this product, especially the dewy finish!!</li>
            <li> It was exactly as pictured.</li>
            <li> and this is the first time that I used the dewy finish setting spray</li>
            <li> Smells weird but work amazing!!!</li>
            <li> I was happy with how long it makes your foundation last though.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used the Urban Decay ones and I have to say these are WAY better at keeping my makeup in place.</li>
            <li> but when i used them for the first time i honetly didnt see any difference.</li>
            <li> My first time trying it.</li>
            <li> it does exactly what it says.....</li>
            <li> and I love how they make my face look - especially the dewy one.</li>
            <li> The shipping was extremely fast!</li>
            <li> The flat version is slightly better than the dewy, but I found both to be pretty middle-road.</li>
            <li> I bought one in matte, which really looks great with a matte powder and there is no shine, long lasting and the  dewy which I use with bronzer</li>
            <li> To be honest, the time spent without this spray was a nightmare!</li>
            <li> Compares well to higher priced products and really extends the wear of my makeup.  </li>
            <li> Ive used multiple sprays, and this brand even kicks Urban Decay&#x27;s booty - better in price and quality!</li>
            <li> It works amazing, I definitely will buy again if I can just get a bigger matte finish bottle!</li>
            <li> Got here really fast.</li>
            <li> The spray sets the make up in very well.</li>
            <li> I feel like it didn&#x27;t do much of anything.</li>
            <li> They do what they say they do, although I can&#x27;t tell too much of a difference between the matte and the dewy spray.</li>
            <li> and I really don&#x27;t like them.</li>
            <li> I was really looking forward to the dewy spray, but it just made my face feel so sticky.</li>
            <li> THANKS</li>
            <li> Fast shipping.</li>
            <li> so I don&#x27;t have much time to touch up my make up.  </li>
            <li> My make up really dose stay in place with this setting spray</li>
            <li> Really sets your make as well as add hydration</li>
            <li> so I really cant compare them to anything.</li>
            <li> it really does the job.</li>
            <li> really , but i dont regret it becuase its still working on me</li>
            <li> but really it&#x27;s &amp;#34;depending&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> on your diet and so many other factors during your day or night before.</li>
            <li> The only one better is Urban Decay&#x27;s setting spray, but NYX&#x27;s is a fraction of the cost.  </li>
            <li> Shipping was not only quick but packaged</li>
            <li> I mainly use these just as a pre-foundation spray and on humid days I&#x27;ll spray after I&#x27;ve completed my face.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend both of these items purchased separately or together as I purchased them.</li>
            <li> By far better than any other setting spray out there.</li>
            <li> If you are looking for  a better spray (dewy finish) please just splurge a little and buy MAC fix+ or the MAC charged water.</li>
            <li> Keeps my face right where I put it...for the entire day.</li>
            <li> I live in nyc).</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like looking like I wear too much foundation, and this helps give my face a healthy, glowing finish that doesn&#x27;t look like I worked so hard in putting my face on in the morning.</li>
            <li> About a few hours into wearing it eased up a bit and made my makeup look more natural.</li>
            <li> Not a super fine mister, have to blend excess with fingers.</li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t want to spray too much, so the bottles last a decent amount of time.  </li>
            <li> Long lasting and beautiful a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> This is especially helpful in the summer heat and really does make a difference.  </li>
            <li> I was so surprised to come home to these.</li>
            <li> Cant really tell a difference in the lasting power of my makeup when I use this.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff - same quality as the equivalent MAC or Urban Decay spray&#x27;s at much less cost.</li>
            <li> Not only do you get a teeny tiny bottle, but it does absolutely nothing to &amp;#34;set&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also less than other setting sprays on the block, which to be honest, I haven&#x27;t tried the more expensive ones that people rave about.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Throughout the day it can melt a little with the rest of your makeup, but it really does do a decent job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I only recently started using makeup setting spray after trying (and really liking) Urban Decay&#x27;s version.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m getting older and have some dry places after my make up is on.</li>
            <li> Second order so far.</li>
            <li> If there&#x27;s a secret to using this effectively, I&#x27;d love to be let in on it.</li>
            <li> I was a little hesitant in purchasing such a product but after using it the first time, I could see the results in what it does.</li>
            <li> Alas, the sprayer doesn&#x27;t release in a fine mist (hence not five stars) - I just saved my Urban Decay travel size sprayers &amp; fill it with this each month.</li>
            <li> I can only use the dewy one from this pair because the &amp;#34;matte&amp;#34; one changes the color of the makeup and makes it look patchy and strange.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used primers, long lasting foundation, setting powders etc and nothing helped.  </li>
            <li> They don&#x27;t last very long.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think it lasts that long</li>
            <li> though the package was smaller than i have of expected</li>
            <li> I will say that if you have dry skin at all the matte is not for you.</li>
            <li> I have dry skin</li>
            <li> These mists do the job of a setting powder without making my face look dry and unnatural.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried Urban Decay, Skindinavia, Ben Nye, Kat Von D and they&#x27;ve all let me down.  </li>
            <li> but I got 1 bottle only &amp; it was half way.</li>
            <li> i really dint know what to expect , but it was really small ... and its too small for this</li>
            <li> Seems to work but have only used it a few times.  </li>
            <li> so you don&#x27;t make your face wet.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like the product because it makes no difference whatsoever other than making my face wet.</li>
            <li> didn&#x27;t make me itch like the other brand made a difference in makeup appearance..</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t tried any other setting sprays</li>
            <li> But I&#x27;ve been spraying this over my makeup everyday for the last few weeks</li>
            <li> Its crazy how something as simple as a setting spray can do so much for your makeup.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used way more expensive sprays just to have my makeup slide off mere hours after I applied.  </li>
            <li> it sprays a little less misty than i was hoping for.</li>
            <li> It does leave a somewhat tight feeling on your face, but you do get use to it if you want to set and matte your face.</li>
            <li> Did not meet my expectations , wasted money</li>
            <li> It holds my make up in place but after a few hours has my face oily.</li>
            <li> well nothing was broken or missing.</li>
            <li> They smell weird and don&#x27;t do anything for me.</li>
            <li> There is no point to using this expensive stuff.  </li>
            <li> SOOOO BAD!!!</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

            <li> I am in the Army. I needed something to keep my makeup in place while I am up and about doing what I do at work. This helps keep my foundation, liquid eyeliner and eyebrow tint in place ALL DAY! As much as I sweat and take my helmet or hat on and off, my makeup doesn&#x27;t budge! I do not feel like I am wearing anything extra on my face and the setting spray gives my foundation a nice smooth finish, unlike mineral powder that just adds cake to my face. I don&#x27;t like looking like I wear too much foundation, and this helps give my face a healthy, glowing finish that doesn&#x27;t look like I worked so hard in putting my face on in the morning.</li>
            <li> These last forever, and definitely work!  Will continue using over Urban Decay&#x27;s more expensive spray.</li>
            <li> I love this product, especially the dewy finish!! im definitely ordering this 2 nyx makeup setting spray again! it&#x27;s a great price also</li>
            <li> I was a little hesitant in purchasing such a product but after using it the first time, I could see the results in what it does. I purchased both the Dewy and Matte finish, I&#x27;ve only used the Dewey and very pleased with the results...Have not used the Matte finish yet, but Im certain it will be good results</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s pretty good for the price nothing super exciting</li>
            <li> Keeps my face right where I put it...for the entire day. Nice size bottle...just right for traveling. Love both formulas.</li>
            <li> Awesome.  Got here really fast.</li>
            <li> I love NYX products and heard such great things about these setting sprays. I am a tan/olive skin tone with lightly oily skin. I tried both the matte and dewy. I definitely liked the dewey one better. Although they both seemed to set and kinda press my makeup more into my face, which made my imperfections stand out even more. About a few hours into wearing it eased up a bit and made my makeup look more natural. Unless you have absolutely perfect skin, I prob wouldn&#x27;t recommend these. But I will say the seller shipped this product super fast! Which was awesome!</li>
            <li> Excelent conditions, both gave me the result i was looking for, nyx is an excelent brand, i just love their products.</li>
            <li> gave me pimples all over my face. the only place i use it is for eyes/eye shadow hold</li>
            <li> The product arrived on time. It was exactly as pictured. I&#x27;ve never used this brand of setting spray before I like it but I don&#x27;t love it. The dewy setting spray I think gives me an oily look as opposed to dewy. However I do like the matte spray very much.</li>
            <li> Amazing does what it says it does and more it helps with everyday application and it eases the whole process and assist the makeup process</li>
            <li> The only one better is Urban Decay&#x27;s setting spray, but NYX&#x27;s is a fraction of the cost.  If you don&#x27;t want to spend $20-$40 on a setting spray, this is for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Throughout the day it can melt a little with the rest of your makeup, but it really does do a decent job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d recommend these to a friend.</li>
            <li> I love both of them so much! A friend asked me to do her makeup for her and this is the first time that I used the dewy finish setting spray and I love how it looked on her skin.I used the matte setting spray on myself and I love how that looks on my skin.I think this is gonna be a repurchase when I run out.</li>
            <li> Makes me look like I&#x27;m sweating.</li>
            <li> Smells weird but work amazing!!!</li>
            <li> The spray sets the make up in very well. As for the matte effect, I wasn&#x27;t blown away... I was happy with how long it makes your foundation last though. Great product for the price and delivery was very prompt.</li>
            <li> I didnt see a big difference with the spray or without it when i tryed it. I would not bye it again</li>
            <li> does the job. would recommend.</li>
            <li> I can only use the dewy one from this pair because the &amp;#34;matte&amp;#34; one changes the color of the makeup and makes it look patchy and strange. I re-bought the dewy one alone which serves its purpose for the price.</li>
            <li> Its an ok setting spray. It helped my makeup last a tad-bit longer. Its not the best though. Also I wish there was more product in the bottles. They don&#x27;t last very long. The matte one DID NOT keep me matte though. I feel like it didn&#x27;t do much of anything. I prefer the dewy one out of the two.</li>
            <li> LOVE this!  Compares well to higher priced products and really extends the wear of my makeup.  Even in the recent humid weather we&#x27;ve been experiencing it still has held up great.&lt;br /&gt;My two &amp;#34;tricks&amp;#34; to use with these:&lt;br /&gt;1. Because the &amp;#34;Dewey version is a tiny bit too dewy for my taste and I&#x27;m not fond of matte, I&#x27;ve mixed the two together for the perfect finish.&lt;br /&gt;2. When humid, I spritz my face with this after applying both my primer AND after finishing all my makeup.</li>
            <li> Doesnt work as well as Ben Nye FInal Seal or Urban Decay but works to take away the powder look after makeup.</li>
            <li> Quite frankly I think the Mac fix+ does a better job, but if you&#x27;re on a budget this is okay. I don&#x27;t think it lasts that long and the duey finish is alright. It&#x27;s meh.</li>
            <li> it sprays a little less misty than i was hoping for. works well to hide powdered face. the dewy isnt too dewy so thats great, the matte isnt really all that matte looking though in my opinion. it doesnt last all day but it does keep makeup in tact longer, espically blush and powders</li>
            <li> Good product will use again it smells wonderful didn&#x27;t make me itch like the other brand made a difference in makeup appearance..</li>
            <li> I absolutely love these makeup setting sprays! I&#x27;ve used the Urban Decay ones and I have to say these are WAY better at keeping my makeup in place. You also get an option of having a dewy finish or more matte finish.</li>
            <li> I decided to try these setting stays after I saw so many beauty guru&#x27;s review it on YouTube and I&#x27;m glad I bought them. They do as they say and my make up stay in place all day :)</li>
            <li> These were great. They do what they say they do, although I can&#x27;t tell too much of a difference between the matte and the dewy spray. But I&#x27;ve been spraying this over my makeup everyday for the last few weeks and it&#x27;s worked great. It&#x27;s also less than other setting sprays on the block, which to be honest, I haven&#x27;t tried the more expensive ones that people rave about.</li>
            <li> I bought both of these sprays at my local target and I really don&#x27;t like them. They smell weird and don&#x27;t do anything for me. I was really looking forward to the dewy spray, but it just made my face feel so sticky. If you are looking for  a better spray (dewy finish) please just splurge a little and buy MAC fix+ or the MAC charged water. Not only does the MAC stuff smell amazing, it hydrates the skin.</li>
            <li> I only recently started using makeup setting spray after trying (and really liking) Urban Decay&#x27;s version. This brand isn&#x27;t as good; it feels nice when first applied, but makeup still wears off after a full day of work. The flat version is slightly better than the dewy, but I found both to be pretty middle-road.</li>
            <li> I can see it &#x27;kind of working&#x27; but is nothing wow, then again, the price is great so you get what you pay for, the dewy makes more effect for me than the mate one</li>
            <li> i have not seen a amazing difference but my make-up does stay longer without falling off and such. though the package was smaller than i have of expected</li>
            <li> Did not meet my expectations , wasted money</li>
            <li> I ordered it on July12 and I just received it today :D very happy that it came supper fast. &amp; I&#x27;m going to put this baby to test tomorrow (: !&lt;br /&gt;If it works I will be buying more ^.^</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t work as well as I&#x27;d hoped.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m getting older and have some dry places after my make up is on. This spray is the answer. I use the matte spray for my oily tzone and the dewy spray everywhere else. My make up stays put all day.</li>
            <li> SO PERFECT! THANKS I WILL BUYING MORE PRODUCTS IN YOUR STORE</li>
            <li> Love love love perfect makeup setting spray,  not blotchy at all, and no water marks left behind! Plus can&#x27;t beat the price!!!</li>
            <li> i was excited for these to come in but when i used them for the first time i honetly didnt see any difference. my make up didnt stay any longer ? ?</li>
            <li> Works like it says it does. Not bad pricing</li>
            <li> The dewy finish makes me look oily. But I love the matte finish. It works amazing, I definitely will buy again if I can just get a bigger matte finish bottle!</li>
            <li> Good price for 2 good products to use depending on my mood. Both work great... By the end of the day my makeup still looks pretty damn good</li>
            <li> No color, this is a setting spray for makeup.  This is especially helpful in the summer heat and really does make a difference.  Make up does not slide off ten minutes after you step out the door in the morning.  I use it every day.</li>
            <li> Products came in 3 days(including the day i ordered. I live in nyc). I was so surprised to come home to these. And just in time. Love NYX. And i love these sprays. At the local beauty supply one bottle is over 11$ so 2 for $13 is amazing.</li>
            <li> It holds my make up in place but after a few hours has my face oily.</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t used them enough to say I love or it&#x27;s just ok .. so so far so good.</li>
            <li> I ordered this product on a friday and received it on that monday. Shipping was not only quick but packaged well nothing was broken or missing. The Matte setting spray is amazing but try to spray both setting sprays a couple inches away from your face to get the best out of this product. It leaves makeup with a perfect set and is long lasting. The Dewy setting spray leaves the face moist and glowy. The dewy setting spray also to me would be best for someone with dryer skin. Its crazy how something as simple as a setting spray can do so much for your makeup.</li>
            <li> There is no point to using this expensive stuff.  Not only do you get a teeny tiny bottle, but it does absolutely nothing to &amp;#34;set&amp;#34; your makeup.  I have tried it now 3 times, and my makeup did not stay any better than without this stuff.  If there&#x27;s a secret to using this effectively, I&#x27;d love to be let in on it.</li>
            <li> They work great, I love both of them!</li>
            <li> Fast shipping. And I love the product I put my makeup on spray it on, went to work for 8 hours came back home and my makeup was still looking good. Wow Love it!!!!</li>
            <li> I like it so much better than a powder.  Seems to work but have only used it a few times.  So far, so good.  Good seller.  Quick delivery and received exactly as promised.</li>
            <li> if you have large poors not!!</li>
            <li> I really liked the outcome of the sprays. They held the make-up for most of the day. I&#x27;ve been spraying my face after I apply my moisturizer. I find the foundation has something to grab to and stay put to. I personally didn&#x27;t notice a vast difference between the matte and the dewy finishes. I mainly use these just as a pre-foundation spray and on humid days I&#x27;ll spray after I&#x27;ve completed my face. I would totally buy these again.</li>
            <li> Honestly this thing ruined my face, I used this thing and the SAME DAY it made my face break out SOOOO BAD!!! But I don&#x27;t know if it will work for some of you guys but for me it was H-O-R-R-I-B-L-E!!!</li>
            <li> It actually works. I work a 12th shift every day so I don&#x27;t have much time to touch up my make up.  My make up really dose stay in place with this setting spray</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like the product because it makes no difference whatsoever other than making my face wet. Good shipping though!!</li>
            <li> My grand-daughter loves this</li>
            <li> I love this product  my makeup stays on all day.</li>
            <li> Really sets your make as well as add hydration&lt;br /&gt;Good purchase. Glad that I bought it.&lt;br /&gt;You will not regret purchasing this item</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know what&#x27;s going on but I got 1 bottle only &amp; it was half way.</li>
            <li> Very nice products.  Real easy to use and it helps for your make-up to stay on for hours and hours.</li>
            <li> I love these! They work perfect</li>
            <li> Cant really tell a difference in the lasting power of my makeup when I use this. But i like the refreshing feeling i get when i spray it on!</li>
            <li> My first time trying it. I&#x27;m impressed with both dewy and matte finish. Now during the winter season i&#x27;ve been reaching for the dewy finish.</li>
            <li> Makeup stayed on good and it looked good after spraying. But my clients jump when I spray it to their face lol.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried a good amount of setting sprays and powders in a attempt to make my makeup last a work day.  I&#x27;ve used way more expensive sprays just to have my makeup slide off mere hours after I applied.  Setting powders make my skin look dry now that I&#x27;ve left my 20&#x27;s, so I&#x27;ve been on the hunt for the best setting spray.  This brand is the only stuff that helps my makeup last throughout work.  After work is when it falls apart, but without the spray I wouldn&#x27;t make it to lunch.  I&#x27;ve used primers, long lasting foundation, setting powders etc and nothing helped.  I&#x27;ve tried Urban Decay, Skindinavia, Ben Nye, Kat Von D and they&#x27;ve all let me down.  I saw the price of NYX plus two bottles and thought, what the hell.  After I apply my foundation, I tilt my head back and let the spray fall on my face and I&#x27;m good to go for the day.  Finally!  This stuff is awesome.  I use the dewy for winter and the matte for the summer.  You don&#x27;t want to spray too much, so the bottles last a decent amount of time.  I recommend it to anyone.</li>
            <li> Seemed to work as good as comparable high name brand setting sprays, really like the matte finish one!</li>
            <li> Love this stuff - same quality as the equivalent MAC or Urban Decay spray&#x27;s at much less cost. Alas, the sprayer doesn&#x27;t release in a fine mist (hence not five stars) - I just saved my Urban Decay travel size sprayers &amp; fill it with this each month. The bomb for achieving a smooth finish vs. &amp;#34;caked&amp;#34; look with a finishing powder.</li>
            <li> I bought these to set my make-up with and they do their job. I haven&#x27;t tried any other setting sprays so I really cant compare them to anything. overall I m happy with them. I really love the dewy finish.</li>
            <li> I can not say ENOUGH about these product!  I LOVE them!  True to everything they say. I use the dewy the most! Significantly has changes the look of my makeup!  I use it on all my clients. Long lasting and beautiful a little goes a long way. I will say that if you have dry skin at all the matte is not for you.</li>
            <li> these setting sprays are awesome and they do what they say.  I bought one in matte, which really looks great with a matte powder and there is no shine, long lasting and the  dewy which I use with bronzer and it illuminates my skin so awesome.  will recommend to people!</li>
            <li> it really does the job. i re ordered this product. i will say however, the matte is not as good as the dewy.</li>
            <li> I love these..its not too expensive...and it sets my makeup...it does exactly what it says.....Will buy again.</li>
            <li> this spray I love it it feels wonderful it makes my make up last long all day</li>
            <li> My favorite makeup setting spray at an affordable price.  Both the matte and the dewy work equally well.  I highly recommend both of these items purchased separately or together as I purchased them.</li>
            <li> I already had some quick looks on youtube about this products , and some did like it and some dint...&lt;br /&gt;so i really dint know what to expect , but it was really small ... and its too small for this kinda&lt;br /&gt;money really , but i dont regret it becuase its still working on me</li>
            <li> By far better than any other setting spray out there. Ive used multiple sprays, and this brand even kicks Urban Decay&#x27;s booty - better in price and quality!</li>
            <li> I have enjoyed the Makeup Setting Spray I have not had any problems with it. A great deal! That all</li>
            <li> Great price for a two pack. This mist lengthens makeup wear time and sets it. I prefer the dewy formula but both work fine. Just be sure to hold the bottle about arm&#x27;s length away so you don&#x27;t make your face wet. I have experienced no irritation or breakouts from these mists and I love how they make my face look - especially the dewy one. They do lengthen my makeup wear time and set it for the day. I have dry skin so I try to avoid using a lot of powder. These mists do the job of a setting powder without making my face look dry and unnatural.</li>
            <li> Great&lt;br /&gt;does the work&lt;br /&gt;I think I like both. I dont think there is a big difference between them too...&lt;br /&gt;I use both.&lt;br /&gt;love it</li>
            <li> I LOVE this product. Second order so far. If your wondering if this is an miracle in a bottle, no it isn&#x27;t, but it&#x27;s pretty close! It does leave a somewhat tight feeling on your face, but you do get use to it if you want to set and matte your face. It does wonders for the contour and blush areas! Not a super fine mister, have to blend excess with fingers. &amp;#34;Sometimes&amp;#34; I do need to powder my t-zone but really it&#x27;s &amp;#34;depending&amp;#34; on your diet and so many other factors during your day or night before. The shipping was extremely fast! The price was right. To be honest, the time spent without this spray was a nightmare! So I definitely recommend this product!&lt;br /&gt;-Haven&#x27;t experimented with dewy looks, so no review for the dewy spray.</li>
            <li> Excellent product worth the experience</li>
