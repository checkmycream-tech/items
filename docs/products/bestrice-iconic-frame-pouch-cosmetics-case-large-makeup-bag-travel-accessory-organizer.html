            <li>It is a nice large size cosmetic bag.</li>
            <li>and I don&#x27;t want to carry my HUGE purse around.  </li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t fit all my make up in it...</li>
            <li>it does not look cheap.</li>
            <li>Fit all of my makeup in comfortably.</li>
            <li>Plus, it was cheap.  </li>
            <li>I came across this bag while looking for a cute fashionable large makeup bag for traveling or staying the night at a friends house.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li>Good for a smaller makeup bag, if you don&#x27;t use/have a lot of make up!</li>
            <li>Great quality, shipping was quick, but I&#x27;m only marking it four stars because it was not as large as it claimed.</li>
            <li>Just received this bag a few moments ago and although it is a very great quality bag, it lacks in size which I am very upset about.</li>
            <li>This is exactly what I was expecting!</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s pretty roomy!</li>
            <li>Littler than I expected, but still good size.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a really good quality pouch, super spacious and fits all my everyday makeup and skin care items.</li>
            <li>I only wish the navy color was available but the black still looks good!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s lightweight which is great for my purse that is rather small.</li>
            <li>For the price, it is exactly what I wanted</li>
            <li>Cute and basic.</li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t consider this a large makeup bag though.</li>
            <li>I expected it to be a bit bigger being labeled as a large case, but still is a good quality pouch.</li>
            <li>Also, really spacious.</li>
            <li>I cost was very affordable, I&#x27;ve received a lot of compliments.  </li>
            <li>still has rooms for other brushes/eyeliners, maybe 2 more lipsticks too</li>
            <li>It holds a lot more than expected!</li>
            <li>Nothing fancy or high quality here.</li>
            <li>Nice size, not too big or little.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re looking for a smaller bag to not hold very much, this is the bag for you.</li>
            <li>bag is marked at a crazy good price for what we get!</li>
            <li>The companies version of a large cosmetic bag and mine are not the same.</li>
            <li>I needed a pancil case because my old one had a broken zipper, actually this is a face longchamp makeup bag, but looks cute</li>
            <li>I know I could have bought a real purse, but I won&#x27;t need it all of the time, it&#x27;s water proof and fits in my regular purse or other bags for travel.  </li>

            <li> I should&#x27;ve checked the dimensions before ordering. The companies version of a large cosmetic bag and mine are not the same. I would call this a small one.</li>
            <li> It is a nice large size cosmetic bag.</li>
            <li> Cute bag. But small. Not like in the pics at all. :(. Can&#x27;t fit all my make up in it...</li>
            <li> love it! it does not look cheap. and it can put a lot of my makeup in this purse. i have my 7 inch length of eyeshadows, face powder, 5 lipsticks, 4 inch length of powder brush, and2 eyeshadow brushes, 1 eyebrow brush, 1 canceler brush. still has rooms for other brushes/eyeliners, maybe 2 more lipsticks too</li>
            <li> I love it. Fit all of my makeup in comfortably. I have recommended to a friend and would definitely buy again.</li>
            <li> I bought it to use as a small purse when I do not have pockets and I don&#x27;t want to carry my HUGE purse around.  It fits all I need in it perfectly, phone included with room to spare.

            <li> Perfect cosmetic bag for your purse!!</li>
            <li> It even has a rubberized interior to keep makeup spills contained. Fits in my big purse perfectly. The perfect length to allow makeup brushes and pencils to lay flat on the bottom. Nice size, not too big or little.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s simple, sleek, and the perfect size! I only wish the navy color was available but the black still looks good! It holds a lot more than expected!</li>
            <li> Perfect for my makeup!</li>
            <li> This is a basic makeup bag. Nothing fancy or high quality here. It&#x27;s lightweight which is great for my purse that is rather small. I wouldn&#x27;t consider this a large makeup bag though. It&#x27;s for your everyday products, not travel. If you have a small purse or are trying to make your purse lighter, then I would say try it, but it&#x27;s not amazing.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a really good quality pouch, super spacious and fits all my everyday makeup and skin care items. I love it!</li>
            <li> Great fits all my makeup on the go</li>
            <li> Not the nicest quality but you get what you pay for. Cute and basic. Good for a smaller makeup bag, if you don&#x27;t use/have a lot of make up!</li>
            <li> Great quality, shipping was quick, but I&#x27;m only marking it four stars because it was not as large as it claimed.</li>
            <li> Go it in the mail today. This is exactly what I was expecting! I love itüòç! And its waterproof! I wish I could give this more then 5 stars !</li>

            <li> Just what I wanted! Its very spacious and the quality is good. I love it!</li>
            <li> Wonderful product! Super sophisticated look!</li>
            <li> Just received this bag a few moments ago and although it is a very great quality bag, it lacks in size which I am very upset about. I was looking to buy as the make up bag to hold everything I needed it to and it looks like this bag may just end up being for my makeup brushes. If you&#x27;re looking for a smaller bag to not hold very much, this is the bag for you. If you&#x27;re looking for large make up bag to hold everything, you&#x27;re search continues :/</li>
            <li> Littler than I expected, but still good size.</li>
            <li> It broke when I got it in the mail</li>
            <li> I love this bag it&#x27;s perfect for your purse or just in your house</li>
            <li> I needed a pancil case because my old one had a broken zipper, actually this is a face longchamp makeup bag, but looks cute and it&#x27;s pretty roomy! Nice product</li>
            <li> Roomy, easy to clean, works well!  Fits the bill.</li>
            <li> This makeup bag is the best. I cost was very affordable, I&#x27;ve received a lot of compliments.  It looks like I paid more than I did.  Great purchase.</li>
            <li> nice bag.  happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li> This case is great for carrying your makeup and roomy enough to hold all of your things easily.  For the price, you won&#x27;t go wrong.</li>
            <li> Great travel makeup bag.</li>
            <li> I expected it to be a bit bigger being labeled as a large case, but still is a good quality pouch.</li>
            <li> I came across this bag while looking for a cute fashionable large makeup bag for traveling or staying the night at a friends house.&lt;br /&gt;This bag is marked at a crazy good price for what we get! I love it!&lt;br /&gt;Very spacious, chic exterior, and the material seems like it could wipe away makeup spills easily.&lt;br /&gt;AND it came in the mail 24 hours after i ordered it, and that was with standard shipping. Awesome.&lt;br /&gt;EASILY a five star rating.</li>
