            <li> Fresh White Musk is a subtle fragrance that lingers just enough not to overpower the senses.  </li>
            <li> This is terrible,  the small sample I brought walmart for 1.99 was better more concentrated.</li>
            <li> The lotion and the spray is very watered down so disappointed.</li>
            <li> Received this product today, was not thrilled.</li>
            <li> it is very subtle</li>
            <li> what is wrong with that picture????</li>
