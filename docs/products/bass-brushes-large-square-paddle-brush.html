            <li>Love the feel of wood.</li>
            <li>I got this brush after reading reviews from others about the wonderful wooden bristles.  </li>
            <li>Way better than the plastics.</li>
            <li>Glad I did.</li>
            <li>People always complement how shiny and healthy my hair looks, even at the ends.</li>
            <li>I thought this was the \\&quot;Olivia Garden Healthy Hair Ionic Massage Hair</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t pull my grand kids hair out of their head.</li>
            <li>Everyone loves this brush - I have given it as a gift more times than I can say.</li>
            <li>I will also recommend this item to others! :-)</li>
            <li>I love it, doesn&#x27;t hurt.</li>
            <li>brush arrived and has a sturdy handle, lovely cushioned pad for the many finely-rounded wood bristles.  </li>
            <li>Great brush and very sturdy</li>
            <li>Love wood brushes.  </li>
            <li>I love this brush.  </li>
            <li>Bamboo seemed like a good renewable and &amp;#34;green&amp;#34; choice and the price was right.  </li>
            <li>Very smooth bristles and easy to handle.</li>
            <li>They have LONG hair, and this brush has been the best one for their hair.</li>
            <li>I use my own mix of pure Argan oil and Lavender oil to have a nice smelling conditioner for my hair and it has not affected the brush in any way.</li>
            <li>Best brush for very long hair.  </li>
            <li>My sister had purchased brush by Kent, which is significantly more expensive, but this lovely perfectly made brush is great not just in name</li>
            <li>It leaves my hair silky smooth and does not produce static.  </li>
            <li>Bristles really feel good on the scalp.  </li>
            <li>This brush is awesome as I feel like it is more gentle when brushing out knots in your hair or while your hair is wet(at its most fragile state).</li>
            <li>It is very large, goes through my hair nicely.  </li>
            <li>Great paddle brush my hair feels smooth and soft after I finish using this</li>
            <li>It detangles my curly hair easily without pulling.</li>
            <li>It easily detangles and smooths my hair.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had this brush for two years now and it&#x27;s still going strong.</li>
            <li>Brushing with Bamboo has many great benefits to hair, keeping it smooth, glossy and also stimulates your scalp to encourage hair growth and proper blood flow.</li>
            <li>Very good quality, no missing bristles and very gentle on the hair.</li>
            <li>i love love love the way the wood bristles feel on my scalp, &amp; make my hair soft &amp; static free.</li>
            <li>, doesn&#x27;t rip it out, but I don&#x27;t enjoy using this brush.</li>
            <li>I really enjoy this brush.  </li>
            <li>Such a great product.</li>
            <li>Helps me remove tangles smoothly without breaking my hair.</li>
            <li>I am surprised at how quick I can separate my hair and use my dryer to get a good, sleek smooth look.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a really nice, high quality hairbrush.  </li>
            <li>This Bass Large Square Paddle Brush is beautiful!</li>
            <li>and they gave me full refund for the item.</li>
            <li>I have thick curly hair and this brush is great for blow drying!</li>
            <li>i would definitely purchase again, but its so well made, it will be a good while before I need to.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re looking for a wonderful brush with genuine wooden bristles, get the brush I ordered at the same time I ordered this (something less than deluxe) one.  </li>
            <li>The weight and shape are pleasant and the &amp;#34;pins&amp;#34; (?) are not too sharp.</li>
            <li>Natural brushes are recommended to maintain hair length because plastic/metal brushes make static in the hair and can cause it to break per a YouTube channel.</li>
            <li>I believe it does help to distribute your natural oils from your scalp to the ends of your hair- which needs moisture the most.</li>
            <li>My old one had lasted me many years</li>
            <li>We&#x27;ll see how it holds up over the long term, but right out of the packaging, I&#x27;m very pleased.</li>
            <li>I have never tried a brush other than the nylon cheap kind --</li>
            <li>So far, with the long, semi-rough strokes I take to brush my longer abundant hair, the bamboo bristles stay in perfect shape, no breakage; they take a slight beating (hehe!).</li>
            <li>The brush is a good size paddle brush and is great for long thick hair.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve seen brushes of a similar nature costing upwards of 50 or 100 something dollars (MIND BOGGLING), but if you are looking for a good brush start here with this brush especially if you need easy detangling.  </li>
            <li>Living in dry climate, my hair is full of static unless I use the bamboo brushes.</li>
            <li>thank you very much.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a nice massage brush and the pins are bamboo, but the amount of STATIC it generates is ridiculous</li>
            <li>Still have the first one.</li>
            <li>This one is much better constructed and I can see it will last forever!  </li>
            <li>Exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li>I bought a paddle wooden brush made in Italy paid much more</li>
            <li>They are great for detangling thick curly hair in the shower.</li>
            <li>This hairbrush purchased from Amazon exactly meets my needs.  </li>
            <li>I ordered it after reading lots of reviews and looking at many different prices and products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It feels great and goes through my thick hair and massages my scalp.</li>
            <li>The bamboo bristles do significantly cut down on the amount of static in my hair, which is why I tried it.</li>
            <li>The only thing I am not as pleased with is it weighs less and doesn&#x27;t feel as nice when held.</li>
            <li>Wasn&#x27;t sure what to expect because it was such a reasonable price.</li>
            <li>- if you use this brush on dry hair, you can get a lot of static from the plastic bristles.</li>
            <li>If that isn&#x27;t enough you can wash it so easily.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a large brush and definitely keeps my long straight locks flowing free from static and knots.  </li>
            <li>THIS IS THE BEST BRUSH FOR MY THICK HAIR &amp;#34;EVER&amp;#34; !!!</li>
            <li>Hard on the scalp, scratchy, doesn&#x27;t feel good.</li>
            <li>Very well made.</li>
            <li>It really keeps your hair from getting damaged while brushing, which is nice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Highly reccomend this product!</li>
            <li>I was about to spend too much for a Mason Pearson brush.&lt;br /&gt;But</li>
            <li>The brush is very stimulating to my scalp.  </li>
            <li>Fast shipping.</li>
            <li>I really like this brush.</li>
            <li>Brush seems great but one of the bristles came broken.</li>
            <li>It goes through curly hair really well.</li>
            <li>I recommend this to anyone who wants buy this product.</li>
            <li>It is also a very durable brush.</li>
            <li>and it is defective due to the static)</li>
            <li>it un tangles my very very long hair easily.</li>
            <li>My Aveda brush similar to this broke, so I quickly ordered this one online.</li>
            <li>I will never go back to any other kind</li>
            <li>B000KM3NDO Earth Therapeutics Natural Wood Pin Massage Brush (Large)]]</li>
            <li>right up then I just l let it dry overnight (after making sure to squeeze as much out of the pneumatic pad or let it drain tine side down depending on how you cleaned it.  </li>
            <li>So much nicer than any old plastic brush with nylon bristles.</li>
            <li>I have not experienced a lot of hair lost and it feels really good on my scalp.</li>
            <li>It leaves my long thick hair silky smooth and doesn&#x27;t produce static whatsoever.</li>
            <li>Was way overdue for a new paddle brush.</li>
            <li>Brand NEW, has that brand new smell.</li>
            <li>The second one was not like the first, the Bristol were not wood</li>
            <li>No more static and</li>
            <li>when i wanted a bigger one for blow drying &amp; mistakenly bought another brand with the little balls on the end of bristles, which made it an absolute pain to clean!</li>
            <li>i have the bass oval brush that i use daily &amp; love.</li>
            <li>The average brush only brushes the top of my hair and don&#x27;t go through</li>
            <li>I have psoriasis and this brush gets right to the roots of my hair removing loose skin.  </li>
            <li>Very high quality and will last forever.</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s really the only reason I kept this brush instead of returning it.  </li>
            <li>I definitely expected (much, much) better, and this ensures that I won&#x27;t be buying any Bass products again.  </li>
            <li>I bought this after I finally admitted my original square paddle brush from Bass needed to be replaced.</li>
            <li>Finally the bristles started falling out and after 12 years we had to order a new one.  </li>
            <li>The wooden bristles redistribute your  hair&#x27;s natural oils making it softer.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d been on the hunt for a new wood-handled, wooden-bristled hair brush for a long time.  </li>
            <li>really disappointed - it&#x27;s an okay brush, but nothing special.  </li>
            <li>I have long hair and needed a new brush with wooden bristles, so I decided to give this one a try.  </li>
            <li>It may seem a bit expensive for a hair brush, but to me, it&#x27;s very well worth it!</li>

            <li> Everyone loves this brush - I have given it as a gift more times than I can say.</li>
            <li> I will also recommend this item to others! :-)</li>
            <li> I love it, doesn&#x27;t hurt.</li>
            <li> brush arrived and has a sturdy handle, lovely cushioned pad for the many finely-rounded wood bristles.  </li>
            <li> Great brush and very sturdy</li>
            <li> Love wood brushes.  </li>
            <li> I love this brush.  </li>
            <li> Bamboo seemed like a good renewable and &amp;#34;green&amp;#34; choice and the price was right.  </li>
            <li> Very smooth bristles and easy to handle.</li>
            <li> They have LONG hair, and this brush has been the best one for their hair.</li>
            <li> I use my own mix of pure Argan oil and Lavender oil to have a nice smelling conditioner for my hair and it has not affected the brush in any way.</li>
            <li> Best brush for very long hair.  </li>
            <li> My sister had purchased brush by Kent, which is significantly more expensive, but this lovely perfectly made brush is great not just in name</li>
            <li> It leaves my hair silky smooth and does not produce static.  </li>
            <li> Bristles really feel good on the scalp.  </li>
            <li> This brush is awesome as I feel like it is more gentle when brushing out knots in your hair or while your hair is wet(at its most fragile state).</li>
            <li> It is very large, goes through my hair nicely.  </li>
            <li> Great paddle brush my hair feels smooth and soft after I finish using this</li>
            <li> It detangles my curly hair easily without pulling.</li>
            <li> It easily detangles and smooths my hair.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this brush for two years now and it&#x27;s still going strong.</li>
            <li> Brushing with Bamboo has many great benefits to hair, keeping it smooth, glossy and also stimulates your scalp to encourage hair growth and proper blood flow.</li>
            <li> Very good quality, no missing bristles and very gentle on the hair.</li>
            <li> i love love love the way the wood bristles feel on my scalp, &amp; make my hair soft &amp; static free.</li>
            <li> , doesn&#x27;t rip it out, but I don&#x27;t enjoy using this brush.</li>
            <li> I really enjoy this brush.  </li>
            <li> Such a great product.</li>
            <li> Helps me remove tangles smoothly without breaking my hair.</li>
            <li> I am surprised at how quick I can separate my hair and use my dryer to get a good, sleek smooth look.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a really nice, high quality hairbrush.  </li>
            <li> This Bass Large Square Paddle Brush is beautiful!</li>
            <li> and they gave me full refund for the item.</li>
            <li> I have thick curly hair and this brush is great for blow drying!</li>
            <li> i would definitely purchase again, but its so well made, it will be a good while before I need to.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re looking for a wonderful brush with genuine wooden bristles, get the brush I ordered at the same time I ordered this (something less than deluxe) one.  </li>
            <li> The weight and shape are pleasant and the &amp;#34;pins&amp;#34; (?) are not too sharp.</li>
            <li> Natural brushes are recommended to maintain hair length because plastic/metal brushes make static in the hair and can cause it to break per a YouTube channel.</li>
            <li> I believe it does help to distribute your natural oils from your scalp to the ends of your hair- which needs moisture the most.</li>
            <li> My old one had lasted me many years</li>
            <li> We&#x27;ll see how it holds up over the long term, but right out of the packaging, I&#x27;m very pleased.</li>
            <li> I have never tried a brush other than the nylon cheap kind --</li>
            <li> So far, with the long, semi-rough strokes I take to brush my longer abundant hair, the bamboo bristles stay in perfect shape, no breakage; they take a slight beating (hehe!).</li>
            <li> The brush is a good size paddle brush and is great for long thick hair.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve seen brushes of a similar nature costing upwards of 50 or 100 something dollars (MIND BOGGLING), but if you are looking for a good brush start here with this brush especially if you need easy detangling.  </li>
            <li> Living in dry climate, my hair is full of static unless I use the bamboo brushes.</li>
            <li> thank you very much.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a nice massage brush and the pins are bamboo, but the amount of STATIC it generates is ridiculous</li>
            <li> Still have the first one.</li>
            <li> This one is much better constructed and I can see it will last forever!  </li>
            <li> Exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li> I bought a paddle wooden brush made in Italy paid much more</li>
            <li> They are great for detangling thick curly hair in the shower.</li>
            <li> This hairbrush purchased from Amazon exactly meets my needs.  </li>
            <li> I ordered it after reading lots of reviews and looking at many different prices and products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It feels great and goes through my thick hair and massages my scalp.</li>
            <li> The bamboo bristles do significantly cut down on the amount of static in my hair, which is why I tried it.</li>
            <li> The only thing I am not as pleased with is it weighs less and doesn&#x27;t feel as nice when held.</li>
            <li> Wasn&#x27;t sure what to expect because it was such a reasonable price.</li>
            <li> - if you use this brush on dry hair, you can get a lot of static from the plastic bristles.</li>
            <li> If that isn&#x27;t enough you can wash it so easily.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a large brush and definitely keeps my long straight locks flowing free from static and knots.  </li>
            <li> THIS IS THE BEST BRUSH FOR MY THICK HAIR &amp;#34;EVER&amp;#34; !!!</li>
            <li> Hard on the scalp, scratchy, doesn&#x27;t feel good.</li>
            <li> Very well made.</li>
            <li> It really keeps your hair from getting damaged while brushing, which is nice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Highly reccomend this product!</li>
            <li> I was about to spend too much for a Mason Pearson brush.&lt;br /&gt;But</li>
            <li> The brush is very stimulating to my scalp.  </li>
            <li> Fast shipping.</li>
            <li> I really like this brush.</li>
            <li> Brush seems great but one of the bristles came broken.</li>
            <li> It goes through curly hair really well.</li>
            <li> I recommend this to anyone who wants buy this product.</li>
            <li> It is also a very durable brush.</li>
            <li> and it is defective due to the static)</li>
            <li> it un tangles my very very long hair easily.</li>
            <li> My Aveda brush similar to this broke, so I quickly ordered this one online.</li>
            <li> I will never go back to any other kind</li>
            <li> B000KM3NDO Earth Therapeutics Natural Wood Pin Massage Brush (Large)]]</li>
            <li> right up then I just l let it dry overnight (after making sure to squeeze as much out of the pneumatic pad or let it drain tine side down depending on how you cleaned it.  </li>
            <li> So much nicer than any old plastic brush with nylon bristles.</li>
            <li> I have not experienced a lot of hair lost and it feels really good on my scalp.</li>
            <li> It leaves my long thick hair silky smooth and doesn&#x27;t produce static whatsoever.</li>
            <li> Was way overdue for a new paddle brush.</li>
            <li> Brand NEW, has that brand new smell.</li>
            <li> The second one was not like the first, the Bristol were not wood</li>
            <li> No more static and</li>
            <li> when i wanted a bigger one for blow drying &amp; mistakenly bought another brand with the little balls on the end of bristles, which made it an absolute pain to clean!</li>
            <li> i have the bass oval brush that i use daily &amp; love.</li>
            <li> The average brush only brushes the top of my hair and don&#x27;t go through</li>
            <li> I have psoriasis and this brush gets right to the roots of my hair removing loose skin.  </li>
            <li> Very high quality and will last forever.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s really the only reason I kept this brush instead of returning it.  </li>
            <li> I definitely expected (much, much) better, and this ensures that I won&#x27;t be buying any Bass products again.  </li>
            <li> I bought this after I finally admitted my original square paddle brush from Bass needed to be replaced.</li>
            <li> Finally the bristles started falling out and after 12 years we had to order a new one.  </li>
            <li> The wooden bristles redistribute your  hair&#x27;s natural oils making it softer.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d been on the hunt for a new wood-handled, wooden-bristled hair brush for a long time.  </li>
            <li> really disappointed - it&#x27;s an okay brush, but nothing special.  </li>
            <li> I have long hair and needed a new brush with wooden bristles, so I decided to give this one a try.  </li>
            <li> It may seem a bit expensive for a hair brush, but to me, it&#x27;s very well worth it!</li>
            <li> Boar is better at forcing stray hairs to lay down, but not good for detangling.  </li>
            <li> Boy this is a high quality brush, and I have thick natural 4B hair.</li>
            <li> my wife and youngest daughter have long hair and these are the only brushes that get used.</li>
            <li> So if you have long hair, wavy, and or curly hair this is definitely the brush.</li>
            <li> The brush is definitely not for dry hair.</li>
            <li> I threw my other brushes in the back of a drawer, because I only want to use this one.</li>
            <li> Bought this for long curly hair based on</li>
            <li> (I have long, straight, thick hair).</li>
            <li> I will definitely be sticking with Bass Brushes in the future,</li>
            <li> Had my last one for nine years, and only then did the rubber pad start to break down.</li>
            <li> i have very long thick hair and this brush works very well in my hair.</li>
            <li> I have very long, fairly thick hair, and I have saved so much time brushing my hair.</li>
            <li> and I use it to brush my long hair both wet and dry.  </li>
            <li> but, this Bass Paddle Brush not only brush my hair</li>
            <li> I loose a lot of hair and this brush has helped with my excess shedding.</li>
            <li> perfect,fast receipt of the brush and less than at local pharmacy</li>
            <li> I use the Earth Therapeutics one all the time, and reserve this brush for just after I wash my hair, when it&#x27;s still wet</li>
            <li> But it definitely appears to have had wooden bristles in the past, which have been replaced by plastic bristles, and there is no disclaimer to indicate that the previous reviews no longer apply.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> i now use that other one as a backscratcher, &amp; this one for drying~</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll buy this one, before any other kind/brand ever again.</li>
            <li> At the time I don&#x27;t know if that is an indication of the quality and other bristles would start breaking or a problem with packaging.</li>
            <li> Because bamboo can handle being wet without damage you can use it in or out of the shower or with a blowdryer!  </li>
            <li> The wood pins are a little sharper than the brushes that have the rounded plastic tips but not so sharp that it scratches.</li>
            <li> I have somewhat thick, wavy hair that is generally dry.</li>
            <li> The only thing is eventually the bristles break off in very thick hair and the wood degrades after about 6 months if you use it in the shower.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve dropped it a few times and nothing happened to it; no cracks in the bamboo and no bristles fell out.  </li>
            <li> I brush slowly with it, and yes eventually less &amp; less hair is in brush.</li>
            <li> also, the bristles are long and go all the way through my thick hair!</li>
            <li> The bristles were stiff.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure where people got the idea that this brush doesn&#x27;t have bamboo bristles.</li>
            <li> no more plastic/nylon brushes, bristles or handles for me.</li>
            <li> I did have a hard time finding a brush on Amazon that was not an add-on.  </li>
            <li> and instead I got horrible short plastic bristles.</li>
            <li> After a few months of use it was bad packaging or a bad seller.</li>
            <li> Mine came with a wood base and bristles.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed !!</li>

            <li> Hard on the scalp, scratchy, doesn&#x27;t feel good. Detangles hair well, doesn&#x27;t rip it out, but I don&#x27;t enjoy using this brush. Will keep it as a back up but for for daily use.</li>
            <li> These brushes last for ever!! this is my second in 12 years. if you take care of it, it will take care of you.</li>
            <li> Bought this for long curly hair based on a &amp;#34;what&#x27;s the best brush for your hair type&amp;#34; review. Wasn&#x27;t sure what to expect because it was such a reasonable price. But boy howdy is this thing of quality.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Knowing what I know now with how well it works with my hair would buy again for two or even three times the price.</li>
            <li> I have long hair and needed a new brush with wooden bristles, so I decided to give this one a try.  It is very large, goes through my hair nicely.  Absolutely love it!</li>
            <li> i have the bass oval brush that i use daily &amp; love. when i wanted a bigger one for blow drying &amp; mistakenly bought another brand with the little balls on the end of bristles, which made it an absolute pain to clean! i now use that other one as a backscratcher, &amp; this one for drying~ i love love love the way the wood bristles feel on my scalp, &amp; make my hair soft &amp; static free.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a nice massage brush and the pins are bamboo, but the amount of STATIC it generates is ridiculous (I have long, straight, thick hair). The brush is definitely not for dry hair. Amazon said I could keep the brush (I guess because I&#x27;ve used it and it is defective due to the static) and they gave me full refund for the item. I will search for another wood pin brush and will try the earth therapeutics brush next.</li>
            <li> Living in dry climate, my hair is full of static unless I use the bamboo brushes. This is my second one in 20+ years. Still have the first one. This one is much better constructed and I can see it will last forever!  Love the feel of wood.</li>
            <li> Boy this is a high quality brush, and I have thick natural 4B hair. Natural brushes are recommended to maintain hair length because plastic/metal brushes make static in the hair and can cause it to break per a YouTube channel. So I thought I&#x27;d try it, and I must say my hair is longer. I brush slowly with it, and yes eventually less &amp; less hair is in brush. I suggest you try it. I am very pleased with it.</li>
            <li> Best brush ever.  Had my last one for nine years, and only then did the rubber pad start to break down.</li>
            <li> I got this brush after reading reviews from others about the wonderful wooden bristles.  However, this brush does NOT have wooden bristles - they&#x27;re plastic.  The description doesn&#x27;t indicate the type of bristles, either plastic or wooden, so it&#x27;s not misleading in that sense.  But it definitely appears to have had wooden bristles in the past, which have been replaced by plastic bristles, and there is no disclaimer to indicate that the previous reviews no longer apply.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m really disappointed - it&#x27;s an okay brush, but nothing special.  I definitely expected (much, much) better, and this ensures that I won&#x27;t be buying any Bass products again.  If you&#x27;re looking for a wonderful brush with genuine wooden bristles, get the brush I ordered at the same time I ordered this (something less than deluxe) one.  It&#x27;s the [[ASIN:B000KM3NDO Earth Therapeutics Natural Wood Pin Massage Brush (Large)]] and that&#x27;s the best brush I&#x27;ve ever owned.  I use the Earth Therapeutics one all the time, and reserve this brush for just after I wash my hair, when it&#x27;s still wet - I don&#x27;t have to worry about ruining the plastic bristles.  That&#x27;s really the only reason I kept this brush instead of returning it.  Fair warning though - if you use this brush on dry hair, you can get a lot of static from the plastic bristles.</li>
            <li> I really enjoy this brush.  It leaves my hair silky smooth and does not produce static.  It&#x27;s a really nice, high quality hairbrush.  The weight and shape are pleasant and the &amp;#34;pins&amp;#34; (?) are not too sharp.</li>
            <li> Great Brush that massages the scalp and is really good at getting out tangles.</li>
            <li> Amazing brush. Way better than the plastics.</li>
            <li> Works great.  Very well made.</li>
            <li> this product was on time and as described. this product was on time and as described. thank you very much.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this brush for two years now and it&#x27;s still going strong. The handle is beautiful bamboo and the bristles are bamboo too! It really keeps your hair from getting damaged while brushing, which is nice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If I had to guess, I&#x27;d say that this brush would easily last another 5 or 10 years. Such a great product.</li>
            <li> Love it! I loose a lot of hair and this brush has helped with my excess shedding. Highly reccomend this product!</li>
            <li> This feels so good on my scalp I threw my other brushes in the back of a drawer, because I only want to use this one. The bamboo bristles do significantly cut down on the amount of static in my hair, which is why I tried it. Glad I did.</li>
            <li> Ordered this brush and liked it so I ordered another one for my daughter. Very disappointed !! The second one was not like the first, the Bristol were not wood and instead I got horrible short plastic bristles. Never know what you will get, you order the same thing you should get the same advertised product. Doesn&#x27;t even look like the pictures bristles</li>
            <li> THIS IS THE BEST BRUSH FOR MY THICK HAIR &amp;#34;EVER&amp;#34; !!!</li>
            <li> Best brush for very long hair.  I donate my hair once it has grown to my waist and this brush is excellent for getting my tangles out.  People always complement how shiny and healthy my hair looks, even at the ends.</li>
            <li> We had this brush model for 12 years and loved it!  Finally the bristles started falling out and after 12 years we had to order a new one.  I like the bamboo, but the bristles are closer together and one of them fell out on the second day we used the brush.  We are waiting to see if this brush is as good as they used to make them.</li>
            <li> I thought this was the \\&quot;Olivia Garden Healthy Hair Ionic Massage Hair Brush\\&quot; [[ASIN:B0018S2L1Y B0018S2L1Y]] I had ordered before... just not the same quality at all!</li>
            <li> Exactly what I wanted. Had ordered one before and had great service both times. Very satisfied!</li>
            <li> I was about to spend too much for a Mason Pearson brush.&lt;br /&gt;But then I found this brush.  I like that it is bamboo which is sustainable.  Very pleased.</li>
            <li> Feels so nice against your scalp</li>
            <li> The brush is very stimulating to my scalp.  It was a excellent purchase.</li>
            <li> Very good quality, no missing bristles and very gentle on the hair. Distributes oils throughout the hair.</li>
            <li> Excellent hair brush i have very long thick hair and this brush works very well in my hair. I bought a paddle wooden brush made in Italy paid much more and i didn&#x27;t likethe why it would go through my hair like it couldn&#x27;t get all my hair . The brush is a good size paddle brush and is great for long thick hair.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t pull my grand kids hair out of their head. They have LONG hair, and this brush has been the best one for their hair. It detangles and lets them brush their hair without pain. I bought them one each. Nice quality and price. I&#x27;ll buy this one, before any other kind/brand ever again.</li>
            <li> perfect,fast receipt of the brush and less than at local pharmacy</li>
            <li> I bought this as a gift for my daughter-in-law and she says she loves it. So much nicer than any old plastic brush with nylon bristles.</li>
            <li> I have never tried a brush other than the nylon cheap kind -- I was pleasantly surprised how great this brush felt running across my scalp!</li>
            <li> It smelled funky, like petroleum... It also did not brush as well as I&#x27;d hoped. The bristles were stiff. ugh!</li>
            <li> This brush has a great feel to it.  I don&#x27;t use it for styling with my blow dryer...just for a nice brush out.</li>
            <li> Everyone loves this brush - I have given it as a gift more times than I can say. It&#x27;s like a massage for your scalp!</li>
            <li> This brush is awesome. I have not experienced a lot of hair lost and it feels really good on my scalp.</li>
            <li> My Aveda brush similar to this broke, so I quickly ordered this one online. To my surprise it works as well as my beloved $25 Aveda brush! I LOVE it!</li>
            <li> My daughter loves this brush</li>
            <li> Awesome sturdy bamboo brush! It leaves my long thick hair silky smooth and doesn&#x27;t produce static whatsoever. A very satisfied customer! I will also recommend this item to others! :-)</li>
            <li> Was way overdue for a new paddle brush. This one feels great and goes through the hair with ease. Niiiiiice</li>
            <li> Best bamboo brush ever! Love how it massages my scalp!</li>
            <li> I love it, doesn&#x27;t hurt. It&#x27;s staticy but I guess I have to break it in. Fast shipping. Brand NEW, has that brand new smell. I love it, great price for it too</li>
            <li> I have very long, fairly thick hair, and I have saved so much time brushing my hair. This brush is durable, and helps keep my hair looking and feeling great.</li>
            <li> Best brush I&#x27;ve ever owned.  Very light weight, never pulls.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure where people got the idea that this brush doesn&#x27;t have bamboo bristles. I got mine today and I&#x27;m very pleased with it. The entire brush except for the pad the bristles poke through is bamboo - including the bristles. I hope this lives up to the recommendation I received. I&#x27;m looking forward to healthier hair.</li>
            <li> I love this brush!  The wooden bristles redistribute your  hair&#x27;s natural oils making it softer. The brush itself is great quality; I gave away all of my plastic ones upon reciving it. Very impressed.</li>
            <li> This is the third brush of this type from this brand this I have bought.  They are great for detangling thick curly hair in the shower. The only thing is eventually the bristles break off in very thick hair and the wood degrades after about 6 months if you use it in the shower. I won&#x27;t use anything else.</li>
            <li> I bought this after I finally admitted my original square paddle brush from Bass needed to be replaced. Mine came with a wood base and bristles. The only thing I am not as pleased with is it weighs less and doesn&#x27;t feel as nice when held.</li>
            <li> I love this fricken brush....feels AWESOME  on my head</li>
            <li> Best brush ever!  I use it every day and it works amazing!</li>
            <li> Excellent brush for my wavy hair! No snag or pulling.  Very smooth bristles and easy to handle.</li>
            <li> Great brush! Helps me remove tangles smoothly without breaking my hair.</li>
            <li> I really like this brush. It brushes through my tangles and doesn&#x27;t hurt.</li>
            <li> This hairbrush purchased from Amazon exactly meets my needs.  I have psoriasis and this brush gets right to the roots of my hair removing loose skin.  It feels good on the scalp causing no discomfort.  I did have a hard time finding a brush on Amazon that was not an add-on.  Iam finding that an increasing problem for mr with Amazon.</li>
            <li> Brush seems great but one of the bristles came broken. At the time I don&#x27;t know if that is an indication of the quality and other bristles would start breaking or a problem with packaging. Either way I was dissapointed. After a few months of use it was bad packaging or a bad seller. My wife loves the brush.</li>
            <li> I purchased one about a decade ago and it&#x27;s still in great shape so I thought to buy another one to take with me camping and so on. These things last forever or so it seems !</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a large brush and definitely keeps my long straight locks flowing free from static and knots.  It is well made and I use it to brush my long hair both wet and dry.  I bought one as a gift for my niece and decided to get one for myself.  I am surprised at how quick I can separate my hair and use my dryer to get a good, sleek smooth look.  The price keeps fluctuating but I would easily give it 4 1/2 stars!</li>
            <li> This brush is awesome as I feel like it is more gentle when brushing out knots in your hair or while your hair is wet(at its most fragile state). I believe it does help to distribute your natural oils from your scalp to the ends of your hair- which needs moisture the most.</li>
            <li> This brush works well on my curly hair. I use it for detangling.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d been on the hunt for a new wood-handled, wooden-bristled hair brush for a long time.  My old one had lasted me many years and I wanted a back-up and couldn&#x27;t find the same brand again.  Bamboo seemed like a good renewable and &amp;#34;green&amp;#34; choice and the price was right.  I ordered it after reading lots of reviews and looking at many different prices and products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This brush arrived and has a sturdy handle, lovely cushioned pad for the many finely-rounded wood bristles.  I&#x27;m impressed and it works beautifully in my hair.  We&#x27;ll see how it holds up over the long term, but right out of the packaging, I&#x27;m very pleased.</li>
            <li> Great brush and very sturdy but the pointed bristles are not as good as rounded ones. It goes through curly hair really well.</li>
            <li> Love wood brushes.  I will never go back to any other kind--feels great on my scalp.</li>
            <li> This Bass Large Square Paddle Brush is beautiful! It is a work of art. Beautiful wood in aritsan creation. The wood pins are a little sharper than the brushes that have the rounded plastic tips but not so sharp that it scratches. It feels great and goes through my thick hair and massages my scalp. It feels very nice in my hand as well. I am very pleased with this brush.</li>
            <li> Sturdy 100% bamboo including bristles!! A must have</li>
            <li> I love this brush.  Very high quality and will last forever.</li>
            <li> Favorite brush ever! No more static and it un tangles my very very long hair easily. Plus the bristles are great for a scalp massage.  This has helped my hair alot.</li>
            <li> Very satisfied with this brush. It detangles my curly hair easily without pulling.</li>
            <li> Great brush I have shortish hair, my wife and youngest daughter have long hair and these are the only brushes that get used.</li>
            <li> Bristles really feel good on the scalp.  It does not pull my hair out when blow drying my hair. I&#x27;m happy with this purchase.</li>
            <li> Great paddle brush my hair feels smooth and soft after I finish using this I recommend this to anyone who wants buy this product.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this brush! I have somewhat thick, wavy hair that is generally dry. The average brush only brushes the top of my hair and don&#x27;t go through but, this Bass Paddle Brush not only brush my hair but it combs and brush through my hair. It easily detangles and smooths my hair.  It is also a very durable brush. I&#x27;ve dropped it a few times and nothing happened to it; no cracks in the bamboo and no bristles fell out.  This is just the brush I&#x27;ve been looking for. It&#x27;s definitely a keeper...</li>
            <li> I have thick curly hair and this brush is great for blow drying! since the bristles are wooden, they don&#x27;t melt and bend out of shape with the heat from my dryer. also, the bristles are long and go all the way through my thick hair! i would definitely purchase again, but its so well made, it will be a good while before I need to.</li>
            <li> Awesome bamboo brush! I love the feeling it gives me while touching my scalp; it&#x27;s wonderful and therapeutic! So far, with the long, semi-rough strokes I take to brush my longer abundant hair, the bamboo bristles stay in perfect shape, no breakage; they take a slight beating (hehe!). Brushing with Bamboo has many great benefits to hair, keeping it smooth, glossy and also stimulates your scalp to encourage hair growth and proper blood flow. It may seem a bit expensive for a hair brush, but to me, it&#x27;s very well worth it! I&#x27;ll continue to purchase this brush, once my current one is on it&#x27;s last leg. LOL</li>
            <li> Durable, works great, and feels great on your scalp.</li>
            <li> This brush is so well made it even has four metal screws to join the bristle pad to the bamboo wood.  Besides being beautiful the brush is a \\&quot;Green\\&quot; composition of bamboo instead of wood or plastic.  Because bamboo can handle being wet without damage you can use it in or out of the shower or with a blowdryer!  The tines massage your scalp so wonderfully that I find myself wanting to brush my hair over and over at night (and sometimes during the day!)  My sister had purchased brush by Kent, which is significantly more expensive, but this lovely perfectly made brush is great not just in name it is also in composition.  I use my own mix of pure Argan oil and Lavender oil to have a nice smelling conditioner for my hair and it has not affected the brush in any way. So if you have long hair, wavy, and or curly hair this is definitely the brush. If that isn&#x27;t enough you can wash it so easily. Sometimes I just rinse it real good under hot water and it cleans the tines right up then I just l let it dry overnight (after making sure to squeeze as much out of the pneumatic pad or let it drain tine side down depending on how you cleaned it.  I&#x27;ve seen brushes of a similar nature costing upwards of 50 or 100 something dollars (MIND BOGGLING), but if you are looking for a good brush start here with this brush especially if you need easy detangling.  I still use my boar mixed bristle brush to get that glass finish when pulling my hair back in a pony tail or \\&quot;up style\\&quot; hairdo. Boar is better at forcing stray hairs to lay down, but not good for detangling.  I will definitely be sticking with Bass Brushes in the future, no more plastic/nylon brushes, bristles or handles for me.</li>
