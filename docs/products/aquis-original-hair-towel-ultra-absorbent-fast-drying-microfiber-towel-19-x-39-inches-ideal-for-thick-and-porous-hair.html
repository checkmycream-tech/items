            <li>I love this towel and will buy again.</li>
            <li>Works very well!!!!</li>
            <li>Super absorbent waffled material in a nice length.</li>
            <li>nice and compact and dries quickly.</li>
            <li>These towels work great on my naturally curly, frizzy hair.  </li>
            <li>I have had these towels for years and they are holding up just fine.</li>
            <li>exactly as described / fast shipping/ great packaging</li>
            <li>towel is huge.</li>
            <li>It is the smooth style.  </li>
            <li>* Light weight</li>
            <li>These soak up water like a sponge and are light with a waffled texture, but don&#x27;t put them in the dryer because it&#x27;s supposed to ruin them.  </li>
            <li>We use this towel for swimming and so far the absorbancy has been really good.  </li>
            <li>The absorbancy factor is great, my hair is not frizzy after keeping my hair wrapped in the towel, and it&#x27;s pretty soft.</li>
            <li>worth the price!  </li>
            <li>The other one was good at getting my hair dryer,  this one is better.</li>
            <li>Or maybe even getting a full size one because I love how fast it dries.</li>
            <li>on my head and was lightweight, unlike regular towels.&lt;br /&gt;*Looked good while it was on my head.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Nice, natural linen color.  </li>
            <li>And I liked it so well that I ordered two more  &amp; one will be a gift for my long, curly-haired daughter because despite the higher price it&#x27;s well worth it!</li>
            <li>Super-absortant and dries quickly.  </li>
            <li>It absorbs moisture quickly without squeezing or patting.</li>
            <li>Arrived quickly.</li>
            <li>Towel dries quickly after use&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>only the best in hair dry towels.</li>
            <li>and she actually (yea) was thrilled to get them.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s definitely worth the price.</li>
            <li>Very absorbent, quick drying, large enough to wrap around your head to make a turban, great classic color, washes well.</li>
            <li>So absorbent and just the right size.</li>
            <li>thinking of getting the turban shape for right after the shower and keeping this one for my pillow (I like to shower at night).</li>
            <li>this is the right product for helping to lessen any frizz.  </li>
            <li>2nd one to own after I wore the first one out.  </li>
            <li>Very happy I bought this, has definitely cut down on drying time and heat damage to my hair.</li>
            <li>So, I would use these towels as a baby towel or very large hand/face towel instead of a bath towe.</li>
            <li>We washed it several times, so far so good.</li>
            <li>my hair look better, starting with the first use!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>when I looked in the mirror the morning after the first use, someone else&#x27;s hair was on my head -</li>
            <li>More like 1/2 to 3/4 the size of a regular sized bath towel.</li>
            <li>Much better for your hair than regular towels.</li>
            <li>They are great for towel-drying hair and they dry quickly, too, when hanging them to dry.</li>
            <li>Dispite all this, when my hair is dried I actually have beutiful hair, this towel has been great, I swear the best thing yet, after I use it, if I let my hair to air dry it&#x27;ll dry in just a couple of hours</li>
            <li>I like the waffle weave&#x27;s &#x27;hand&#x27; better than flat weave.  </li>
            <li>It would be nice to see some other colors .</li>
            <li>very quick great for athletes and last a long long time.</li>
            <li>They wrap and dry my hair without causing breakage, and they wash and dry very nicely.</li>
            <li>Bought large and</li>
            <li>It is not quite as large as I would like</li>
            <li>I used mine and washed it so many times over the years that the edges finally started fraying, so I just replaced it with a new one.  </li>
            <li>They are worth the purchase price they last and last through many washing without showing hardness of the weave..</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not bulky but very absorbent.</li>
            <li>But much thinner and lighter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Drys supper fast.</li>
            <li>I have purchased several now and was amazed as it is so light weight, but IT WORKS.</li>
            <li>I have hair that hits to my shoulder blades, and this towel EASILY got all of my hair dry.</li>
            <li>I was hopeful I would escape that since my hair is pretty short (not even shoulder length right now).</li>
            <li>If you have long hair it might not be a good fit, might need one a little bigger.</li>
            <li>Super for curly headed folks who want to blot or plop their curls and not disturb the fragile cuticle.</li>
            <li>highly recommend this towel as a hair towel.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>highly recommend.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used it for a few months and it&#x27;s one of the better microfiber towels I have used.</li>
            <li>but i love how they are dry by the next morning.</li>
            <li>Just the right size for my fairly short hair.  </li>
            <li>It does start to smell damp after 3-4 months of use, but it will not stop me from purchasing a new one.</li>
            <li>Wow!</li>
            <li>The color, texture and overall feel suggest a high quality product.</li>
            <li>My old towel is actually thicker than this new one</li>
            <li>This towel seems to extract water from my hair after washing - I can dry my hair much faster after using the towel.</li>
            <li>I bought this thinking it would be the same quality as my old Aquis hair towel.</li>
            <li>I tossed out my old one that was smaller and had no waffle weave.</li>
            <li>Dries curls faster than a regular towel and never makes them look dry, frizzy or too &#x27;played with&#x27; the way a normal towel would.</li>
            <li>FYI, I have very long (almost to my waist), thick hair and the towel can handle all of it just fine</li>
            <li>I have long curly hair, and it completely replaced my need for a second towel after showering.</li>
            <li>I needed it to stay on my head and dry - I normally air dry my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I live in a condo that has a very, very small washer and dryer, so I don&#x27;t have the room or the time to do much laundry.</li>

            <li> I needed it to stay on my head and dry - I normally air dry my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I live in a condo that has a very, very small washer and dryer, so I don&#x27;t have the room or the time to do much laundry.</li>
            <li> towels which developed some sort of dark spots on the towel - some sort of mold?</li>
            <li> - this towel has not developed such spots.  </li>
            <li> With regular towels, I can only put three in the washer, and it ends up taking 2 hours to wash and dry them!</li>
            <li> I would get using regular towels to dry my hair.</li>
            <li> My husband and I are very thin, so I thought this size towel would be great for drying off, but unfortunately, they barely wrap around our bodies enough to tie them on the side and wear them around the house.</li>
            <li> Unless you have super thick hair down to your waist, you won&#x27;t have any problems getting your hair wrapped up in this thing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and so my hair would be wet the entire day,spongy, frizzy</li>

            <li> I have read that leaving your hair in any towel for too long is not good for your hair,wicks out too much moisture causing frizz, so I just leave it on for 5 to 10 minutes and then air dry.</li>
            <li> I use it to blot my hair dry or also for when I &amp;#34;plop&amp;#34; my hair (one way to dry curly hair...google it).</li>
            <li> If you have thick hair that retains water, this will cut your drying time down just by removing so much excess water.</li>

            <li> Great for my curly hair. the waffle weave stays looking nicer than a regular microfiber towel. The regular always pic up lint and start to look gross it just a couple of washings.</li>
            <li> 2nd one to own after I wore the first one out.  That took 5 years.  Excellent quality.</li>
            <li> I bought this thinking it would be the same quality as my old Aquis hair towel. This one was very thin and just doesn&#x27;t feel like it will last very long. My old towel is actually thicker than this new one and I paid less for it.</li>
            <li> So absorbent and just the right size.</li>
            <li> I live in a condo that has a very, very small washer and dryer, so I don&#x27;t have the room or the time to do much laundry. With regular towels, I can only put three in the washer, and it ends up taking 2 hours to wash and dry them! These towels are perfect for apartment-style living! I can throw this towel in the washer and have a TON of room for all the other things I need washed, too! The absorbancy factor is great, my hair is not frizzy after keeping my hair wrapped in the towel, and it&#x27;s pretty soft. My husband and I are very thin, so I thought this size towel would be great for drying off, but unfortunately, they barely wrap around our bodies enough to tie them on the side and wear them around the house. So, I would use these towels as a baby towel or very large hand/face towel instead of a bath towe. I&#x27;ll definitely buy the larger one in the future.</li>
            <li> Wow! This towel exceeded my expectations! I needed it to stay on my head and dry - I normally air dry my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This towel did the following:&lt;br /&gt;*Stayed on my head and was lightweight, unlike regular towels.&lt;br /&gt;*Looked good while it was on my head.&lt;br /&gt;*Dried my hair in no time.&lt;br /&gt;*Dried itself quickly.&lt;br /&gt;*Made my hair look better, starting with the first use!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bonus for me - when I looked in the mirror the morning after the first use, someone else&#x27;s hair was on my head - it was fluffy and shiny instead of limp and stringy!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this towel as a hair towel. I&#x27;m glad I bought three of them.</li>
            <li> This can make a perfect gift and I purchased one for my brother.  My Husband uses his all the time and especially for his annual overseas bike trip.  It&#x27;s small and compact as he only takes a small backpack.  Perfect for hostals or hotel germ-aphobics, it&#x27;s your own personal towel.  Super-absortant and dries quickly.  Also wonderful for pets.  Closet space- no problem again small and compact.</li>
            <li> I have used one of these towels for 15 years and love it. Once you start using one you can&#x27;t go back to a regular towel. I bought a second towel for myself and gave one to my cousin for Christmas.</li>
            <li> I have another hair towel from this company.  It is the smooth style.  What a difference!  The other one was good at getting my hair dryer,  this one is better.</li>
            <li> I have used and recommended these towels for about 14 years.  They are worth the purchase price they last and last through many washing without showing hardness of the weave..</li>
            <li> Highly recommend this product. In just a few minutes hair is almost dry. Saves time and energy with the hair dryer.</li>
            <li> They wick away moisture dry very quick great for athletes and last a long long time. Replaces the cotton towels that stay damp all day!</li>
            <li> read reviews on this type towel and bought based on others and will add my accolades. Great absorption and size. Super for curly headed folks who want to blot or plop their curls and not disturb the fragile cuticle.</li>
            <li> I have long hair and lots of it, and I used to hate the day that I had to wash it because I don&#x27;t have time to blow dry it and so my hair would be wet the entire day,spongy, frizzy, basically what would constitute a REALLY bad hair day! Dispite all this, when my hair is dried I actually have beutiful hair, this towel has been great, I swear the best thing yet, after I use it, if I let my hair to air dry it&#x27;ll dry in just a couple of hours and If I blow dry it it&#x27;ll take half the time than before. Also when I air dri it, it dries out nice with no puffiness, frizziness or sponginess!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The down side is that it&#x27;s a bit small for my amount of hair and it&#x27;s hard for me to wrap it around, so I have to use a hair clip to hold it up in a turban.</li>
            <li> I have used the Aquis Microfifer waffle towel for years and love it.  It is so lightweight, which helps it stay on when wrapping around your head after washing your hair.  This hair towel is superior to a heavier cotton bath towel for drying your hair.  I used mine and washed it so many times over the years that the edges finally started fraying, so I just replaced it with a new one.  I also love the linen color.</li>
            <li> Works very well!!!! I was tired of the neck ache I would get using regular towels to dry my hair. I wanted something light-weight that would work well. This product met my expectations and beyond.</li>
            <li> Super absorbent waffled material in a nice length. I use it for drying my hair, wrapping it around my head turban style. It absorbs moisture quickly without squeezing or patting.</li>
            <li> I have been using an Aquis towel for years, I&#x27;m a fan.  I have read that leaving your hair in any towel for too long is not good for your hair,wicks out too much moisture causing frizz, so I just leave it on for 5 to 10 minutes and then air dry. FYI, I have very long (almost to my waist), thick hair and the towel can handle all of it just fine</li>
            <li> This towel seems to extract water from my hair after washing - I can dry my hair much faster after using the towel. Wish it came shaped differently so that it would stay on my head easier. If I was handy with a needle and thread I could do it myself.</li>
            <li> I was hopeful I would escape that since my hair is pretty short (not even shoulder length right now). But it just won&#x27;t stay on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m thinking of getting the turban shape for right after the shower and keeping this one for my pillow (I like to shower at night). Or maybe even getting a full size one because I love how fast it dries. But it&#x27;s just too annoying how it always wants to fall off.</li>
            <li> I bought these for 2 of my girl friends for Christmas!  I love these towels! Aquis is the only brand I ever buy.</li>
            <li> I have had these towels for years and they are holding up just fine. I keep them in our camper and only use them during the summer camping season, however</li>
            <li> Just the right size for my fairly short hair.  Absorbant, light-weight, very nice.  I had the &amp;#34;diva&amp;#34; towels which developed some sort of dark spots on the towel - some sort of mold? - this towel has not developed such spots.  Will probably buy more on an as-needed basis.</li>
            <li> A little on the expensive side but hey, it gets the job done. We washed it several times, so far so good.</li>
            <li> This is my second purchase of this towel. I love its size and durability. I use it to blot my hair dry or also for when I &amp;#34;plop&amp;#34; my hair (one way to dry curly hair...google it).</li>
            <li> I love this towel...works great for drying your hair after washing. It&#x27;s not bulky but very absorbent. I have one for everyone in my family.</li>
            <li> This towel is great for getting most of the water out of my hair after showering. I have medium length hair and it is plenty big enough for me. If you have long hair it might not be a good fit, might need one a little bigger. Very happy I bought this, has definitely cut down on drying time and heat damage to my hair.</li>
            <li> Excellent quality &amp;#34;original&amp;#34; Aquis product.. exactly as described / fast shipping/ great packaging</li>
            <li> These towels work great on my naturally curly, frizzy hair.  They have reduced my frizz and cuts down on my blow drying time.</li>
            <li> Love this microfiber towel. It&#x27;s the perfect size - I have long curly hair, and it completely replaced my need for a second towel after showering. Dries curls faster than a regular towel and never makes them look dry, frizzy or too &#x27;played with&#x27; the way a normal towel would. Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I bought the Aquis on Amazon after the turbie-twist I&#x27;d had finally was too worn out to keep using. This is DEFINITELY an upgrade.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This towel is huge. In the picture it looks like the size of a hand towel, but it&#x27;s actually a bit bigger. More like 1/2 to 3/4 the size of a regular sized bath towel. But much thinner and lighter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s awesome. The waffle weave gives it this upscale spa-accesory vibe. I have hair that hits to my shoulder blades, and this towel EASILY got all of my hair dry. Unless you have super thick hair down to your waist, you won&#x27;t have any problems getting your hair wrapped up in this thing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend. Just wish it came in more colors.</li>
            <li> I like the waffle weave&#x27;s &#x27;hand&#x27; better than flat weave.  Feels more like cotton and doesn&#x27;t have annoying scratching feel that some microfiber towels do.  Nice, natural linen color.  Bought large and this size for when I go to the pool or for travel.  nice and compact and dries quickly.</li>
            <li> Bought these towels for my future daughter-in-law for Christmas.  Was hoping she wouldn&#x27;t be insulted about getting &amp;#34;a towel&amp;#34; when she opened her package.  Put a note in about how wonderful I had heard they were and she actually (yea) was thrilled to get them.  She already knew about them but didn&#x27;t have any.  She even brought them with her when she traveled here to visit.  Score!</li>
            <li> Much better for your hair than regular towels. Arrived quickly. I&#x27;ve used it for a few months and it&#x27;s one of the better microfiber towels I have used. I have medium length hair and it soaks up the moisture well.</li>
            <li> These towels are great. They wrap and dry my hair without causing breakage, and they wash and dry very nicely.</li>
            <li> they aren&#x27;t luxury enough for some people but i love how they are dry by the next morning. makes life easier! and they aren&#x27;t bulky so they don&#x27;t take up a ton of room on your closet shelf.  worth the price!  they come in white too but i prefer the linen color.</li>
            <li> This towel is well sized for long hair even when it&#x27;s thick.  It&#x27;s well made and a quality material. If you&#x27;ve got curly hair this is the right product for helping to lessen any frizz.  And I liked it so well that I ordered two more  &amp; one will be a gift for my long, curly-haired daughter because despite the higher price it&#x27;s well worth it!</li>
            <li> We use this towel for swimming and so far the absorbancy has been really good.  May buy another one soon.</li>
            <li> LOVE LOVE LOVE the hair towel. Drys supper fast. Perfect size. It would be nice to see some other colors . Hint,Hint!</li>
            <li> What works:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* Towel dries quickly after use&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* Absorbent&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* Light weight (Don&#x27;t feel like I&#x27;m balancing books on my head)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What does not work:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* It is not quite as large as I would like</li>
            <li> I love this towel and will buy again. It does start to smell damp after 3-4 months of use, but it will not stop me from purchasing a new one.</li>
            <li> I have used these towels for years in our RV (and at home, too).  They are terrifically absorbent and take up so little space.  (A good thing for RVs and boats.)  They are great for towel-drying hair and they dry quickly, too, when hanging them to dry.</li>
            <li> only the best in hair dry towels.</li>
            <li> Great Hair Towel as well as golf.</li>
            <li> These soak up water like a sponge and are light with a waffled texture, but don&#x27;t put them in the dryer because it&#x27;s supposed to ruin them.  I&#x27;ve been very happy with this product and would order it again.</li>
            <li> If you have thick hair that retains water, this will cut your drying time down just by removing so much excess water. I have purchased several now and was amazed as it is so light weight, but IT WORKS.</li>
            <li> Very absorbent, quick drying, large enough to wrap around your head to make a turban, great classic color, washes well.</li>
            <li> Very good quality and absorbent. Have been using them for some years. This purchase is for a guest room.</li>
            <li> This does a great job of drying my hair. I tossed out my old one that was smaller and had no waffle weave.</li>
            <li> This is a great invention for home and travel.  I have medium length hair, and it is perfect for gently drying hair, and it dries quickly in a humid coastal home.</li>
            <li> Why did I wait until I was 62 to buy a hair towel???? This cuts down drying and styling time by at least half. The color, texture and overall feel suggest a high quality product. It&#x27;s definitely worth the price.</li>
