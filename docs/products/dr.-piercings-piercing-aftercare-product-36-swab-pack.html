            <li>Product arive very quickly.</li>
            <li>I have a belly button piercing and this is great for getting into hard to reach spots , it&#x27;s got the perfect amount of medicine in it and after about and is great for removing all those little crusties .</li>
            <li>There was a good amount of the liquid in each tip to help with both my new piercings.</li>
            <li>But I still like it fine.</li>
            <li>I was carrying around a bag of swabs and a huge can of saline wound wash.</li>
            <li>The packaging is secure.</li>
            <li>Purchasing this product has made my belly button piercing a much easier healing process this time around!!!</li>
            <li>I have had piercings for about a year now, and I use this once in a while when I notice my belly button getting gross and it works amazingly!</li>
            <li>/&gt;After I clean my piercing</li>
            <li>I use this to clean my belly piercing.</li>
            <li>this did the job well in the car to get my nose clean</li>
            <li>I bought this for helping me to clean my nose piercing.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t even touch the end with the medicine, use 2 each time I clean with it.</li>
            <li>and I need to clean my piercings.</li>
            <li>Maybe it&#x27;s only good for non-cartilage piercings or nose piercings?</li>
            <li>Much easier and more control than using just a cotton swab or ball.</li>
            <li>My pierced ear felt a whole lot better, because of it.</li>
            <li>Definitely will be getting more when I get more piercings.</li>
            <li>I originally bought this from my piercer when I first got my conch pierced over a year ago and it worked wonders.</li>
            <li>Overall my piercings are healing nicely.</li>
            <li>You don&#x27;t have to do a lot of preparing to distribute this product other then twist the top of the Q-tip and the medicine runs to the top and you distribute.</li>
            <li>When you piercing is irritated and itchy this is the right product to use</li>
            <li>I purchased these right after i got my Monroe piercing done.</li>
            <li>Easy, small, and effective</li>
            <li>I immediately opened them and applied the first one.</li>
            <li>So nice to not have to deal without the hassle of a spray or other liquid solutions.</li>
            <li>First time using this product it helped more than I expected it too.</li>
            <li>I would definitely buy this product again, it was so easy to store and use.</li>
            <li>a very sweaty show</li>
            <li>Very convenient method of caring for piercing.  </li>
            <li>if you want something that you can really feel helping buy the h2o sea salt spray, Hope this helps anyone thats thinking about buying this product.</li>
            <li>I was almost ready to pull out my piercing and be done with it.</li>
            <li>So I ordered this product on Sunday afternoon and it came really fast.</li>
            <li>They are very affordable for what you are getting</li>
            <li>Overall a pretty good product but not worth the price</li>
            <li>Got it when my belly ring showed signs of infection and it clear right up.</li>
            <li>When i got this it was much smaller than i expected, it can fit in the palm of most peoples hands, it only has 36 swabs in the package which it not very use full to a person like me that doesn&#x27;t feel my piercing is clean until I&#x27;ve drenched it in cleaning stuff, another downside is you can only use the one end of the swab b/c thats where to medicine is located which means you would have to use many swabs to get the piercing clean b/c if you have an infection in one spot of the piercing using the same swab on all areas of your piercing</li>
            <li>It is so much more convenient than the other methods that were recommended to me.</li>
            <li>These really came in handy for when one of my piercings encountered a small infection.  </li>
            <li>Not sure how effective they are in helping with infection.</li>
            <li>was really hoping it would help my new ear piercing.</li>
            <li>highly recommend for anyone with a piercing.  </li>
            <li>I first found it at a tattoo shop far from home and couldn&#x27;t get it near home</li>
            <li>I bought these for my new piercing.</li>
            <li>I recommend it to all my friends with new piercings.</li>
            <li>/&gt;i would say if you just got a piercing dont use this everyday if you actually want it to heal use the warm water and sea salt</li>
            <li>After using this product, the pain would be gone the next day and it healed my conch very well.</li>
            <li>Not enough liquid in the q-tip and was upset you have to use one whole q-tip for one ear</li>
            <li>The solution flows right down on to the swab.</li>
            <li>is an easy way to spread infection not to mention the price is pretty expensive</li>
            <li>So easy to use, and seriously...</li>
            <li>helped to clear up long standing problem with pierced ears.</li>
            <li>Especially tricky spots that are hard to clean thoroughly.</li>

            <li> So easy to use, and seriously...</li>
            <li> helped to clear up long standing problem with pierced ears.</li>
            <li> Especially tricky spots that are hard to clean thoroughly.</li>
            <li> This product decreased the healing time and also kept the piercing clean.</li>
            <li> so you won&#x27;t walk around with a strange smell.</li>
            <li> The price is reasonable compared to H2ocean because you waste half the H2 ocean spray when you&#x27;re putting it on a q tip!</li>
            <li> More expensive than other methods but easier to use when other methods are not available while maintaining piercing.</li>
            <li> The packaging is little, I thought it was gonna be much bigger</li>
            <li> Salt water never really helped the healing process for me with any of my piercings and whenever they were ever accidentally knocked or slept on, they would hurt for days.</li>
            <li> worked as expected for my daughters nose piercing.</li>
            <li> Snap off the tip with the black line and let the liquid soak the other end.</li>
            <li> In my opinion sea salt helps soothe it where this i did not feel anything with this product ,would not recommend this to anyone, its not worth the money or wait to get it,</li>
            <li> As with tattoos and other piercings (I have 17 tats and 5 piercings), they tend to itch a little every now</li>
            <li> They were, however, extremely convenient, and much less messy than cotton balls or shot glasses.</li>
            <li> Helped me with my nose piercing that I was having trouble with.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, I lost the piercing due to jewelry malfunctions about 6 months ago</li>
            <li> Some of the medicine was on the wrong side of the q-tip.</li>
            <li> but I wish it wasn&#x27;t so expensive!</li>
            <li> these swabs aided in my heal time, and i was shocked.</li>

            <li> Works great and quick and easy to use!</li>
            <li> Good product, but you run out fast. I would order more then one package at a time. It does work well though but does not make up for a good sea salt soak.</li>
            <li> Gets the crust off but nothing a regular cotton swab could not to . Overall a pretty good product but not worth the price</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t speak explicitly as to the healing effect of the medication, because I was using these in combination with H2Ocean. They were, however, extremely convenient, and much less messy than cotton balls or shot glasses.</li>
            <li> I was very impressed with the speed of delivery. I use this regularly with H20 ocean spray for my piercings. They always heal nicely.</li>
            <li> best cleaner I had for soothing piercing. snap of is good and easy to use. I actually thought box was bigger but, its fine good for travel.</li>
            <li> I used this for my bellly piercing. Although I still did my sea salt soaks, this was a great way to remove excess lymph and impurities after every soak. I also used them when I was in a hurry and had no time to do a soak. It was easy to bring around with me when I travel, plus the case makes a great coin purse when you&#x27;re done with the swabs. I would still recommend sea salt soaks though. This is just a product you can use in addition to the soaks.</li>
            <li> Great product, very easy to use. Heals piercings so much better than just salt water. I originally bought this from my piercer when I first got my conch pierced over a year ago and it worked wonders. Salt water never really helped the healing process for me with any of my piercings and whenever they were ever accidentally knocked or slept on, they would hurt for days. After using this product, the pain would be gone the next day and it healed my conch very well. Unfortunately, I lost the piercing due to jewelry malfunctions about 6 months ago but I loved it so much, I got it re-pierced and am currently using this once again to heal my conch. If you&#x27;re on the fence, just buy it. You won&#x27;t regret it.</li>
            <li> Awesome will purchase again! Got it when my belly ring showed signs of infection and it clear right up. Purchasing for my next piercing!</li>
            <li> I really liked this product. Worked great for me but I wish it wasn&#x27;t so expensive! Helped me with my nose piercing that I was having trouble with. I first found it at a tattoo shop far from home and couldn&#x27;t get it near home so I had to order it online. Would give it 5 star if it were cheaper.</li>
            <li> Good product though the shipper (Steel Navel) doesn&#x27;t package the item safely and arrived cracked...&lt;br /&gt;Helped heal my triple helix quite nicely.</li>
            <li> I bought these for my new piercing. They are easy to use and they work.&lt;br /&gt;After I clean my piercing I use one of these twice a day.</li>
            <li> I loved the concept of this and it worked well with my piercing. No infections or irritations. If I were to get another piercing I would get this product again.</li>
            <li> It was alright. It irritates my piercing. Some of the medicine was on the wrong side of the q-tip. But I still like it fine.</li>
            <li> Irritated my industrial piercing. Maybe it&#x27;s only good for non-cartilage piercings or nose piercings? Industrial piercings are notoriously finicky so maybe that&#x27;s another reason why.</li>
            <li> I purchased the swab pack to take with me on trips to make sure I take care of my piercings.&lt;br /&gt;I haven&#x27;t used them at this time that is why I gave it. 4 star. When I do I will write back.</li>
            <li> I wish I found these years ago!  These are great for an additional cleaning step of new and healing piercings. Especially tricky spots that are hard to clean thoroughly. I&#x27;ve already ordered these again.</li>
            <li> When i&#x27;m on the go I use this to clean my belly piercing. It works great and helps keep it clean and healthy. I will buy again.</li>
            <li> very great for on the go cleaner&lt;br /&gt;after a very sweaty show this did the job well in the car to get my nose clean&lt;br /&gt;its really great for travel just toss it in and good to go or just keep in my bag&lt;br /&gt;i would say if you just got a piercing dont use this everyday if you actually want it to heal use the warm water and sea salt</li>
            <li> Very convenient method of caring for piercing.  More expensive than other methods but easier to use when other methods are not available while maintaining piercing.</li>
            <li> Great product! Easy, small, and effective</li>
            <li> This is amazing! I was having problems with my helix piercing (pain, redness, swelling) almost since day one. Within three uses it was all gone. I will never use anything else for a piercing again.</li>
            <li> I was carrying around a bag of swabs and a huge can of saline wound wash. These are so much more portable and convenient. And they soothed my piercing more than the saline. The itchiness and soreness almost disappeared after one use.</li>
            <li> Ive used this product before and loved it. (: id definitely recommend this to others in a heart beat! (:</li>
            <li> These really came in handy for when one of my piercings encountered a small infection.  This product decreased the healing time and also kept the piercing clean.</li>
            <li> worked as expected for my daughters nose piercing.</li>
            <li> Perfect for on the go cleaning. Fits inside a pocket ot purse and soooo easy to use. Wonderful idea.</li>
            <li> Just what I needed for my piercings....When you piercing is irritated and itchy this is the right product to use</li>
            <li> This is an absolutely incredible product.  I wish these were around years ago when I had my belly piercing.  I bought these for my nose piercing so I could throw them in my purse for when I travel.  I like them.  ALOT.  I use one every day and it actually sooths my nose as it helps my piercing.  I wish these were sold locally, but I plan on putting another order in soon.  A very good product which is conveniently packaged!</li>
            <li> This is a great product. I was using h2ocean. That works also. But this item worked faster. The stinging pain u have after a piercing...is totally gone. Love love love it</li>
            <li> Great idea for after a piercing!! Will buy them again!!</li>
            <li> Very easy to use. Not sure how effective they are in helping with infection. I had to take out my nose ring, so I stopped using them.</li>
            <li> Purchasing this product has made my belly button piercing a much easier healing process this time around!!! I can take these amazing swabs with me anywhere&#x27;s I go, and easily take care of my piercing. I am glad I found this helpful product!!</li>
            <li> I bought this for helping me to clean my nose piercing. Much easier and more control than using just a cotton swab or ball. hygenic I don&#x27;t even touch the end with the medicine, use 2 each time I clean with it. Thinking about continuing to use this after the 5 month &amp;#34;healing&amp;#34; period to use every day. Product arive very quickly.</li>
            <li> So amazing!! Ordered on a Thursday around 8pm and it shipped by 10am that friday and got it Monday morning! So convient to have around when I&#x27;m in a hurry. Have my tragus and cartilage pierced and it has saved me! The price is reasonable compared to H2ocean because you waste half the H2 ocean spray when you&#x27;re putting it on a q tip! So so happy I found this!!&lt;br /&gt;Def going to buy a couple more to keep in my car and purse!!</li>
            <li> these swabs aided in my heal time, and i was shocked. i will recommend these to my clients as much as possible.</li>
            <li> Not enough liquid in the q-tip and was upset you have to use one whole q-tip for one ear</li>
            <li> When i found this product on here i was very excited b/c it got a lot of good reviews &amp; i was really hoping it would help my new ear piercing.When i got this it was much smaller than i expected, it can fit in the palm of most peoples hands, it only has 36 swabs in the package which it not very use full to a person like me that doesn&#x27;t feel my piercing is clean until I&#x27;ve drenched it in cleaning stuff, another downside is you can only use the one end of the swab b/c thats where to medicine is located which means you would have to use many swabs to get the piercing clean b/c if you have an infection in one spot of the piercing using the same swab on all areas of your piercing is an easy way to spread infection not to mention the price is pretty expensive i feel they dont do very much good for a piercing as compared to sea salt.In my opinion sea salt helps soothe it where this i did not feel anything with this product ,would not recommend this to anyone, its not worth the money or wait to get it, if you want something that you can really feel helping buy the h2o sea salt spray, Hope this helps anyone thats thinking about buying this product.</li>
            <li> Nice to use when traveling</li>
            <li> First time using this product it helped more than I expected it too. You don&#x27;t have to do a lot of preparing to distribute this product other then twist the top of the Q-tip and the medicine runs to the top and you distribute. My pierced ear felt a whole lot better, because of it. Great product and I recommended it to anyone just pierced or recently pierced.</li>
            <li> I was almost ready to pull out my piercing and be done with it. This stuff cured my piercing! I recommend it to all my friends with new piercings. So easy to use, and seriously...it does work. Even if you have an infection and redness, or a red infection lump growing - it will cure that! Snap off the tip with the black line and let the liquid soak the other end. Dab it around your piercing a couple times a day, and a within a week or so you will see results!</li>
            <li> So I ordered this product on Sunday afternoon and it came really fast. I didn&#x27;t expect it to be here today which is Tuesday. It says that the delivery estimate is Friday. The packaging is little, I thought it was gonna be much bigger but it&#x27;s the perfect travel size. I excited to try this out! Hopefully it makes my piercing heal a lot faster and protects it from getting infections. (:</li>
            <li> I use these mostly if I&#x27;m out or at work and I need to clean my piercings. they are very handy and seem to clean my piercings very well. I haven&#x27;t had a infection yet. When I&#x27;m home I use a piercing soap and sea salt. Overall my piercings are healing nicely. Ordered these twice and will continue ordering.</li>
            <li> I would definitely buy this product again, it was so easy to store and use. There was a good amount of the liquid in each tip to help with both my new piercings. So nice to not have to deal without the hassle of a spray or other liquid solutions.</li>
            <li> This product has been so helpful with my piercing. I got my eyebrow pierced about 3 weeks ago and I have been using this for about a week. It is so much more convenient than the other methods that were recommended to me. They are very affordable for what you are getting and I haven&#x27;t run into any complications with my piercing while using this product. It is healing up quite nicely.</li>
            <li> I have a belly button piercing and this is great for getting into hard to reach spots , it&#x27;s got the perfect amount of medicine in it and after about and is great for removing all those little crusties . Totally recommend !</li>
            <li> highly recommend for anyone with a piercing.  purchased for daughter.  helped to clear up long standing problem with pierced ears.</li>
            <li> I have had piercings for about a year now, and I use this once in a while when I notice my belly button getting gross and it works amazingly! Definitely will be getting more when I get more piercings.</li>
            <li> I purchased these right after i got my Monroe piercing done. They arrived yesterday. I immediately opened them and applied the first one. The packaging is secure. The swabs re very easy to use. Just hold the swab with the end with the strip up and snap it. The solution flows right down on to the swab. As with tattoos and other piercings (I have 17 tats and 5 piercings), they tend to itch a little every now and then when healing properly. as soon as I applied the solution, the itching stopping. It has no smell so you won&#x27;t walk around with a strange smell. All in all a great product!</li>
