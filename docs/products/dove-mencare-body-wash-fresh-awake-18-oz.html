            <li>Nice product.  </li>
            <li>Also seems to leave my skin feeling like it&#x27;s coated with some kind of sticky film.</li>
            <li>Dove products are great and very gentle on skin!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s got fine micro crystals and helps promote good skin &#x27;look and feel&#x27;...</li>
            <li>I just wanted to try this thinking that it may be better.....</li>
            <li>Love the scent.</li>
            <li>I regularly buy this great product for under $5!</li>

            <li>Refreshing scent, love it.</li>
            <li>I ordered this body wash for my finance, and we both fell in love with it.</li>
            <li>I love the smell, and he loves the way  it feels.</li>
            <li>Very fresh, very clean.</li>
            <li>Smells great and the larger size is better price per ounce.</li>
            <li>It smell terrific and works great with a very clean feel after shower.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping, cant beat the price and smells amazing.</li>
            <li>When you work out two to three hours a day, move your fluids around a lot, a great body wash like this goes a long way to eliminating orders.</li>
            <li>And it rinses clean without any slippery residue.</li>
            <li>I really enjoy the micro beads and the scent that is not too powerful.</li>
            <li>Gets me clean, has a good scent, and doesn&#x27;t dry my skin out which was why I decided to try this.  </li>
            <li>Great value for the price and very convenient to have this delivered regularly to my doorstep.  </li>
            <li>I have been using EXTRA FRESH and CLEAN DEFENSE from Dove from a while and liked them.</li>
            <li>This is probably my 2nd favorite.</li>
            <li>Somehow, this bodywash is much less effective at moisturizing my skin than the &amp;#34;normal&amp;#34; Dove bodywash.</li>
            <li>Fantastic body soap that lasts a long time.</li>
            <li>If you are looking for a long lasting scent that keeps you smelling fresh and a soap that gives you that clean feeling, then this is the body wash for you.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s light and citrusy while still being slightly woodsy.</li>
            <li>He said it gives the feeling of freshness, and leaves his skin very soft, unlike many other body wash products for men that leave skin dry.</li>
            <li>I started using this early this year</li>
            <li>It lathers very well and lasts a long time!</li>

            <li> Not much to say other than it works well</li>
            <li> Its not worth.</li>
            <li> I think the Dove Body Products sold here may be water down.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also an added bonus that the lid stays on very tight so as to not have any unwanted leakage in my gym bag.</li>

            <li> I have been using EXTRA FRESH and CLEAN DEFENSE from Dove from a while and liked them. I just wanted to try this thinking that it may be better.....BUMMER............Its not worth.</li>
            <li> Good deal.  Nice product.  What else can you say about soap?</li>
            <li> This is the body wash I have used for a long time and finding it on amazon for a few cents cheaper than my local store makes this a bargain.  The product itself has a pleasant scent, although I wouldn&#x27;t say it invigorates you to wake up in the morning.  If you are looking for a long lasting scent that keeps you smelling fresh and a soap that gives you that clean feeling, then this is the body wash for you.</li>
            <li> Love the scent. Very fresh, very clean. For some reason I never saw this on the store shelves, but I will definitely purchase it through Amazon again and again</li>
            <li> I regularly buy this great product for under $5! Can&#x27;t beat it!!</li>
            <li> Dove Rocks! Love this product! through and through! The smell is awesome! It lathers very well and lasts a long time!</li>
            <li> YUMMY, my husband smells delicious ;)</li>
            <li> Not much to say other than it works well and you can get it for a great price here on Amazon. Will definitely be purchasing again.</li>
            <li> Does it&#x27;s job well.  Gets me clean, has a good scent, and doesn&#x27;t dry my skin out which was why I decided to try this.  Very happy with the results</li>
            <li> This is the best!  I started using this early this year and it smells great, keeps me fresher longer. When you work out two to three hours a day, move your fluids around a lot, a great body wash like this goes a long way to eliminating orders. It&#x27;s got fine micro crystals and helps promote good skin &#x27;look and feel&#x27;... If you care about that stuff.</li>
            <li> Great scent! This bottle lasted forever. Dove products are great and very gentle on skin!</li>
            <li> I love this body wash!!! However, I have noticed the consistency is different then it is suppose to be. I think the Dove Body Products sold here may be water down. I do recommend all the Dove Men Care Bodywashes. I still have yet to find one that I don&#x27;t like. This is probably my 2nd favorite. This product keeps your skin nourished, without the dry feeling other body washes give you. I really like the Fresh Awake one the best. Their Deorderant is really great too!!</li>
            <li> Love the product and will order again. Thank you.</li>
            <li> Smells good and lathers good. And it rinses clean without any slippery residue. It smells like a combination of citrus and woodsy smell; not overpowering or perfumey. It was a good purchase. I&#x27;m satisfied.</li>
            <li> Good product. Fragrance is good.</li>
            <li> Really good smell bought it for my husband thank u and he likes it ty</li>
            <li> My son always loves any of these he has all of them at one time or another .</li>
            <li> This is the &amp;#34;freshest&amp;#34; of the Dove men scents! I wish they made face lotion or bar soap in this scent. It&#x27;s light and citrusy while still being slightly woodsy. I love it as do THA LADEEEZZZZZ!</li>
            <li> nice grit smells great!!!</li>
            <li> Great body wash! I keep one at home and carry another with me for the gym. I really enjoy the micro beads and the scent that is not too powerful. It&#x27;s also an added bonus that the lid stays on very tight so as to not have any unwanted leakage in my gym bag.</li>
            <li> This is a great buy with a respected name for skin protection. Even men need to take care of their skin.</li>
            <li> Great value for the price and very convenient to have this delivered regularly to my doorstep.  Smells great and the larger size is better price per ounce.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping, cant beat the price and smells amazing.My husband loves it!</li>
            <li> Fantastic body soap that lasts a long time. Very refreshing.</li>
            <li> Refreshing scent, love it.</li>
            <li> My husband has tried a couple of scents and I believe likes this one the best -- he smells great! :)</li>
            <li> I ordered this body wash for my finance, and we both fell in love with it. I love the smell, and he loves the way  it feels. He said it gives the feeling of freshness, and leaves his skin very soft, unlike many other body wash products for men that leave skin dry. I will definitely get it again!</li>
            <li> So I stocked up on this body wash. It smell terrific and works great with a very clean feel after shower. I bought 3 additional bottles. It seems like the best deal for the price!</li>
            <li> Somehow, this bodywash is much less effective at moisturizing my skin than the &amp;#34;normal&amp;#34; Dove bodywash. I am not a fan. I&#x27;m still using it ONLY because it would be wasteful to throw it away. Also seems to leave my skin feeling like it&#x27;s coated with some kind of sticky film.</li>
