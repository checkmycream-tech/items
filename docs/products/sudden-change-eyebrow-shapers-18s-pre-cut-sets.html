    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>The best part is the skin around my eyebrows is not at all irritated.</li>
            <li>Use these in a well-lit room, by a sunny window is best.  </li>
            <li>I am very pleased to have discovered this product!</li>
            <li>These eyebrow shapers are great.  </li>
            <li>These are great for weekly maintenance-esp after going to a salon.</li>
            <li>and I look great.  </li>
            <li>this product is so easy to use and the results are perfect...</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d say a good 75%.</li>
            <li>was resend, that is good customer service.</li>
            <li>good product.  </li>
            <li>I love this product!  </li>
            <li>The shape is great, and they are so easy to use.</li>
            <li>Warm the strips in your hand a bit before you apply them - it helps.  </li>
            <li>just nice eyebrows.....</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s easy, cheap and the end result is very good.  </li>
            <li>Near perfect brows, no burns or redness.</li>
            <li>THE PARISSA EYEBROW WAX STRIPS ARE MUCH BETTER.</li>
            <li>NO, IT WON&#x27;T GET ALL THE HAIR OFF WITH ONE STRIP EITHER, BUT IT IS SOOO MUCH BETTER.</li>
            <li>HAVEN&#x27;T YET FOUND ANYTHING BETTER THAN THE PARISSA BRAND YET.</li>
            <li>More of a sticker.</li>
            <li>You&#x27;d be better off tweezing with your fingers</li>
            <li>The strips removed most of the hair.</li>
            <li>I would recommend these :)</li>
            <li>Sudden Change Eyebrow Shapers are the best thing out there -</li>
            <li>OK, so I have problem eye brows.  </li>
            <li>but do research to see if there is any better product.  </li>
            <li>You might have better luck with Scotch Tape than this.</li>
            <li>easy to shape eyebrows using this product.  </li>
            <li>Press the shaper on and rub it gently for about 5 seconds to warm it and get it well-stuck.</li>
            <li>Not available in many stores anymore!!!!!!!</li>
            <li>I like how these are shaped for you - however, I have to cut them to fit my eyebrows.</li>
            <li>some light moisturizer on afterwards</li>
            <li>They work very well!!!</li>
            <li>They are pre-cut in a nice generic arch shape and very easy to use.  </li>
            <li>Quick and easy to clean over, under and sides of brows.  </li>
            <li>They come in a nice arch shape and they are pretty much pain free.</li>
            <li>Was glad to find this at a reasonable price.  </li>
            <li>Overall this is a good product.</li>
            <li>Wow, I was thrilled with the change.</li>
            <li>wash your face first and then pull it quickly towands to your nose, it will works.&lt;br /&gt;although pains, but i like it!</li>
            <li>These strips are great for home eyebrow maintenance,  Super fast and easy to use with no mess and no red marks.  </li>
            <li>I find that the strip does most of the work with no trouble.  </li>
            <li>You do have to peel them off in the right direction (toward your nose)as the directions indicate or they do not work.</li>
            <li>Make sure that your skin is clean and dry</li>
            <li>First try didn&#x27;t work, so I read the directions.</li>
            <li>I purchased these hoping that they would be the perfect solution to tweezing, sadly they were not.</li>
            <li>I washed my face first to get rid of oils.</li>
            <li>Works exactly how I remembered they did..</li>
            <li>Stellar.</li>
            <li>Just be sure you wash off all makeup and have a dry face.</li>
            <li>I ordered this product about 3weeks ago and was excited because I have was excited to finally be able to do my own eyebrows sadly to know is that it was NOT WHAT I EXPECTED...</li>
            <li>But although the shape of these is nice, they have little to no stickiness and therefore don&#x27;t remove any hairs.</li>
            <li>I have very thick brows and these work great.</li>
            <li>Make sure that the area is clean and dry and pull the strips off the opposite direction of the hair growth.</li>
            <li>I love this product because there is minimal pain after using it.</li>
            <li>These eyebrow shapers really work with no pain.  </li>
            <li>Delivery was fast and the item was what I wanted</li>
            <li>Plastic just do not work when it comes to waxing, no matter how much powder and alcohol you use on your skin.</li>
            <li>and you are ready to face the world.</li>
            <li>thanks</li>
            <li>This isn&#x27;t really as you would expect, it&#x27;s not as effective as wax or a salon threading, the arch is only subtle.&lt;br /&gt;Another, it didn&#x27;t really remove as much hair as I wanted on the first go, I needed to use up one whole page just to get the necessary effect, and that is just such a waste.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>TO GET ALL THE HAIR OFF ONE BROW, AND THE HAIR DOESN&#x27;T GROW BACK UNTIL SIX WEEKS OR MORE LATER.</li>
            <li>Pull your skin back a bit and then pull the strip off quickly.  </li>
            <li>no mess..would highly recommend&lt;br /&gt;enjoy</li>
            <li>its worth the extra 3 bucks to go to Hair Cuttery or another salon.</li>
            <li>I had never used any other kind of hair removal other than a tweezer.</li>
            <li>Pull your skin back toward your hairline, then quickly pull the shaper off from outside in toward your nose.   </li>
            <li>no messy wax -</li>
            <li>Busy</li>
            <li>If you want a professional job then don&#x27;t do it yourself.</li>
            <li>I wish I could give this a good review unfortunately</li>
            <li>I used the top shaper the same way, only brushing my brows down this time.</li>
            <li>Only rarely do i need to use tweezers on one or two single hairs.</li>
            <li>This is a waste of money, doesn&#x27;t really work it may pull out 10 hairs in like 5 stickers and doesn&#x27;t really fits my brows shape.</li>
            <li>Adhesive not strong enough for any other hairs but still OK on my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>Possibly I have sensitive eyes..</li>
            <li>/&gt;However - they always leave most of my hair behind.</li>
            <li>Plus I can do my eyebrows several times for the same cost as having it done professionally, and with the same professional results.  </li>
            <li>I am not one to exagerate to prove a point, NOT A SINGLE HAIR.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This is so hard to find in the stores like Sally&#x27;s, Walgreens and other stores, so glad I found it online</li>

            <li> I was so excited to try this product because I am horrible at shaping my own brows, and tweezing is such a pain.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve bought this product or a similar ones previously</li>
            <li> They take off only a few hairs, but I used 8 sets and can&#x27;t tell.</li>
            <li> I repeated this process five or six times, only to realize that I wasted my money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Then I applied the pre-cut strips, smoothed them down for a few seconds, and then removed from the outside of the face in toward the nose.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> They do remove the hair if you wash your face first and remove the oils, but the shape is all wrong and to try to cut the strips is just not for me.</li>
            <li> Not worth the $5 bucks I invested, did not work at all,</li>
            <li> This product works average</li>
            <li> waste of money  basically spent the money on stickers</li>
            <li> They are easier than tweezing and a lot less pain than waxing.  </li>
            <li> It  won&#x27;t attach to a hair, much less have the ability to pull it out.  </li>
            <li> The little square pieces cleaned up between my brows.  </li>
            <li> In between visits though I can get a little fuzzy and these strips do the trick.  </li>
            <li> If it really hurts (which it won&#x27;t) you can use a little ice to numb the area.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Wasted money.</li>
            <li> Feel like I wasted my money.</li>
            <li> The item was misplaced and I never got the product.</li>
            <li> this is a total&lt;br /&gt; Waste of money ....</li>
            <li> I waste my money with this item.</li>
            <li> I would return them, but I used half a sheet!</li>
            <li> I USUALLY DON&#x27;T HAVE TO USE NO MORE THAN TWO STRIPS</li>
            <li> My daughter and I both use these and are not able to find them in the stores around us any longer.</li>
            <li> - I usually go over the area with a cotton ball and some skin toner.  </li>
            <li> this product is hard to use and doesn&#x27;t do the job it is supposed to..will never buy it again ..</li>
            <li> and it says its going to work and then omit sucks.</li>
            <li> AND IT STILL DIDN&#x27;T GET ALL THE HAIR, AND I DON&#x27;T EVEN HAVE THICK EYEBROWS.</li>
            <li> work great-but they&#x27;re not going to get every thick hair.</li>
            <li> Purchased this product because I was tired of spending a half hour with painful tweezing and wasn&#x27;t going to pay $15 at my local salon for an eyebrow waxing.&lt;br</li>
            <li> but hey maybe I do.&lt;br /&gt;Another pro - these don&#x27;t leave sticky stuff behind on your face.</li>
            <li> The sticker like strips are to be simply taken out from the stricker base and placed correctly on the eye brows to shape them.</li>
            <li> The moment the seller found out I had a bad experience, they emailed me and apologized that I had had trouble and issued an immediate refund!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think I have crazy arched eyebrows</li>
            <li> Really bad I can&#x27;t stand when u but something</li>
            <li> Disappointed.</li>
            <li> disappointed.  </li>
            <li> Awful, doesn&#x27;t work at all.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I BOUGHT THESE SHAPERS AND I THOUGHT THEY WOULD REMOVE ALL THE HAIR. I HAD TO KEEP USING ONE STRIP AFTER ANOTHER AND IT STILL DIDN&#x27;T GET ALL THE HAIR, AND I DON&#x27;T EVEN HAVE THICK EYEBROWS. THESE STRIPS ARE SO TIME CONSUMING!!! THE PARISSA EYEBROW WAX STRIPS ARE MUCH BETTER. I USUALLY DON&#x27;T HAVE TO USE NO MORE THAN TWO STRIPS TO GET ALL THE HAIR OFF ONE BROW, AND THE HAIR DOESN&#x27;T GROW BACK UNTIL SIX WEEKS OR MORE LATER. NO, IT WON&#x27;T GET ALL THE HAIR OFF WITH ONE STRIP EITHER, BUT IT IS SOOO MUCH BETTER. I HAVEN&#x27;T YET FOUND ANYTHING BETTER THAN THE PARISSA BRAND YET.</li>
            <li> It was a flimsy see-through strips with this adhesive on back. More of a sticker. Did nothing for me. Didn&#x27;t even removed one hair. Disappointed.</li>
            <li> Save your money.  You&#x27;d be better off tweezing with your fingers</li>
            <li> Was glad to find this at a reasonable price.  My daughter and I both use these and are not able to find them in the stores around us any longer. They work very well!!!</li>
            <li> The moment the seller found out I had a bad experience, they emailed me and apologized that I had had trouble and issued an immediate refund! Thankou! How do I send the stickie things back?&lt;br /&gt;These don&#x27;t do the job. Wasted money. They take off only a few hairs, but I used 8 sets and can&#x27;t tell. I would return them, but I used half a sheet!</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t find them at any local retail anymore.  Quick and easy to clean over, under and sides of brows.  Adhesive not strong enough for any other hairs but still OK on my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> Overall this is a good product. They come in a nice arch shape and they are pretty much pain free. The strips removed most of the hair. Make sure that the area is clean and dry and pull the strips off the opposite direction of the hair growth. I would recommend these :)</li>
            <li> I had never used any other kind of hair removal other than a tweezer. I love this product because there is minimal pain after using it.</li>
            <li> Not worth the $5 bucks I invested, did not work at all, waste of money  basically spent the money on stickers</li>
            <li> When I needed my brows done, I couldn&#x27;t find a place open with someone on duty. Desperation - I went to Walgreens and found these strips. First try didn&#x27;t work, so I read the directions. I brush my brows up to expose the stray hairs. Press the shaper on and rub it gently for about 5 seconds to warm it and get it well-stuck. Pull your skin back toward your hairline, then quickly pull the shaper off from outside in toward your nose.   Wow, I was thrilled with the change. I used the top shaper the same way, only brushing my brows down this time. Near perfect brows, no burns or redness. The little square pieces cleaned up between my brows.  I have very thick brows and these work great. I can keep my eyebrow critters under control and never have to wait to get to a salon. I&#x27;m looking for larger pieces now for my underarm areas.</li>
            <li> I am very pleased to have discovered this product! Now I can keep my brows under control myself without the time and expense involved with solon waxings. The shape is great, and they are so easy to use. You do have to peel them off in the right direction (toward your nose)as the directions indicate or they do not work. I made this mistake once.</li>
            <li> wash your face first and then pull it quickly towands to your nose, it will works.&lt;br /&gt;although pains, but i like it!</li>
            <li> Sudden Change Eyebrow Shapers are the best thing out there - no messy wax - no wondering how to shape the brows - no pain.  Not available in many stores anymore!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> I love this product!  I could no longer locate this product in my local drugstores, thank goodness I can order it from Amazon.  These eyebrow shapers really work with no pain.  I recommend this product!</li>
            <li> These eyebrow shapers are great.  They are easier than tweezing and a lot less pain than waxing.  Plus I can do my eyebrows several times for the same cost as having it done professionally, and with the same professional results.  Thank you,  Busy Mom of 2 GA boys</li>
            <li> I like how these are shaped for you - however, I have to cut them to fit my eyebrows. I don&#x27;t think I have crazy arched eyebrows but hey maybe I do.&lt;br /&gt;Another pro - these don&#x27;t leave sticky stuff behind on your face. You can use them and then immediately put on your make up.&lt;br /&gt;However - they always leave most of my hair behind. I&#x27;d say a good 75%. I end up tweezing anyway! Feel like I wasted my money.</li>
            <li> work great-but they&#x27;re not going to get every thick hair. If you want a professional job then don&#x27;t do it yourself. These are great for weekly maintenance-esp after going to a salon.</li>
            <li> They dont work at all it was like putting tape on my face, all it did was take off some skin cells let alone hair!</li>
            <li> I read the recent reviews of &amp;#34;doesn&#x27;t work&amp;#34; and assumed these ladies  just didn&#x27;t know how to use the strips.  I&#x27;ve bought this product or a similar ones previously and it&#x27;s always been OK.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The adhesive on the batch I just receive is not sticky  at all.  It  won&#x27;t attach to a hair, much less have the ability to pull it out.  I am not one to exagerate to prove a point, NOT A SINGLE HAIR.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So disappointed.  I will return if I can come up with the energy otherwise trash.</li>
            <li> This product works average</li>
            <li> This is so hard to find in the stores like Sally&#x27;s, Walgreens and other stores, so glad I found it online</li>
            <li> Delivery was fast and the item was what I wanted</li>
            <li> I purchased these hoping that they would be the perfect solution to tweezing, sadly they were not. They do remove the hair if you wash your face first and remove the oils, but the shape is all wrong and to try to cut the strips is just not for me. I would purchase these again but they are equivalent to using wax and there is still a lot of tweezing to shape your eyebrows.</li>
            <li> The item was misplaced and I never got the product. I contact the seller and the product was resend, that is good customer service. I wish I could give this a good review unfortunately,I cannot. The product does not work as advertised. I will not be buying it again. Plastic just do not work when it comes to waxing, no matter how much powder and alcohol you use on your skin.</li>
            <li> These strips are great for home eyebrow maintenance,  Super fast and easy to use with no mess and no red marks.  I find that the strip does most of the work with no trouble.  Only rarely do i need to use tweezers on one or two single hairs. The best part is the skin around my eyebrows is not at all irritated.</li>
            <li> OK, so I have problem eye brows.  I don&#x27;t have a unibrow, but they do need to be tamed.  Every couple of months I make it to my local salon and let the lady with the wax do her thing and I look great.  In between visits though I can get a little fuzzy and these strips do the trick.  They are pre-cut in a nice generic arch shape and very easy to use.  Make sure that your skin is clean and dry - I usually go over the area with a cotton ball and some skin toner.  Use these in a well-lit room, by a sunny window is best.  Warm the strips in your hand a bit before you apply them - it helps.  Press them on your skin and rub in the direction the hair grows.  Pull your skin back a bit and then pull the strip off quickly.  If it really hurts (which it won&#x27;t) you can use a little ice to numb the area.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Put some light moisturizer on afterwards and you are ready to face the world.</li>
            <li> Purchased this product because I was tired of spending a half hour with painful tweezing and wasn&#x27;t going to pay $15 at my local salon for an eyebrow waxing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I followed directions to the T. I washed my face first to get rid of oils. Then I applied the pre-cut strips, smoothed them down for a few seconds, and then removed from the outside of the face in toward the nose.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These did not remove one hair from my eyebrows. Not one. I repeated this process five or six times, only to realize that I wasted my money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would never purchase these again.</li>
            <li> Really bad I can&#x27;t stand when u but something and it says its going to work and then omit sucks. All this is is crappy tap</li>
            <li> Struggled using it. The tape does not match everyones eyebrow line of course.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Actually made my eyebrow area on one side bleed.  Beware.  Possibly I have sensitive eyes.. but do research to see if there is any better product.  if brows done at Hair Cuttery are 10 bucks... its worth the extra 3 bucks to go to Hair Cuttery or another salon.</li>
            <li> I was so excited to try this product because I am horrible at shaping my own brows, and tweezing is such a pain. But although the shape of these is nice, they have little to no stickiness and therefore don&#x27;t remove any hairs. Save your money.</li>
            <li> Works exactly how I remembered they did..</li>
            <li> I ordered this product about 3weeks ago and was excited because I have was excited to finally be able to do my own eyebrows sadly to know is that it was NOT WHAT I EXPECTED... this is a total&lt;br /&gt; Waste of money ....</li>
            <li> this product is hard to use and doesn&#x27;t do the job it is supposed to..will never buy it again ..i am returning it</li>
            <li> You might have better luck with Scotch Tape than this. These shapers removed 0.0 hairs on my brows. Also, the design of the tape is unlike any eyebrow I&#x27;ve ever seen.&lt;br /&gt;My recommendation if you choose to buy this is to use them to tape wrapping paper.</li>
            <li> This is nothing but a piece of scotch tape on paper</li>
            <li> This isn&#x27;t really as you would expect, it&#x27;s not as effective as wax or a salon threading, the arch is only subtle.&lt;br /&gt;Another, it didn&#x27;t really remove as much hair as I wanted on the first go, I needed to use up one whole page just to get the necessary effect, and that is just such a waste.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Moral, stick to wax.</li>
            <li> Stellar. Just be sure you wash off all makeup and have a dry face.</li>
            <li> when the eye brown wax strips are placed and pulled properly. The sticker like strips are to be simply taken out from the stricker base and placed correctly on the eye brows to shape them.</li>
            <li> this product is so easy to use and the results are perfect...no pain just nice eyebrows.....no mess..would highly recommend&lt;br /&gt;enjoy this and forget the trip to the salon</li>
            <li> Awful, doesn&#x27;t work at all. I waste my money with this item.</li>
            <li> good product.  easy to shape eyebrows using this product.  it&#x27;s easy, cheap and the end result is very good.  thanks</li>
            <li> This is a waste of money, doesn&#x27;t really work it may pull out 10 hairs in like 5 stickers and doesn&#x27;t really fits my brows shape.</li>
