            <li>both VERY pleased with this product!</li>

            <li>They are just what I wanted and the price was great.  </li>
            <li>These toothbrushes are great.</li>
            <li>For those who like a hard-bristled brush, this one is great.  </li>
            <li>This is a great purchase and the delivery and service was great.  </li>
            <li>We have always been happy with them.</li>
            <li>My teeth are happy.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so thrilled to have found these toothbrushes!  </li>
            <li>Just to give you gums a good work out.  </li>
            <li>i recieved a newer design brush that is not as good.</li>
            <li>As a smoker I need a toothbrush that really cleans, and these work perfect for me.</li>
            <li>The bristles are not firm anymore; its medium at best compare to the ones bought before November, 2010.  </li>
            <li>My whole family is happy with the quality and service.  </li>
            <li>I suggest more people try them out.</li>
            <li>I was glad to be able to order them online.</li>
            <li>The product came on time and there were no problems, I am pleased to have a stash of toothbrushes to draw from when I need one.</li>
            <li>If you can use some, don&#x27;t hesitate to buy as many of these as you might need for a while.</li>
            <li>So glad they are still available on the internet.  </li>
            <li>My order was easy to place and came to my house in just days.</li>
            <li>I feel like I can really get a good clean</li>
            <li>Seems the dentists don&#x27;t want us to get our teeth too clean.  </li>
            <li>he was so happy he had to wake me up before he left for work to look at his smile.</li>
            <li>They actually clean your teeth and they can be used for a longer period of time.</li>
            <li>we had a good laugh that we both ordered the same thing.</li>
            <li>No strange shapes, no weird rubber interspersed with the bristles, just a full size good toothbrush.</li>
            <li>I thought who needs \\&quot;12 toothbrushes?\\&quot; when I came across this item, but seeing the comments here about having problems finding them in stores and my own experience who knows how long they will be available so I might as well stock up.     </li>
            <li>Firm toothbrushes are great.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s nice to know I don&#x27;t have to worry about where my next toothbrush is coming from.</li>
            <li>Walmart used to carry it, but I have not been able to find it recently.  </li>
            <li>They do a better job of cleaning and last longer.</li>
            <li>I have cut myself repeatedly from the pressure required in trying to get my teeth clean with one of those soft things.&lt;br /&gt;YAY</li>
            <li>These arrived and are of very good quality, exactly as described and I ordered enough to last several years.</li>
            <li>It really doesn&#x27;t bother me till I use one; the most important aspect of the firm brush is absent.  </li>
            <li>When the firm thoothbrushes were taken off store shelves, we tried the medium brushes but did not do the same great job.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t get cavities and have used these brushes my whole life</li>
            <li>They really made your teeth feel cleaned.  </li>
            <li>Thanks for giving the consumer the choice.</li>
            <li>thanks to Amazon for offering it.</li>
            <li>You can get a very thorough scrubbing with these.</li>
            <li>Its not a three times a day brush but a good brush to mix up with your everyday soft brush.  </li>
            <li>low rating is based on this ridiculous pricing scheme, not the product, which is pretty good!</li>
            <li>Thanks to Amazon I am able to get a supply of firm toothbrushes.</li>
            <li>Firm toothbrushes work much better for me.</li>
            <li>Even my dentist says my firm toothbrushes clean my teeth better than soft ones and do a better job with my gums without irritating them.  </li>
            <li>Man what a new one of these will do for your gums.  </li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t like the new ones.  </li>
            <li>I ordered the pack of 6 and should confirm that what I received was 6 two-packs (12 brushes) exactly as shown in the picture (The white handles with the colored stripes).  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve found that this toothbrush in firm, is not always easy to find thats why I purchased 12 of them.</li>
            <li>I would say they are between soft and medium.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m still considered an adult on the internet.</li>
            <li>I wanted the old style reach toothbrushes.  </li>
            <li>Looked on line to see if anyone had the old ones.</li>
            <li>This item was pictured as the old ones but was not.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used this particular Reach toothbrush for a number of years, along with various others that I&#x27;ve tryed and always return to this product.</li>
            <li>B001E96P78 Reach Full Head Toothbrush, Firm, Assorted Colors, 2-Count Packages (Pack of 6)]]re</li>
            <li>I love the hard bristle!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been stuck on this brand for as long as I can remember, really like it; this jumbo pack seemed like a great deal @ least @ 1st, but after some 2 years (that how long each of them lasts), the new ones start out shedding a few bunches of the fibers at the top; pretty annoying; almost seems like they are degrading on storage;</li>
            <li>New brushes from December &#x60;10 come with minor difference; although the grip and neck angle is unchanged but the bristles are no longer flat and with a \\&quot;ripjaw\\</li>
            <li>More product should at least cost comparatively, if not less, but surely not MORE!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li> The Reach Firm Toothbrush has always been my choice for toothbrush since 2007 till now.  New brushes from December &#x60;10 come with minor difference; although the grip and neck angle is unchanged but the bristles are no longer flat and with a \\&quot;ripjaw\\&quot; overall look.  It really doesn&#x27;t bother me till I use one; the most important aspect of the firm brush is absent.  The bristles are not firm anymore; its medium at best compare to the ones bought before November, 2010.  It&#x27;s a shame, I wonder if both the firm/medium has the same firmness.</li>
            <li> not taking long storage well?  I&#x27;ve been stuck on this brand for as long as I can remember, really like it; this jumbo pack seemed like a great deal @ least @ 1st, but after some 2 years (that how long each of them lasts), the new ones start out shedding a few bunches of the fibers at the top; pretty annoying; almost seems like they are degrading on storage;</li>

            <li> I have been trying to find these toothbrushes for over a year.  They are just what I wanted and the price was great.  I got them in record breaking time.  My whole family is happy with the quality and service.  I am going to place another order soon.</li>
            <li> These toothbrushes are great. All you can find in stores are soft and medium ,mushy, \\&quot;half headed,\\&quot; toothbruhes.  I always bought them at Wal Mart, but they quit handling them as Wal Mart often does with the things you like.</li>
            <li> Why do these go from $5.26+$1.99 for two-pack to $24.14+$3.99 for a six-pack?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ditto to the difficulty if finding hard tbrushes.  Even Medium are disappearing, and to the PC&#x27;s out there proffering soft tbrushes, one must brush harder and likely  damage gums and teeth with one of those nonsense and useless products.  I have cut myself repeatedly from the pressure required in trying to get my teeth clean with one of those soft things.&lt;br /&gt;YAY AMZ!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But please reconsider this outrageous pricing.

I don&#x27;t get cavities and have used these brushes my whole life so I am not about to stop.  This is a great purchase and the delivery and service was great.

            <li> These little monsters are getting harder and harder to find.  I was really concerned when i saw a recent review that said they were not as firm as in the past.  Well, i got mine in only two days and broke one out as soon as i saw the box.  Man what a new one of these will do for your gums.  Its not a three times a day brush but a good brush to mix up with your everyday soft brush.  Just to give you gums a good work out.  Thank you Amazon!</li>

I ordered the pack of 6 and should confirm that what I received was 6 two-packs (12 brushes) exactly as shown in the picture (The white handles with the colored stripes).  The shipping was prompt and the product was delivered on time with no problems.  My teeth are happy.</li>
            <li> my boyfriend&#x27;s birthday was coming up and i wanted to get him something he has been wanting for a long time and could use. this was the perfect gift. he has been on the hunt for firm toothbrushes. you can&#x27;t find them in any stores! i ordered them and they arrived in plenty of time for his birthday. two days before his birthday he told me he had gone on amazon.com and ordered a bunch of firm toothbrushes. we had a good laugh that we both ordered the same thing. i gave him one toothbrush on the morning of his birthday. he was so happy he had to wake me up before he left for work to look at his smile. i hide the other 11 around the house and made him find them that evening. we a[[ASIN:B001E96P78 Reach Full Head Toothbrush, Firm, Assorted Colors, 2-Count Packages (Pack of 6)]]re both VERY pleased with this product!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this particular Reach toothbrush for a number of years, along with various others that I&#x27;ve tryed and always return to this product. I guess it must be working since my twice annual dental appointments have shown no tooth or gum issues in ages. I&#x27;ve found that this toothbrush in firm, is not always easy to find thats why I purchased 12 of them.</li>
            <li> Once again the \\&quot;Do-Gooders\\&quot; have decided to save us from ourselves and remove our option to use firm bristled toothbrushes. I can&#x27;t find them anywhere in my area of California, and it&#x27;s increasingly difficult to find even the medium bristled brushes. Thank goodness I&#x27;m still considered an adult on the internet. I&#x27;m putting in an order tonight. Woo-hoo!</li>
            <li> This item is not as pictured on line.  I wanted the old style reach toothbrushes.  Don&#x27;t like the new ones.  Looked on line to see if anyone had the old ones. This item was pictured as the old ones but was not. Not worth my time to ship it back.  Rather than return them, I donated them to Goodwill.</li>
            <li> it is so hard to find the FIRM reach brush so I went online.</li>
            <li> Firm toothbrushes are great.  They actually clean your teeth and they can be used for a longer period of time.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to find &amp;#34;firm&amp;#34; toothbrushes, so I was glad to be able to order them online. The product came on time and there were no problems, I am pleased to have a stash of toothbrushes to draw from when I need one.</li>
            <li> Thanks to Amazon I am able to get a supply of firm toothbrushes. I am anxious that how long will this continue? Is firm toothbrush going to join the ranks of Dodo, Dinosaurs?</li>
            <li> Even my dentist says my firm toothbrushes clean my teeth better than soft ones and do a better job with my gums without irritating them.  Unfortunately neither my dentist or local stores can provide firm toothbrushes.  These truly are firm like the ones I used to purchase at the local store.  So glad they are still available on the internet.  If you can use some, don&#x27;t hesitate to buy as many of these as you might need for a while.</li>
            <li> This is the type of tooth brush that I like.  You can get a very thorough scrubbing with these.</li>
            <li> I love the hard bristle! I feel like I can really get a good clean</li>
