            <li>I think this product is amazing.  </li>
            <li>It has a pleasant smell, non-greasy, and leaves the hair moisturized and fabulous.</li>
            <li>, sometimes things with amazing reviews (which happens to me more often than not on hair products) turn out being a dud.</li>
            <li>I wanted to love this moisturizer</li>
            <li>I love the results this has had and wish I had been using it all winter.</li>
            <li>I think more Argan oil in formula cost more.</li>

            <li>all i can say that its ok it drys my hair</li>

            <li>love the scent</li>
            <li>And I&#x27;m glad it wasn&#x27;t just me.</li>
            <li>Like another reviewer said that&#x27;s why it&#x27;s important to try things on your own</li>
            <li>Having a good stylist who knows your hair and can refer products would make this so much easier.</li>
            <li>I was using some cheap Neutrogena stuff for a while (for budgetary reasons) and thought I&#x27;d give my hair a treat.  </li>
            <li>I am glad I saw it there first because I don&#x27;t think I would have tried it at this price with all the neagtive reviews.  </li>
            <li>It would be great to be able to use their entire line again as a natural.</li>
            <li>Love the whole line for my relaxed hair.</li>
            <li>All the other Creme of Nature products are great.</li>
            <li>Quick note</li>
            <li>i did not read the reviews, anyways when i first bought this product i had high hope s because it contained argan oil, which is very good for the hair &amp; i have dry hair</li>
            <li>But you can&#x27;t apply too much because your hair could get to oily!!</li>
            <li>I am black and my hair is natural  has to be done and this product is perfect.</li>
            <li>Its good on wet hair.</li>
            <li>I used it twice because I was determined to get my money&#x27;s worth but its going to be dumped.</li>
            <li>so I dont know if it would fare any better on natural hair, but all in all?</li>
            <li>It is soft and has a healthy shine to it.</li>
            <li>This product is definitely better for natural hair.</li>
            <li>I have always wanted to use Moroccan oil &amp; thought I might get lucky &amp; find my brand on the first try.  </li>
            <li>My mistake was thinking that this product would be as good as other products in the Creme of Nature line.</li>
            <li>I initially used it liberally on my natural AA hair at night, and loved the silky soothing effect.  </li>
            <li>I read the reviews after I tried it for the first time.</li>
            <li>and I was nervous about manipulating my hair without applying a bit of olive oil first.  </li>
            <li>As a matter for fact, the entire Creme of Nature Argan Oil line are the best products on the market today for African American hair.  </li>
            <li>I decided to cut my hair into a short cut and start growing it again, healthy.</li>
            <li>I love the entire line of products because it has made my hair a lot stronger and healthier used together.</li>
            <li>This is my first time using it</li>
            <li>This is why all products should have sample sizes for people to try first because reviews somethimes do not help.</li>
            <li>I am so glad I finally gave up on the idea of no mineral oil, no this no that.  </li>
            <li>First off i would just like to say before i purchased this product</li>
            <li>My hair is natural and a nice middle grade of hair...</li>
            <li>After using the product, I could tell immediately that my hair was much stronger.</li>
            <li>In the AM, after removing my hair wrap, it seemed that my hair didnâ€™t really absorb and/or retain much moisture</li>
            <li>it feels like i put honey straight up in my hair</li>
            <li>I would definitely reccommed using the entire product line, because maybe that is why I am having such good results.</li>
            <li>I am currently using the Pura d&#x27;Or hair loss prevention with the John Freda full repair conditioner.</li>
            <li>I have naturally curly hair that responds to oil very well.  </li>
            <li>My hair after shampooing is normally curly...</li>
            <li>I have been using the product system for two weeks and have seen an inch in new growth, of course I wear my hair natural 85% of the time to avoid heat styling too.</li>
            <li>The next morning I combed through my hair same effects and as a consequence I had to find a way to reverse the effects quickly without.</li>
            <li>Went in a large expensive circle (thinking I would use new fancier products) and went right back around to home :)</li>
            <li>clearly.</li>
            <li>It worked perfectly on my natural hair.</li>
            <li>I like how this product keeps my hair so soft</li>
            <li>The all natural stuff wasn&#x27;t working for my hair.  </li>
            <li>, I have only tried this on my straight hair, haven&#x27;t given it a try on twists or twists outs.  </li>
            <li>My twistouts are nice and stretched out yet defined and remain that way the entire day, even with the unpredictable weather (e.g. 40&#x27;s in the morning - 70&#x27;s in the afternoon).</li>
            <li>after hot oil treatments, and washing my hair again with the Creme of Nature, my hair was still dry and brittle.</li>
            <li>My hair has never been better, breakage (which I always had an issue with in the past), is virtually non existent since I started using this line of product last October 2014.</li>
            <li>I had to do a deep conditioning treatment in order to return my hair to normal.</li>
            <li>and before I knew it, the texture of my hair changed dramatically; it was hard, brittle and inevitably easy to break ...with a slide of my fingers through my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>When I left the hair dresser, my hair was soft and shiny.</li>
            <li>I used this on 2 different hair types, natural (my son&#x27;s) and relaxed (mine)</li>
            <li>I have shoulder length natural hair (African American)</li>
            <li>I had weak hair that broke too easily.</li>
            <li>I still use the product (only at night) and might buy it again, but now, I mix it with some pure argan, Jamaican black castor, jojoba, or olive oil before applying it to my hair at night.  </li>
            <li>The very moment I put it on the ends of my hair, it felt dry &amp; rough against my hair.</li>
            <li>If you are experiencing the same negative effects of this product and want to reverse it quickly, follow my steps and leave the conditioner for 30 minutes to an hour; wash and rinse as usual.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>the other hand, I used this product on my son&#x27;s very wavy/curly but dry hair and this detangled and softened his hair like nothing else ever has.</li>

            <li> My hair doesn&#x27;t become &#x27;wet&#x27; as some say maybe due to me not using so much.</li>
            <li> A week later, I washed it myself and the next day, dry and brittle.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m African American with relaxed hair that&#x27;s started to shed and have dry ends.</li>
            <li> The first attempt left my hair dry, hard and brittle.</li>
            <li> I knew my hair couldn&#x27;t possibly be damaged, I just had it cut for crying out loud.</li>
            <li> I thought about it and was like hair is dead and as long as I am not putting it on my scalp why not purchase products that actually work for my natural hair.  </li>
            <li> Like the next person, I don&#x27;t want a product that&#x27;s too greasy, but this, this is just the extreme opposite.</li>
            <li> I have very dry hair with low porosity, brittle,split ends,  maybe a 4C grade.  </li>
            <li> and I put a nickle size amount in my hair, blow dry &amp; flat iron.</li>
            <li> I tried it when my hair was dry, it immediately caused this weird stiffness and left my hair super greasy...</li>
            <li> The same result with the other cond.</li>
            <li> I only use this product every other day.  </li>
            <li> I started googling what causes dry and brittle hair, and that&#x27;s when I came across other reviews saying the same thing about Creme of Naure.</li>
            <li> But this is a huge (disappointment doesn&#x27;t even begin to describe it) frustration for me; especially since I Just cleaned my hair.</li>
            <li> I was holding for something to soften and moisturize my already dry hair but this isn&#x27;t it.</li>
            <li> my hair is itchy, dry, brittle..</li>
            <li> My hair doesn&#x27;t feel dry, fried, or brittle.</li>
            <li> His hair is naturally dry</li>
            <li> My hair is so dry</li>
            <li> This product helps the dry ends.</li>
            <li> so i thought it would work i used it once on my dry hair</li>
            <li> No dry ends all day and no breakage and less shedding.</li>
            <li> I used it on my wet hair after a deep moisturising steam and this oil moisturiser immediately stripped my hair of whatever softness/moisturisation the other product I used provided.</li>
            <li> I applied it to wet hair and let it air dry.</li>
            <li> I have used this twice on my hair both wet and dry</li>
            <li> The texture is strange, somehow dry as straw, tangled, while also being greasy &amp; weighed down.  </li>
            <li> All you need is a little bit, which goes a long wait and lasts all day long.  </li>
            <li> ABSOLUTELY NOT...</li>
            <li> But I figured it was just a result of using my flat iron on a lower setting, meaning that my hair was probably a little puffy.</li>
            <li> Two days later, I&#x27;ve used this product all over my hair and it looks and feels absolutely stiff.</li>
            <li> i completely agree with the other negative reviews.</li>
            <li> Just a quarter sized messages into very wet hair would do.</li>
            <li> it makes my hair oily stiff AND dry.</li>
            <li> &amp; it felt very stiff and left my hair greasy the next day my hair was very dry, so i used it a second time and got the same results i was very disappointed by this product it does absolutely nothing for relaxed hair will not be repurchasing.</li>
            <li> and I only have to use a very small amount.</li>
            <li> I wet my hair minimally, applied olive oil, combed the ends of my hair, then added a wallop of thick hair conditioner, comb again and let it set.</li>
            <li> This is a must have for black hair.</li>
            <li> It made my hair hard and dry..</li>
            <li> but it was a waste of my money.</li>
            <li> The first time I used it, I was disappointed.</li>
            <li> Not sure what&#x27;s happening to my hair.</li>
            <li> I use a small (quarter size)amount on my ends at night, wear a silk cap and in the morining I style and go.</li>
            <li> and it makes my hair feel dry and weird...</li>
            <li> HUGE disappointment and a waste of my hard earned money :-(</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sorry, but I have Got to agree with the other negative reviews.</li>
            <li> I like the other Creme of nature products, but i think ill pass on this one.</li>
            <li> I mean its here</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I just wanted this for like a basic moisturizer. I hate the way it makes my hair look and feel. I like the other Creme of nature products, but i think ill pass on this one.</li>
            <li> Terrible! I wanted to love this moisturizer but it didn&#x27;t work for me at all. I read the reviews after I tried it for the first time. The first attempt left my hair dry, hard and brittle. I figured that it turned out dry because my hair was dirty and unwashed. I tried it again the next day after I washed my hair. I applied it to wet hair and let it air dry. The next day, my hair was even drier. I had to do a deep conditioning treatment in order to return my hair to normal. I was holding for something to soften and moisturize my already dry hair but this isn&#x27;t it. I threw the entire bottle in the trash. Will never recommend.</li>
            <li> I had weak hair that broke too easily. I purchased a box of relaxer with a sample pack inside. After using the product, I could tell immediately that my hair was much stronger. No product has ever done that before. I got on the Internet, searched for it, purchased it immediately and have been using it daily since. I found a solution. One that is none greasy, smells great and I only have to use a very small amount. Best used when your hair is damp. This is the only product review I have posted.</li>
            <li> I hate his product! The first time I used it, I was disappointed. I began using it as a night time moisturizer and before I knew it, the texture of my hair changed dramatically; it was hard, brittle and inevitably easy to break ...with a slide of my fingers through my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used it a second time the following year. I mean its here, i tend to like the effects of argan and I thought to myself, &#x27; it was probably something else&#x27;. The next morning I combed through my hair same effects and as a consequence I had to find a way to reverse the effects quickly without. I wet my hair minimally, applied olive oil, combed the ends of my hair, then added a wallop of thick hair conditioner, comb again and let it set. If you are experiencing the same negative effects of this product and want to reverse it quickly, follow my steps and leave the conditioner for 30 minutes to an hour; wash and rinse as usual.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hope that helped!</li>
            <li> I have naturally curly hair that responds to oil very well.  I was using some cheap Neutrogena stuff for a while (for budgetary reasons) and thought I&#x27;d give my hair a treat.  I have always wanted to use Moroccan oil &amp; thought I might get lucky &amp; find my brand on the first try.  No such luck.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair is unhappy, my hair&#x27;s appearance is unhappy, which makes me unhappy.  The texture is strange, somehow dry as straw, tangled, while also being greasy &amp; weighed down.  It&#x27;s hard to imagine a worse result.  The hunt continues...</li>
            <li> I have used this twice on my hair both wet and dry and it makes my hair feel dry and weird... Anything but moisturizing i would say</li>
            <li> I agree with those who said this product doesnâ€™t work as well as you would expect a creamy leave in moisturizer to work.  I initially used it liberally on my natural AA hair at night, and loved the silky soothing effect.  In the AM, after removing my hair wrap, it seemed that my hair didnâ€™t really absorb and/or retain much moisture and I was nervous about manipulating my hair without applying a bit of olive oil first.  I still use the product (only at night) and might buy it again, but now, I mix it with some pure argan, Jamaican black castor, jojoba, or olive oil before applying it to my hair at night.  I probably wouldnâ€™t recommend this to anyone with relaxed/chemically treated hair.</li>
            <li> My twistouts had not been working all winter. I use this before twisting my hair and then seal with the CON leave-in spray. I love the results this has had and wish I had been using it all winter. My twistouts are nice and stretched out yet defined and remain that way the entire day, even with the unpredictable weather (e.g. 40&#x27;s in the morning - 70&#x27;s in the afternoon). I hope this works as well during spring and summer since I grew up using CON products and considered them a staple when my hair was permed. It would be great to be able to use their entire line again as a natural.</li>
            <li> Its good on wet hair. Just a quarter sized messages into very wet hair would do. Too bad mineral oil comes before Argan oil on list of ingredients. Maybe Creme of Nature should&#x27;ve added a plant oil like sunflower or soybean oil as an alternative? I think more Argan oil in formula cost more.</li>
            <li> The BEST leave moisturizer EVER.  All you need is a little bit, which goes a long wait and lasts all day long.  I will never use another moisturizer again, period.  As a matter for fact, the entire Creme of Nature Argan Oil line are the best products on the market today for African American hair.  My hair has never been better, breakage (which I always had an issue with in the past), is virtually non existent since I started using this line of product last October 2014.</li>
            <li> this is the worst product ever. my hair is itchy, dry, brittle..i have used it three days and i will be throwing it away. i kept hoping it would work but it was a waste of my money. my hair is relaxed and normally a nice oil or moisturerzer works great this product is giving my hair no sheen and only brittleness.</li>
            <li> Excellent before heat</li>
            <li> After using a LOC system for my hair Liquid (Water) Oil and I seal it in with this.  I have very dry hair with low porosity, brittle,split ends,  maybe a 4C grade.  Sometimes I think my hair grows in Damaged. Well anyway this process using this helps.</li>
            <li> This is a must have for black hair. It has a pleasant smell, non-greasy, and leaves the hair moisturized and fabulous. I bought some for my daughter and I love the way it leaves her hair.</li>
            <li> all i can say that its ok it drys my hair idk it is creamy but eh idk i wouldnt use it again</li>
            <li> I started using Creme of Nature after I switched from Motions. I was on the argan oil wave. I started using the relaxer, shampoo, and conditioner. My hair texture started changing. I figured I over processed my hair with the relaxer. after hot oil treatments, and washing my hair again with the Creme of Nature, my hair was still dry and brittle. I decided to cut my hair into a short cut and start growing it again, healthy. When I left the hair dresser, my hair was soft and shiny. A week later, I washed it myself and the next day, dry and brittle. I knew my hair couldn&#x27;t possibly be damaged, I just had it cut for crying out loud. I started googling what causes dry and brittle hair, and that&#x27;s when I came across other reviews saying the same thing about Creme of Naure. I can&#x27;t believe I chopped off all my hair and it&#x27;s all because I switched to another product. I should have stayed with what worked for me.</li>
            <li> My hair is natural and a nice middle grade of hair...My hair after shampooing is normally curly...It made my hair hard and dry.. I don&#x27;t understand it ... its creamy , yet it has this drying affect... ABSOLUTELY NOT...</li>
            <li> i completely agree with the other negative reviews. I purchased this product to try out this brand and i also need a heat protecting product. i tried to use it before straightening my hair. my hair is RUINED after using this product. it makes my hair oily stiff AND dry. my straightened hair becomes curly because of it. it feels like i put honey straight up in my hair its sticky!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;waste of money. big time.</li>
            <li> My mistake was thinking that this product would be as good as other products in the Creme of Nature line. Let me tell you...it is the worst. I bought it without reviewing it. I would have realized that no one fancied it. I used it twice because I was determined to get my money&#x27;s worth but its going to be dumped. It makes my hair feel like a brillo pad. In the ingredient list the second ingredient is Mineral Oil. I  should have seen that sooner. My hair is relaxed so I dont know if it would fare any better on natural hair, but all in all? HUGE disappointment and a waste of my hard earned money :-(</li>
            <li> I just bought this product as a heat protectant. I love the entire line of products because it has made my hair a lot stronger and healthier used together. Anyways you do not need a lot of this product, maybe that is why people are having problems. I have shoulder length natural hair (African American) and I put a nickle size amount in my hair, blow dry &amp; flat iron. It comes out so silky and shiny. No product has EVER done that to my hair, not chi silk infusion, not anything! My hair doesn&#x27;t become &#x27;wet&#x27; as some say maybe due to me not using so much. My hair doesn&#x27;t feel dry, fried, or brittle. It is soft and has a healthy shine to it. I can definitley tell you if you use the product like this, you will be satisfied. I would definitely reccommed using the entire product line, because maybe that is why I am having such good results. I have been using the product system for two weeks and have seen an inch in new growth, of course I wear my hair natural 85% of the time to avoid heat styling too.</li>
            <li> I really love this. It worked perfectly on my natural hair. I am black and my hair is natural  has to be done and this product is perfect. If you want to see how i use the product watch my youtube video and subscribe, if you have any question ask me on the comment section [...]</li>
            <li> This product is definitely better for natural hair. I used this on 2 different hair types, natural (my son&#x27;s) and relaxed (mine) this is the absolute worst product I have ever used on my chemically treated hair. I tried it when my hair was dry, it immediately caused this weird stiffness and left my hair super greasy... I used it on my wet hair after a deep moisturising steam and this oil moisturiser immediately stripped my hair of whatever softness/moisturisation the other product I used provided. I am trying to figure out what to do to reverse this madness!&lt;br /&gt;on the other hand, I used this product on my son&#x27;s very wavy/curly but dry hair and this detangled and softened his hair like nothing else ever has. His hair is naturally dry and we know how frizzy curly hair gets, the creme of Nature moisturiser helps tremendously.&lt;br /&gt;I love the scent but I will never use it on my hair again. If the great effects continue until the bottle finishes, I will purchase again for my son.</li>
            <li> I like how this product keeps my hair so soft and manageable!doesnt make my hair feel oily and sticky! Smells great too:)</li>
            <li> Love the whole line for my relaxed hair. My mom used these products on me when I was younger. Went in a large expensive circle (thinking I would use new fancier products) and went right back around to home :)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sorry, but I have Got to agree with the other negative reviews. And I&#x27;m glad it wasn&#x27;t just me. I washed my hair and used this product. The very moment I put it on the ends of my hair, it felt dry &amp; rough against my hair. But I figured it was just a result of using my flat iron on a lower setting, meaning that my hair was probably a little puffy. Two days later, I&#x27;ve used this product all over my hair and it looks and feels absolutely stiff. I have never seen my hair look this way &amp; I&#x27;ve certainly never experienced my hair feeling this way &amp; just... it just feels off. Like the next person, I don&#x27;t want a product that&#x27;s too greasy, but this, this is just the extreme opposite. All the other Creme of Nature products are great. But this is a huge (disappointment doesn&#x27;t even begin to describe it) frustration for me; especially since I Just cleaned my hair. About to wash it again &amp; get this crap out.</li>
            <li> This is my first time using it and I loved the product!!  My hair is so dry and i was looking for a conditioner that I used before and i used to loved, the name of the cond. was \\&quot;perfect results\\&quot; it was an amazing conditioner but I moved to nj and i couldn&#x27;t find it here,so I decided to buy a sample from this product and the result was perfect!! The same result with the other cond. so now I gonna start to use it!! But you can&#x27;t apply too much because your hair could get to oily!! That&#x27;s why I don&#x27;t give 5star!!</li>
            <li> This is why all products should have sample sizes for people to try first because reviews somethimes do not help. I have used products with 4 and 5 star reviews (Joico K-Pak, WEN)and wanted, hoped, prayed that they would work and they didn&#x27;t. I&#x27;m African American with relaxed hair that&#x27;s started to shed and have dry ends. Not sure what&#x27;s happening to my hair. This product helps the dry ends. I use a small (quarter size)amount on my ends at night, wear a silk cap and in the morining I style and go. No dry ends all day and no breakage and less shedding. But once I wash my hair I start all over again so it&#x27;s not making the problems go away. Still looking for help with that. I am currently using the Pura d&#x27;Or hair loss prevention with the John Freda full repair conditioner. Everyone&#x27;s hair is different and what works for one person may not work for others...clearly. Having a good stylist who knows your hair and can refer products would make this so much easier. Sigh...</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t do it for me. I still feel the same</li>
            <li> I am sad to see all the negative reviews.  I think this product is amazing.  I am so glad I finally gave up on the idea of no mineral oil, no this no that.  The all natural stuff wasn&#x27;t working for my hair.  For some reason my hair is always dry even cutting out all the things that natural czars say are bad for your hair.  I thought about it and was like hair is dead and as long as I am not putting it on my scalp why not purchase products that actually work for my natural hair.  So this was one of the products I purchased.  I think it is a perfect balance between water and oil.  Quick note, I have only tried this on my straight hair, haven&#x27;t given it a try on twists or twists outs.  You know sometimes products can be too watery sometimes they can be too oily, this was the perfect medium between the two and lasts in my hair all day.  I only use this product every other day.  At the big box store this only costs around $5 so I don&#x27;t know why its so expensive here.  I am glad I saw it there first because I don&#x27;t think I would have tried it at this price with all the neagtive reviews.  Like another reviewer said that&#x27;s why it&#x27;s important to try things on your own, sometimes things with amazing reviews (which happens to me more often than not on hair products) turn out being a dud.</li>
            <li> First off i would just like to say before i purchased this product i did not read the reviews, anyways when i first bought this product i had high hope s because it contained argan oil, which is very good for the hair &amp; i have dry hair so i thought it would work i used it once on my dry hair &amp; it felt very stiff and left my hair greasy the next day my hair was very dry, so i used it a second time and got the same results i was very disappointed by this product it does absolutely nothing for relaxed hair will not be repurchasing.</li>
