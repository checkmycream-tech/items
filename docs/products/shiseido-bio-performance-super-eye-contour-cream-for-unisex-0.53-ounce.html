            <li>I sometime dispense more than I plan to and this is wasteful.  </li>

            <li>It is a very good to the eye contour cream is quite moisturizing, and its packaging is very useful to apply and not waste product.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m really happy with this product,provides amazing moisture, and even helps keep dark circles away, I will buy this again and continue to use.</li>
            <li>Fine lines are still there</li>
            <li>however when to check and they said it was fine..</li>
            <li>stinging no residue and Best thing a little bit goes along way, although it says you can put it on your eyelid</li>

            <li>It does not burn your eyes if you smooth it around your eyes, that is why I love it so much</li>
            <li>My only dilema will be to find a genuine good seller here or buy it again from macy&#x27;s.</li>
            <li>is nothing special at all.</li>
            <li>really wanted to love this</li>
            <li>and I still have enough I would say for a good couple of weeks, so it lasted me a while.</li>
            <li>I like the way my concealer looks when applied over the Super Eye Contour Cream cream.</li>
            <li>Hmm.. I don&#x27;t know-- the woman at the counter told me that true results and a balanced skin would result after 6-12 weeks worth of use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The lines around my eyes are less visible, and it feels great, not grease at all.</li>
            <li>so I have the most sensitive eyes, so</li>
            <li>You will notice a difference in your under eye circles immediately and in how hydrated and minimized your laugh lines</li>
            <li>She&#x27;s been a long time Shiseido user and her skin looks better than mine!</li>
            <li>Thank you very much for the cream.</li>
            <li>The first difference I noticed was that my skin got firmer under the eye</li>
            <li>How are you supposed to find out it is not a product your skin can handle without trying it first.  </li>
            <li>and I see defference from he first month.</li>
            <li>no different from drug store products, but costs alot more....</li>
            <li>It goes on so smooth, it&#x27;s not that greasy and heavy at all love</li>
            <li>Buying on Amazon is pure brillance because this is such a good product that my local store often runs out.  </li>
            <li>All I know is that the skin under my eyes is super soft and baby skin looking.</li>
            <li>and it has made such a huge difference.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Anyhow, I really thought I&#x27;d hit the jackpot when the woman at the counter sold me... not once, but twice, but this--</li>
            <li>Highly recommended!</li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t really give this a fair/honest evaluation.  </li>
            <li>I am very allergic to the product.  </li>
            <li>REALLY?</li>
            <li>Wondering maybe I don&#x27;t really need this since I use a night emulsion which keeps my eyes just as hydrated overnight.</li>
            <li>Shipped fast</li>
            <li>I like it so much.</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>It is worth every penny you pay for it and it is worth keeping an extra one on hand.  </li>
            <li>I feel the eye cream is rich enough for winter time.</li>
            <li>my eyes were highly agitated.&lt;br</li>
            <li>no fountain of youth, slight improvement in fine wrinkles//lines after applying</li>
            <li>With regular use results will be visible quickly; however, coffee and stress, a poor diet and lack of sleep will not work in your favor and not even that product will be able to fix the damage you create by your lifestyle.</li>
            <li>It absorbs quickly and never interfers with my makeup (even in the summer when other creams tend to melt your eye make up off).  </li>
            <li>I had no fine lines whatsoever until last year when I turned 34 and there was a fine line showing when I laugh at the corner of my left eye and some other fine lines under that same eye since I sleep on my left side .</li>
            <li>I contemplated doing a video review so fellow young women could see the affects of this cream on my eyes, but decided against it for personal reasons :</li>
            <li>legit-- small tiny pimples below my eye where most people have dark</li>

            <li> legit-- small tiny pimples below my eye where most people have dark</li>
            <li> The cream also has a hard time absorbing into the skin, so if you try to apply in the morning before your makeup, you definitely have another force working against you--</li>
            <li> Why did I use it for so long?</li>
            <li> Good base for concealer.</li>
            <li> Same quality as other eye creams.</li>
            <li> Just a little concern when it came the bottle had the little piece that shows that has not been open , however if you notice this product can be open from the entire head ..</li>
            <li> The only issue I found was that the pump stop pumping when it was half ways</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> However, after using it once (only 1 small pump)</li>
            <li> I purchase skin products online regularly from other suppliers and have NEVER had a problem returning them if not completely satisfied with the product.</li>
            <li> If you are still reading this review and haven&#x27;t bought it yet, you might miss out because other people read quicker and are clicking on the purchase button now.......</li>
            <li> you can buy this or other, makes no difference.</li>
            <li> but it didn&#x27;t take that long for them to soften and be less noticible and i do notice a difference when I get lazy and don&#x27;t put it, so I will try to not skip one day.</li>
            <li> now I have this weird red mark on both eyes almost like red eyeliner jutting out from the outer corner of my eyes creating an almost \\&quot;catlike\\&quot; eyeliner effect from the irritation.</li>
            <li> It was then when it turned into a mission to find a cream that my sensitive eyes can take and after trial and error buying from oil of olay which had retonoid and was a major disaster and burned around my eyes and also obagi eye cream which formed a horrible white crust and seemed to do nothing.</li>
            <li> There was very little product in the container</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;ve used this cream every night for the past almost 4 months now</li>
            <li> I am annoyed a little by the way the dispenser works since it can get messy and gum up the opening.  </li>
            <li> it was feeling a little thin before.</li>
            <li> Woke up with weird crusties around both corners of both eyes, as well as redness and irritation.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve seen bad results.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> It does not burn your eyes if you smooth it around your eyes, that is why I love it so much and it is like satin!</li>
            <li> I would love to write a review of this product  i am still waiting for it to arrive  YES!! i know that it has been over a month since I ordered it!!!!!!</li>
            <li> Love it! Have used it for years both as a night eye cream and also daily. Love all the Shiseido products</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really happy with this product,provides amazing moisture, and even helps keep dark circles away, I will buy this again and continue to use.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I contemplated doing a video review so fellow young women could see the affects of this cream on my eyes, but decided against it for personal reasons :-)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really wanted to love this product-- I just came close to finishing up the 2nd tube of it I&#x27;ve purchased. I&#x27;m 28 and do not yet have any wrinkles (Yet-- I&#x27;m trying for prevention here); but I&#x27;ve used this cream every night for the past almost 4 months now and I&#x27;ve seen bad results. Of course there are no wrinkles.... I didn&#x27;t have any to begin with-- but-- now I have this weird red mark on both eyes almost like red eyeliner jutting out from the outer corner of my eyes creating an almost \\&quot;catlike\\&quot; eyeliner effect from the irritation. Why did I use it for so long? Hmm.. I don&#x27;t know-- the woman at the counter told me that true results and a balanced skin would result after 6-12 weeks worth of use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Results: Every night before bed I put it on... Woke up with weird crusties around both corners of both eyes, as well as redness and irritation. Also I&#x27;ve been getting acne around my eye-- legit-- small tiny pimples below my eye where most people have dark circles-- now I have healing red spots... at 28. The cream also has a hard time absorbing into the skin, so if you try to apply in the morning before your makeup, you definitely have another force working against you-- good luck.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyhow, I really thought I&#x27;d hit the jackpot when the woman at the counter sold me... not once, but twice, but this-- I must confess-- is nothing special at all.</li>
            <li> O.K so I have the most sensitive eyes, so I did not use any eyecream for that reason and because I have oily skin I had no fine lines whatsoever until last year when I turned 34 and there was a fine line showing when I laugh at the corner of my left eye and some other fine lines under that same eye since I sleep on my left side . It was then when it turned into a mission to find a cream that my sensitive eyes can take and after trial and error buying from oil of olay which had retonoid and was a major disaster and burned around my eyes and also obagi eye cream which formed a horrible white crust and seemed to do nothing. So for my 35th b-day somebody gave a macy&#x27;s gift card and decided to buy this shishiedo cream and do not regret buying this product at all. It goes on so smooth, it&#x27;s not that greasy and heavy at all love it!!no stinging no residue and Best thing a little bit goes along way, although it says you can put it on your eyelid I don&#x27;t i just put under my eyes everynight. The first difference I noticed was that my skin got firmer under the eye it was feeling a little thin before. Fine lines are still there but it didn&#x27;t take that long for them to soften and be less noticible and i do notice a difference when I get lazy and don&#x27;t put it, so I will try to not skip one day. The only issue I found was that the pump stop pumping when it was half ways so I don&#x27;t know if it was just mine or somebody alse has had a problem with that, but no biggie as i just use a pointed q-tip and deep it just enough to put it under my eyes. Btw I bought mine in January and I still have enough I would say for a good couple of weeks, so it lasted me a while. My only dilema will be to find a genuine good seller here or buy it again from macy&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> For the aging skin losing elasticity  . .  . that&#x27;s what you need. With regular use results will be visible quickly; however, coffee and stress, a poor diet and lack of sleep will not work in your favor and not even that product will be able to fix the damage you create by your lifestyle.</li>
            <li> Just a little concern when it came the bottle had the little piece that shows that has not been open , however if you notice this product can be open from the entire head .. so it got me concern on the purity of the product.. however when to check and they said it was fine.. My suggestion is to have the seal on both parts the head and on the cap.. just to make sure of any miss understanding</li>
            <li> Gave this to my mom as a Christmas gift and she loves it. She&#x27;s been a long time Shiseido user and her skin looks better than mine! Best price on Amazon! :)</li>
            <li> Thank you very much for the cream. Very happy with purchase. Fully corresponds to the description. Great value. Moisturizes and nourishes the skin around the eyes.</li>
            <li> It is a very good to the eye contour cream is quite moisturizing, and its packaging is very useful to apply and not waste product. Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> perfect product!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> There was very little product in the container so I returned it- I couldn&#x27;t really give this a fair/honest evaluation.  This is why I will never buy a product with the exception of some I&#x27;ve tried before, where I can&#x27;t unscrew the top and honestly get the product out in a way that I know I am getting all that I paid for.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this since uffffff!!! I can&#x27;t even remember! All I know is that the skin under my eyes is super soft and baby skin looking. I will never change to another brand.</li>
            <li> I was SOO excited to try this product after seeing it advertised on a morning news program.&lt;br /&gt;It arrived in appropriate amount of time. However, after using it once (only 1 small pump) my eyes were highly agitated.&lt;br /&gt;Evidently I am very allergic to the product.  Contacting the seller to ask about how to return the product I was alerted to the&lt;br /&gt;fact that they do not take returns on anything used. REALLY? How are you supposed to find out it is not a product your skin can handle without trying it first.  I purchase skin products online regularly from other suppliers and have NEVER had a problem returning them if not completely satisfied with the product. Thankfully this supplier is giving me a 85% refund (one time only) plus I am paying for the return shipping costs as well....of course. Well, do not worry I will NEVER Purchase from them again...All I can say is BUYER BEWARE!!!</li>
            <li> This is the best eye-cream EVER in the history of time.  It is worth every penny you pay for it and it is worth keeping an extra one on hand.  Buying on Amazon is pure brillance because this is such a good product that my local store often runs out.  You will notice a difference in your under eye circles immediately and in how hydrated and minimized your laugh lines will appear. It absorbs quickly and never interfers with my makeup (even in the summer when other creams tend to melt your eye make up off).  If you are still reading this review and haven&#x27;t bought it yet, you might miss out because other people read quicker and are clicking on the purchase button now....... just sayin&#x27;</li>
            <li> I like the way my concealer looks when applied over the Super Eye Contour Cream cream. Good base for concealer.</li>
            <li> Great for all skin typed</li>
            <li> I use a night emulsion product from Shiseido which I believe protects my eye area as well as this eye cream.  I am annoyed a little by the way the dispenser works since it can get messy and gum up the opening.  I sometime dispense more than I plan to and this is wasteful.  Wondering maybe I don&#x27;t really need this since I use a night emulsion which keeps my eyes just as hydrated overnight.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really happy with this product. I used from a year and I see defference from he first month. It works for me as well</li>
            <li> Drying, peeling skin cannot recommend. Shipped fast but product does not deliver in any way. This method  of feedback requires that I go on and on about the product. Enough said.</li>
            <li> I have been using this eye cream for a while. I like it so much. I feel the eye cream is rich enough for winter time.</li>
            <li> Same quality as other eye creams. It is nothing more. you can buy this or other, makes no difference. Thanks</li>
            <li> I started using this eye cream about 6 months ago and it has made such a huge difference. The lines around my eyes are less visible, and it feels great, not grease at all. Since then I also bought the bio performance cream and use them both. It&#x27;s a great product, my mom and sisters swear by it.</li>
            <li> no different from drug store products, but costs alot more....probably paying for the name...no fountain of youth, slight improvement in fine wrinkles//lines after applying</li>
