            <li>It heats very quickly and maintains  its heat.</li>
            <li>Easy to use.</li>

            <li>and I can&#x27;t live without it its the best curling iron ever,but sooooo hard to find..</li>
            <li>; iron is perfect for very short hair or tight edges.</li>

            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this particular curling iron.</li>
            <li>Shorts out to quickly...owned many never last long..</li>
            <li>It was so old</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t seem to find an old fashion marcel anywhere.</li>
            <li>Like the fact that they have low, medium and high settings</li>
            <li>Works great, I have nothing bad to say.</li>
            <li>I ordered 2 because of the long stem handle and because this particular style may not be around in the future.</li>

            <li> but I sure found out how dangerous it was without one.  </li>

            <li> WELL, IT WAS  WHAT I EXPECTED,</li>
            <li> Always as expected</li>
            <li> Not worth the money spent for the purchase.</li>
            <li> some how shorts out over a few months</li>
            <li> If you have small hands, you have to use both hands.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve only been using it for a month :(</li>
            <li> and I burned three of my fingers badly.  </li>
            <li> very disappointed wouldn&#x27;t recommend.</li>
            <li> but this was the worst I have ever bought.</li>

            <li> Do not like it.  Plan on giving it away.  Do not like the return policy.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I was looking. Fast delivery . Very satisfied</li>
            <li> Fair price, great product, recommended!</li>
            <li> It had no end cap and I burned three of my fingers badly.  I returned it.  Don&#x27;t know if is suppose to have a safety cap on the end or not, but I sure found out how dangerous it was without one.  I have two other Hot Tools curling irons and love them.  This one is totally different from my others.</li>
            <li> I love it. works great for left handed people this is the second one I have had. They last along time</li>
            <li> As a professional hairdresser, I can tell you this is a fine product. It heats very quickly and maintains  its heat.</li>
            <li> Easy to use. Pleased with the purchase.</li>
            <li> Works great, I have nothing bad to say.</li>
            <li> This is a curling iron I&#x27;ve used for years and I bought these so that I have backups in case/when the one I&#x27;m using stops working.  This grip is hard to find in local stores and is the only one I use.</li>
            <li> I am a hairdresser for over 16 years and I can&#x27;t live without it its the best curling iron ever,but sooooo hard to find..</li>
            <li> I really think this curling iron is fun to use. You have to have large hands, though. If you have small hands, you have to use both hands. It makes it harder to use. I think it&#x27;s great. I want to get another one with a larger barrel. I like it that you can adjust the temperature, and it has an on/off switch.</li>
            <li> My last one lasted for 10 years. I was worried I wouldn&#x27;t be able to fine another one but there it was on Amazon!</li>
            <li> The product itself was great, but got it as a gift for my mother. She has arthritis and couldn&#x27;t use it. The company wouldn&#x27;t take the product back. Even though it was just tested out. I did sell it to my hair dresser. So I still got something.</li>
            <li> These irons are nice while they work. They burn out extremely fast as the cords twist up until the wires in the inside break. Not worth the money spent for the purchase. I&#x27;ve bought more than one. The results have been the same.</li>
            <li> Fabulous, works great, that&#x27;s why I keep buying it.</li>
            <li> This is a great marcel iron.  I think I have every size they make from 1/2 inch and up. 6 in all. Like the fact that they have low, medium and high settings so are very versatile. They come in a spring clip too for those that can&#x27;t handle the marcel. Just had to replace the 3/4 inch so bought the exaxt same one. It was so old I can&#x27;t remember when I bought it, aslo the 3/4 inch size is the one most used in the salon so I feel I got my moneys worth!</li>
            <li> Great marcel iron !!!!</li>
            <li> Great Curling Iron.  I ordered 2 because of the long stem handle and because this particular style may not be around in the future. You have a range of temperature settings which is fantastic.  I highly recommend this particular curling iron.</li>
            <li> I have hot tools everything but this was the worst I have ever bought. The purple paint comes off in the hair and I&#x27;ve only been using it for a month :( very disappointed wouldn&#x27;t recommend.</li>
            <li> Hot tools is a top of the line product. Controllable even heat.&lt;br /&gt;This is not a spring clip iron. It takes practice to use a marcel iron.&lt;br /&gt;This 1/2&amp;#34; iron is perfect for very short hair or tight edges.</li>
            <li> great product. cord doesn&#x27;t tangle and the temp. settings are a great feature. this is the brand used in the beauty shop where i go. would recommend it to anyone desiring a versitle curling iron.</li>
            <li> Best price love the iron</li>
            <li> OMG I LOVE ITTTT,ITS HEAT WELL, IT WAS  WHAT I EXPECTED, IS EASY TO USE I REALLY LOVE IT ///</li>
            <li> VERY GOOD!!  GOOD SERVICE AND THE RIGHT PRODUCT.  WOULD DO BUSINESS WITH THEM AGAIN.</li>
            <li> I love my curling iron it came quick and I have used it almost every day since it got here.</li>
            <li> Shorts out to quickly...owned many never last long..I have found that the cord connected the the iron some how shorts out over a few months</li>
            <li> A gift for my wife, she loves it.  Thanks</li>
            <li> Great product... I love the brand. Always as expected</li>
            <li> My only complaint is the handle is far from the barrel.  Not so good for &amp;#34;older&amp;#34; short hands .  Can&#x27;t seem to find an old fashion marcel anywhere.</li>
