            <li> I used this product for years. It worked really well, I don&#x27;t think it is as good as it used to be. I&#x27;m wondering it they changed the formula.</li>
            <li> This is one of the better hair sprays now available.  We, my hair dresser and I, have been looking for sometime for this product.  We were able to find it at Amazon and are delighted.</li>
            <li> I love this, it holds well!</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re looking for a spray that will help hold your style in heat, humidity or even a hurricane - this is it. I have curly hair - the bigger the better - and haven&#x27;t found anything that comes close to working as amazing as this does. It has worked in the heat of Arizona and the humidity of New Jersey. I style in the morning and it holds all day and all night. I have been using it for more than 20 years and haven&#x27;t found anything that even comes close to working like this stuff does and it smells great too!</li>
            <li> This item was a perfect buy and works great and the seler shipped it ASAP. I highly recommend this item to anyone who needs a good smelling and strong hold hair spray!</li>
            <li> Love this product, great service and speedy service</li>
            <li> Love&lt;br /&gt;focus--  kind of panic when I start to run out!!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s every bit as good as Joico&#x27;s Ice Mist but it&#x27;s way more affordable. And the formula is always the same.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;vebeen using this product for 20 years. Its the best at holding your style and adds awesome shine. I always get compliments on how it makes my hair look and how it makes my hair smell</li>
            <li> My hair is fine, thin and straight this product holds my hair all day!   I&#x27;ve been using Focus 21 Finishing Splash for over 20 years  Never a complaint</li>
            <li> Excellent price &amp; great service</li>
            <li> love it fer sur like it is the most totally awesome hairspray ever!!! Keeps my 80&#x27;s hair perfectly spiky all day!</li>
            <li> I have been buying this product for years, you don&#x27;t have to use alot and it holds all day. I will continue to buy this product forever.</li>
            <li> I have used this hairspray for years.  Tried alot of different ones....but, keep going back to Splash hairspray.&lt;br /&gt;This will hold your hair in place.  A little goes a long way.&lt;br /&gt;It smells good, too.  (at least, to me).</li>
            <li> I love the product and the service was fast... Thank You !</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the best! I have used it for 30 years but can no longer find it in a beauty supply or salon. Thank goodness I can purchase online.</li>
            <li> I have never found a better finishing spray better than this.  I do not know why it is not carried in Walgreens or CVS&#x27;s.  At one time I used to get it at Rite Aide but they are no longer in my area.</li>
            <li> The best hold for my hair, cant find it in stores but love buying it in the larger sizes.</li>
            <li> Ordered this for my sister because she uses it all the time</li>
            <li> received your product very quickly very pleased with the promptness, love this product!</li>
            <li> Focus 21 Splash is the Best Hair spray.  I&#x27;ve been using it for over 20 years.  Every time I try another brand I can&#x27;t return to Splash fast enough!  It&#x27;s light but Holds a hair style like no other.</li>
            <li> Sorry that it is not being made any more, have used for years and it never fails me.</li>
            <li> Thank you - great product, quick and safe delivery</li>
            <li> good hair spray, used it for about 25 years. If you want your hair to stay in place use it.</li>
            <li> Hands down my favorite hairspray for years and years.  When I try something else it is never as good. I always go back! Ulta carries it too here in San Diego and you can use their discount coupon for a good price.</li>
            <li> I have used this hairspray for years and NOTHING compares to it. Fingers crossed it doesn&#x27;t go by way of the dinosaur! Firm hold yet water soluble...love it. Seller had it to me ASAP so no complaints about this transaction or product.</li>
            <li> I used this years ago and had an old bottle so I used it in a pinch.  I loved it!  Forgot how well it holds and was pleasantly surprised by the shine.</li>
            <li> Have always loved Splash spray!  It&#x27;s my &amp;#34;go to&amp;#34; for extreme hold styles!  I will always order as long as I can find it!  The smell takes me back to high school!</li>
            <li> NOTE THIS IS MY REVIEW OF THE ORIGINAL PRODUCT!! This product is very hard to find. CVS used to carry it in CA but we moved and I can&#x27;t find it here. Glad Amazon has it. This spray will not let you down. It holds your style in all weather conditions, and even under hats. I have hard to hold hair, and Focus21 holds it just like I want it, and the style lasts all day. I don&#x27;t like to fuss with my hair after I fix it in the morning. Plus, you will look as good at the end of the day. I hope they never stop making this excellent product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update October 2015: They carry this at Fred Meyer and at Ulta, so I was so happy to find it in our area. I still like to get the big size so will stick to good old Amazon for that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;NOTE THIS IS MY CURRENT OPINION OF THIS PRODUCT:&lt;br /&gt;Update November 2016:  Product was discontinued by the manufacturer, so recently I ordered several of these large &amp;#34;refill&amp;#34; bottles only to discover that the once-wonderful formula has been changed. Not sure how this happened, but found that the changed formula is really inferior.  It makes my hair oily, doesn&#x27;t hold at all, and smells bad. BOO. Extremely disappointed, and wasted my money.</li>
            <li> Have used Focus 21 for several years.  I have fine hair and it really helps to hold set.  I also like idea of pump/mist spray rather&lt;br /&gt;than using aerosol cans.</li>
            <li> My favorite hairspray ever have used it for over 20 years. i give it 2 because from this purchase not the same it is diluted. very watery</li>
