            <li>I&#x27;m buying more drops because I want to see if they improve my vision.</li>
            <li>It took the full 7-8 months before the cataracts started to dissolve.</li>
            <li>/&gt;P.S. Dog is a golden mix with chow/shepard?</li>
            <li>Not as good as I had expected after using for 6 months.</li>
            <li>pretty good.&lt;br</li>
            <li>great, as far as the other problems...let&#x27;s wait &amp; SEE!!!</li>
            <li>It did how ever eliminate a large floater that was in my eye after a couple of months use.</li>
            <li>My wife was starting to develop cataracts and had this confirmed by the optician.</li>
            <li>If it works it will be so much easier on her than cataract surgery</li>
            <li>and so much easier on my pocket book @ $2000 per eye for canine cataract removal.</li>
            <li>haven&#x27;t seen much change yet&#x3D;may need to use it all before that will happen</li>
            <li>It is a real blessing if you have ever had this problem.  </li>
            <li>My veterinarian was very interested.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>When I use them daily, my eyesight is clearer, not as dim, and I can sure tell the difference if I skip.</li>
            <li>And the relief they give last a full 12 hours.</li>
            <li>Nothing special for such a high price.</li>
            <li>I have been using in my 12 year old Airedale Terrier for the past 3 years and her eyes are bright and clear.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.  </li>
            <li>My advice is to spend a little more and buy Can C.  </li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t get much help from vision clearly drop.after 4 months used.</li>
            <li>I know this, because they do not sting when I use them the first thing in the morning, only in the evening when my eyes have been exposed all day.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll be interested to see if my eye doc notices any reduction in either at my next eye exam.</li>
            <li>i bought these because they appear to be same mix as the much higher priced brand from europe.</li>
            <li>for how the cataracts dissolved I read about on other sites- was true.</li>
            <li>I am optimistic and hopeful that these eye drops will clear up my cataract and keep my eyes clear.  </li>
            <li>She developed cataracts, fast, that covered her ENTIRE eyes.</li>
            <li>After I have completed using the six viles I will have my vision checked professionally.</li>
            <li>She is 8 years old and doing well.</li>
            <li>The jury is still out as far as the effectiveness of this product against cataract.</li>
            <li>It works very well for I have had no cataracts in years - and I broke one up years ago using another product with the same ingredients.</li>
            <li>She regained peripheral vision first and now only has a  tiny cloudiness in the center of her pupil.</li>
            <li>I held her chin up, gave her the drops, put my hand on her eyes and stroked her head for at least one full minute</li>
            <li>It took a few months of consistent use, but I have a noticeable improvement in my vision.</li>

            <li> A local vet gave this to someone I met, she said it took a few months and slowly but surely the cataracts slowly dissolved.</li>
            <li> I have been using them for over six months and am due for an eye exam next month.  </li>
            <li> I have a multitude of eye problems including:high myopia,astigmatism,vitreous separation,moderate cataracts,severe dry eye&amp; macular degeneration.</li>
            <li> The drops helped the dry eye problem a lot after using them,as directed, in 2 months time....</li>
            <li> This has helped me maintain on Cataract growth, as well as keep the dry eye moister than other drops.</li>
            <li> I purchased Vision Clarity because of the 1% NAC solution and other reviewers said it did not sting.</li>
            <li> My family has genetically been prone to cataract and other eye problems for generations.</li>

            <li> It stings a little sometimes, but it is due to our intensely dry air in NM.  </li>

            <li> Not sure its doing anything.</li>
            <li> But it is slow drops 4x&#x27;s a day.</li>
            <li> It is also less expensive.  </li>
            <li> Helped my dry eyes and seemed to improve my night vision and a bad cataract condition  would recommend to anyone</li>
            <li> Poor girl was depressed and running into things.</li>
            <li> The heartbreak of seeing your pet go blind is so avoidable with these drops.</li>
            <li> did TONS of research looking for a solution that did not involve a very expensive surgery and found that NAC was proven in studies to dissolve cataracts.</li>

            <li> I have been using this product for years now as a preventative. Read up on Carnosine and make your decision them whether this product well help.</li>
            <li> Not sure its doing anything. I think its overpriced eye lubrication drops that you can buy over the counter. Nothing special for such a high price. Check out the ingredients. Even says it on the box. No cataract miracle as advertised.</li>
            <li> I was with the hope that effective.</li>
            <li> My wife was starting to develop cataracts and had this confirmed by the optician. Read the news article about this and decided to give it a try. Didn&#x27;t seem to be doing any good so she stopped aplying it after 3 months. However next time we visited the optician he said there were no signs of forming cataracts. Simple conclusion. It works!</li>
            <li> I have a multitude of eye problems including:high myopia,astigmatism,vitreous separation,moderate cataracts,severe dry eye&amp; macular degeneration. The drops helped the dry eye problem a lot after using them,as directed, in 2 months time....great, as far as the other problems...let&#x27;s wait &amp; SEE!!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using these eyedrops for a couple of months now and no longer need my glasses to watch TV. My night vision is also improved.</li>
            <li> I tried it in my diabetic dogs eyes, didn&#x27;t help her at all. a lot of work for no results</li>
            <li> This seems to be helping my dogs cataracts, they are more opaque now. But it is slow drops 4x&#x27;s a day. If it works it will be so much easier on her than cataract surgery and so much easier on my pocket book @ $2000 per eye for canine cataract removal. A local vet gave this to someone I met, she said it took a few months and slowly but surely the cataracts slowly dissolved.</li>
            <li> I ordered these to try to improved my vision without expected future cataract surgery. I have been using them twice a day since they arrived six weeks ago. After I have completed using the six viles I will have my vision checked professionally. Only then will I have a scientific response to the effectiveness of this product. Will have to wait and see what my vision test reveal.</li>
            <li> I have been using these eyedrops for a couple years now and they have helped trememdously!!!!</li>
            <li> haven&#x27;t seen much change yet&#x3D;may need to use it all before that will happen&lt;br /&gt;will have to wait and see</li>
            <li> For years I tried all kinds of allergy relief products, prescription, over the counter, homeopathic, etc.  Three years ago I took a chance and ordered these drops and have used them morning and night all this time.  I never have itchy eyes any more.  It is a real blessing if you have ever had this problem.  It stings a little sometimes, but it is due to our intensely dry air in NM.  I know this, because they do not sting when I use them the first thing in the morning, only in the evening when my eyes have been exposed all day.  And the relief they give last a full 12 hours.</li>
            <li> The maker of this product claims it is more uniformly sterile than Can C drops. It is also less expensive.  For those two reasons I purchased 3 boxes on offer.  However, I neglected to read the warning that the product must be used four times a day, unlike Can C, which only requires a drop in each eye at night. After two weeks of using Vision Clarity once a day, the cataract in one eye seems to be growing again. My vision has regained the fuzziness that Can C kept under control for almost two years. Vision Clarity drops also sting, which is annoying in a product that doesn&#x27;t seem to be nearly as strong as Can C that does not sting. In summary, I believe this product is inadequate for those who already have a cataract.  My advice is to spend a little more and buy Can C.  [[ASIN:B002CCY1MC Can-c Eye-drops]]</li>
            <li> I can honestly testify that this product works. I started purchasing this product over two years ago when my dog was diagnosed with diabetes. She developed cataracts, fast, that covered her ENTIRE eyes. Poor girl was depressed and running into things. I would take her for walks and people would comment on her &amp;#34;pretty eyes&amp;#34;. No kidding.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did TONS of research looking for a solution that did not involve a very expensive surgery and found that NAC was proven in studies to dissolve cataracts. I purchased Vision Clarity because of the 1% NAC solution and other reviewers said it did not sting. I tried the drops out  prior to giving them to my dog, and they did not bother me. No way was she going to let me put drops in her eyes for the next year if they stung her!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Our routine: two drops in each eye at shot time (insulin). I held her chin up, gave her the drops, put my hand on her eyes and stroked her head for at least one full minute so the NAC would dissolve into her eyes and the drops would not run off. It took 7-8 months and the cataracts started to noticeably dissolve. The &amp;#34;melting snow effect&amp;#34; -description for how the cataracts dissolved I read about on other sites- was true. She regained peripheral vision first and now only has a  tiny cloudiness in the center of her pupil. It probably would be all gone if I hadn&#x27;t slacked off on the drops once she wasn&#x27;t bumping into things and her eyes looked pretty good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Look people, this is not a quick fix. It took the full 7-8 months before the cataracts started to dissolve. My regret is I did not take before and after pics. I tell everyone about these drops.  My veterinarian was very interested.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;P.S. Dog is a golden mix with chow/shepard? She is 8 years old and doing well. I&#x27;m buying more drops because I want to see if they improve my vision.</li>
            <li> I believe the Carnosine eyedrops are a benefit to eyes that are forming cataracts. When I use them daily, my eyesight is clearer, not as dim, and I can sure tell the difference if I skip. I like them and do not want to be without them.</li>
            <li> It took a few months of consistent use, but I have a noticeable improvement in my vision. My cataracts and floaters interfere with my vision much less. I&#x27;ll be interested to see if my eye doc notices any reduction in either at my next eye exam.</li>
            <li> Working as per my doctor said it would.</li>
            <li> Not as good as I had expected after using for 6 months. It did how ever eliminate a large floater that was in my eye after a couple of months use.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t get much help from vision clearly drop.after 4 months used. I still use it.</li>
            <li> The jury is still out as far as the effectiveness of this product against cataract. Guess I&#x27;ll find out on my next eye exam.</li>
            <li> My family has genetically been prone to cataract and other eye problems for generations. I use Vision Clarity daily to prevent any cataract from getting a start in my eyes. It works very well for I have had no cataracts in years - and I broke one up years ago using another product with the same ingredients. The only reason I didn&#x27;t use Vision Clarity then was it hadn&#x27;t been made yet...</li>
            <li> Thank you for sending the order in a timely manner.&lt;br /&gt;Not sure how good the product is yet as it takes time&lt;br /&gt;to see any results. We are hoping for the best though.</li>
            <li> It helps the glaucoma in my eyes,, and cataracts.</li>
            <li> i bought these because they appear to be same mix as the much higher priced brand from europe. they seem to be working.</li>
            <li> I have been using these drops in my pets since 2007.  My 17 year old Schipperkee was totally blind due to the thick cataracts on his eye and he regained shape recognition and quit running into things and falling off the side of the deck.  I have been using in my 12 year old Airedale Terrier for the past 3 years and her eyes are bright and clear.  I highly recommend this product.  The heartbreak of seeing your pet go blind is so avoidable with these drops.</li>
            <li> I have read some articles about  L-carnosine&#x27;s affect on cataracts. Since L-carnosine is one of the ingredient in Vision Clarity Drops and unlike some other brands, these drops are sterile, I decided to give them a try.  They arrived promptly.  Time will tell if they work on the cataracts developing in my eyes.</li>
