    <ol>
            <li> The knife is just what I wanted for my Uncle who has limited use of his left hand after suffering a stroke.  Delivery was exceptionally fast.</li>
            <li> The wood handle is unfinished and feels cheap.... Like you might get a splinter after a while. I wish I had gotten the plastic handle model.</li>
            <li> Works good. Fits a small hand very well.</li>
            <li> Received the item on time.  I bought it for my friend who had a stroke and is limited to one hand.  The item wasn&#x27;t sharp and had difficulty trying to use it to cut an apple.  Her husband has sharped it but still has some flaws.</li>
            <li> See carrying case review. Great tool for folks with arthritis</li>
            <li> The edge was squared and it had to be sharpened.  I figured it may be for safety with some people but,  I was a bit disappointed. Otherwise decent quality.</li>
            <li> Found it very usefil and utility knife. Not a table knife</li>
            <li> Very disappointed. Doesn&#x27;t cut very well, if at all. My son needs help cutting his food. I was hoping this would give him more independence, but it just added to the frustration.</li>
            <li> Works great for anyone who has a weakness in their wrist, shaking, or tremor, if they want the independence of cutting their own food. Simply rock it back and forth, and it cuts through. You will still have some difficulty, but it WORKS! I Would give it 5 stars except the wood handle is a little cheap, not going to fall apart cheap, just a little unfinished. A good buy.</li>
            <li> Hard to use when you only have one hand</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s what I was looking for. But there is SHARP EDGE.</li>
            <li> I ordered one of these a few years ago because I had a stroke and loved it! My husband had to sharpen it for me though. It disappeared so I&#x27;m ordering another one</li>
            <li> The knife was good but did not like the wooden Handel feels like you can get a splinter with it</li>
            <li> I cut a chicken breast for stirfry  easily.</li>
            <li> I had a severe hand injury(burns) and this product helps cut my food up nicely and easily.</li>
            <li> This type of knife is not appropriate for stroke victims and so on. Your fingers rub on metal plate and its not Sharp enough to cut anything! However shipping was fast.</li>
            <li> Works great  I use it often, should have ordered it sooner I recommend it highly.  You can not go wrong with item.</li>
            <li> these knifes are the best so glad i found 1 my husband lost his arm &amp; it the only knife he can use to cut meat as too the review from the gal who got 1 for her friend who had a stroke im sorry but these knifes are only ment to cut meat so it wont work on other food like a apple there are products out there for that if your diaabled and looking for something too cut your steal or other meat rocker knife is what you want a must have</li>
            <li> does not cut as well as i expected</li>
            <li> I bought this to use with my patients that have had a stroke and have to cook and eat one handed.  It is wonderful and most of them usually end up buying one themselves.</li>
            <li> This knife is freaking awesome! For the first time I was able to make my own banana and peanut butter sandwich. Cutting was so easy that I am sad I waited this long to get a knife like this. I was never really someone who likes being in the kitchen but since my injury I&#x27;ve been motivated to start getting in the kitchen. I never really cooked even though I&#x27;m trying to learn but I&#x27;d always been a pretty good sandwich maker. I used to make my husband sandwich every day for school and I always cut it diagonally because I know that&#x27;s how I like it. :). I&#x27;ve also used it to cut up some meat for jambalaya. I have no dexterity whatsoever but I do have a fairly strong rest. Even without that therapy this thing was so easy to use. I&#x27;d recommend it to anyone who has limited hand function.</li>
            <li> did not have enough space for hands to control</li>
