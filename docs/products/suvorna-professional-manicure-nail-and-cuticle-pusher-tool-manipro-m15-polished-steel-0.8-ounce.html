            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>I get my own cuticle cream and then use this and get amazing results.  </li>
            <li>Pamper yourself and be kind.  </li>
            <li>but I actually liked it.</li>
            <li>Not my favorite pusher of the three I own.</li>
            <li>Perfect sizes, super fast shipping.</li>
            <li>Love this thing.  </li>
            <li>but the ladies was sure pleased that it was included in the basket.</li>
            <li>Be sure to look at the ends in the pic...</li>
            <li>was more curved</li>
            <li>What&#x27;s not to love?</li>
            <li>Easy to use and has saved me $$$ by be able to skip a manicure by doing it myself.</li>
            <li>They are easy to use and sterilize at home.</li>
            <li>The scoop end easily cleans under the nail tips, removes stray polish, etc.</li>
            <li>Arrived quickly!</li>
            <li>I do notice that you have to use a light hand or you can scrape your nail bed.  </li>
            <li>I use this for home manicure and pedicure, to help clean up cuticles and smooth imperfections on the tops of my nails.  </li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re looking for something more gentle, this is for you.</li>
            <li>This is just what I needed for doing my own gel nails instead of paying big prices every month to have my nails done.</li>
            <li>I would definitely recommend for anyone who does their own mani / pedis at home.</li>
            <li>They got this right.</li>
            <li>I just wash it with soap and warm water after and spritz it down with alcohol to sterilize all my tools</li>
            <li>Too large for me.  </li>
            <li>Amazing what one little tool can do.  </li>
            <li>Really works and removes the cuticles like professionals.</li>
            <li>Was very pleased that the tool wasn&#x27;t flimsy as I have purchased in the past.  </li>
            <li>I purchased it for a cuticle pusher... and it wants me to use it to pop pimples...</li>
            <li>The flat-edge really scraped up my nails after a while, so I bought this one instead.</li>
            <li>As for me, I can&#x27;t seem to separate some of the more stubborn cuticle skin from the nail bed with this because it is just not sharp enough.</li>
            <li>My first professional cuticle pusher.</li>
            <li>I kept it but ordered a different one from a different company that I like better.</li>
            <li>This works better than a wooden cuticle pusher in that you don&#x27;t have to refile or reshape the end of it in order for it to push cuticles back.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s okay, but I found the curette to be a little too big.</li>
            <li>Wow...</li>
            <li>looks sturdy and nearly indestructable.  </li>
            <li>Works ok, not exceptional.</li>
            <li>Not sharp enough for scraping.</li>
            <li>The other end of the pusher is a nail cleaner which also helps push back and clean dead skin particles.  </li>

            <li> Will last a long time.  </li>
            <li> This tool is very sharp and professional grade</li>
            <li> There are other implements I plan to purchase in the future</li>
            <li> Comes in a little slip case which I like and it feel like a quality piece that will last a long time.</li>
            <li> Only one word of warning, it&#x27;s VERY Sharp which is not a bad thing, but don&#x27;t slip while pushing back or cutting your cuticles.</li>
            <li> So be careful, but I would recommend this item.</li>
            <li> The cuticle side is not as sharp as my other two.</li>
            <li> My other two pushers don&#x27;t have the nail cleaner end.</li>
            <li> Not too sharp.  </li>
            <li> I have cuticles that are hard to push back and keep neat.  </li>
            <li> the little cup on the other end is a mystery to me.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very sharp.  </li>
            <li> It comes with a little slave to store it in.</li>
            <li> However, it comes with an insert about &amp;#34;how to use to pop pimples&amp;#34; which is kind of disgusting.  </li>
            <li> The angle on the scooper side makes it awkward to use and the other end is so sharp edged that I ended up damaging my nails.  </li>
            <li> I like the fact the basin is nail shaped and not only gets the cuticle at the base of the nail but cleans the sides of the nails as well.  </li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t go wrong.  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Great product. It&#x27;s well-balanced and seems to be made out of good materials that are good. Does the job what I bought it for pushing cuticles cleaning under the nails and actually trimming the cuticle. It comes with a little slave to store it in.</li>
            <li> I use this tool for cuticles and cleaning under the nail. I also use it to scrape off the remaining polish after removing gel soak off. Love it!</li>
            <li> Very nice quality. Wife loves it. End.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s okay, but I found the curette to be a little too big. I kept it but ordered a different one from a different company that I like better. Just personal taste, probably. It is well made though.</li>
            <li> Great quality. Even my manicurist was impressed. There are other implements I plan to purchase in the future and I will begin my search with this company.</li>
            <li> This works better than a wooden cuticle pusher in that you don&#x27;t have to refile or reshape the end of it in order for it to push cuticles back.  I do notice that you have to use a light hand or you can scrape your nail bed.  I like the fact the basin is nail shaped and not only gets the cuticle at the base of the nail but cleans the sides of the nails as well.  The other end of the pusher is a nail cleaner which also helps push back and clean dead skin particles.  I like my tool-hope you do too.</li>
            <li> Not my favorite pusher of the three I own. The cuticle side is not as sharp as my other two. If you&#x27;re looking for something more gentle, this is for you. As for me, I can&#x27;t seem to separate some of the more stubborn cuticle skin from the nail bed with this because it is just not sharp enough. This is even with the use of a cuticle softener.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do like the nail cleaner end. My other two pushers don&#x27;t have the nail cleaner end. When I reach for this item it is only because I want to use the nail cleaner and not the cuticle pusher.</li>
            <li> Does what it is supposed to. Comes in a little slip case which I like and it feel like a quality piece that will last a long time.</li>
            <li> Too large for me.  Still trying to replace the one that somehow disappeared.  I will use this for working with clay.</li>
            <li> Amazing product!! Its cheeper to do it at home than go to a salon.</li>
            <li> I have cuticles that are hard to push back and keep neat.  The Suvorna cuticle pusher has solved all my problems.  My nails and cuticles are looking beautiful since I have started using this tool.</li>
            <li> The angle on the scooper side makes it awkward to use and the other end is so sharp edged that I ended up damaging my nails.  I would skip this.</li>
            <li> Really works and removes the cuticles like professionals.</li>
            <li> This is just what I needed for doing my own gel nails instead of paying big prices every month to have my nails done.</li>
            <li> Works ok, not exceptional.</li>
            <li> Very pleased with merchandise and delivery.</li>
            <li> Perfect! Arrived quickly!</li>
            <li> Love this thing.  Amazing what one little tool can do.  Compare the price to just ONE manicure! LOL!  I get my own cuticle cream and then use this and get amazing results.  You can&#x27;t go wrong.  Pamper yourself and be kind.  For this price???? You deserve it!</li>
            <li> Good finish.  Not too sharp.  Does the job.  Radius of curvature fairly well matches radius of nail plate.  Recommended.</li>
            <li> I purchased for a pedicure/manicure gift basket but haven&#x27;t heard any complaints yet...but the ladies was sure pleased that it was included in the basket.</li>
            <li> Very easy to clean and does a great job! Love it!</li>
            <li> Works great and is great quality.  Very nice! Was very pleased that the tool wasn&#x27;t flimsy as I have purchased in the past.  Will look for this brand again.</li>
            <li> Love this....works great and seems to be of great quality...would recommend it to my fellow nail techs. Be sure to look at the ends in the pic...was more curved then what I had seen but I actually liked it.</li>
            <li> This works great. It&#x27;s very sharp.  So be careful, but I would recommend this item. My daughter even let me do her nails, which is a miracle.</li>
            <li> Not sharp enough for scraping.</li>
            <li> Perfect sizes, super fast shipping.</li>
            <li> Good manicure tools for home or to take along to the nail salon. They are easy to use and sterilize at home.</li>
            <li> This works so well to eliminate cuticle from my nails without pain or damage to my fingers. The scoop end easily cleans under the nail tips, removes stray polish, etc. What&#x27;s not to love?</li>
            <li> substantial product. i use the fat cuticle pusher side. the little cup on the other end is a mystery to me. i cannot figure out what the heck you would be digging out with that. ouch!</li>
            <li> Easy to use and has saved me $$$ by be able to skip a manicure by doing it myself.</li>
            <li> I use this for home manicure and pedicure, to help clean up cuticles and smooth imperfections on the tops of my nails.  This tool is very sharp and professional grade and I am very pleased.  I would definitely recommend for anyone who does their own mani / pedis at home.</li>
            <li> My first professional cuticle pusher. Wow... How will I ever go back?</li>
            <li> looks sturdy and nearly indestructable.  Will last a long time.  However, it comes with an insert about &amp;#34;how to use to pop pimples&amp;#34; which is kind of disgusting.  I purchased it for a cuticle pusher... and it wants me to use it to pop pimples... but is a high-quality product once the insert is thrown away &#x3D;P</li>
            <li> I had a Sally Hanson cuticle pusher tool with a flat-edged scraper instead of the cuvet tip. The flat-edge really scraped up my nails after a while, so I bought this one instead. It works just as well and the curved, blunt cuvet edge leaves my nails intact. However, the cuvet tip fills up with tissue and doesn&#x27;t come out just by wiping on napkin. I have to keep a couple toothpicks in my manicure kit to scrape out the cuvet after each finger. It&#x27;s not that big a deal and would not stop me from using this tool. I just wash it with soap and warm water after and spritz it down with alcohol to sterilize all my tools after.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this for people who have the same problem. I was already doing at-home gel manicures. I didn&#x27;t want to further scrape up my nails than necessary.</li>
            <li> They got this right. Only one word of warning, it&#x27;s VERY Sharp which is not a bad thing, but don&#x27;t slip while pushing back or cutting your cuticles.</li>
