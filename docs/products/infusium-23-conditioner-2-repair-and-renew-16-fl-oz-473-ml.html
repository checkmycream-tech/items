            <li>Everything was perfect!</li>
            <li>Infusium the best hair product I&#x27;ve ever used!</li>
            <li>Great on line price.</li>
            <li>A good product, but don&#x27;t buy it without checking the price at grocery stores.  </li>
            <li>The color of my hair is good as well.</li>
            <li>I am very pleased.</li>
            <li>Love this stuff and it smells so good</li>
            <li>product leaves hair soft, silky and in great shape!</li>
            <li>Just love this product.</li>
            <li>I love this conditioner, however I felt fooled by the misleading photograph and price .</li>
            <li>Although I absolutely love this conditioner.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>This conditioner works wonderfully well with my long, curly hair.</li>
            <li>This conditioner is the best I&#x27;ve used, however I wouldn&#x27;t pay $10 for a single bottle-available cheaper elsewhere.</li>
            <li>It goes on very smooth and washes clean.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this conditioner (and shampoo), it&#x27;s my new favorite!</li>
            <li>Makes my hair soft &amp; shiny, even looks good the day after I wash it.</li>
            <li>My hair is smooth and frizz free today with the right amount of body and curl!</li>
            <li>Got rid of the fly away issue I was having on my long gray hair.</li>
            <li>The shampoo is really great, foams up a lot and feels really soft, so I expected a lot from the conditioner, but it doesn&#x27;t provide much moisturizing.</li>
            <li>Just a nickle sized drop worked into my mid-back length naturally curly hair with the same amt of gel brushed thru smooths and tames the frizzies while encouraging beautifully diffuser inspired spiral curls.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t really like it</li>
            <li>It smells like some high end salon brand conditioner.</li>
            <li>I believed that I was receiving two bottles, as was what was pictured above and is noted in many other reviews.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t read the description as clearly as I should have, so be aware that you&#x27;ll recieve only one bottle of conditioner.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend this to anyone looking for a high quality conditioner at a low price.</li>
            <li>Naturally curly hair - #1 product</li>
            <li>I have used this product for years and it leaves my hair soft and silky.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you.</li>
            <li>You can easily comb through a very active 7 year old&#x27;s quite kinky hair if you use this religiously.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried quite a few higher priced salon type conditioners &amp; this works better than those on my long thick hair.</li>

            <li> IT IS UNQUESTIONABLY THE VERY BEST CONDITIONER I HAVE USED. I WAS A MODEL IN NYC&lt;br /&gt;ALL OF MY LIFE AND NOONE EVER USED THIS IN MY HAIR . I ACCIDENTALLY BOUGHT IT ON&lt;br /&gt;AMAZON THINKING I WAS BUYING THE SPRAY CONDITION . THIS IS MARVELOUS!!!</li>
            <li> False advertizing! I thought I was getting 2 because there were 2 in the photo. I even compared prices.</li>
            <li> A good product, but don&#x27;t buy it without checking the price at grocery stores.  It is not an expensive product.</li>
            <li> My hair LOVES this stuff! Been using it for YEARS as an after shower leave-in conditioner and detangler. Just a nickle sized drop worked into my mid-back length naturally curly hair with the same amt of gel brushed thru smooths and tames the frizzies while encouraging beautifully diffuser inspired spiral curls. GET SOME TODAY!!!</li>
            <li> Naturally curly hair - #1 product</li>
            <li> You can easily comb through a very active 7 year old&#x27;s quite kinky hair if you use this religiously. Saves me tons of time and energy!</li>
            <li> The shampoo is really great, foams up a lot and feels really soft, so I expected a lot from the conditioner, but it doesn&#x27;t provide much moisturizing. Just average. Now I use infusium shampoo and redken conditioner.</li>
            <li> Misleading. I believed that I was receiving two bottles, as was what was pictured above and is noted in many other reviews. I didn&#x27;t read the description as clearly as I should have, so be aware that you&#x27;ll recieve only one bottle of conditioner. This conditioner is the best I&#x27;ve used, however I wouldn&#x27;t pay $10 for a single bottle-available cheaper elsewhere.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff and it smells so good</li>
            <li> Just love this product. Use on my hair as well as my kids. Great on line price.</li>
            <li> This conditioner works wonderfully well with my long, curly hair. It smells like some high end salon brand conditioner. It goes on very smooth and washes clean. My hair is smooth and frizz free today with the right amount of body and curl! The color of my hair is good as well. Some conditioners gunk up my hair so bad that my hair looks dull afterwards from buildup. Not true with this stuff! I just wish it was easier to find. I can only find it at the grocery store, neither Target nor Walmart sells it. Please don&#x27;t stop making it Infusium!!</li>
            <li> Everything was perfect! I have used this product for years and it leaves my hair soft and silky.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you.</li>
            <li> Ordered repair and renew but received seething else but I tried it I don&#x27;t really like it but I will keep it</li>
            <li> Expensive for one bottle. I am dumb and did not read the full description. I saw the pic and thought I was getting two bottle for that price. Cheaper to buy in store.</li>
            <li> I love this conditioner, however I felt fooled by the misleading photograph and price . I assumed , erroneously , that there were 2 bottles for the order since there were two bottles in the picture plus a (2), which I know now was for the specific Infusium product. However, the price was that for 2 bottles at the store . I felt very misled and paid 11.99 for one small bottle.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this conditioner (and shampoo), it&#x27;s my new favorite! I&#x27;ve tried quite a few higher priced salon type conditioners &amp; this works better than those on my long thick hair. Makes my hair soft &amp; shiny, even looks good the day after I wash it. Highly recommend this to anyone looking for a high quality conditioner at a low price. But definitely check out your local grocery stores before buying online, way cheaper!</li>
            <li> Got rid of the fly away issue I was having on my long gray hair. I use their shampoo, conditioner and the leave in conditioner. I am very pleased.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not giving any stars because it shows 2 bottles and I only received one. Although I absolutely love this conditioner.</li>
            <li> Infusium the best hair product I&#x27;ve ever used! Love it. Use both the shampoo and conditioner. My poor hair; sun, bands.......product leaves hair soft, silky and in great shape!</li>
