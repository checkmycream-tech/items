            <li>Good.</li>
            <li>Love these Poof Sponges1  Much better than a washcloth!  </li>
            <li>Perfect size and soft material.</li>
            <li>Are they the comfiest most amazing loofahs I&#x27;ve ever felt?</li>
            <li>Works great fast shipping!</li>
            <li>but that&#x27;s fine because it acts as a reminder for me to replace it</li>
            <li>Cheaply made - already coming undone after a week of use.</li>
            <li>Good price and the size and quality was better than expected.</li>
            <li>Cheap and useful.</li>
            <li>Nice and Med soft.  </li>
            <li>Get soapy quick.</li>
            <li>This was a great value for the money - although the Poufs are on the small side.  </li>
            <li>This sponge removes the crud and makes my skin look healthy and younger.  </li>
            <li>Exactly what I was looking for and the price was quite reasonable.  </li>
            <li>The size is nice, and it is relatively firm.</li>
            <li>Will be a good travel pouf instead of the tiny ones I&#x27;ve taken on my other trips.</li>
            <li>So far they are holding up well.  </li>
            <li>It frayed a little quickly</li>
            <li>After a few months I just threw out my first one!</li>
            <li>Not very large or soft.</li>

            <li> A little small</li>
            <li> and it often looks dull.  </li>
            <li> Sometimes you buy loofahs and they are hard that it feels like it is sanding your skin.</li>

    <ol>
            <li> A little small but it worked</li>
            <li> Perfect size and soft material. Hasnt fallen apart yet.</li>
            <li> I used them as stocking stuffers, everyone like them.</li>
            <li> The size is nice, and it is relatively firm.</li>
            <li> Does what it&#x27;s intended to do. Cheap and useful. It does fall apart (as in it unravels) several months in, but that&#x27;s fine because it acts as a reminder for me to replace it</li>
            <li> Not as big as I expected, but not as small as some I&#x27;ve gotten.  So far they are holding up well.  Will be a good travel pouf instead of the tiny ones I&#x27;ve taken on my other trips.</li>
            <li> Not very large or soft. So so. Could have purchased the same at the dollar store.</li>
            <li> Great loufahs! After a few months I just threw out my first one! It frayed a little quickly and then it just stayed that way for months. Very happy with the durability for the price.</li>
            <li> Good price and the size and quality was better than expected.</li>
            <li> Tiny not worth it to me.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I was looking for and the price was quite reasonable.  I have dry skin and it often looks dull.  This sponge removes the crud and makes my skin look healthy and younger.  Yea!</li>
            <li> A lot smaller than anticipated.</li>
            <li> So far durable but quite small.</li>
            <li> these pouf&#x27;s are a regular houshold item, this is a must have in my household. good price and on time delivery!</li>
            <li> These are the best I&#x27;ve found.</li>
            <li> This was a great value for the money - although the Poufs are on the small side.  I like the different colors.  Everyone knows which one is theirs!!</li>
            <li> Love these Poof Sponges1  Much better than a washcloth!  Great treatment for skin!</li>
            <li> fell apart in one wash. do not go for these</li>
            <li> Works great fast shipping!</li>
            <li> Good. Get soapy quick.</li>
            <li> Cheaply made - already coming undone after a week of use.</li>
            <li> Nice and Med soft.  Sometimes you buy loofahs and they are hard that it feels like it is sanding your skin.</li>
            <li> Product is as described, and colors match the image. Are they the comfiest most amazing loofahs I&#x27;ve ever felt? No. Do they do the job and do it well? Yes.</li>
