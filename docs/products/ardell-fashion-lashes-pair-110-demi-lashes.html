            <li>Five stars....would give six if it was available.</li>
            <li>I liked this pair of lashed because it looked natural and not over the top.</li>
            <li>As a frequent lash wearer, I loved these lashes.  </li>
            <li>good for professional settings/date nights.</li>
            <li>these are good quality and natural looking.</li>
            <li>mistake-like really!!!</li>
            <li>This size works perfectly for someone with small eyes/short eyelashes that can&#x27;t handle some of the huge glam eyelashes out there.</li>
            <li>Overall, super happy with these.</li>
            <li>Definitely worth the buy!</li>
            <li>I have experimented with $18-a-pair Winks and these 110&#x27;s from Ardell which I originally found at Walgreen&#x27;s and just about everything in between.  </li>
            <li>these were great and are even okay if you want to wear them everyday.</li>
            <li>quality and most certainly will repurchase them.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re just right!</li>
            <li>Good basic lashes.  </li>
            <li>They were good to wear for basic stuff to add volume.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Because I have Asian eyes, fancy eyelashes don&#x27;t look good with</li>
            <li>I loved it, the first time it came with 4 separate packaging (great for stocking stuffers) the second time i ordered it came with a single packaging in four pairs.</li>
            <li>The order came quickly and has been an asset to our needs.</li>
            <li>My older aunt&#x27;s love</li>
            <li>The ones that I purchased at Ulta are more realistic for me. .</li>
            <li>Shipping was quick as well.</li>
            <li>Wore these today for the first time, they looked natural but yet not so natural my eyes didn&#x27;t pop, my fiance loved them on me :)</li>
            <li>Beautiful lashes, durable for a few times.</li>
            <li>I can swear they are my natural eyelashes and be ok with it , the most natural looking eyelashes ever!!!</li>
            <li>Mascara cleans off easily and they dry nicely for reuse.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t actually used the lashes yet because I have a pair that are still in pretty good shape.  </li>
            <li>I will definitely be ordering more!</li>
            <li>They were exactly what I expected and more!!</li>
            <li>Nothing special about them but for the price they do offer a pretty frame for your eyes.</li>
            <li>/&gt;They are light weight and very comfortable.&lt;br /&gt;And</li>
            <li>/&gt;These are great for any use, and yes, even everyday use.</li>
            <li>Great for everyday wear.</li>
            <li>These falsies are great for an everyday look.  </li>
            <li>only thing is that my fianc&amp;eacute; said its not that diff from my own eye lashes.</li>
            <li>These lashes look so much more natural than the ones i had been purchasing.</li>
            <li>Want more lashes but to look natural?</li>
            <li>I love these lashes because they look natural on me during the day and you can&#x27;t tell I&#x27;m wearing any.</li>
            <li>Let me be clear, these are great lashes, but I only received 1 out of 4 pairs!</li>
            <li>great if you&#x27;re going for a natural look, but I think next time I order lashes</li>
            <li>These are probably the most natural look you&#x27;ll get with a falsie because of the volume and length.</li>
            <li>They are the most natural looking falsies I have.</li>
            <li>These brands have lashes that are knotted and look more natural.</li>
            <li>Many people thought these were my natural lashes....</li>
            <li>They look the most natural all while adding lash volume.  </li>
            <li>They are the wispier lashes and find them more natural looking.  </li>
            <li>I love these because they look very natural and the price is very reasonable.  </li>
            <li>This is definitely a popular brand so for someone who loves that dramatic look, these are good eyelashes.</li>
            <li>The material was flexible and the length was just right for me.</li>
            <li>I have to buy them in the store to insure I get the right length.</li>
            <li>Beautiful lashes that last with proper care.</li>
            <li>They are very easy to put on and you can use them multiple times.</li>
            <li>Great for everyday use,!</li>
            <li>Comfortable on eyes not too heavy love these!</li>
            <li>These lashes go on easy, stay on, and look really natural.</li>
            <li>but they look and feel so natural and so easy to put on, if you are like me</li>
            <li>These lashes look natural , easy to put on too.</li>
            <li>Very natural and light to wear.</li>
            <li>The quality is good, the lashes are in tight and don&#x27;t fall out.  </li>
            <li>Very fast delivery:)&lt;br</li>
            <li>so buying more of this same model#.</li>
            <li>Exactly as described, Waaaayy cheaper than in the store.</li>
            <li>I find with the better brands you can get up to 36 uses with mac&#x27;s and up to 25 with Flutter lashes if you take care of them and remove the adhesive as soon as you take them off before putting them back in the case.</li>
            <li>Really opens up youreyes!</li>
            <li>I got exactly what was described and what was shown in the picture.</li>
            <li>but it is worth it now that I can buy in bulk online and not spend too much money.</li>
            <li>This is my first time with falsies.</li>
            <li>so I wear these exact lashes and have for years.</li>
            <li>But ultimately, having never worn any before, I needed to ease in a bit more.  </li>
            <li>Not fake looking at all......</li>
            <li>Same brand same kind!</li>
            <li>so I looked at the reviews here first before buying them at Walgreens.  </li>
            <li>great, these lashes adds a little glam but also very natural looking</li>
            <li>These lashes are my daily &amp;#34;go to&amp;#34; and they are super comfortable.</li>
            <li>and I think they are the perfect mixture of dramatic but realistic eyelashes.</li>
            <li>They actually look very natural, not too thick/thin; they look like my own lashes.</li>
            <li>people said i looked different and better without really knowing why.</li>
            <li>these are good for everyday of you don&#x27;t want your eyes to pop as much...</li>
            <li>I love to put fake eyelashes on because it&#x27;s part of a good make-up.</li>
            <li>They are pretty much disposable.  </li>
            <li>so I needed to cut the lashes as well as make them shorter for it to look natural but full.</li>
            <li>they&#x27;re full, natural looking lashes.</li>
            <li>But the price is good enough that I decided not to return them &amp; take a chance on them lasting a reasonable amount of time.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had other kinds of lashes but these are the most natural looking and comfortable</li>
            <li>These are light and more natural looking than other styles.</li>
            <li>These are amazing for everyday use, they look real!</li>
            <li>Obviously, easy application and removal, since they are all in one, not individual lashes.</li>
            <li>and my eyes always look glamorous whether dolled up or plain faced, which I love!</li>
            <li>one is very natural!!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very</li>
            <li>were NOT the real thing.</li>
            <li>They don&#x27;t even feel real.</li>
            <li>it doesn&#x27;t look like you&#x27;ve done too much.</li>
            <li>Very desirable effect.&lt;br /</li>
            <li>Very good.&lt;br</li>
            <li>stay on, i didn&#x27;t really have to cut to fit my lashes, and even though i have asian eyes they fit relatively well!</li>
            <li>A lot of people thought they were my real lashes.  </li>
            <li>These lashes make me look very awake</li>
            <li>The lashes are great, receiving 1 out 4 pairs is not great.</li>
            <li>and these look so real i put them on and</li>
            <li>Got the impression these were shorter in length than what they really are.</li>
            <li>and I don&#x27;t have to apply too much mascara which sometimes made my lashes to clump.</li>
            <li>No one could tell but it really made a difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Pencil liner didn&#x27;t work and I don&#x27;t want to go through having to carefully apply liquid liner over and on top of the strip to cover the filament.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t really like these.</li>
            <li>They didn&#x27;t stay on very well either.</li>
            <li>You can easily trim these lashes to better fit your eye, or do what I do and cut one pair in half and use as half lashes on both eyes.  </li>
            <li>These are by far my favorite lashes to wear on a daily basis.</li>
            <li>i had false eyelases on, lol</li>
            <li>Easy to trim with scissors if they are too long for the eye.</li>
            <li>The band is a touch too long, but really easy to clip.</li>
            <li>Sometimes I would rather go with just a little light eyeshadow instead of the full liner, and these make that even easier.</li>
            <li>These Ardell Demi Lashes are great for a dramatic look or dress-up affair.  </li>
            <li>Saw the great reviews and mistook these for the ones I usually get at my local drug store...</li>
            <li>With the 4-pack these are very affordable yet high quality.</li>
            <li>Very real looking and not heavy.  </li>
            <li>I also generally prefer accent lashes over full strips, so I was trying a lot of new things.</li>
            <li>These look very natural on and are very light.&lt;br /&gt;Great for smaller eye shapes &amp; suitable for daily wear.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Love these lahses, they are the most natural looking false lash i have ever used, I use them on 90% of my brides when I do makeup.</li>
            <li>THEY LOOK NATURAL, NOT EXAGGERATED.</li>
            <li>Just enough to make mine look full and beautiful, without looking fake.  </li>
            <li>and these look pretty and natural.</li>
            <li>the Demi lashes may be too small for your eyes, but if your eyes are small, the Demi&#x27;s will be perfect.  </li>
            <li>the older we get we lose our eyelashes</li>
            <li>On top of that, the lashes cost too much to use for an everyday look.</li>
            <li>These lashes are pretty and seem very convenient but upon experimenting with them before actual wear, I found that the corners of the lashes don&#x27;t stick very well.  </li>
            <li>and I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>They dont compare to high end lashes but will do in a pinch.</li>
            <li>These are great to cut in half and use as half lashes.  </li>
            <li>These lashes are great, they add volume and length but do not look obviously fake.</li>
            <li>They really are natural.</li>
            <li>The clear strip makes these much easier to wear without a line of eyeliner if you prefer that.</li>
            <li>Looks really natural but they&#x27;re really flimsy</li>
            <li>They look so natural I don&#x27;t have to wear eyeliner with them, but they look so much nicer and fuller than mascara.</li>
            <li>My eye lashes are longer than normal ppl..</li>
            <li>And more importantly, they are short enough to fit behind my glasses.</li>
            <li>The Demi lashes are smaller across than regular lashes, and fit smaller eyes better, if you have big eyes</li>
            <li>I love wearing these lashes everyday.</li>
            <li>They are natural and light and really compliment my own lashes and are not too dramatic for daily wear.  </li>
            <li>Probably down to my lack of experience with falsies, but these do not go on easily.</li>
            <li>them coming in a set of 4, so I don&#x27;t have to buy them new as often.</li>
            <li>but like I said I&#x27;m new to this</li>
            <li>These  arrived promptly and were in the boxes brand new.</li>
            <li>Truly looks very natural.</li>
            <li>very natural looking lashes</li>
            <li>If you are into a very natural look, this are for you.</li>
            <li>They look very natural, so</li>
            <li>Very natural looking.</li>
            <li>and I find these lashes to look very natural to conceal</li>
            <li>VERY natural looking, so</li>
            <li>They have a very natural look...</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t need to trim at all and they ended up looking very natural on my eyes.</li>
            <li>It has a natural-looking, very easy to apply, but a little different from the one which I bought from drug store.</li>
            <li>For times when I&#x27;m way too lazy to put on eye makeup, or for nights out when I want my eyes to be a bit more noticeable, these style lashes are my go-to.</li>
            <li>My girlfriend loves them because they look so natural!</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s more of an everyday lash!</li>
            <li>, I love them and I wear them almost everyday, even if I don&#x27;t wear makeup!</li>
            <li>Only problem is they aren&#x27;t consistent and vary in length from package to package.  </li>
            <li>Wore the first pair several times before they wore out.  </li>
            <li>They are on the full side so be careful if you are just looking for length.</li>
            <li>I like these because they are long enough to fit my eyelids.  </li>
            <li>I usually cut about 1/3 of them off so they don&#x27;t go all the way across my lid and look more natural.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t understand why they wouldn&#x27;t use clear filament.</li>
            <li>They look so natural.</li>
            <li>and i like how natural they look</li>
            <li>get at least &gt;20 wears per pair of eyelashes :)</li>
            <li>Watched several youtube videos and that really helped.&lt;br</li>
            <li>in all these lashes lood fairly natural.  </li>
            <li>but for those who want the natural look here it is.</li>
            <li>Its a simple and very flirty look&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>they look think and natural.</li>
            <li>I did not feel they had a totally natural look.</li>
            <li>They look incredibly natural and gives my look just a bit of an umph with out looking overdone.</li>
            <li>They are soft and natural looking.</li>
            <li>Look natural.</li>
            <li>it looks natural.</li>
            <li>It looks natural.</li>
            <li>This makes putting on the natural lashes a breeze.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a newbie to lashes, but I ike these because they look so natural.</li>
            <li>These lashes look absolutely natural.</li>
            <li>they look like my natural eyelashes.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think they look natural.</li>
            <li>but if your looking for a relatively natural looking &amp;#34;oomph&amp;#34; that will ensure people will notice your eyelashes, give these a try.</li>
            <li>These are by far my fav pair of lashes.  </li>
            <li>My go-to lashes for the natural look.</li>
            <li>They are comfortable to wear and last me at least 3 weeks per pair if they are treated right.</li>
            <li>Easy to apply and last a long time when cared for properly.</li>
            <li>A little too long to be believable.</li>
            <li>They are super natural looking, the band is not too thick, the lashes are very durable.  </li>
            <li>These lashes are lovely and a very natural looking style, but as a first time false lash wearer, they were a little too much for me.  </li>
            <li>Not too long, not too short, but just right.</li>
            <li>I have been wearing these lashes for about a year now, sad to say I only just saw how cheap they are on Amazon and have been paying $6 a set up until now!!!&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, the 110&#x27;s look fantastic</li>
            <li>I have teeny-weeny Asian eyes with super short-n-straight lashes, so this style is just long enough for me without making me look like a tranny.  </li>
            <li>I found that I could only wear them 2-3 times then had to get a new pair.</li>
            <li>It is pretty amazing what a few false lashes can do to enhance the look of your eyes.  </li>
            <li>I am getting ready to run out to CVS, spend a few more $$$ and get my usual for church tomorrow...</li>
            <li>My lashes are normal, not full but not thin either.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re durable, easy to apply, even if you&#x27;re new to wearing false lashes</li>
            <li>These definitely do look natural</li>
            <li>Based on the picture I thought these would be too short, but even though they&#x27;re &#x27;demi&#x27; lashes, they&#x27;re still longer than my natural lashes were.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve worn lashes for the last 10 years because my natural lashes thinned out after I turned 40-something.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m not great at it...has just confirmed my need to see a stylist to put the demi-perm lashes on for me!</li>
            <li>The shape and size are good, but the lashes keeps lifting from my lid no matter how much glue I use... :(</li>
            <li>Ardell will always be my favorite false eyelash brand</li>
            <li>My favorite and go to false lashes.</li>
            <li>I do wish they held a curl better, but that&#x27;s pretty typical of false lashes.  </li>
            <li>You&#x27;re better off buying the other brands that cost less such as Red Cherry 747s or Creme.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t get this if you want something dramatic :)  </li>
            <li>These lashes were not long enough for me.  </li>

            <li> in bulk for way cheap.</li>
            <li> This is a great price too, especially if you have Amazon Prime.</li>
            <li> They seemed like really cheap quality, and when i tried wearing them they irritated my eyes</li>
            <li> These lashes were so comfortable</li>
            <li> These are great for going out, and they&#x27;re not obviously fake-looking.</li>
            <li> The best lashes, don&#x27;t waste your money on others.  </li>
            <li> Five stars....would give six if it was available.</li>
            <li> I liked this pair of lashed because it looked natural and not over the top.</li>
            <li> As a frequent lash wearer, I loved these lashes.  </li>
            <li> good for professional settings/date nights.</li>
            <li> these are good quality and natural looking.</li>
            <li> mistake-like really!!!</li>
            <li> This size works perfectly for someone with small eyes/short eyelashes that can&#x27;t handle some of the huge glam eyelashes out there.</li>
            <li> Overall, super happy with these.</li>
            <li> Definitely worth the buy!</li>
            <li> I have experimented with $18-a-pair Winks and these 110&#x27;s from Ardell which I originally found at Walgreen&#x27;s and just about everything in between.  </li>
            <li> these were great and are even okay if you want to wear them everyday.</li>
            <li> quality and most certainly will repurchase them.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re just right!</li>
            <li> Good basic lashes.  </li>
            <li> They were good to wear for basic stuff to add volume.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Because I have Asian eyes, fancy eyelashes don&#x27;t look good with</li>
            <li> I loved it, the first time it came with 4 separate packaging (great for stocking stuffers) the second time i ordered it came with a single packaging in four pairs.</li>
            <li> The order came quickly and has been an asset to our needs.</li>
            <li> My older aunt&#x27;s love</li>
            <li> The ones that I purchased at Ulta are more realistic for me. .</li>
            <li> Shipping was quick as well.</li>
            <li> Wore these today for the first time, they looked natural but yet not so natural my eyes didn&#x27;t pop, my fiance loved them on me :)</li>
            <li> Beautiful lashes, durable for a few times.</li>
            <li> I can swear they are my natural eyelashes and be ok with it , the most natural looking eyelashes ever!!!</li>
            <li> Mascara cleans off easily and they dry nicely for reuse.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t actually used the lashes yet because I have a pair that are still in pretty good shape.  </li>
            <li> I will definitely be ordering more!</li>
            <li> They were exactly what I expected and more!!</li>
            <li> Nothing special about them but for the price they do offer a pretty frame for your eyes.</li>
            <li> /&gt;They are light weight and very comfortable.&lt;br /&gt;And</li>
            <li> /&gt;These are great for any use, and yes, even everyday use.</li>
            <li> Great for everyday wear.</li>
            <li> These falsies are great for an everyday look.  </li>
            <li> only thing is that my fianc&amp;eacute; said its not that diff from my own eye lashes.</li>
            <li> These lashes look so much more natural than the ones i had been purchasing.</li>
            <li> Want more lashes but to look natural?</li>
            <li> I love these lashes because they look natural on me during the day and you can&#x27;t tell I&#x27;m wearing any.</li>
            <li> Let me be clear, these are great lashes, but I only received 1 out of 4 pairs!</li>
            <li> great if you&#x27;re going for a natural look, but I think next time I order lashes</li>
            <li> These are probably the most natural look you&#x27;ll get with a falsie because of the volume and length.</li>
            <li> They are the most natural looking falsies I have.</li>
            <li> These brands have lashes that are knotted and look more natural.</li>
            <li> Many people thought these were my natural lashes....</li>
            <li> They look the most natural all while adding lash volume.  </li>
            <li> They are the wispier lashes and find them more natural looking.  </li>
            <li> I love these because they look very natural and the price is very reasonable.  </li>
            <li> This is definitely a popular brand so for someone who loves that dramatic look, these are good eyelashes.</li>
            <li> The material was flexible and the length was just right for me.</li>
            <li> I have to buy them in the store to insure I get the right length.</li>
            <li> Beautiful lashes that last with proper care.</li>
            <li> They are very easy to put on and you can use them multiple times.</li>
            <li> Great for everyday use,!</li>
            <li> Comfortable on eyes not too heavy love these!</li>
            <li> These lashes go on easy, stay on, and look really natural.</li>
            <li> but they look and feel so natural and so easy to put on, if you are like me</li>
            <li> These lashes look natural , easy to put on too.</li>
            <li> Very natural and light to wear.</li>
            <li> The quality is good, the lashes are in tight and don&#x27;t fall out.  </li>
            <li> Very fast delivery:)&lt;br</li>
            <li> so buying more of this same model#.</li>
            <li> Exactly as described, Waaaayy cheaper than in the store.</li>
            <li> I find with the better brands you can get up to 36 uses with mac&#x27;s and up to 25 with Flutter lashes if you take care of them and remove the adhesive as soon as you take them off before putting them back in the case.</li>
            <li> Really opens up youreyes!</li>
            <li> I got exactly what was described and what was shown in the picture.</li>
            <li> but it is worth it now that I can buy in bulk online and not spend too much money.</li>
            <li> This is my first time with falsies.</li>
            <li> so I wear these exact lashes and have for years.</li>
            <li> But ultimately, having never worn any before, I needed to ease in a bit more.  </li>
            <li> Not fake looking at all......</li>
            <li> Same brand same kind!</li>
            <li> so I looked at the reviews here first before buying them at Walgreens.  </li>
            <li> great, these lashes adds a little glam but also very natural looking</li>
            <li> These lashes are my daily &amp;#34;go to&amp;#34; and they are super comfortable.</li>
            <li> and I think they are the perfect mixture of dramatic but realistic eyelashes.</li>
            <li> They actually look very natural, not too thick/thin; they look like my own lashes.</li>
            <li> people said i looked different and better without really knowing why.</li>
            <li> these are good for everyday of you don&#x27;t want your eyes to pop as much...</li>
            <li> I love to put fake eyelashes on because it&#x27;s part of a good make-up.</li>
            <li> They are pretty much disposable.  </li>
            <li> so I needed to cut the lashes as well as make them shorter for it to look natural but full.</li>
            <li> they&#x27;re full, natural looking lashes.</li>
            <li> But the price is good enough that I decided not to return them &amp; take a chance on them lasting a reasonable amount of time.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had other kinds of lashes but these are the most natural looking and comfortable</li>
            <li> These are light and more natural looking than other styles.</li>
            <li> These are amazing for everyday use, they look real!</li>
            <li> Obviously, easy application and removal, since they are all in one, not individual lashes.</li>
            <li> and my eyes always look glamorous whether dolled up or plain faced, which I love!</li>
            <li> one is very natural!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very</li>
            <li> were NOT the real thing.</li>
            <li> They don&#x27;t even feel real.</li>
            <li> it doesn&#x27;t look like you&#x27;ve done too much.</li>
            <li> Very desirable effect.&lt;br /</li>
            <li> Very good.&lt;br</li>
            <li> stay on, i didn&#x27;t really have to cut to fit my lashes, and even though i have asian eyes they fit relatively well!</li>
            <li> A lot of people thought they were my real lashes.  </li>
            <li> These lashes make me look very awake</li>
            <li> The lashes are great, receiving 1 out 4 pairs is not great.</li>
            <li> and these look so real i put them on and</li>
            <li> Got the impression these were shorter in length than what they really are.</li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t have to apply too much mascara which sometimes made my lashes to clump.</li>
            <li> No one could tell but it really made a difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Pencil liner didn&#x27;t work and I don&#x27;t want to go through having to carefully apply liquid liner over and on top of the strip to cover the filament.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t really like these.</li>
            <li> They didn&#x27;t stay on very well either.</li>
            <li> You can easily trim these lashes to better fit your eye, or do what I do and cut one pair in half and use as half lashes on both eyes.  </li>
            <li> These are by far my favorite lashes to wear on a daily basis.</li>
            <li> i had false eyelases on, lol</li>
            <li> Easy to trim with scissors if they are too long for the eye.</li>
            <li> The band is a touch too long, but really easy to clip.</li>
            <li> Sometimes I would rather go with just a little light eyeshadow instead of the full liner, and these make that even easier.</li>
            <li> These Ardell Demi Lashes are great for a dramatic look or dress-up affair.  </li>
            <li> Saw the great reviews and mistook these for the ones I usually get at my local drug store...</li>
            <li> With the 4-pack these are very affordable yet high quality.</li>
            <li> Very real looking and not heavy.  </li>
            <li> I also generally prefer accent lashes over full strips, so I was trying a lot of new things.</li>
            <li> These look very natural on and are very light.&lt;br /&gt;Great for smaller eye shapes &amp; suitable for daily wear.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Love these lahses, they are the most natural looking false lash i have ever used, I use them on 90% of my brides when I do makeup.</li>
            <li> THEY LOOK NATURAL, NOT EXAGGERATED.</li>
            <li> Just enough to make mine look full and beautiful, without looking fake.  </li>
            <li> and these look pretty and natural.</li>
            <li> the Demi lashes may be too small for your eyes, but if your eyes are small, the Demi&#x27;s will be perfect.  </li>
            <li> the older we get we lose our eyelashes</li>
            <li> On top of that, the lashes cost too much to use for an everyday look.</li>
            <li> These lashes are pretty and seem very convenient but upon experimenting with them before actual wear, I found that the corners of the lashes don&#x27;t stick very well.  </li>
            <li> and I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> They dont compare to high end lashes but will do in a pinch.</li>
            <li> These are great to cut in half and use as half lashes.  </li>
            <li> These lashes are great, they add volume and length but do not look obviously fake.</li>
            <li> They really are natural.</li>
            <li> The clear strip makes these much easier to wear without a line of eyeliner if you prefer that.</li>
            <li> Looks really natural but they&#x27;re really flimsy</li>
            <li> They look so natural I don&#x27;t have to wear eyeliner with them, but they look so much nicer and fuller than mascara.</li>
            <li> My eye lashes are longer than normal ppl..</li>
            <li> And more importantly, they are short enough to fit behind my glasses.</li>
            <li> The Demi lashes are smaller across than regular lashes, and fit smaller eyes better, if you have big eyes</li>
            <li> I love wearing these lashes everyday.</li>
            <li> They are natural and light and really compliment my own lashes and are not too dramatic for daily wear.  </li>
            <li> Probably down to my lack of experience with falsies, but these do not go on easily.</li>
            <li> them coming in a set of 4, so I don&#x27;t have to buy them new as often.</li>
            <li> but like I said I&#x27;m new to this</li>
            <li> These  arrived promptly and were in the boxes brand new.</li>
            <li> Truly looks very natural.</li>
            <li> very natural looking lashes</li>
            <li> If you are into a very natural look, this are for you.</li>
            <li> They look very natural, so</li>
            <li> Very natural looking.</li>
            <li> and I find these lashes to look very natural to conceal</li>
            <li> VERY natural looking, so</li>
            <li> They have a very natural look...</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t need to trim at all and they ended up looking very natural on my eyes.</li>
            <li> It has a natural-looking, very easy to apply, but a little different from the one which I bought from drug store.</li>
            <li> For times when I&#x27;m way too lazy to put on eye makeup, or for nights out when I want my eyes to be a bit more noticeable, these style lashes are my go-to.</li>
            <li> My girlfriend loves them because they look so natural!</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s more of an everyday lash!</li>
            <li> , I love them and I wear them almost everyday, even if I don&#x27;t wear makeup!</li>
            <li> Only problem is they aren&#x27;t consistent and vary in length from package to package.  </li>
            <li> Wore the first pair several times before they wore out.  </li>
            <li> They are on the full side so be careful if you are just looking for length.</li>
            <li> I like these because they are long enough to fit my eyelids.  </li>
            <li> I usually cut about 1/3 of them off so they don&#x27;t go all the way across my lid and look more natural.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t understand why they wouldn&#x27;t use clear filament.</li>
            <li> They look so natural.</li>
            <li> and i like how natural they look</li>
            <li> get at least &gt;20 wears per pair of eyelashes :)</li>
            <li> Watched several youtube videos and that really helped.&lt;br</li>
            <li> in all these lashes lood fairly natural.  </li>
            <li> but for those who want the natural look here it is.</li>
            <li> Its a simple and very flirty look&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> they look think and natural.</li>
            <li> I did not feel they had a totally natural look.</li>
            <li> They look incredibly natural and gives my look just a bit of an umph with out looking overdone.</li>
            <li> They are soft and natural looking.</li>
            <li> Look natural.</li>
            <li> it looks natural.</li>
            <li> It looks natural.</li>
            <li> This makes putting on the natural lashes a breeze.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a newbie to lashes, but I ike these because they look so natural.</li>
            <li> These lashes look absolutely natural.</li>
            <li> they look like my natural eyelashes.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think they look natural.</li>
            <li> but if your looking for a relatively natural looking &amp;#34;oomph&amp;#34; that will ensure people will notice your eyelashes, give these a try.</li>
            <li> These are by far my fav pair of lashes.  </li>
            <li> My go-to lashes for the natural look.</li>
            <li> They are comfortable to wear and last me at least 3 weeks per pair if they are treated right.</li>
            <li> Easy to apply and last a long time when cared for properly.</li>
            <li> A little too long to be believable.</li>
            <li> They are super natural looking, the band is not too thick, the lashes are very durable.  </li>
            <li> These lashes are lovely and a very natural looking style, but as a first time false lash wearer, they were a little too much for me.  </li>
            <li> Not too long, not too short, but just right.</li>
            <li> I have been wearing these lashes for about a year now, sad to say I only just saw how cheap they are on Amazon and have been paying $6 a set up until now!!!&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, the 110&#x27;s look fantastic</li>
            <li> I have teeny-weeny Asian eyes with super short-n-straight lashes, so this style is just long enough for me without making me look like a tranny.  </li>
            <li> I found that I could only wear them 2-3 times then had to get a new pair.</li>
            <li> It is pretty amazing what a few false lashes can do to enhance the look of your eyes.  </li>
            <li> I am getting ready to run out to CVS, spend a few more $$$ and get my usual for church tomorrow...</li>
            <li> My lashes are normal, not full but not thin either.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re durable, easy to apply, even if you&#x27;re new to wearing false lashes</li>
            <li> These definitely do look natural</li>
            <li> Based on the picture I thought these would be too short, but even though they&#x27;re &#x27;demi&#x27; lashes, they&#x27;re still longer than my natural lashes were.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve worn lashes for the last 10 years because my natural lashes thinned out after I turned 40-something.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m not great at it...has just confirmed my need to see a stylist to put the demi-perm lashes on for me!</li>
            <li> The shape and size are good, but the lashes keeps lifting from my lid no matter how much glue I use... :(</li>
            <li> Ardell will always be my favorite false eyelash brand</li>
            <li> My favorite and go to false lashes.</li>
            <li> I do wish they held a curl better, but that&#x27;s pretty typical of false lashes.  </li>
            <li> You&#x27;re better off buying the other brands that cost less such as Red Cherry 747s or Creme.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t get this if you want something dramatic :)  </li>
            <li> These lashes were not long enough for me.  </li>
            <li> they&#x27;re not thick, not super long...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve bought several lashes and I&#x27;m looking for long but not spiky.</li>
            <li> I purchased Demi lashes and received Double Up lashes which are too long and too angled.</li>
            <li> &amp; I&#x27;m just hoping that won&#x27;t compromise them &amp; cause them to not last as long.  </li>
            <li> The only thing is for me, they are too long.</li>
            <li> absolutely different from the one I got from drug store, looks not natural.</li>
            <li> and they last a long time.&lt;br /&gt;Great product, wouldn&#x27;t use anything else</li>
            <li> I admit it has taken me a while to learn how to apply fake lashes, but these are so easy to apply and reapply.</li>
            <li> they did not stay on as long or even last as long as these do.</li>
            <li> They are long, obviously, but not too long as to disrupt your view or anything.&lt;br /</li>
            <li> The lash band is super thin</li>
            <li> I usually go for Japanese brand false eyelashes for the quality, but decided to try these out, mostly because they&#x27;re cheaper.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m guessing they just put cheap fake ones inside the Ardell boxes.</li>
            <li> So far they last longer than a day unlike the ones I purchased in the past.</li>
            <li> I have long but thin/fine eyelashes.</li>
            <li> They are too long and need to be trimmed so they don&#x27;t pop up on the inside corner.</li>
            <li> they are a bit too long for my eye</li>
            <li> So after my experience I would recommend to those with very short lashes who are just trying false ones out for the first time, try the 108 (which is what I will be returning these for) -</li>
            <li> however I would suggest using a little glue at the inner and outer corner of your eyes so that the ends do not flick up and inevitably fall off.  </li>
            <li> Despite being thin, these lashes are very durable and can be used multiple times.  </li>
            <li> So I guess I don&#x27;t know very much about false eyelashes.</li>
            <li> However, I have worn false eyelashes for MANY years &amp; have always used demi lashes because I have very small eyes.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never worn false lashed before and this is my first time.</li>
            <li> This is the first time I have worn false eyelashes</li>
            <li> However this model in particular is a bit subtle.</li>
            <li> I only had alittlte trouble applying the glue to the lash</li>
            <li> Unless you want to add lots of mascara to fluff up.</li>
            <li> Remove them carefully and reuse.</li>
            <li> I love that it looks so natural, thick but not that thick that it looks fake,</li>
            <li> the glue is needed to retain a nice shape and base fof additional glue to be applied for application.</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that the base (where the lashes attach to the eyelid) needs to be covered with eyeliner to look more real, and I am not very good at doing that.</li>
            <li> Other than that, they are good for everyday wear and don&#x27;t look fake or overly dramatic.</li>
            <li> Some women like that Miss Piggy look, but I wanted something subtle and natural looking.</li>
            <li> They never look too long or thick, just an extra pop to the eye makeup.</li>
            <li> I have just gotten into false eyelashes now that I am older and my lashes seem thinner.  </li>
            <li> Pretty, but they&#x27;re fake.</li>
            <li> Like other consumers I prefer the 110&#x27;s</li>
            <li> I can usually reuse each pair for about 3 to 4 times after proper cleaning and storage.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t experimented with any other lashes</li>
            <li> I am new to false lashes and I wanted something with some drama but not too extreme</li>
            <li> Anyways, save your money, these are not worth it.</li>
            <li> very flattering.cant go wrong at this price.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Buying these in a bulk order of four saves me on average $5 from the price at my local&lt;br /&gt;pharmacy.</li>
            <li> These false lashes are so natural looking.</li>
            <li> these lashes are very natural looking and are not so dramatic looking .</li>
            <li> They aren&#x27;t flashy, super voluminous or thick...</li>
            <li> I FOUND WALGREENS AND WALMART NOW SELL THESE AND OTHER QUALITY LASHES IN PACKS OF 10!</li>
            <li> The band isn&#x27;t black, so even if you use a dark toned adhesive, you would still need to go over the \\&quot;roots\\&quot; with a black eyeliner.</li>
            <li> use revlon black adhesive with it.</li>
            <li> I also run a black sharpie over the lash line strip so that the strip does not show with black eyeliner.  </li>
            <li> If I keep the tray and carefully peel the glue off at the end of each day (and spritz them with a small spray bottle of alcohol)</li>
            <li> They are not too long or too thick</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re not too thick or too long.</li>
            <li> these lashes.&lt;br /&gt;They&#x27;re not too thick or too long and appear &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re not too flashy and they look very natural.</li>
            <li> I tried to cover the \\&quot;stripes\\&quot; with eye liner but it still showed through a little.</li>
            <li> I always get asked what mascara I use, but little do they know these are falsies.</li>
            <li> Demi lashes are a little shorter than others and don&#x27;t interfere with my lenses like the longer lashes do.  </li>
            <li> When I got them, the lashes were all knotted and some of them were missing.</li>
            <li> The look is so natural that they don&#x27;t look like fake lashes.</li>
            <li> for everyday or party.  </li>
            <li> Watched enough YouTube tutorials to realize false lashes aren&#x27;t for me.</li>
            <li> I needed several pairs of false eyelashes for my granddaughter who dances on a competitive showtroupe.  </li>
            <li> I noticed some comments mention white strips etc...usually with fake lashes u throw on some black liquid liner and that covers it</li>
            <li> you want to try lashes, go with these, they dont give you that super fake look!!</li>
            <li> IM GLAD BECAUSE IM TIRED OF BUYING THEM FOR SUCH OUTRAGEOUS PRICES--ONLY TO THROW THEM AWAY AFTER A COUPLE USES.</li>
            <li> I finally broke down and told one lady that my lashes were fake and that I&#x27;ve been wearing fake lashes for only 2 weeks.</li>
            <li> All so the strip is stiff so they pop up in the corners :/</li>
            <li> I got too lazy and don&#x27;t use it anymore</li>
            <li> :-/</li>
            <li> even came with a small bag (coin size).</li>
            <li> I bought more expensive eyelashes from a well known make up company and not only did they look horrible</li>
            <li> I usually get Mac&#x27;s lashes or Flutter Lashes.</li>
            <li> they were not able to be used.</li>
            <li> I am not sure why does this happen.</li>
            <li> Cutting them in half gives you two pairs instead of buying the half lashes as a single pack.</li>
            <li> These lashes are your basic, subtle fake eyelash look.</li>
            <li> I have an extremely hard time putting them on.  </li>
            <li> so you hardly notice them at all.</li>
            <li> I have hardly any lashes.</li>
            <li> and it was hard to apply.</li>
            <li> At least for now.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t like them - too thick.  </li>
            <li> For when you take that strip off they get so weak and fall apart</li>
            <li> Just really thin and unnatural looking.</li>
            <li> NOT HAPPY...</li>
            <li> I have a thin lashes</li>
            <li> so I suggest this to people who are in a hurry and doesn&#x27;t have time to apply for mascara (&amp; thin lashes).</li>
            <li> there is a learning curve for applying false eyelashes</li>
            <li> It has taken a lot of practice to master the art of applying false eyelashes</li>
            <li> Even using black glue it still looks bad.</li>
            <li> They don&#x27;t ave the dramatic wing or length.</li>
            <li> If you want a dramatic Kim Kardashian lashes this are NOT for you.</li>
            <li> They make your eyes truly stand out without being overly dramatic.  </li>
            <li> Very delicate lashes and pairs well with mascara!</li>
            <li> THE WRONG ITEM  </li>
            <li> so if you&#x27;re a beginner at applying falsies, you may have a really difficult time.</li>
            <li> Difficult to glue on and come off within minutes of blinking.</li>
            <li> if you are looking for lashes that dont look like fake lashes then get these.</li>
            <li> no one even realizes they are fake.</li>
            <li> my boyfriend didn&#x27;t even realize they were fake until I said something about it</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t want people to say that they look fake</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t go wrong with these.</li>
            <li> And the white strip at the base is so annoying.</li>
            <li> I had an awful time gluing them on but that is completely due to my inexperience.</li>
            <li> What a disappointment.  </li>
            <li> I hate false lashes, because they&#x27;re a struggle to put on</li>
            <li> so they are not screaming, hey I&#x27;m wearing fake eyelashes!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m mad with myself because I ended up tossing the remainder out by</li>
            <li> Was disappointed in that.</li>
            <li> I searched all around for these lashes in Germany on base &amp; they didn&#x27;t carry it.  </li>
            <li> you can see the base line</li>
            <li> I am very disappointed with this service.</li>
            <li> not so...absolutely hate them!</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Absolutely love these!!! they&#x27;re not thick, not super long...they&#x27;re perfect.  They are full enough and the length is perfect, I&#x27;m forever buying these lol I noticed some comments mention white strips etc...usually with fake lashes u throw on some black liquid liner and that covers it, I&#x27;ve never had an issue???...anyways, I posted a couple of photos for everyone to see.</li>
            <li> Pretty, but they&#x27;re fake. I hate false lashes, because they&#x27;re a struggle to put on and then I wind up ruining them. Watched enough YouTube tutorials to realize false lashes aren&#x27;t for me.</li>
            <li> I am a professional makeup artist and have used all sorts of lashes, from cheap to expensive and I always come back to Ardell #110&#x27;s.  They fit most eyes perfectly and they add that flirtyness that women want in their lashes.  I will order them agaain and again!</li>
            <li> For times when I&#x27;m way too lazy to put on eye makeup, or for nights out when I want my eyes to be a bit more noticeable, these style lashes are my go-to. I have teeny-weeny Asian eyes with super short-n-straight lashes, so this style is just long enough for me without making me look like a tranny.  And on Amazon, you can buy&#x27;em in bulk for way cheap. Gotta love that.</li>
            <li> These lashes are great, they add volume and length but do not look obviously fake. Easy to put on and take off. My favorite fake eyelashes.&lt;br /&gt;Love them coming in a set of 4, so I don&#x27;t have to buy them new as often.</li>
            <li> My girlfriend loves them because they look so natural!</li>
            <li> I rated these 3 stars because the lash quality is very nice but the \\&quot;root\\&quot; of the lashes is clear which still shows up on my darker skin tone... so it almost looks like there are stripes at the root of my lashes...    It may just be my medium skin tone.  I tried to cover the \\&quot;stripes\\&quot; with eye liner but it still showed through a little.</li>
            <li> They look so natural. They were easy to put on with the Duo adhesive glue. I will definitely be ordering more!</li>
            <li> these eyelashes are a great fit for my eyes and i like how natural they look, will definatley order more.</li>
            <li> Will buy again.  Truly looks very natural.</li>
            <li> These look very natural on and are very light.&lt;br /&gt;Great for smaller eye shapes &amp; suitable for daily wear.&lt;br /&gt;I get at least &gt;20 wears per pair of eyelashes :)</li>
            <li> Been wanting to try these for a while.  there is a learning curve for applying false eyelashes and I think I am finally getting the hang of it.  Watched several youtube videos and that really helped.&lt;br /&gt;All in all these lashes lood fairly natural.  they make it look like you have perfectly applied mascara.  They are not too long or too thick so they are not screaming, hey I&#x27;m wearing fake eyelashes!</li>
            <li> I love these lashes.  I use them all the time and people have no idea I&#x27;m wearing falsies</li>
            <li> These are by far my favorite lashes to wear on a daily basis. They are on the full side so be careful if you are just looking for length. I have smaller features so I needed to cut the lashes as well as make them shorter for it to look natural but full. They are comfortable to wear and last me at least 3 weeks per pair if they are treated right.</li>
            <li> I use these every day. TIP: Use the Revlon wand lash adhesive for all day staying power. If I keep the tray and carefully peel the glue off at the end of each day (and spritz them with a small spray bottle of alcohol) each set lasts about 7-10 days.</li>
            <li> Looks natural, my fianc&amp;eacute; told me it look great! :) I&#x27;m very happy.&lt;br /&gt;I use revlon black adhesive with it. Just over $3 at Walmart. It&#x27;s awesome.&lt;br /&gt;The only thing is that my fianc&amp;eacute; said its not that diff from my own eye lashes. My eye lashes are longer than normal ppl..&lt;br /&gt;So I got too lazy and don&#x27;t use it anymore :-/ but I will again when I feel like using it to make it look a lot more :)</li>
            <li> Ardell 110 are great for those with shorter lashes wanting a bit more extra.  These won&#x27;t look all spidery and overdramatic.  Good quality lashes.</li>
            <li> very natural looking lashes even tho I haven&#x27;t try it on yet. just look so beautiful!! even came with a small bag (coin size).</li>
            <li> This looks really natural and work perfectly. My friends are amazed by the look these eyelashes provided.</li>
            <li> I bought this item 2 weeks b4 my husbands bday and it got here in 1 week.  I searched all around for these lashes in Germany on base &amp; they didn&#x27;t carry it.  Thank goodness they came when they did.  That night I had got alot of compliments on my eyes. I finally broke down and told one lady that my lashes were fake and that I&#x27;ve been wearing fake lashes for only 2 weeks. She was amazed.  They were easy to put on I only had alittlte trouble applying the glue to the lash but like I said I&#x27;m new to this and  next time I&#x27;ll use tweezers.</li>
            <li> These are one of my favorite lashes to wear for special occasions. They&#x27;re not too flashy and they look very natural.</li>
            <li> I needed several pairs of false eyelashes for my granddaughter who dances on a competitive showtroupe.  The order came quickly and has been an asset to our needs.</li>
            <li> These lashes go on easy, stay on, and look really natural. They&#x27;re not too thick or too long. They&#x27;re just right! This is a great price too, especially if you have Amazon Prime. At Rite Aid these lashes are $4.00 a pair, so this is a big savings. Great lashes, great deal, what could be better?</li>
            <li> I love that it looks so natural, thick but not that thick that it looks fake, im so buying more of this same model#. Thumbs up and I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Price is good.  The quality is good, the lashes are in tight and don&#x27;t fall out.  Nothing spectacular, but a good value.</li>
            <li> I really liked the quality of these Ardell lashes. However this model in particular is a bit subtle. Though they are very nice I will be buying a fuller thicker model from Ardell soon.</li>
            <li> product not as described. They sent me the &amp;#34;natural lashes&amp;#34; not the ones in the picture. When I got them, the lashes were all knotted and some of them were missing. Boxes looked as if they had been opened? I&#x27;ve bought these lashes tons of times from the store and the ones I received were NOT the real thing. They seemed like really cheap quality, and when i tried wearing them they irritated my eyes and I had to take them off after about 20 minutes. I&#x27;m guessing they just put cheap fake ones inside the Ardell boxes. Anyways, save your money, these are not worth it.</li>
            <li> This makes it look like I dont have any lashes on but isn&#x27;t it all about the lashes that is why i buy them and wear them.  but for those who want the natural look here it is.</li>
            <li> these lashes are very natural looking and are not so dramatic looking . Looks good for the daily use for beautiful look for eyes.</li>
            <li> I ordered several pairs.great price!!&lt;br /&gt;They are light weight and very comfortable.&lt;br /&gt;And very flattering.cant go wrong at this price.</li>
            <li> These lashes look so much more natural than the ones i had been purchasing. Very delicate lashes and pairs well with mascara!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never worn false lashed before and this is my first time. These lashes were so comfortable and it stayed on all day. The material was flexible and the length was just right for me. I liked this pair of lashed because it looked natural and not over the top.</li>
            <li> These false lashes are so natural looking. They&#x27;re also very comfortable. And more importantly, they are short enough to fit behind my glasses. I usually go for Japanese brand false eyelashes for the quality, but decided to try these out, mostly because they&#x27;re cheaper. I also generally prefer accent lashes over full strips, so I was trying a lot of new things. Overall, super happy with these.</li>
            <li> Love these lahses, they are the most natural looking false lash i have ever used, I use them on 90% of my brides when I do makeup. They never look too long or thick, just an extra pop to the eye makeup. they are perfect.</li>
            <li> I love the Ardel 110 Demi Lashes!  They are super natural looking, the band is not too thick, the lashes are very durable.  The Demi lashes are smaller across than regular lashes, and fit smaller eyes better, if you have big eyes the Demi lashes may be too small for your eyes, but if your eyes are small, the Demi&#x27;s will be perfect.  Will repurchase!</li>
            <li> THESE ARE REALLY NICE LASHES FROM ARDELL. THEY LOOK NATURAL, NOT EXAGGERATED. I FOUND WALGREENS AND WALMART NOW SELL THESE AND OTHER QUALITY LASHES IN PACKS OF 10! THEY JUST RECENTLY STARTED THIS, AND IM GLAD BECAUSE IM TIRED OF BUYING THEM FOR SUCH OUTRAGEOUS PRICES--ONLY TO THROW THEM AWAY AFTER A COUPLE USES. NOW THAT THEYRE BEING SOLD IN GREATER QUANTITIES IN STORES, I WILL GO THERE FOR MY PURCHASES UNLESS THERES A BETTER DEAL ON AMAZON.</li>
            <li> Beautiful lashes that last with proper care. I have long but thin/fine eyelashes. These blend very well and add the perfect thickness that I crave. Great for laid back looks or can vamp up for nights out-these are one of my top lash choices. Mascara cleans off easily and they dry nicely for reuse. I love these and will continue to order from this seller. Excellent shipping time and great service!</li>
            <li> I love these eyelashes! Basically every style they make are great. I bought more expensive eyelashes from a well known make up company and not only did they look horrible they did not stay on as long or even last as long as these do. If your looking for Great quality eyelashes these are the way to go. The price is fantastic for the great quality too! BUY THEM NOW :D</li>
            <li> These lashes are your basic, subtle fake eyelash look. Want more lashes but to look natural? this is for you. Easy to trim with scissors if they are too long for the eye.</li>
            <li> Beautiful lashes, durable for a few times. Its a simple and very flirty look&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this product to anyone that like to wear lashes</li>
            <li> It has a natural-looking, very easy to apply, but a little different from the one which I bought from drug store.</li>
            <li> I will never get this brand again. I will stick to Salon Perfect. I found that I could only wear them 2-3 times then had to get a new pair.They don&#x27;t even feel real. They feel prickly and &amp;#34;fake&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> I am new to lashes and these lashes are great.  They are not too much perfect for day to day. Comfortable on eyes not too heavy love these!</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t say enough about Ardell lashes. They are the best.  The price was good for these also.  Will purchase again.</li>
            <li> great, these lashes adds a little glam but also very natural looking it is a great product and would highly recommend</li>
            <li> great price! Great product!</li>
            <li> Good basic lashes.  This size works perfectly for someone with small eyes/short eyelashes that can&#x27;t handle some of the huge glam eyelashes out there.</li>
            <li> These are great for going out, and they&#x27;re not obviously fake-looking. My only complaint is that the base (where the lashes attach to the eyelid) needs to be covered with eyeliner to look more real, and I am not very good at doing that.</li>
            <li> I bought these thinking they&#x27;re my go-to Demi 116&#x27;s.. They&#x27;re not. They don&#x27;t ave the dramatic wing or length. They were good to wear for basic stuff to add volume.</li>
            <li> Great lashes and fantastic price.  You do need a stronger eyelash adhesive like the Duo since the lashes don&#x27;t automatically curve to the arch of your lash line.  They are comfortable and  look beautiful.  I tried the 110&#x27;s and the 109&#x27;s.  Like other consumers I prefer the 110&#x27;s they look think and natural.</li>
            <li> I loved it, the first time it came with 4 separate packaging (great for stocking stuffers) the second time i ordered it came with a single packaging in four pairs. Great but i liked them separate. wonderful natural-like lashes. you can see the base line so just ink it out with your liner.</li>
            <li> I gave only 3 stars because I haven&#x27;t used these lashes, yet.  I have an extremely hard time putting them on.  Glue was not included in the package.  Now, I have the glue and I&#x27;ve ruined one pair.  Once I get them on correctly, I&#x27;m sure they will be nice.</li>
            <li> Exactly as described, Waaaayy cheaper than in the store.</li>
            <li> They dont compare to high end lashes but will do in a pinch. I usually get Mac&#x27;s lashes or Flutter Lashes. I find with the better brands you can get up to 36 uses with mac&#x27;s and up to 25 with Flutter lashes if you take care of them and remove the adhesive as soon as you take them off before putting them back in the case.</li>
            <li> My older aunt&#x27;s love these lashes.&lt;br /&gt;They&#x27;re not too thick or too long and appear &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; like they claim to be</li>
            <li> I ordered these to wear to a Christmas party, received them the same day as the party. I thought they were self-adhesive and the perk of the product was not having to get glue. Well I have no adhesive and one of the steps listed is &amp;#34;apply adhesive&amp;#34;. So I guess I don&#x27;t know very much about false eyelashes.</li>
            <li> If you are into a very natural look, this are for you. If you want a dramatic Kim Kardashian lashes this are NOT for you. Of course you look better with this one, but you will not look like the eye in the picture.</li>
            <li> These were much better quality than the Ardell 118 I also purchased.  These don&#x27;t \\&quot;pop\\&quot; as much but are great for day wear.  Would recommend them.</li>
            <li> Saw the great reviews and mistook these for the ones I usually get at my local drug store...not so...absolutely hate them! Just really thin and unnatural looking. And the white strip at the base is so annoying. I am getting ready to run out to CVS, spend a few more $$$ and get my usual for church tomorrow...I guess you get what you pay for!</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t like them - too thick.  Followed Bobbi Thomas&#x27; suggestion on Kathy Lee and Hoda.  The ones that I purchased at Ulta are more realistic for me. .</li>
            <li> These lashes are great!&lt;br /&gt;* They look very natural, so it doesn&#x27;t look like you&#x27;ve done too much. Very desirable effect.&lt;br /&gt;* They are long, obviously, but not too long as to disrupt your view or anything.&lt;br /&gt;* Obviously, easy application and removal, since they are all in one, not individual lashes. Very good.&lt;br /&gt;* They don&#x27;t start falling off in the middle of the day or anything. They are durable, and tear-resistant.&lt;br /&gt;* They curl amazingly well, and stay curled.&lt;br /&gt;* They&#x27;re good for up to 3 weeks of re-use!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The application process is very simple and written on the back.&lt;br /&gt;I recommend using it with Revlon Precision Lash Adhesive. That way, you&#x27;d get the absolute best performance from your lashes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These are great for any use, and yes, even everyday use. That&#x27;s awesome, right?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will definitely repurchase these lashes. I&#x27;ve tried &amp;#34;Red Cherry Lashes&amp;#34; as well, and they weren&#x27;t as good as these.</li>
            <li> I found that these lashes were so wispy that they looked thinner than just putting on mascara.  I probably wouldn&#x27;t order these again.</li>
            <li> As a frequent lash wearer, I loved these lashes.  They really are natural. I can&#x27;t stand lashes that arrive in the room an hour before you do.  Looking like crow feathers!  I will keep buying these. Really opens up youreyes!</li>
            <li> I love these lashes because they look natural on me during the day and you can&#x27;t tell I&#x27;m wearing any.</li>
            <li> WHEN I ORDERED LASHES FROM HERE... I ORDERED #21 AND WAS SENT #110...I DID NOT WANT OR DID NOT ORDER THOSE YET HAD TO PAY FOR  THE WRONG ITEM  TO BE SHIPPED TO ME ...NOT HAPPY...WILL BE MORE CAREFULL  WHAT AND WHO I ORDER FROM IN THE FUTURE..STILL WAITING FOR CREDIT CARD BILL TO CHECK IF MY MONEY HAS BEEN REFUNDED</li>
            <li> These Ardell Demi Lashes are great for a dramatic look or dress-up affair.  The stayed on all day and night with the use of the Duo Lash Adhesive.</li>
            <li> I did not feel they had a totally natural look. A little too long to be believable.</li>
            <li> they&#x27;re full, natural looking lashes. people said i looked different and better without really knowing why. they&#x27;re the lashes! no one would notice otherwise. it&#x27;s more of an everyday lash! which i wanted. good for professional settings/date nights. stay on, i didn&#x27;t really have to cut to fit my lashes, and even though i have asian eyes they fit relatively well!</li>
            <li> these are good for everyday of you don&#x27;t want your eyes to pop as much...don&#x27;t look overly &amp;#34;fake&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> I like these because they are long enough to fit my eyelids.  A lot of people thought they were my real lashes.  I but a lot of this brand and style.</li>
            <li> I LOVE these lashes. They look natural and beautiful and are very light so you hardly notice them at all. The clear strip makes these much easier to wear without a line of eyeliner if you prefer that. Sometimes I would rather go with just a little light eyeshadow instead of the full liner, and these make that even easier. With the 4-pack these are very affordable yet high quality. Definitely worth the buy!</li>
            <li> Very natural and light to wear. It&#x27;s perfect. Shipping was quick as well.</li>
            <li> Love these. Very natural looking.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve bought several lashes and I&#x27;m looking for long but not spiky. 110&#x27;s are the ones. They are too long and need to be trimmed so they don&#x27;t pop up on the inside corner. Other than that, they are good for everyday wear and don&#x27;t look fake or overly dramatic.</li>
            <li> Looks really natural but they&#x27;re really flimsy so if you&#x27;re a beginner at applying falsies, you may have a really difficult time.</li>
            <li> I purchased Demi lashes and received Double Up lashes which are too long and too angled. I received totally opposite of what I ordered.</li>
            <li> The strip you glue to the eyelid is white! Looks like white dashes going across your lid with lashes inbetween. Even using black glue it still looks bad. All so the strip is stiff so they pop up in the corners :/</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a beginner to the falsies world, so I played it safe with these. My natural eyelashes are basically non-existent, lol. These lashes make me look very awake and my eyes always look glamorous whether dolled up or plain faced, which I love!</li>
            <li> These are nowhere close to passing for eyelashes.  My dolls have better lashes than these.  Difficult to glue on and come off within minutes of blinking.</li>
            <li> Let me be clear, these are great lashes, but I only received 1 out of 4 pairs! I paid 11$ + for 1 pair of eyelashes. I am very disappointed with this service. My rating has to do with the service and NOT the item. The lashes are great, receiving 1 out 4 pairs is not great.</li>
            <li> My lashes are normal, not full but not thin either. These particular pair are the perfect compliment to my look. They look incredibly natural and gives my look just a bit of an umph with out looking overdone. I wear these lashes every day office/work.</li>
            <li> Probably down to my lack of experience with falsies, but these do not go on easily.</li>
            <li> These definitely do look natural</li>
            <li> Love these lashes. I can usually reuse each pair for about 3 to 4 times after proper cleaning and storage. They are soft and natural looking. Great for everyday wear.</li>
            <li> ladies these eyelashes are not only beautiful but they look and feel so natural and so easy to put on, if you are like me the older we get we lose our eyelashes and these look so real i put them on and no one believed me i had false eyelases on, lol another must have</li>
            <li> these are good quality and natural looking. they are a bit too long for my eye so I have to trim a bit off the inside of the lash. great if you&#x27;re going for a natural look, but I think next time I order lashes I&#x27;ll look for thicker ones.</li>
            <li> I thought the lashes would have come with glue as it is needed for use but had to purchase separately.  What a disappointment.  But the lashes look great.</li>
            <li> The eyelashes themselves are good. Just enough to make mine look full and beautiful, without looking fake.  They take practice though and I&#x27;m not great at it...has just confirmed my need to see a stylist to put the demi-perm lashes on for me!</li>
            <li> So, I&#x27;ve reviewed the Number 108s and now the 110s. Both are excellent choices, but I&#x27;m finding that I tend to prefer the 108s. At least for now.</li>
            <li> These lashes are beautiful, very nicely priced and were a breeze to apply.  They look very natural and were a good way to make my eyes pop for pictures.</li>
            <li> I recieve these monthly but this time all of them did not have enough glue on the strip and they bent all over. they were not able to be used. the glue is needed to retain a nice shape and base fof additional glue to be applied for application.</li>
            <li> Absolutely love these!  Look natural. Very real looking and not heavy.  Unless you want to add lots of mascara to fluff up. Get them on auto delivery. Lasts me for several times of wear. Can curl them with eyelashes as well.</li>
            <li> These are the best eyelashes. I love to put fake eyelashes on because it&#x27;s part of a good make-up. I&#x27;m very happy with this order.</li>
            <li> I love them!!!! So glad I ordered 8 pairs at one time. Nice quality and it looks natural. These are the best eye lashes I&#x27;ve ever had</li>
            <li> The best lashes, don&#x27;t waste your money on others.  These lashes look natural , easy to put on too. You can cut them in the middle and just attach to your outter eye lid.</li>
            <li> I suffer from Trichotillomania and I find these lashes to look very natural to conceal&lt;br /&gt;the fact that I have no lashes of my own.&lt;br /&gt;Buying these in a bulk order of four saves me on average $5 from the price at my local&lt;br /&gt;pharmacy. :) Very happy with these.&lt;br /&gt;Good quality and most certainly will repurchase them.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the best eyelashes for my asian eyes. It looks natural. It&#x27;s very easy to put on. Very nice shape.</li>
            <li> Love them.. Cheaper than beauty supply stores. I&#x27;m hooked...:)&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re looking for great price and service..  they&#x27;re a winner.</li>
            <li> I can swear they are my natural eyelashes and be ok with it , the most natural looking eyelashes ever!!!</li>
            <li> Cut into 3 pieces. Put on one piece at a time. This makes putting on the natural lashes a breeze. Seller&#x27;s price and delivery is excellent.</li>
            <li> I wear these all the time, they fit me perfect and look natural, not fake, I love them and I wear them almost everyday, even if I don&#x27;t wear makeup! these are great!</li>
            <li> if you are looking for lashes that dont look like fake lashes then get these. it just makes your lashes look fuller. they are also really easy to apply.</li>
            <li> Best natural looking eyelashes. Great for everyday use,!</li>
            <li> These lashes are my daily &amp;#34;go to&amp;#34; and they are super comfortable. They are the perfect length, don&#x27;t look fake, and add the perfect amount of length for daytime or night time. I always get asked what mascara I use, but little do they know these are falsies. I love that they&#x27;re reusable too!!</li>
            <li> These lashes were not long enough for me.  VERY natural looking, so if that&#x27;s the look you are wanting, then these are for you.  They are pretty much disposable.  I don&#x27;t see how anyone could wear them more than once, not to mention that just seems unsanitary.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a newbie to lashes, but I ike these because they look so natural. I&#x27;m mad with myself because I ended up tossing the remainder out by mistake-like really!!! So, I have to re-purchase these once again-LOL...</li>
            <li> Super fast shipping!!!!! Love it.</li>
            <li> These lashes are great!  Perfect length and thickness to accentuate your lashes but still look real.  Only problem is they aren&#x27;t consistent and vary in length from package to package.  I have to buy them in the store to insure I get the right length.</li>
            <li> They were exactly what I expected and more!! The look is so natural that they don&#x27;t look like fake lashes. But you can still tell they give you more volume and length! They are amazing and I&#x27;m subscribing to them now! Can&#x27;t love with pith them!</li>
            <li> Perfect semi-natural look! Ardell will always be my favorite false eyelash brand</li>
            <li> I have been buying these lashes for years from the store that&#x27;s why I knew what number to get. They were a different kind with the ready to put on sticky strip which I HATE. For when you take that strip off they get so weak and fall apart you can&#x27;t use then anymore. I might as well have got them from the store.</li>
            <li> These lashes are pretty and seem very convenient but upon experimenting with them before actual wear, I found that the corners of the lashes don&#x27;t stick very well.  These are self adhesive however I would suggest using a little glue at the inner and outer corner of your eyes so that the ends do not flick up and inevitably fall off.  I haven&#x27;t experimented with any other lashes so my review is solely based off of &amp;#34;non-sticky&amp;#34; edges of these lashes.</li>
            <li> These falsies are great for an everyday look.  They aren&#x27;t flashy, super voluminous or thick...but they add just a touch bit of length and fullness to your lashes that enhances your overall look.  The lash band is super thin so it feels like you&#x27;re wearing nothing, and easily works with any glue.  Despite being thin, these lashes are very durable and can be used multiple times.  Don&#x27;t get this if you want something dramatic :)  I love wearing these lashes everyday.</li>
            <li> These are probably the most natural look you&#x27;ll get with a falsie because of the volume and length. They are easy to apply. I also find them easy to size and trim. These are my go-to lashes.</li>
            <li> Got the impression these were shorter in length than what they really are. Was disappointed in that. Wish I knew how to shorten the lash length on these. This is definitely a popular brand so for someone who loves that dramatic look, these are good eyelashes.</li>
            <li> Love these! They make your eyes truly stand out without being overly dramatic.  Easy to apply and last a long time when cared for properly.</li>
            <li> These are my favorite go to lash. Not too long, not too short, but just right. Looks good on almost anyone.</li>
            <li> I absolutely LOVE these lashes. I don&#x27;t ever write reviews but i had to come back and give this product my 5 stars. These lashes look absolutely natural. Nobody can tell I wear falsies and they are beautiful on! I get so many compliments. Love love love!!!!üòç</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t actually used the lashes yet because I have a pair that are still in pretty good shape.  These look to be a good quality.  However, I have worn false eyelashes for MANY years &amp; have always used demi lashes because I have very small eyes.  These are not what I would consider demi lashes at all.  So, I&#x27;ll have to cut them off to make them the length I need &amp; I&#x27;m just hoping that won&#x27;t compromise them &amp; cause them to not last as long.  But the price is good enough that I decided not to return them &amp; take a chance on them lasting a reasonable amount of time.</li>
            <li> Product accurately described</li>
            <li> Great lashes! I was concerned about how they would look, having never purchased lashes online before. Some women like that Miss Piggy look, but I wanted something subtle and natural looking. I am satisfied with my purchase and will continue to purchase these.</li>
            <li> I am in love with these lashes! I received them on time and very quick delivery. I got exactly what was described and what was shown in the picture.</li>
            <li> Looks great and natural. I will purchase again</li>
            <li> These are great to cut in half and use as half lashes.  Cutting them in half gives you two pairs instead of buying the half lashes as a single pack.</li>
            <li> I like them they look like my natural eyelashes. So far they last longer than a day unlike the ones I purchased in the past. I admit it has taken me a while to learn how to apply fake lashes, but these are so easy to apply and reapply. It&#x27;s good value for the cost. Still cheaper than the store.</li>
            <li> I have been wearing these lashes for about a year now, sad to say I only just saw how cheap they are on Amazon and have been paying $6 a set up until now!!!&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, the 110&#x27;s look fantastic and I think they are the perfect mixture of dramatic but realistic eyelashes. I often have people ask me if mine are real, I always say yes now because Ive gotten so good at doing them I can keep them on for up to one week!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you want to try lashes, go with these, they dont give you that super fake look!!</li>
            <li> These  arrived promptly and were in the boxes brand new. They are the most natural looking falsies I have. I put them on and while they add volume and a bit of length, you can&#x27;t even tell I have any on. No one even mentioned them to me they just said my eyelashes looked great. I&#x27;ll probably be getting more soon cause I&#x27;ve used and reused them!</li>
            <li> Another good looking lash from Ardell.  The shape and size are good, but the lashes keeps lifting from my lid no matter how much glue I use... :(</li>
            <li> I bought this last month to try it out, its been years since I used &amp;#34;Fashion falsies eyelashes&amp;#34;. They actually look very natural, not too thick/thin; they look like my own lashes. Its easy to used and I don&#x27;t have to apply too much mascara which sometimes made my lashes to clump. I have a thin lashes so I suggest this to people who are in a hurry and doesn&#x27;t have time to apply for mascara (&amp; thin lashes). I&#x27;m 37 and I love them (affordable &amp; durable)</li>
            <li> The band isn&#x27;t black, so even if you use a dark toned adhesive, you would still need to go over the \\&quot;roots\\&quot; with a black eyeliner. On top of that, the lashes cost too much to use for an everyday look. They can be reused but they lose their shape. You&#x27;re better off buying the other brands that cost less such as Red Cherry 747s or Creme. These brands have lashes that are knotted and look more natural.</li>
            <li> The on line price was great and they were the same lashes I bought at Target for more money. Great buy!</li>
            <li> Wore these today for the first time, they looked natural but yet not so natural my eyes didn&#x27;t pop, my fiance loved them on me :)</li>
            <li> Wore the first pair several times before they wore out.  They&#x27;re durable, easy to apply, even if you&#x27;re new to wearing false lashes</li>
            <li> Great, natural looking lashes.  Invisible band makes them easy to apply. Remove them carefully and reuse.</li>
            <li> Based on the picture I thought these would be too short, but even though they&#x27;re &#x27;demi&#x27; lashes, they&#x27;re still longer than my natural lashes were. The band is a touch too long, but really easy to clip. They look so natural I don&#x27;t have to wear eyeliner with them, but they look so much nicer and fuller than mascara. I do wish they held a curl better, but that&#x27;s pretty typical of false lashes.  Love love love.</li>
            <li> Very fast delivery:)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Because I have Asian eyes, fancy eyelashes don&#x27;t look good with me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This one is very natural!! No one could tell but it really made a difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I loved how it was delivered so quickly, had resonable price, and I also looooveeee the product:) Thank u!</li>
            <li> I love these lashes!  I use them on brides for weddings.  The 110 demi lashes are great and you get 4 in one pack.  By far the best price for good lashes that I have found on the web.</li>
            <li> I have just gotten into false eyelashes now that I am older and my lashes seem thinner.  I have experimented with $18-a-pair Winks and these 110&#x27;s from Ardell which I originally found at Walgreen&#x27;s and just about everything in between.  These 110&#x27;s, which are very attractively priced here on Amazon, are the perfect combination of fullness and length for every day wear.  They are natural and light and really compliment my own lashes and are not too dramatic for daily wear.  It has taken a lot of practice to master the art of applying false eyelashes (I looked like a whacky raccoon for about a week there) but it is worth it now that I can buy in bulk online and not spend too much money.</li>
            <li> I love these because they look very natural and the price is very reasonable.  I plan on buying them more.</li>
            <li> I love these. I have hardly any lashes. and these look pretty and natural. no one even realizes they are fake. I like buying the pack online since its cheaper than stores, I think salon select in walmart is the same. but I never have time to drive there. I keep buying the 110 demi, they are my favorite style.</li>
            <li> Excellent!  I expected to buy something not &amp;#34;to much&amp;#34;, and these are perfect.  loved.  for everyday or party.  I recomend.</li>
            <li> The hairs on these lashes are knotted onto a white-colored filament, so when you glue them on, the white filament shows between the knots. So I can&#x27;t use these at all and don&#x27;t know how others are managing this - maybe applying lots of liquid liner over them. Pencil liner didn&#x27;t work and I don&#x27;t want to go through having to carefully apply liquid liner over and on top of the strip to cover the filament. I don&#x27;t understand why they wouldn&#x27;t use clear filament.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t really like these. I don&#x27;t think they look natural. They didn&#x27;t stay on very well either. I wouldn&#x27;t buy again.</li>
            <li> These don&#x27;t stay on AT ALL. I think it must be the batch as I&#x27;ve purchased from Walgreens and worked fune.</li>
            <li> Great lashes and great price</li>
            <li> My favorite and go to false lashes. I usually cut about 1/3 of them off so they don&#x27;t go all the way across my lid and look more natural. Ardell makes THE BEST fake eyelash strips and also has the BEST adhesive glue. This is my favorite style. I wear them almost every day!</li>
            <li> I am new to false lashes and I wanted something with some drama but not too extreme and these are perfect for that. They are very easy to put on and you can use them multiple times. They have a very natural look...my boyfriend didn&#x27;t even realize they were fake until I said something about it but he did say how nice my eyes looked beforehand.</li>
            <li> These are my favorite lashes but I refuse to pay this price for them ever again. I&#x27;d rather go to a beauty supply or order another brand. They&#x27;re great if you&#x27;re willing to spend the money though.</li>
            <li> This is my first time with falsies. I didn&#x27;t need to trim at all and they ended up looking very natural on my eyes. I had an awful time gluing them on but that is completely due to my inexperience. I had glue everywhere :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hope it gets easier because they look beautiful and I can&#x27;t wait to wear them again!</li>
            <li> These are my all-time favorites. I&#x27;ve had other kinds of lashes but these are the most natural looking and comfortable kind I&#x27;ve ever used! I&#x27;ve worn lashes for the last 10 years because my natural lashes thinned out after I turned 40-something. I don&#x27;t want people to say that they look fake so I wear these exact lashes and have for years.</li>
            <li> These lashes are lovely and a very natural looking style, but as a first time false lash wearer, they were a little too much for me.  I read the reviews about these (110) and the &amp;#34;next size down&amp;#34; (108) and made an executive decision based on what I read.  But ultimately, having never worn any before, I needed to ease in a bit more.  So after my experience I would recommend to those with very short lashes who are just trying false ones out for the first time, try the 108 (which is what I will be returning these for) - but if your looking for a relatively natural looking &amp;#34;oomph&amp;#34; that will ensure people will notice your eyelashes, give these a try.</li>
            <li> Ardell Lashes are always great. These are light and more natural looking than other styles. You can&#x27;t beat the price either. They are easy to wear daytime or evening. You can&#x27;t go wrong with these.</li>
            <li> Great product, no complaints. However I missed that there is no glue or anything included! I had to run to the store to buy the adhesive separately.</li>
            <li> just as described. love them!</li>
            <li> Not fake looking at all......Many people thought these were my natural lashes....these were great and are even okay if you want to wear them everyday.</li>
            <li> These are by far my fav pair of lashes.  They look the most natural all while adding lash volume.  The only thing is for me, they are too long. I tend to snip a bit of the front (inner eyelid) off so that the majority of the lash volume is on the outside of my eyelids.</li>
            <li> These lashes do not look unnatural; they are perfect to enhance your own lashes. It is pretty amazing what a few false lashes can do to enhance the look of your eyes.  You can easily trim these lashes to better fit your eye, or do what I do and cut one pair in half and use as half lashes on both eyes.  I also run a black sharpie over the lash line strip so that the strip does not show with black eyeliner.  If you don&#x27;t put mascara on these lashes you can reapply them several times.</li>
            <li> These are ok. Nothing special about them but for the price they do offer a pretty frame for your eyes.</li>
            <li> absolutely different from the one I got from drug store, looks not natural. and it was hard to apply. I am not sure why does this happen. Same brand same kind!</li>
            <li> My go-to lashes for the natural look.</li>
            <li> These are amazing for everyday use, they look real!</li>
            <li> This is the first time I have worn false eyelashes so I looked at the reviews here first before buying them at Walgreens.  One pair at Walgreens was $6.  I will buy them from Amazon from now on.  I had my hair stylist put them on for me and she had never done it before it.  We were done in 5 minutes.  They look great and natural.  There was not glue in the package, so I am glad I bought a tube.</li>
            <li> Nice product, love that they look so natural! Easy to put on and they last a long time.&lt;br /&gt;Great product, wouldn&#x27;t use anything else</li>
            <li> Three cheers for another quality product from Ardell.  These lashes are really terrific if you wear glasses like I do.  Demi lashes are a little shorter than others and don&#x27;t interfere with my lenses like the longer lashes do.  They are the wispier lashes and find them more natural looking.  All of Ardell lashes are easy for me to apply, including these.  You can wear them for multiple days, but I do NOT recommend sleeping in them.  I take mine off every night.  Before wearing again, you need to take off the excess adhesive from the prior wearing along the lash line.  I will definitely be buying these again and recommend that you try them too.  Five stars....would give six if it was available.</li>
