    <ol>
            <li>VERY GREAT FOR TEETH AND GUMS.</li>
            <li>excellent product and delivery time....</li>
            <li>best mouth wash.  </li>
            <li>Dental check-ups have been great!</li>
            <li>By the way, I heard about this stuff in a book called Good Teeth, Birth to Death: The Prescription for Perfect Teeth, by a Dr. Judd.</li>
            <li>I have had irritation of my gum at times and also have used it works great.</li>
            <li>Great performance.</li>
            <li>Order fulfillment was great.  </li>
            <li>I will say my gums/mouth felt great after that....</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using specificl products for my dental health, eating good and not going to the dentist.for 3 years.</li>
            <li>kind of like cloves.  </li>
            <li>This is a very good product for refreshing and keeping mouth fresh &amp; clean.&lt;br /&gt;After I read Kiss</li>
            <li>real clean.  </li>
            <li>On the bright side, my mouth felt so clean after using it</li>
            <li>Taste is okay.</li>
            <li>Love this&lt;br /&gt;Product</li>
            <li>Having got a Gum Abcess I had thought from reading supposed reviews that this product might be able to combat this problem.</li>
            <li>Also found out there is a more efficient way to use it.  </li>
            <li>The recommended way is to start with 5 drops of Peri-Gum in 1/2 oz of water and work up to be able to put 25 drops in  1/2 oz of water.  </li>
            <li>Of course the more severe the gum recession the longer</li>
            <li>I ordered 2 more bottles and continue to monitor the progress.  </li>
            <li>I find it to be a great addition to natural health regimen.</li>
            <li>I found the taste to be pleasant, although it packs a hot kick, my mouth and breath feel very fresh and clean afterward.  </li>
            <li>A better and more economical way is to put the 25 drops in 1/2 oz of water and instead of rinsing, use a Q tip to swab the gum line thoroughly twice a day.  </li>
            <li>This stuff is strong but I like the flavor of it...</li>
            <li>And my gums are fine now.</li>
            <li>My results would probably be even better if I was more consistent in my oral care.</li>
            <li>It is slightly light brown in color which may stain teeth - however I did not see any noticable color difference in my teeth after using it.</li>
            <li>so you can enjoy the after look.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>So far so good.</li>
            <li>My mouth feels clean, fresh and healthy.</li>
            <li>Product seems great but it will take several months of use to see its full effectiveness.</li>
            <li>it will clean your tongue and make</li>
            <li>I had areas with mild and severe recession.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had good results over a long period of time; no worsening of my gum line.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll let you know if I have any success with it.</li>
            <li>If teeth show a discoloration, try a mix of baking soda with fresh lemon juice squeezed in, and brush teeth with it.  </li>
            <li>Came very fast.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the hot pepper in it.  </li>
            <li>Have had some bleeding gums and after using the first bottle, I saw an improvement.  </li>
            <li>I was only able to use about 5 drops diluted in water</li>
            <li>This is my wife&#x27;s second bottle and her gums feel healthy.</li>
            <li>Makes your gums tingle from the hot pepper extract.</li>
            <li>I just ordered my third bottle, and found that with regular use I am getting good results.  </li>
            <li>my teeth and gums are not hurting as much.</li>
            <li>I feel its really helping me maintain my gum health.</li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;It pink and healthy.  </li>
            <li>This Peri-Gum concentrate, plus peppermint-flavored Tooth Soap shreds (also sold on Amazon), works really well to repair my receding gums around a molar that suffered trauma and damage to the surrounding bone.  </li>
            <li>shipping was very prompt.</li>
            <li>Tried this product as directed and after using not even half the bottle started feeling more sensitivity in my teeth.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend Peri-Gum.</li>
            <li>I also brush only with soap so my gums are looking nice and pink for a 56 year old.</li>
            <li>After 7 weeks, the mild areas are just about completely restored and I can definitely see the improvement in the severe areas.  </li>
            <li>It brushed right off my teeth but forever stained my fillings.</li>
            <li>but I am quite willing for it to take longer by using the Per-Gum treatment in other areas and enjoy the immense cost savings.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Wow!  </li>
            <li>First of all that&#x27;s probably 1/3 of the bottle and second your teeth would be the nastiest shade of brown!</li>
            <li>I have tried several other similar products, but this one works nicely for my needs.</li>
            <li>This depletes the supply rather quickly and leaves a lot of solution on your tongue which is not very tasty.  </li>
            <li>Not long after starting it, I noticed healthier gums and had fresh breath.</li>
            <li>My last dental cleaning showed promising results.  </li>
            <li>Only&lt;br /&gt;Complaint is the after taste so far.</li>
            <li>She orders frequently because she says she doesn&#x27;t want to run out of it.</li>
            <li>Then you rinse for at least 30 seconds, the longer the better.  </li>
            <li>It fixed the area immediately</li>
            <li>I really like this product it takes a little getting used to as it has a very spicy taste.  </li>
            <li>Bottom line: As long as you take a toothbrush or towel to your teeth afterwards, this stuff is decent.</li>
            <li>Every few days as the volume and strength of the solution are reduced, add 5 drops of Peri-Gum and enough water to make a full 1/2 oz solution to restore the strength and volume.  </li>
    </ol>

            <li> It&#x27;s been several weeks and the tint is finally starting to fade after rinsing with hydrogen peroxide and trying other whitening methods.  </li>
            <li> Seller refused to refund my money but rather chose to direct me to what was supposedly the manufacturer in NJ, but a call to the number they provided resulted in dead silence.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I get a small flat dish/container, put several drops of Peri-Gum in it, drag my floss through the dish until the floss is coated  </li>
            <li> As expected.</li>
            <li> Not ready to give up on this stuff yet.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t throw the solution away each time, put it in a container that can be closed and reuse the solution.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m truly surprised there&#x27;s not more reviews that mention the teeth, tongue, dental filling, and sink discoloration that can happen!!??</li>
            <li> After my lips heal, I&#x27;m going to try diluting it by half the recommended amount and see if it still works on my gums.  </li>
            <li> Half a dozen of them!  </li>
            <li> It has a very slight taste of pepper which probable eradicate any virus or bacteria in the mouth.</li>
            <li> Oral surgery for just one small area cost me $3100.  </li>
            <li> I was using it at the least concentrated amount recommended on the bottle.  </li>
            <li> I could feel the tingling sensation for at least 5 mins after I was done.  </li>
            <li> As for the staining others complained about, I rinse the sink immediately with water, no stains.  </li>
            <li> Gum surgery is worse for you than the reason it is prescribed..  </li>
            <li> I guess its performance capability is grossly exaggerated to sell the product.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, this Peri-Gum also gives me really painful cold sores all over my lips!</li>
            <li> Hoping it will help my bad gums.</li>
            <li> Awful!  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> VERY GREAT FOR TEETH AND GUMS.</li>
            <li> I had sore gums, bought this stuff. used it a couple of times. And my gums are fine now.</li>
            <li> As expected. Taste is okay. Hoping it will help my bad gums. Will update after my next dental visit.</li>
            <li> Peri-Gum dis-colored not only my teeth but my white sink as well.  My normally very white teeth became streaked with a reddish-brown tint.  Awful!  It&#x27;s been several weeks and the tint is finally starting to fade after rinsing with hydrogen peroxide and trying other whitening methods.  Seller refused to refund my money but rather chose to direct me to what was supposedly the manufacturer in NJ, but a call to the number they provided resulted in dead silence.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Be warned!</li>
            <li> Definitely can see improvement with my gums. Will continue to use this product. Cant wait for my next dentist appt.</li>
            <li> excellent product and delivery time....Larry Kinnett</li>
            <li> I really like this product it takes a little getting used to as it has a very spicy taste.  I use this along with a no glycerin mouth wash and some water, rinse twice a day.  I also brush only with soap so my gums are looking nice and pink for a 56 year old.</li>
            <li> My husband has problems with his gums gingivitis, he uses it and he loves it. I have had irritation of my gum at times and also have used it works great. definitely recommend this product to others.</li>
            <li> My last dental cleaning showed promising results.  I will continue to use this product.</li>
            <li> Came very fast. So far so good. Hasn&#x27;t made my teeth brown like everyone was saying. Only&lt;br /&gt;Complaint is the after taste so far.</li>
            <li> I inquired at two different health food stores for Peri-Gum Mouthwash Concentrate. They didn&#x27;t carry it and had never heard of it! This is the second bottle that I have purchased. I brush my teeth with it then gargle. My mouth feels clean, fresh and healthy.</li>
            <li> my teeth and gums are not hurting as much. I feel its really helping me maintain my gum health.</li>
            <li> Was delivered as promised. I find it to be a great addition to natural health regimen. Great performance. I like it and uses it daily.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my gums and found it is&lt;br /&gt;The best mouth wash.  If you drink red&lt;br /&gt;Wine it will clean your tongue and make&lt;br /&gt;It pink and healthy.  You can feel it&lt;br /&gt;Working. No medicine after taste  your&lt;br /&gt;Breath smells like cinnamon  Love this&lt;br /&gt;Product</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had good results over a long period of time; no worsening of my gum line. It  definitely beats gum surgery.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Peri-Gum for about a year. Not long after starting it, I noticed healthier gums and had fresh breath. Receding gums have stabilized. Dental check-ups have been great! I highly recommend Peri-Gum.</li>
            <li> This Peri-Gum concentrate, plus peppermint-flavored Tooth Soap shreds (also sold on Amazon), works really well to repair my receding gums around a molar that suffered trauma and damage to the surrounding bone.  My dentist is amazed and so am I.  Unfortunately, this Peri-Gum also gives me really painful cold sores all over my lips! Half a dozen of them!  It&#x27;s the hot pepper in it.  I was using it at the least concentrated amount recommended on the bottle.  After my lips heal, I&#x27;m going to try diluting it by half the recommended amount and see if it still works on my gums.  Not ready to give up on this stuff yet.  I&#x27;ll let you know if I have any success with it. By the way, I heard about this stuff in a book called Good Teeth, Birth to Death: The Prescription for Perfect Teeth, by a Dr. Judd.</li>
            <li> Order fulfillment was great.  Product seems great but it will take several months of use to see its full effectiveness.</li>
            <li> Just started using this and hope it will do the job.</li>
            <li> There are areas that my gums are receding so I decided to try Peri-Gum.  just started using it this week so it&#x27;s obviously too soon to tell if it works. This is the reason for only 4 stars.  My sister has been using it for a while and LOVES it!  She orders frequently because she says she doesn&#x27;t want to run out of it. The way I&#x27;ve started to use it is on my dental floss after I brush.  I get a small flat dish/container, put several drops of Peri-Gum in it, drag my floss through the dish until the floss is coated  and then I floss.  Wow!  This stuff is strong but I like the flavor of it...kind of like cloves.  I could feel the burning/tingling  up into my gums when I was done.  I don&#x27;t rinse but just spit out the residue that my be left in my mouth.  I will say my gums/mouth felt great after that....real clean.  I could feel the tingling sensation for at least 5 mins after I was done.  I&#x27;m crossing my fingers and will do another report in time.  Stay tuned.........</li>
            <li> I was told I needed a root canal. Started to use Peri-gum and what a difference it made. A year later NO root canal.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for about a year now, and can see some improvement in my receding gums...they&#x27;ve gotten a little better and definitely have not gotten worse.  My results would probably be even better if I was more consistent in my oral care.</li>
            <li> I just ordered my third bottle, and found that with regular use I am getting good results.  Have had some bleeding gums and after using the first bottle, I saw an improvement.  I found the taste to be pleasant, although it packs a hot kick, my mouth and breath feel very fresh and clean afterward.  As for the staining others complained about, I rinse the sink immediately with water, no stains.  If teeth show a discoloration, try a mix of baking soda with fresh lemon juice squeezed in, and brush teeth with it.  I have tried several other similar products, but this one works nicely for my needs.</li>
            <li> Product is used like a mouthwash. It has a very slight taste of pepper which probable eradicate any virus or bacteria in the mouth. It is slightly light brown in color which may stain teeth - however I did not see any noticable color difference in my teeth after using it. When I had a scratchy throat &amp; felt that I might be catching a cold, I gargled with this mouthwash and the scratchiness went away.</li>
            <li> This is a very good product for refreshing and keeping mouth fresh &amp; clean.&lt;br /&gt;After I read Kiss Your Dentist Goodbye - I&#x27;ve been using specificl products for my dental health, eating good and not going to the dentist.for 3 years. I have not had dental problems&lt;br /&gt;The shipping was very prompt. I&#x27;ll get this again.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks! Elizabeth</li>
            <li> Having got a Gum Abcess I had thought from reading supposed reviews that this product might be able to combat this problem. It has not. I guess its performance capability is grossly exaggerated to sell the product.</li>
            <li> my naturopath suggested this product and brand.  Gum surgery is worse for you than the reason it is prescribed..  Avoid any need and use this as directed.</li>
            <li> Tried this product as directed and after using not even half the bottle started feeling more sensitivity in my teeth. After stopping  this product the sensitivity went away. I will be asking for a refund on this product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m truly surprised there&#x27;s not more reviews that mention the teeth, tongue, dental filling, and sink discoloration that can happen!!?? The directions say to work up to 25 drops!? First of all that&#x27;s probably 1/3 of the bottle and second your teeth would be the nastiest shade of brown! I was only able to use about 5 drops diluted in water AND I immediately brushed my teeth afterwards(without toothpaste). It brushed right off my teeth but forever stained my fillings. It also left my cup that I was mixing it in stained! On the bright side, my mouth felt so clean after using it and that&#x27;s the sole reason I finished the bottle . There&#x27;s something about that tingly, spicy feeling it left in my mouth. This isn&#x27;t a miracle worker and it WILL NOT bring back your gum line. It might prevent further recession by killing bacteria. Bottom line: As long as you take a toothbrush or towel to your teeth afterwards, this stuff is decent.</li>
            <li> I have no way of knowing whether it works or not until I&#x27;ve used it for awhile longer. It takes several months of use.</li>
            <li> This is my wife&#x27;s second bottle and her gums feel healthy.</li>
            <li> Second review:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is my second review.  The product does work, it took 6-7 weeks to notice the improvement in how it reverses gum recession but it does.  This was my second order.  Also found out there is a more efficient way to use it.  The recommended way is to start with 5 drops of Peri-Gum in 1/2 oz of water and work up to be able to put 25 drops in  1/2 oz of water.  Then you rinse for at least 30 seconds, the longer the better.  This depletes the supply rather quickly and leaves a lot of solution on your tongue which is not very tasty.  A better and more economical way is to put the 25 drops in 1/2 oz of water and instead of rinsing, use a Q tip to swab the gum line thoroughly twice a day.  Don&#x27;t throw the solution away each time, put it in a container that can be closed and reuse the solution.  Every few days as the volume and strength of the solution are reduced, add 5 drops of Peri-Gum and enough water to make a full 1/2 oz solution to restore the strength and volume.  Of course the more severe the gum recession the longer it will take to restore the gum line.  I had areas with mild and severe recession.  After 7 weeks, the mild areas are just about completely restored and I can definitely see the improvement in the severe areas.  Oral surgery for just one small area cost me $3100.  It fixed the area immediately but I am quite willing for it to take longer by using the Per-Gum treatment in other areas and enjoy the immense cost savings.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just a tip that I didn&#x27;t think of - Take a picture of the before so you can enjoy the after look.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hope you have the same results if you try the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First review:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The jury is still out on its effectiveness.  I ordered 2 more bottles and continue to monitor the progress.  It seems to be working.  I am trying to avoid having periodontal surgery.  I will review again in a month or so.</li>
            <li> Seems to be working.  Makes your gums tingle from the hot pepper extract.</li>
