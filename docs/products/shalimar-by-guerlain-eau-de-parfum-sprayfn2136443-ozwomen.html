            <li>She loved the product.</li>
            <li>A good buy.</li>
            <li>I did research on it on the internet though and wanted it because my boyfriend likes vanilla scent in perfume and supposedly this was a good perfume for that.  </li>
            <li>This is one of the oldest most beautiful parfumerie ever made.</li>
            <li>Shalimar was created in 1921 as a tribute to the legendary love story between Emperor Shahjahan and his wife Muntaz Mahal meaning the &amp;#34;Jewell of the Palace.&amp;#34;  Emperor Shahjahan built the Taj Mahal in memory of his wife and their undying love.  </li>
            <li>Service was great and price is more than fair.</li>
            <li>It is a very sexy scent that lures me every time she wears it.  </li>
            <li>My wife was very pleased to receive the Shalimar for Christmas.</li>
            <li>I was very pleased with the produce ..</li>
            <li>Very satisfied, I recommend, Grateful.</li>
            <li>My mom uses it and the bottle is very elegant.</li>
            <li>My favorite perfume since the 1970&#x27;s!  </li>
            <li>Absolutely love this!  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s my wife&#x27;s favorite perfume!</li>
            <li>Love this fragrance!</li>
            <li>Prompt delivery and the product was outstanding!</li>
            <li>This is my favorite!  </li>
            <li>My Mom was very happy, arrived on time and was exactly as advertised.</li>
            <li>However, they were able to ship the &amp;#34;hazardous material&amp;#34; to me!  </li>
            <li>My favorite perfume for years!  </li>
            <li>Why is this like soooo much more $$$ in sephora/macys?!?</li>
            <li>Have to use it more sparingly!</li>
            <li>Very happy to find a large bottle of Shalimar at this price.  </li>
            <li>This was an amazing value compared to what we have been paying at Nordstrom.</li>
            <li>I thought it smelled nice.</li>
            <li>beloved bride of two score years declares this genuine!</li>
            <li>as good as I remembered, purchesed some for my girlfriend more than fourty years ago</li>
            <li>Surprisingly, I discovered that I, too, still find it to be a favorite.</li>
            <li>The person I gave it to was thrilled to receive it.  </li>
            <li>fragrance falls nowhere in the category of trendy celebrity/current designer&#x27;s fruitchouli, peaches/bubblegum/heady flower</li>
            <li>Nice</li>
            <li>The packaging was excellent and delivery was lightning fast.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the truth that it&#x27;s hazardous.</li>
            <li>My absolute favorite!!!!  </li>
            <li>and my wife liked it.</li>
            <li>Like the savvy disorder of rumpled silk sheets, powdery notes of iris, jasmine and rose suggest or promise sensual embraces.</li>
            <li>One of my favorites; very costly in the dept. stores; this was a great solution for me!</li>
            <li>Love, love, love it!!</li>
            <li>This is a wonderful, classic scent that can become your signature... if you can wear it.</li>
            <li>Very strong scented (in the beginning), it smells nice but the scent begins to fade.</li>
            <li>I love this Shalimar Parfum spray, I used it for over 40 years, and I am very glad that you carry it.</li>
            <li>I think the size for the value is great and the same great fragrance that I have always loved with Shalimar.</li>
            <li>Great price, arrived quickly, and was the &amp;#34;real thing&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>SMELLS GREAT AND A VERY PRETTY BOTTLE.</li>
            <li>Has a nice exotic aroma............</li>
            <li>BECAUSE SO MANY PEOPLE HAVE COMPLIMENTED ME ON HOW BEAUTIFUL THIS LOVELY TRUE SCENT SMELLS ON MY BODY TYPE...</li>
            <li>However, one of my most favorite role models and most loved people, my Aunt, swears by this perfume.</li>
            <li>&gt; hundred percent original and a good price</li>
            <li>Thanks for the good buy!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never found anything that smells as good as this since the first day I discovered it 50 years ago, amazing as that may seem.</li>
            <li>Good products, quick deliveries.  </li>
            <li>My wife and I love this parfum  </li>
            <li>bought for my daughter, we both love Shalimar.</li>
            <li>Love this fragrance.</li>
            <li>This will definitely be my perfume from hereon!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks for handling a great product!  </li>
            <li>Love it have worn it for 40 years.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>This is still my husbands favorite scent, and I hadn&#x27;t worn it in years when my husband suggested I buy it again.</li>
            <li>:)</li>
            <li>pleased with purchase.  </li>
            <li>It blooms and morphs and each facet is entirely lovely.</li>
            <li>The scent is divine but my love for it goes deeper than that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>what is in this scent that creates that magic.</li>
            <li>If you are used to buying perfume only once a year, like I was for Christmas, than this is perfect surprise to your spouse.  </li>
            <li>Truly a luxury fragrance that will repay itself to you many times over.  </li>
            <li>Even if I added the requisite amount on top of the cost of the fragrance, one must still pay shipping on the fragrance.</li>
            <li>So it would be nice to count on the free shipping justification.</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t sure this perfume was going to smell like I remember it from years ago.</li>
            <li>Always my favorite fragrance.</li>
            <li>This is the top of the line for me.  </li>
            <li>I was pleased with the price and service.</li>
            <li>and I fall in love all over again.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve read the reviews and it&#x27;s a top selling fragrance, but did I get a &amp;#34;altered&amp;#34; scent?</li>
            <li>I thought it would smell way better.  </li>
            <li>and I am enjoying it a lot .I</li>
            <li>This is my favorite and I just love it.</li>
            <li>Have worn this fragrance for many, many years.</li>
            <li>It is clearly more potent and lasts longer than the eau de toilette (which must be what I had before).</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>AND ALWAYS SMELLS SO LOVELY.</li>
            <li>It was Muntaz&#x27;s favorite garden.</li>

            <li>I know it is not old and the fragrance is wonderful.  </li>

            <li>It was delivered when promised, which was much earlier than originally suggested, and in excellent condition.</li>
            <li>It has a fabulous, intoxicating, sexy aroma.</li>
            <li>This is my first bottle of Shalimar, and I am very pleased with it.  </li>
            <li>Maybe what is good for me isnt what someone else wants......</li>
            <li>Though I am familiar with most of the notes, I have no idea</li>
            <li>Still, I am pleased and the scent IS the Shalimar original.  </li>
            <li>It has the most distinct fragrance that I have enjoyed for years.  </li>
            <li>It makes an easy gift giving opportunity for my husband or daughters.</li>
            <li>Strong bug spray</li>
            <li>I strongly believe that this product has been diluted.</li>
            <li>Good price for classic fragrance.</li>
            <li>And, this is supposed to be a classic, good perfume.  </li>
            <li>Awwww, how sweet it is to have it again.  </li>
            <li>and I have had to move into the perfume where before the Eau de Tiolette had been fine.</li>
            <li>is a fine perfume.</li>
            <li>and I was glad it was authentic and not a fake</li>
            <li>Nice sized bottle that will last me for awhile... love it!  </li>
            <li>Great price for this classic perfume and exactly as advertised.</li>
            <li>it is HUGE, and eau de parfum and not the weaker eau de cologne.</li>
            <li>I always brought back Joy, Chloe, Shalimar, Opium, and Chanel #5 for my sisters.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s awesome to wear it everyday...</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t used this parfum in a while and was happy to get back to it.  </li>
            <li>This has been our primary perfume for over 25 years.  </li>
            <li>It smooth, spicy, and creamy.</li>
            <li>Si I asked them what it was, and was told it was Shalimar Perfume by Guerlain, and that it was available in the Guerlain store on the Champs Elysee.</li>
            <li>Arrived securely packaged and on time.  </li>
            <li>When my wife lightly sprays herself, wherever part of the house</li>
            <li>I recommend getting a sample first, but if it&#x27;s for you,l you&#x27;ll love it.</li>
            <li>Wish they’d re-issue their original version, though.</li>
            <li>Original</li>
            <li>don&#x27;t smell like the original.</li>
            <li>This is the original Shalimar and my wife just loves it.</li>
            <li>and I was not disappointed with this purchase.  </li>
            <li>Shalimar is one of the top ten perfumes in the world and always makes the list of the ten best.</li>
            <li>It is completely non offensive, elegant, sophisticated in an understated way.</li>
            <li>oriental voluptuous, sensual, spellbinding Tonic top notes of fresh flowers and bergamot are calmly intrepid.</li>
            <li>, clean and fibrant.</li>
            <li>BUT YOU LOOSE SOME AND WIN SOME</li>
            <li>nothing special...</li>
            <li>The price was right !</li>
            <li>Priced just right too!</li>
            <li>My favorite, a classic!</li>
            <li>Thanks :)</li>
            <li>This parfum has been around for many years and there is no substitute for the real thing.</li>
            <li>This is still my favorite scent to wear, and I get a lot of compliments from people who hug me, but I don&#x27;t think others get the scent unless very close.</li>
            <li>The Parfum is the only way to go the cheaper cologne spray just does not smell as good.</li>
            <li>WHAT I WAS WEARING AND GIVING THE TRUE NORDSTROMS &amp;#34;SHALIMAR&amp;#34;  </li>
            <li>We are purchasing at a great savings, but remember these products are old, some very old...</li>
            <li>I am a huge fan of Shalimar and I was so excited that this smells exactly like mine purchased in a department store.</li>
            <li>My favorite classic fragrance.</li>
            <li>Shalimar, a classic, need one say more.</li>
            <li>Very pleased overall!</li>
            <li>My wife loves this product - hence, so do I. Shalimar has been around for a long time; for good reason.  </li>
            <li>Exactly what I wanted for my sweetheart!</li>
            <li>I never fail to get compliments, when I am wearing Shalimar!</li>
            <li>I am talking about pure rose oil and loud floral perfumes like Anais Anais by Cacharel.</li>
            <li>I rarely see or hear of Shalimar anymore.  </li>
            <li>Or, how to smell like vanilla and sandalwood and eastern spice and be elegant and not smell like a patchoulied up old hippie.</li>
            <li>her face was worth the price.  </li>
            <li>It would be nice to know what it smelled like way back when.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s ok if you like to smell like old ladies and funeral parlors.</li>
            <li>and I found it to be more of a masculine, vintage scent.</li>
            <li>My wife has used this perfume for most of her life and is now 73 years old</li>
            <li>And, Amazon won&#x27;t take it back because it is considered a hazardous material.  </li>
            <li>... BE CAREFUL, AND I WISH YOU GOOD LUCK IN YOUR CHOICE...  </li>
            <li>I feel like a really powerful woman when I wear it.</li>
            <li>Please check these little things better!!</li>
            <li>Beautiful, classic, mysterious as always; different, unusual, one of the most highly intriguing fragrances of all times.</li>
            <li>It is a senior scent if this is the right formula.</li>
            <li>The one I had previously was better, this one is just okay.  </li>
            <li>As many have stated the new is not the same as original, This is the original fragrance.</li>
            <li>It is not cheap, but this was the best deal I found after checking out numerous places.</li>
            <li>There used to be a bigger variety available with the free shipping incentive.</li>
            <li>it arrived quickly, and, much to my surprise, in plenty of time for Mother&#x27;s Day surprise.</li>
            <li>I could find no choice in my other favorite, Samsara, to purchase with the free shipping option.</li>
            <li>This latest iteration is not as strong as the previous</li>
            <li>As a man I can simply say I love the scent of it on her day and night.</li>
            <li>Same thing here - love the fragrance as much today as I did 50 years ago!</li>
            <li>Fast delivery too!  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the real stuff people!</li>
            <li>VERY!</li>
            <li>She was one of the first people (and a woman at that) in my family to get a college education.</li>
            <li>little history behind Shalimar:  Shalimar is one of the best selling perfumes ever and its magic is undeniable.  </li>
            <li>At first I was - I admit - very cautious about this purchase because it is anyway, a Guerlain fragrance.</li>
            <li>It is my favorite of all time and lasts a long time on the skin.  </li>
            <li>(though I personally loved and wore it as a teen when it was not a vogue scent amongst my peers)It is a scent for a mature woman without being musty, old, overly powdery.</li>
            <li>I just moved here from a large city</li>
            <li>All she ever wants is Shalimar for any and every occasion.</li>
            <li>VERY HEDDY.  </li>
            <li>MUCH HEAVIER SCENT THAN THE TOILETTE THAT</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re tired of smelling like a fruity citrusy teenager, it&#x27;s time you ventured into one of the top 10 elegant perfumes of modern time.</li>
            <li>This is real.</li>
            <li>Purchased it for my wife for her birthday but really for me, it excites me when I smell it on her.</li>
            <li>You cannot beat real quality.</li>
            <li>This one is the real deal.  </li>
            <li>the gentle aroma defines who I am per the words of friends who say when they smell Shalimar they remember me.  </li>
            <li>was extremely fast, used Prime.</li>
            <li>This item arrived promptly and was packaged very well.  </li>
            <li>The fragrance fades very rapidly.</li>
            <li>And buying it at Amazon really saved me a lot of $ rather than a department store.</li>
            <li>If you have been wearing Shalimar, you know that you have yourself a real bottle.</li>
            <li>ONE OF MY VERY FAVORITES-LOVE IT</li>
            <li>Much prefer this to Channel.</li>
            <li>so I will try to fix the problem myself, but is very dissapointing...</li>
            <li>Wife says that it was not the real stuff.</li>
            <li>I would check with that vendor to insure people are getting the real Shalimar.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t have a real sense of what I was getting for the 3 oz.</li>
            <li>and it is the real thing.  </li>
            <li>Fast delivery.</li>
            <li>fast shipping- thank you</li>
            <li>, it just might keep me from getting something I really want.</li>
            <li>I ordered it because I live in a small town and there are no stores nearby that sell good perfumes</li>
            <li>and they were so cheap over there, never bought anything less than full strength perfume, never edt, cologne, etc...</li>
            <li>Classic fragrance and classic Amazon service!</li>
            <li>She received two other fragrances, but she said that the Shalimar was her favorite.</li>
            <li>This is my favorite perfume and the price from this company is extremely competitive.  </li>
            <li>I also like Guerlain la petite robe noir, and angel, and although not too similar to those, clean skin.</li>
            <li>my wifes very favorite scent, barely lasts a year, but beats the price at local malls and department stores for the same size.  </li>
            <li>The Shalim,ar was far higher quality</li>
            <li>It is still a hot selling classic since it&#x27;s debut in the early 1900&#x27;s.</li>
            <li>It is a little sweet but the spicy factor makes it so that it isn&#x27;t so sweet that the Mosquitos will seek you out.</li>
            <li>The Perfume arrived very quickly and was just as I expected it to be.</li>
            <li>It smells a lot like Chantilly but a lot less citrusy and with more vanilla.</li>
            <li>A classic.</li>
            <li>It is a classic fragrance, that I adore.</li>
            <li>Smells like a cheaper perfume for an older lady.  </li>
            <li>this fragrance is fantastic  when I was single in the navy traveling Europe</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this vendor.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>I have worn Shalimar since I was in high school and have always gotten compliments on it.  </li>
            <li>is a high quality product which I recommend.</li>
            <li>so I normally would have gone to a perfume counter and sampled before I bought.  </li>
            <li>We have a new perfume supplier.</li>
            <li>when I got this bottle, I was expecting a smaller bottle and when I pulled this one out when it arrived it was huge compared to the tiny ones you buy in the store.</li>
            <li>Although I can clearly tell it is a high quality product, it is not for me.</li>
            <li>Exactly as promised, packaged properly, delivered promptly!</li>
            <li>Scent lasts all night long and not too powerful.  </li>
            <li>I have used Shalimar, since receiving my first bottle as a birthday present, when I was 16.</li>
            <li>So the next day I was first in line, there were a lot of people lined up to get into the store, and when the door was opened to let me in, I bought a 3 ounce bottle of perfume for a thousand Francs ($20).</li>
            <li>product is great but the bottle was open and the contents of the bottle was half not a full bottle</li>
            <li>and you use the torch to make the hard caramel top.</li>
            <li>Glad to see that you carried this parfum, hard to find in department stores.  </li>
            <li>What a huge waste of money.</li>
            <li>The creamy softness of addictive vanilla, the penetrating charm of iris, the balmy roundness of opoponax and the gourmand warmth of Tonka bean orchestrate an intimate symphony of scent for languorous interludes.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>but she pass away when I was 19 years old, so</li>
            <li>so Soft.</li>
            <li>I feel like an old maid wearing this.</li>
            <li>It was delivered early.</li>
            <li>This is definitely a knock off of the real thing.  </li>
            <li>It seems to be compatible with my natural scent,  </li>
            <li>She is 62 yrs young.</li>
            <li>What do you say about a perfume that&#x27;s been around for nearly a century?</li>
            <li>perfume by Philosophy for a few years due to the fact that it was a lot more reasonable.  </li>
            <li>To each their own but love it or hate it, there is no other that compares to the mystery and majesty of The Divine Guerlain Shalimar.</li>
            <li>I never tire of the soft, subtle, powdery vanilla scent and have received many compliments on my scent over the years.</li>
            <li>Such an oriental classic.</li>
            <li>I used to wear this in High School back in the 70&#x27;s.</li>
            <li>It was exactly what I expected and arrived on time.</li>
            <li>It seems to be getting harder and harder to order these products and receive the free shipping.</li>
            <li>Getting at a price lower than at the &amp;#34;box&amp;#34; stores is a major plus.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>She has since, used no other perfume in our 70 years of marriage.</li>
            <li>I know it says this is genuine Shalimar, but I find that hard to believe.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s wonderful on my body chemistry, ive smelled it on others and hated it.</li>
            <li>Many fragrances have come and gone in the past half century, but this is a keeper.</li>
            <li>To make sure it lasts as long a possible, I put a thin layer of unscented lotion on my skin before applying the perfume.</li>
            <li>I knew was real and was devastated when they didn&#x27;t smell the same, but after I shook the bottle up a bit, sprayed it twice, and let it settle for a half hour or so, it smelled the same as the tester.</li>
            <li>I used a less expensive similar alternative, but it was eventually discontinued and I came back to my beloved Shalimar.</li>
            <li>so glad i got a sample before ordering a large bottle.&lt;br /&gt;Smells like bad breath...</li>

            <li> I did research on it on the internet though and wanted it because my boyfriend likes vanilla scent in perfume and supposedly this was a good perfume for that.  </li>
            <li> This is one of the oldest most beautiful parfumerie ever made.</li>
            <li> Shalimar was created in 1921 as a tribute to the legendary love story between Emperor Shahjahan and his wife Muntaz Mahal meaning the &amp;#34;Jewell of the Palace.&amp;#34;  Emperor Shahjahan built the Taj Mahal in memory of his wife and their undying love.  </li>

            <li> Prompt delivery and the product was outstanding!</li>
            <li> This is my favorite!  </li>
            <li> My Mom was very happy, arrived on time and was exactly as advertised.</li>
            <li> However, they were able to ship the &amp;#34;hazardous material&amp;#34; to me!  </li>
            <li> My favorite perfume for years!  </li>
            <li> Why is this like soooo much more $$$ in sephora/macys?!?</li>
            <li> Have to use it more sparingly!</li>
            <li> Very happy to find a large bottle of Shalimar at this price.  </li>
            <li> This was an amazing value compared to what we have been paying at Nordstrom.</li>
            <li> I thought it smelled nice.</li>
            <li> beloved bride of two score years declares this genuine!</li>
            <li> as good as I remembered, purchesed some for my girlfriend more than fourty years ago</li>
            <li> Surprisingly, I discovered that I, too, still find it to be a favorite.</li>
            <li> The person I gave it to was thrilled to receive it.  </li>
            <li> fragrance falls nowhere in the category of trendy celebrity/current designer&#x27;s fruitchouli, peaches/bubblegum/heady flower</li>
            <li> Nice</li>
            <li> The packaging was excellent and delivery was lightning fast.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the truth that it&#x27;s hazardous.</li>
            <li> My absolute favorite!!!!  </li>
            <li> and my wife liked it.</li>
            <li> Like the savvy disorder of rumpled silk sheets, powdery notes of iris, jasmine and rose suggest or promise sensual embraces.</li>
            <li> One of my favorites; very costly in the dept. stores; this was a great solution for me!</li>
            <li> Love, love, love it!!</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful, classic scent that can become your signature... if you can wear it.</li>
            <li> Very strong scented (in the beginning), it smells nice but the scent begins to fade.</li>
            <li> I love this Shalimar Parfum spray, I used it for over 40 years, and I am very glad that you carry it.</li>
            <li> I think the size for the value is great and the same great fragrance that I have always loved with Shalimar.</li>
            <li> Great price, arrived quickly, and was the &amp;#34;real thing&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> SMELLS GREAT AND A VERY PRETTY BOTTLE.</li>
            <li> Has a nice exotic aroma............</li>
            <li> BECAUSE SO MANY PEOPLE HAVE COMPLIMENTED ME ON HOW BEAUTIFUL THIS LOVELY TRUE SCENT SMELLS ON MY BODY TYPE...</li>
            <li> However, one of my most favorite role models and most loved people, my Aunt, swears by this perfume.</li>
            <li> &gt; hundred percent original and a good price</li>
            <li> Thanks for the good buy!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never found anything that smells as good as this since the first day I discovered it 50 years ago, amazing as that may seem.</li>
            <li> Good products, quick deliveries.  </li>
            <li> My wife and I love this parfum  </li>

            <li> This is still my husbands favorite scent, and I hadn&#x27;t worn it in years when my husband suggested I buy it again.</li>
            <li> :)</li>
            <li> pleased with purchase.  </li>
            <li> It blooms and morphs and each facet is entirely lovely.</li>
            <li> The scent is divine but my love for it goes deeper than that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> what is in this scent that creates that magic.</li>
            <li> If you are used to buying perfume only once a year, like I was for Christmas, than this is perfect surprise to your spouse.  </li>
            <li> Truly a luxury fragrance that will repay itself to you many times over.  </li>
            <li> Even if I added the requisite amount on top of the cost of the fragrance, one must still pay shipping on the fragrance.</li>
            <li> So it would be nice to count on the free shipping justification.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure this perfume was going to smell like I remember it from years ago.</li>
            <li> Always my favorite fragrance.</li>
            <li> This is the top of the line for me.  </li>
            <li> I was pleased with the price and service.</li>
            <li> and I fall in love all over again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve read the reviews and it&#x27;s a top selling fragrance, but did I get a &amp;#34;altered&amp;#34; scent?</li>
            <li> I thought it would smell way better.  </li>
            <li> and I am enjoying it a lot .I</li>
            <li> This is my favorite and I just love it.</li>
            <li> Have worn this fragrance for many, many years.</li>
            <li> It is clearly more potent and lasts longer than the eau de toilette (which must be what I had before).</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> AND ALWAYS SMELLS SO LOVELY.</li>
            <li> It was Muntaz&#x27;s favorite garden.</li>

            <li> I love the smell of vanilla sandlewood candles and that is what this fragrance reminds me alot of.  </li>
            <li> I see why it has been around for so many years.  </li>
            <li> The scent is  lovely,  </li>
            <li> This is my wife&#x27;s favorite perfume.  </li>
            <li> I look up to her and wanted to buy her favorite perfume.</li>
            <li> I have been wearing this perfume for 30+ years; it is one of my favorite scents.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s very unique.  </li>
            <li> (the price is pretty good, too)</li>
            <li> I know it is not old and the fragrance is wonderful.  </li>
            <li> since then I did not stop buying this marvelous and fine french perfume.</li>
            <li> It is a great product, big size and amazing prize for the size of the bottle.  </li>
            <li> arrived swiftly and product just as I remembered it delighted to find such a good deal</li>
            <li> Thanks for having this great item available to us.</li>
            <li> It was delivered when promised, which was much earlier than originally suggested, and in excellent condition.</li>
            <li> It has a fabulous, intoxicating, sexy aroma.</li>
            <li> This is my first bottle of Shalimar, and I am very pleased with it.  </li>
            <li> Maybe what is good for me isnt what someone else wants......</li>
            <li> Though I am familiar with most of the notes, I have no idea</li>
            <li> Still, I am pleased and the scent IS the Shalimar original.  </li>
            <li> It has the most distinct fragrance that I have enjoyed for years.  </li>
            <li> It makes an easy gift giving opportunity for my husband or daughters.</li>
            <li> Strong bug spray</li>
            <li> I strongly believe that this product has been diluted.</li>
            <li> Good price for classic fragrance.</li>
            <li> And, this is supposed to be a classic, good perfume.  </li>
            <li> Awwww, how sweet it is to have it again.  </li>
            <li> and I have had to move into the perfume where before the Eau de Tiolette had been fine.</li>
            <li> is a fine perfume.</li>
            <li> and I was glad it was authentic and not a fake</li>
            <li> Nice sized bottle that will last me for awhile... love it!  </li>
            <li> Great price for this classic perfume and exactly as advertised.</li>
            <li> it is HUGE, and eau de parfum and not the weaker eau de cologne.</li>
            <li> I always brought back Joy, Chloe, Shalimar, Opium, and Chanel #5 for my sisters.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s awesome to wear it everyday...</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used this parfum in a while and was happy to get back to it.  </li>
            <li> This has been our primary perfume for over 25 years.  </li>
            <li> It smooth, spicy, and creamy.</li>
            <li> Si I asked them what it was, and was told it was Shalimar Perfume by Guerlain, and that it was available in the Guerlain store on the Champs Elysee.</li>
            <li> Arrived securely packaged and on time.  </li>
            <li> When my wife lightly sprays herself, wherever part of the house</li>
            <li> I recommend getting a sample first, but if it&#x27;s for you,l you&#x27;ll love it.</li>
            <li> Wish they’d re-issue their original version, though.</li>
            <li> Original</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t smell like the original.</li>
            <li> This is the original Shalimar and my wife just loves it.</li>
            <li> and I was not disappointed with this purchase.  </li>
            <li> Shalimar is one of the top ten perfumes in the world and always makes the list of the ten best.</li>
            <li> It is completely non offensive, elegant, sophisticated in an understated way.</li>
            <li> oriental voluptuous, sensual, spellbinding Tonic top notes of fresh flowers and bergamot are calmly intrepid.</li>
            <li> , clean and fibrant.</li>
            <li> BUT YOU LOOSE SOME AND WIN SOME</li>
            <li> nothing special...</li>
            <li> The price was right !</li>
            <li> Priced just right too!</li>
            <li> My favorite, a classic!</li>
            <li> Thanks :)</li>
            <li> This parfum has been around for many years and there is no substitute for the real thing.</li>
            <li> This is still my favorite scent to wear, and I get a lot of compliments from people who hug me, but I don&#x27;t think others get the scent unless very close.</li>
            <li> The Parfum is the only way to go the cheaper cologne spray just does not smell as good.</li>
            <li> WHAT I WAS WEARING AND GIVING THE TRUE NORDSTROMS &amp;#34;SHALIMAR&amp;#34;  </li>
            <li> We are purchasing at a great savings, but remember these products are old, some very old...</li>
            <li> I am a huge fan of Shalimar and I was so excited that this smells exactly like mine purchased in a department store.</li>
            <li> My favorite classic fragrance.</li>
            <li> Shalimar, a classic, need one say more.</li>
            <li> Very pleased overall!</li>
            <li> My wife loves this product - hence, so do I. Shalimar has been around for a long time; for good reason.  </li>
            <li> Exactly what I wanted for my sweetheart!</li>
            <li> I never fail to get compliments, when I am wearing Shalimar!</li>
            <li> I am talking about pure rose oil and loud floral perfumes like Anais Anais by Cacharel.</li>
            <li> I rarely see or hear of Shalimar anymore.  </li>
            <li> Or, how to smell like vanilla and sandalwood and eastern spice and be elegant and not smell like a patchoulied up old hippie.</li>
            <li> her face was worth the price.  </li>
            <li> It would be nice to know what it smelled like way back when.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ok if you like to smell like old ladies and funeral parlors.</li>
            <li> and I found it to be more of a masculine, vintage scent.</li>
            <li> My wife has used this perfume for most of her life and is now 73 years old</li>
            <li> And, Amazon won&#x27;t take it back because it is considered a hazardous material.  </li>
            <li> ... BE CAREFUL, AND I WISH YOU GOOD LUCK IN YOUR CHOICE...  </li>
            <li> I feel like a really powerful woman when I wear it.</li>
            <li> Please check these little things better!!</li>
            <li> Beautiful, classic, mysterious as always; different, unusual, one of the most highly intriguing fragrances of all times.</li>
            <li> It is a senior scent if this is the right formula.</li>
            <li> The one I had previously was better, this one is just okay.  </li>
            <li> As many have stated the new is not the same as original, This is the original fragrance.</li>
            <li> It is not cheap, but this was the best deal I found after checking out numerous places.</li>
            <li> There used to be a bigger variety available with the free shipping incentive.</li>
            <li> it arrived quickly, and, much to my surprise, in plenty of time for Mother&#x27;s Day surprise.</li>
            <li> I could find no choice in my other favorite, Samsara, to purchase with the free shipping option.</li>
            <li> This latest iteration is not as strong as the previous</li>
            <li> As a man I can simply say I love the scent of it on her day and night.</li>
            <li> Same thing here - love the fragrance as much today as I did 50 years ago!</li>
            <li> Fast delivery too!  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the real stuff people!</li>
            <li> VERY!</li>
            <li> She was one of the first people (and a woman at that) in my family to get a college education.</li>
            <li> little history behind Shalimar:  Shalimar is one of the best selling perfumes ever and its magic is undeniable.  </li>
            <li> At first I was - I admit - very cautious about this purchase because it is anyway, a Guerlain fragrance.</li>
            <li> It is my favorite of all time and lasts a long time on the skin.  </li>
            <li> (though I personally loved and wore it as a teen when it was not a vogue scent amongst my peers)It is a scent for a mature woman without being musty, old, overly powdery.</li>
            <li> I just moved here from a large city</li>
            <li> All she ever wants is Shalimar for any and every occasion.</li>
            <li> VERY HEDDY.  </li>
            <li> MUCH HEAVIER SCENT THAN THE TOILETTE THAT</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re tired of smelling like a fruity citrusy teenager, it&#x27;s time you ventured into one of the top 10 elegant perfumes of modern time.</li>
            <li> This is real.</li>
            <li> Purchased it for my wife for her birthday but really for me, it excites me when I smell it on her.</li>
            <li> You cannot beat real quality.</li>
            <li> This one is the real deal.  </li>
            <li> the gentle aroma defines who I am per the words of friends who say when they smell Shalimar they remember me.  </li>
            <li> was extremely fast, used Prime.</li>
            <li> This item arrived promptly and was packaged very well.  </li>
            <li> The fragrance fades very rapidly.</li>
            <li> And buying it at Amazon really saved me a lot of $ rather than a department store.</li>
            <li> If you have been wearing Shalimar, you know that you have yourself a real bottle.</li>
            <li> ONE OF MY VERY FAVORITES-LOVE IT</li>
            <li> Much prefer this to Channel.</li>
            <li> so I will try to fix the problem myself, but is very dissapointing...</li>
            <li> Wife says that it was not the real stuff.</li>
            <li> I would check with that vendor to insure people are getting the real Shalimar.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t have a real sense of what I was getting for the 3 oz.</li>
            <li> and it is the real thing.  </li>
            <li> Fast delivery.</li>
            <li> fast shipping- thank you</li>
            <li> , it just might keep me from getting something I really want.</li>
            <li> I ordered it because I live in a small town and there are no stores nearby that sell good perfumes</li>
            <li> and they were so cheap over there, never bought anything less than full strength perfume, never edt, cologne, etc...</li>
            <li> Classic fragrance and classic Amazon service!</li>
            <li> She received two other fragrances, but she said that the Shalimar was her favorite.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite perfume and the price from this company is extremely competitive.  </li>
            <li> I also like Guerlain la petite robe noir, and angel, and although not too similar to those, clean skin.</li>
            <li> my wifes very favorite scent, barely lasts a year, but beats the price at local malls and department stores for the same size.  </li>
            <li> The Shalim,ar was far higher quality</li>
            <li> It is still a hot selling classic since it&#x27;s debut in the early 1900&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> It is a little sweet but the spicy factor makes it so that it isn&#x27;t so sweet that the Mosquitos will seek you out.</li>
            <li> The Perfume arrived very quickly and was just as I expected it to be.</li>
            <li> It smells a lot like Chantilly but a lot less citrusy and with more vanilla.</li>
            <li> A classic.</li>
            <li> It is a classic fragrance, that I adore.</li>
            <li> Smells like a cheaper perfume for an older lady.  </li>
            <li> this fragrance is fantastic  when I was single in the navy traveling Europe</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this vendor.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I have worn Shalimar since I was in high school and have always gotten compliments on it.  </li>
            <li> is a high quality product which I recommend.</li>
            <li> so I normally would have gone to a perfume counter and sampled before I bought.  </li>
            <li> We have a new perfume supplier.</li>
            <li> when I got this bottle, I was expecting a smaller bottle and when I pulled this one out when it arrived it was huge compared to the tiny ones you buy in the store.</li>
            <li> Although I can clearly tell it is a high quality product, it is not for me.</li>
            <li> Exactly as promised, packaged properly, delivered promptly!</li>
            <li> Scent lasts all night long and not too powerful.  </li>
            <li> I have used Shalimar, since receiving my first bottle as a birthday present, when I was 16.</li>
            <li> So the next day I was first in line, there were a lot of people lined up to get into the store, and when the door was opened to let me in, I bought a 3 ounce bottle of perfume for a thousand Francs ($20).</li>
            <li> product is great but the bottle was open and the contents of the bottle was half not a full bottle</li>
            <li> and you use the torch to make the hard caramel top.</li>
            <li> Glad to see that you carried this parfum, hard to find in department stores.  </li>
            <li> What a huge waste of money.</li>
            <li> The creamy softness of addictive vanilla, the penetrating charm of iris, the balmy roundness of opoponax and the gourmand warmth of Tonka bean orchestrate an intimate symphony of scent for languorous interludes.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> but she pass away when I was 19 years old, so</li>
            <li> so Soft.</li>
            <li> I feel like an old maid wearing this.</li>
            <li> It was delivered early.</li>
            <li> This is definitely a knock off of the real thing.  </li>
            <li> It seems to be compatible with my natural scent,  </li>
            <li> She is 62 yrs young.</li>
            <li> What do you say about a perfume that&#x27;s been around for nearly a century?</li>
            <li> perfume by Philosophy for a few years due to the fact that it was a lot more reasonable.  </li>
            <li> To each their own but love it or hate it, there is no other that compares to the mystery and majesty of The Divine Guerlain Shalimar.</li>
            <li> I never tire of the soft, subtle, powdery vanilla scent and have received many compliments on my scent over the years.</li>
            <li> Such an oriental classic.</li>
            <li> I used to wear this in High School back in the 70&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> It was exactly what I expected and arrived on time.</li>
            <li> It seems to be getting harder and harder to order these products and receive the free shipping.</li>
            <li> Getting at a price lower than at the &amp;#34;box&amp;#34; stores is a major plus.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> She has since, used no other perfume in our 70 years of marriage.</li>
            <li> I know it says this is genuine Shalimar, but I find that hard to believe.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s wonderful on my body chemistry, ive smelled it on others and hated it.</li>
            <li> Many fragrances have come and gone in the past half century, but this is a keeper.</li>
            <li> To make sure it lasts as long a possible, I put a thin layer of unscented lotion on my skin before applying the perfume.</li>
            <li> I knew was real and was devastated when they didn&#x27;t smell the same, but after I shook the bottle up a bit, sprayed it twice, and let it settle for a half hour or so, it smelled the same as the tester.</li>
            <li> I used a less expensive similar alternative, but it was eventually discontinued and I came back to my beloved Shalimar.</li>
            <li> so glad i got a sample before ordering a large bottle.&lt;br /&gt;Smells like bad breath...</li>
            <li> certainly does not have the same fragrance, in fact has very little smell to it and disappears almost immediately.  </li>
            <li> I love this fragrance its subtle and not overpowering.it can be used everydayand there is no strong after smell.</li>
            <li> Although it smells like a fake at first, THIS IS THE REAL DEAL.</li>
            <li> I have been using shalimar for the past 30 years and this product is not the real thing</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s following, so long as there are humans on this earth.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;We have been buying from amazon for a long time, and we want to keep doing it in the future...</li>
            <li> When she&#x27;s out, it actually affects her physical and mental state.</li>
            <li> A few years back, while visiting Paris, my husband surprised me with a bottle of Shalimar parfum.</li>
            <li> Wish it was just a little cheaper now that I am retired and on a fixed income.  </li>
            <li> No sharp or sour punch in the face or even a trail in passing.</li>
            <li> Others have complained it doesn&#x27;t smell like the real thing, but I disagree.</li>
            <li> My wife of over 40 years has worn Shalimar products for as long as I can remember.</li>
            <li> For so long that I remember when this was $19 a bottle</li>
            <li> Would have given this 5 stars, but the fragrance doesn&#x27;t seem to linger quite as long as I would like.  </li>
            <li> and I can&#x27;t send back for even a partial refund.</li>
            <li> Who knows how long this bottle has been fermenting in the Amazon warehouse?</li>
            <li> One bottle lasts so long that I could not remember if I had purchased eau de toilette or eau de parfum before, so opted for this one.</li>
            <li> The perfume came carefully boxed and I wear it daily.</li>
            <li> This is is for a birthday present, I expected to be sealed and neat.</li>
            <li> The scent , from top to base is truly the very well-known Guerlain furnish and the Shalimar &amp;#34;sniff&amp;#34; (almost repelling odor at first spritz then adorably addicting base notes after a few minutes).</li>
            <li> Did not live up to the expectation and plan to return it.</li>
            <li> Very weak ..Guess it&#x27;s true &amp;</li>
            <li> I asked my husband for a new bottle for Christmas; though I usually get the eau de toilette, he got me the Eau de Parfum instead, and I&#x27;m not complaining!  </li>
            <li> Just as I expected, my husband loves Shalimar</li>
            <li> Just as expected.</li>
            <li> Not as stong as I expected</li>
            <li> received in the expected time frame.&lt;br /</li>
            <li> then I expected.  </li>
            <li> Shalimar Eau De Pafrum Spray was what I expected.  </li>
            <li> It has absolutely no staying power - within an hour or 2 of putting it on</li>
            <li> The bottle I received is not what I expected it to be.  </li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> I read other reviews stating this was not Shalimar, and I do not agree.</li>
            <li> I get a headache from one spray and my husband is sure to hate it too.</li>
            <li> The gift box is so elegant that I hate to throw it away....</li>
            <li> Fragrance too watered down for &amp;#34;</li>
            <li> VERY DISAPPOINTED, AND WAS WARNED I MIGHT GET A GENERIC SCENT, AND TO MY SURPRISE NOT &amp;#34;ONE&amp;#34; PERSON COMPLIMENTED ME ON MY FAVORITE SHALIMAR EAU DE PARFUM SPRAY FOR WOMEN...  </li>
            <li> There is nothing else like it and probably not a good pick for the 30 or younger crowd.</li>
            <li> I was afraid this was not going to be real.</li>
            <li> Well, the problem for me was not the quality of the parfum, it was that the plastic sleeve package came broken and the blue box was unglued on the side.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a bit heavy, like Tabu.  </li>
            <li> This is NOT genuine as stated.</li>
            <li> She got a math degree when it was weird for women to be doing things like that in the early 60&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> :/</li>
            <li> Iam not sure what the difference is.</li>
            <li> BOTH MEN AND WOMEN HAVE STOPPED ME IN THE PAST YEARS, ASKING ME</li>
            <li> This is simply a bottle of expensive colored water with a hint of scent.</li>
            <li> Usually, I&#x27;m used to floral scents.</li>
            <li> it not s strong!</li>
            <li> and THAT was hard to afford.</li>
            <li> There is hardly any fragrance at all and what there is is not Shalimar.  </li>
            <li> Shalimar is complex.</li>
            <li> WHAT A WASTE!!  </li>
            <li> seriously.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s subtle, with what I think of as vanilla notes.</li>
            <li> It STINKS like old man after shave mixed with insect repellent &amp; Avon&#x27;s Skin</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not good at descriptions</li>
            <li> I bought this some time ago but just opened it and disappointed to discover that it is fake not the real perfume.</li>
            <li> Do I re-gift this on some poor unassuming friend?</li>
            <li> It is unfortunate that the product has changed negatively.</li>
            <li> We never get tired of it.  </li>
            <li> I never get tired of wearing it, and I often get compliments.  </li>
            <li> and he agreed--this is not really Shalimar and is fairly unpleasant in my opinion!</li>
            <li> AND I&#x27;M SO DISAPPOINTED THAT I HAVE WASTED MY MONEY...</li>
            <li> She is very disappointed in the current Shalimar purchase.</li>
            <li> it seems very weak smelling</li>
            <li> so I was unable to sample it before bought it.  </li>
            <li> Usually really expensive</li>
            <li> I read reviews and sadly believed them.</li>
            <li> The quality is very poor and does not compare to the Shalimar Eau De Parfum that I have been using for over 40 years.</li>
            <li> she is not that crazy about it...</li>
            <li> Expensive, but what my wife wanted!</li>
            <li> Totally WRONG!</li>
            <li> Purchasing it elsewhere has been disappointing because it had turned bad</li>
            <li> I was shocked</li>
            <li> I was disappointed.  </li>
            <li> And I was worried when I read some of the reviews about how disappointed some were when they got theirs</li>
            <li> Hugely disappointed.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed in Amazon.</li>
            <li> I was  very disappointed.</li>
            <li> I am very disappointed with this product and would not buy it again on line.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> Oh dear Lord this stuff is awful.</li>
            <li> This is the worst smelling perfume I have ever smelled.  </li>
            <li> It smelled nothing like vanilla, it smelled awful.  </li>
    </ol>

            <li> My wife of over 40 years has worn Shalimar products for as long as I can remember. All she ever wants is Shalimar for any and every occasion. As a man I can simply say I love the scent of it on her day and night. Nothing else comes close to its sensual appeal.</li>

            <li> Exactly as promised, packaged properly, delivered promptly! I&#x27;ve been buying Shalimar for my wife for 40 years. This is a good deal.</li>
            <li> My favorite classic fragrance.</li>
            <li> SMELLS GREAT AND A VERY PRETTY BOTTLE.</li>
            <li> bought for mother in law  great price  rapid delivery  this fragrance is fantastic  when I was single in the navy traveling Europe I always brought back Joy, Chloe, Shalimar, Opium, and Chanel #5 for my sisters.  Great fragrances and they were so cheap over there, never bought anything less than full strength perfume, never edt, cologne, etc...</li>
            <li> my wife likes to wear this and I like it on her - just what is there to rate</li>
            <li> beloved bride of two score years declares this genuine!</li>
            <li> I rarely see or hear of Shalimar anymore.  I&#x27;ve worn it for years but hadn&#x27;t had any for a while.  Awwww, how sweet it is to have it again.  Love this fragrance.</li>
            <li> How could I not !! Have used forever...always get comments/questions. Men will often say &amp;#34;you&#x27;re wearing Shalimar&amp;#34;. Thanks :)</li>
            <li> arrived swiftly and product just as I remembered it delighted to find such a good deal</li>
            <li> VERY HEDDY.  SCENT LASTS ALL DAY.  MUCH HEAVIER SCENT THAN THE TOILETTE THAT I HAD BEEN PURCHASING..</li>
            <li> Oh dear Lord this stuff is awful. I mean,,it makes me nauseous...so glad i got a sample before ordering a large bottle.&lt;br /&gt;Smells like bad breath...seriously. :/</li>
            <li> Absolutely love this!  Your price is &amp;#34;the best&amp;#34;!  I used to wear this perfume years ago and decided to go back to it!  Have used the &amp;#34;Unconditional Love&amp;#34; perfume by Philosophy for a few years due to the fact that it was a lot more reasonable.  However, the last time I bought it, there was no lasting fragrance after 5 minutes so thought I would go back to Shalimar.  I realize now that you get what you pay for!  Plus, one spray of Shalimar lasts all day!  Have had nothing but compliments on Shalimar!  This will definitely be my perfume from hereon!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks for handling a great product!  Hope you continue to carry this fragrance!</li>
            <li> as good as I remembered, purchesed some for my girlfriend more than fourty years ago</li>
            <li> This is not Shalimar, smells like insect spray. It had my husband coughing. Strong bug spray</li>
            <li> Exactly what I wanted for my sweetheart!</li>
            <li> as wonderful as I had remembered</li>
            <li> Love it have worn it for 40 years.</li>
            <li> My wife has to have this. When she&#x27;s out, it actually affects her physical and mental state. For years. For so long that I remember when this was $19 a bottle and THAT was hard to afford. If you know what Shalimar is, you know. If you&#x27;re tired of smelling like a fruity citrusy teenager, it&#x27;s time you ventured into one of the top 10 elegant perfumes of modern time. Or, how to smell like vanilla and sandalwood and eastern spice and be elegant and not smell like a patchoulied up old hippie. This is real. Get some today!</li>
            <li> A classic. Purchased it for my wife for her birthday but really for me, it excites me when I smell it on her.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s awesome to wear it everyday... I love it.</li>
            <li> This is still my husbands favorite scent, and I hadn&#x27;t worn it in years when my husband suggested I buy it again. Surprisingly, I discovered that I, too, still find it to be a favorite. It is relatively inexpensive, which is a plus, and it isn&#x27;t overpowering. Has a nice exotic aroma............</li>
            <li> This was a wonderful surprise gift.  The person I gave it to was thrilled to receive it.  The expression&lt;br /&gt;on her face was worth the price.  This is an excellent product.</li>
            <li> Expensive, but what my wife wanted!</li>
            <li> Same thing here - love the fragrance as much today as I did 50 years ago!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s my wife&#x27;s favorite perfume!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never found anything that smells as good as this since the first day I discovered it 50 years ago, amazing as that may seem. Many fragrances have come and gone in the past half century, but this is a keeper. I always get compliments on a daily basis.  If you already wear it, you know what I&#x27;m talking about. I don&#x27;t think this fragrance will ever lose it&#x27;s following, so long as there are humans on this earth.  :)</li>
            <li> pleased with purchase.  Just as expected.</li>
            <li> Not as stong as I expected but scent is as I remembered!  Ordered it because my mom used to wear it and it not s strong!</li>
            <li> Guerlain&#x27;s products are beautiful, because they are made from flowers not synthetic ingredients made to resemble desirable aromas.  You cannot beat real quality.</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful, classic scent that can become your signature... if you can wear it. It&#x27;s wonderful on my body chemistry, ive smelled it on others and hated it. I recommend getting a sample first, but if it&#x27;s for you,l you&#x27;ll love it. My boyfriend does too.</li>
            <li> This was an amazing value compared to what we have been paying at Nordstrom. Twice the quantity for about 1/2 the price. We have a new perfume supplier.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my lady. It has a fabulous, intoxicating, sexy aroma. It is not cheap, but this was the best deal I found after checking out numerous places.</li>
            <li> Love this fragrance! Hadn&#x27;t used it in years but so perfect for summer!</li>
            <li> Beautiful, classic, mysterious as always; different, unusual, one of the most highly intriguing fragrances of all times. Shalimar is complex. It is completely non offensive, elegant, sophisticated in an understated way. No sharp or sour punch in the face or even a trail in passing. Shalimar lays close to the skin and stays there. It is a hint, a &amp;quot;follow me&amp;quot; scent. This is a fragrance that deserves the wait for the unfolding on the skin. It blooms and morphs and each facet is entirely lovely. The scent is divine but my love for it goes deeper than that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My adoration for Shalimar is about the place it takes me when I wear or smell it. It is an experience.... like walking through an ethereal dreamscape. I cannot help but think I could not possibly dislike any one who smells of Shalimar. Though I am familiar with most of the notes, I have no idea what is in this scent that creates that magic. It is still a hot selling classic since it&#x27;s debut in the early 1900&#x27;s. There is a very good reason for that. Fantastic!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This fragrance falls nowhere in the category of trendy celebrity/current designer&#x27;s fruitchouli, peaches/bubblegum/heady flower, smell-one-smell-all category of today. There is nothing else like it and probably not a good pick for the 30 or younger crowd. (though I personally loved and wore it as a teen when it was not a vogue scent amongst my peers)It is a scent for a mature woman without being musty, old, overly powdery. Something  about Shalimar is highly addictive, and once you smell it you will never forget it. To each their own but love it or hate it, there is no other that compares to the mystery and majesty of The Divine Guerlain Shalimar.</li>
            <li> Would have given this 5 stars, but the fragrance doesn&#x27;t seem to linger quite as long as I would like.  Despite that, still feel it&#x27;s a bargain.  Very happy to find a large bottle of Shalimar at this price.  Others have complained it doesn&#x27;t smell like the real thing, but I disagree. I&#x27;m in my 60&#x27;s and have been wearing Shalimar since college.  I know the fragrance well - and this is it.  Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I bought this some time ago but just opened it and disappointed to discover that it is fake not the real perfume. I have been using shalimar for the past 30 years and this product is not the real thing</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been wearing Shalimar for over 30 years and it still smells great on me!</li>
            <li> Did not live up to the expectation and plan to return it.</li>
            <li> I bought this perfume for my wife after reading an article on Yahoo about the top 10 fragrances, and boy is it wonderful.  It is a very sexy scent that lures me every time she wears it.  You truly get what you pay for with this perfume.  If you are used to buying perfume only once a year, like I was for Christmas, than this is perfect surprise to your spouse.  Truly a luxury fragrance that will repay itself to you many times over.  Scent lasts all night long and not too powerful.  If you like the classics in the perfume space, this is a must add to your collection.</li>
            <li> It seems to be getting harder and harder to order these products and receive the free shipping. There used to be a bigger variety available with the free shipping incentive. I could find no choice in my other favorite, Samsara, to purchase with the free shipping option. Even if I added the requisite amount on top of the cost of the fragrance, one must still pay shipping on the fragrance. I am upset. We are purchasing at a great savings, but remember these products are old, some very old...bottled years ago which means there is a loss of potency. So it would be nice to count on the free shipping justification.</li>
            <li> very happy with the Shalimar.  It has the most distinct fragrance that I have enjoyed for years.  That&#x27;s why I have always bought this for my wife who loves the fragrance also.  Very good price from the vendor.  This parfum has been around for many years and there is no substitute for the real thing.</li>
            <li> It was my mom&#x27;s perfume. she always put on me this perfume but she pass away when I was 19 years old, so I did not use it anymore on me.. My boyfriend  who was accustom to smell this delicious  fragrance,ask me the for the name to buy me one,but I did not remember its name.. One day he was  walking on a street and felt the fragrance in the air. He realized that the lady who was ahead of him, had that perfume fragrance on her.. He made  the lady  stop and ask  her the name of the perfume she was wearing........, it was Shalimar from Guerlain......... my mom&#x27;s perfume..... since then I did not stop buying this marvelous and fine french perfume.</li>
            <li> This review is from: Guerlain Shalimar Eau De Parfum Spray for Women, 3 Ounce (Misc.)&lt;br /&gt;My wife loved it and I loved the price.  it arrived quickly, and, much to my surprise, in plenty of time for Mother&#x27;s Day surprise.</li>
            <li> Perfume is the way to go. It lasts all day and smells great.</li>
            <li> I was afraid this was not going to be real. I am a huge fan of Shalimar and I was so excited that this smells exactly like mine purchased in a department store. I will purchase again.</li>
            <li> This is still my favorite scent to wear, and I get a lot of compliments from people who hug me, but I don&#x27;t think others get the scent unless very close.</li>
            <li> Some of the places that offer Shalimar appear to present a lesser product. This one is the real deal.  Nice</li>
            <li> One of my favorites with a lasting fragrance.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure this perfume was going to smell like I remember it from years ago. It did and I am very happy with it. great purchase</li>
            <li> Always my favorite fragrance. Wish they’d re-issue their original version, though. It would be nice to know what it smelled like way back when. This latest iteration is not as strong as the previous and I have had to move into the perfume where before the Eau de Tiolette had been fine.</li>
            <li> I have used Shalimar, since receiving my first bottle as a birthday present, when I was 16. It is a classic fragrance, that I adore. I never fail to get compliments, when I am wearing Shalimar!</li>
            <li> Good  product... Original</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s Guerlain. It makes my wife happy. therefore, it makes me happy. We are both happy. She smell good and keeps my attention where it belongs.&lt;br /&gt;This is a fine perfume. The packaging was excellent and delivery was lightning fast.</li>
            <li> Classic fragrance and classic Amazon service!</li>
            <li> I will order again for the next two pay periods so I can stock thru Christmas.  J&#x27;aime La Maison Guerlain!</li>
            <li> I have worn Shalimar since I was in high school and have always gotten compliments on it.  This is the top of the line for me.  Prompt delivery and the product was outstanding!</li>
            <li> The quality is very poor and does not compare to the Shalimar Eau De Parfum that I have been using for over 40 years. I strongly believe that this product has been diluted. One of the Shalimar Eau De Parfum that I ordered was to be sent to my sister in Ireland but, I will not send this product because of it&#x27;s low quality.</li>
            <li> My wife was very pleased to receive the Shalimar for Christmas. She received two other fragrances, but she said that the Shalimar was her favorite. I was pleased with the price and service.</li>
            <li> the gentle aroma defines who I am per the words of friends who say when they smell Shalimar they remember me.  You too may be remembered.</li>
            <li> A few years back, while visiting Paris, my husband surprised me with a bottle of Shalimar parfum. This time when I smelled again the excting fragance of  Shalimar... I was surraunded with wonderful  memories and I fall in love all over again.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the truth that it&#x27;s hazardous. It STINKS like old man after shave mixed with insect repellent &amp; Avon&#x27;s Skin so Soft. I feel like an old maid wearing this. I&#x27;ve read the reviews and it&#x27;s a top selling fragrance, but did I get a &amp;#34;altered&amp;#34; scent? It has that oniony smell that perfumes get when they expire. Very disappointed in Amazon. It&#x27;s $84 bucks just got it 5 minutes ago and I can&#x27;t send back for even a partial refund. Do I re-gift this on some poor unassuming friend? I will never buy perfume from Amazon again. Who knows how long this bottle has been fermenting in the Amazon warehouse? I get a headache from one spray and my husband is sure to hate it too. What a huge waste of money. If you are younger than 45 and feel younger than 80, don&#x27;t bother. It is a senior scent if this is the right formula.</li>
            <li> As many have stated the new is not the same as original, This is the original fragrance. Same glass bottle and it is perfume not toilette water :) Very happy with purchase and shipping was extremely fast, used Prime.</li>
            <li> Price, delivery &amp; quality as advertised.  Would buy again.</li>
            <li> I thought it would smell way better.  Smells like a cheaper perfume for an older lady.  I was disappointed.  To be fair, I will say I didn&#x27;t buy it from Amazon.</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t smell like the original.</li>
            <li> I was very pleased with the produce ..and I am enjoying it a lot .I know now I can buy it  again from you guys when I need it again</li>
            <li> This item arrived promptly and was packaged very well.  I haven&#x27;t used this parfum in a while and was happy to get back to it.  Beautiful bottle and everything was as advertised.  I would not hesitate to purchase this item again.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite and I just love it. It was delivered early. Thank you!</li>
            <li> is a high quality product which I recommend. received in the expected time frame.&lt;br /&gt; hundred percent original and a good price</li>
            <li> My wife has used Shalimar for over 50 years. She is very disappointed in the current Shalimar purchase. It has caused a skin rash after application. The fragrance fades very rapidly. It is unfortunate that the product has changed negatively.</li>
            <li> Great price for this classic perfume and exactly as advertised.</li>
            <li> item arrived in good shape and was as advertised.</li>
            <li> This has been our primary perfume for over 25 years.  We never get tired of it.  The Parfum is the only way to go the cheaper cologne spray just does not smell as good.</li>
            <li> Have worn this fragrance for many, many years. One bottle lasts so long that I could not remember if I had purchased eau de toilette or eau de parfum before, so opted for this one. It is clearly more potent and lasts longer than the eau de toilette (which must be what I had before). One good spritz and I&#x27;m set for the day. Love it. And buying it at Amazon really saved me a lot of $ rather than a department store.</li>
            <li> I have been searching for my signature scent and found it. I will be purchasing this perfume again!</li>
            <li> BIRTHDAY GIFT FOR MY SISTER WHO BATHES HERSELF IN THIS AND ALWAYS SMELLS SO LOVELY.</li>
            <li> My wife has been using this same product for literally DECADES!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A little history behind Shalimar:  Shalimar is one of the best selling perfumes ever and its magic is undeniable.  Shalimar was created in 1921 as a tribute to the legendary love story between Emperor Shahjahan and his wife Muntaz Mahal meaning the &amp;#34;Jewell of the Palace.&amp;#34;  Emperor Shahjahan built the Taj Mahal in memory of his wife and their undying love.  Shalimar is named after &#x27;The Gardens of Shalimar.&#x27;  It was Muntaz&#x27;s favorite garden.</li>
            <li> Kay W. Barbour, I have been using Shalimar for years Love it.</li>
            <li> Service was great and price is more than fair. This is one of the oldest most beautiful parfumerie ever made. Ci</li>
            <li> Bought for my wife as a anniversary present and as always she loves it. It is the nicest most soothing fragrance ...</li>
            <li> I have used Shalimar for years and am always gratified by the response I get from Friends.  &amp;#34;Um that smells good&amp;#34;.  Love it!!</li>
            <li> was a gift and she loved it.</li>
            <li> There is no reason I will buy Shalimar elsewhere when I can get it cheaper on Amazon. At first I was - I admit - very cautious about this purchase because it is anyway, a Guerlain fragrance. However, this bottle is authentic. The scent , from top to base is truly the very well-known Guerlain furnish and the Shalimar &amp;#34;sniff&amp;#34; (almost repelling odor at first spritz then adorably addicting base notes after a few minutes). If you have been wearing Shalimar, you know that you have yourself a real bottle. The scent lasts and it is not overpowering - and I get compliments of course.</li>
            <li> I have been very happy with the products I have purchased through Amazon</li>
            <li> This is the original Shalimar and my wife just loves it. The scent when she wears it is wonderful.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ok if you like to smell like old ladies and funeral parlors. My sister in law loves this stuff. And she&#x27;s younger than me.  Not my cuppa tea.</li>
            <li> My wife loves Shalimar and so do I (on her).</li>
            <li> I HAVE WORN SHALIMAR FOR MANY YEARS.  THIS IS IN NO WAY THE AUTHENTIC GUERLAIN SHALIMAR!!! FROM THE MOMENT I RECEIVED MY ORDER, I WAS SUSPICIOUS OF THE AUTHENTICITY. THE CELLOPHANE PACKAGING ISN&#x27;T THE SAME AS WHEN YOU PURCHASE THIS FROM A DEPARTMENT STORE.  IT LOOKS LIKE IT WAS HAND WRAPPED.  THE SCENT IS NOT THE SAME AT ALL.  I TRIED TO RETURN IT BUT DIDN&#x27;T KNOW THAT I CAN&#x27;T RETURN FLAMMABLES.  WHAT A WASTE!!  I WILL NEVER BUY PERFUME OR COSMETICS ON LINE AGAIN.</li>
            <li> Best value in perfume that I have found.</li>
            <li> The Shalimar Eau De Parfum came in as described and the company from England responded to my e-mail questions promptly.&lt;br /&gt;It was a superb value.</li>
            <li> It smells like Shalimar, and the price is competitive. Plus, no driving to the mall. If you know you like this perfume, get it here.</li>
            <li> This is definitely a knock off of the real thing.  I had my husband test the two one after another and he agreed--this is not really Shalimar and is fairly unpleasant in my opinion!</li>
            <li> Shalimar, a classic, need one say more. It was delivered when promised, which was much earlier than originally suggested, and in excellent condition.</li>
            <li> Ordered this for my wife for Christmas.  The order arrived within the time period and at a great price.</li>
            <li> it is agreat perfume love it</li>
            <li> This is my favorite fragrance...an oldie but a great one! Getting at a price lower than at the &amp;#34;box&amp;#34; stores is a major plus.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> Convenient purchase, good price for a good product.</li>
            <li> ONE OF MY VERY FAVORITES-LOVE IT</li>
            <li> My favorite, a classic!</li>
            <li> Love Shalimar. .This is a great product at great price and received it quickly! !</li>
            <li> great stuff girl friend loves it</li>
            <li> Should have paid attention to the details on this product as I now cannot return it ! Smells nothing like the Shalimar I wore for years - cheap knock off!</li>
            <li> Such an oriental classic. I love this. It reminds me of burnt caramel. Like when you are making creme brûl&amp;eacute;e and you use the torch to make the hard caramel top. It smooth, spicy, and creamy. It is a little sweet but the spicy factor makes it so that it isn&#x27;t so sweet that the Mosquitos will seek you out. Much prefer this to Channel. Amazon has the best price and I was glad it was authentic and not a fake</li>
            <li> I love this perfume.  It is my favorite of all time and lasts a long time on the skin.  To make sure it lasts as long a possible, I put a thin layer of unscented lotion on my skin before applying the perfume.</li>
            <li> I was  very disappointed. I thought I was ordering the perfume and I didn&#x27;t realize that they had a similar product which is called Eau De Parfum.&lt;br /&gt;It certainly does not have the same fragrance, in fact has very little smell to it and disappears almost immediately.  B. Frost</li>
            <li> My absolute favorite!!!!  Makes me feel beautiful.</li>
            <li> What a lovely scent. I love it and have used it for many years. Guerlain rocks!</li>
            <li> The great perfume. I&#x27;m so happy I bought it.</li>
            <li> In 1944 I was on leave in Paris, and while riding on the Metro (subway) I smelled this wonderful odor on some of the women riders. Si I asked them what it was, and was told it was Shalimar Perfume by Guerlain, and that it was available in the Guerlain store on the Champs Elysee. So I went to their store that day and was told that they would sell only 3 bottles of perfume each day, So the next day I was first in line, there were a lot of people lined up to get into the store, and when the door was opened to let me in, I bought a 3 ounce bottle of perfume for a thousand Francs ($20). I shipped the perfume to my wife in Bay City, Texas. She has since, used no other perfume in our 70 years of marriage. Although now I buy the EDP, because I can no longer afford the perfume.</li>
            <li> The Shalim,ar was far higher quality then I expected.  It was a gift I could not part with.  The bottle is a collectors dream. Si I am keeping it and buying more for perfect gifts.</li>
            <li> Arrived securely packaged and on time.  I have been using Shalimar for many years and I was not disappointed with this purchase.  Shalimar is one of the top ten perfumes in the world and always makes the list of the ten best.</li>
            <li> best deal I could find for 3 oz Eau de Parfum, once again... my wifes very favorite scent, barely lasts a year, but beats the price at local malls and department stores for the same size.  Oh, and you can&#x27;t beat free shipping!</li>
            <li> product is great but the bottle was open and the contents of the bottle was half not a full bottle it was open thank you</li>
            <li> Good price for classic fragrance.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite perfume and the price from this company is extremely competitive.  The perfume came carefully boxed and I wear it daily.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been wearing this fragrence for 30 years and still get compliments on the scent.  I wouldn&#x27;t wear anything else.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite!  Thanks for the good buy!</li>
            <li> Shalimar. The Perfume arrived very quickly and was just as I expected it to be. The price was right !</li>
            <li> Shalimar Eau De Pafrum Spray was what I expected.  Very nice and my wife liked it.</li>
            <li> Well, the problem for me was not the quality of the parfum, it was that the plastic sleeve package came broken and the blue box was unglued on the side. This is is for a birthday present, I expected to be sealed and neat. I&#x27;m running out of time so I will try to fix the problem myself, but is very dissapointing...&lt;br /&gt;We have been buying from amazon for a long time, and we want to keep doing it in the future...Please check these little things better!!</li>
            <li> I have been wearing Shalimar for approx. 35 years.  I know it says this is genuine Shalimar, but I find that hard to believe.  I cannot believe it isn&#x27;t a knockoff.  It has absolutely no staying power - within an hour or 2 of putting it on there is no fragrance left.  Even with weaker forms (cologne or eua de toilette), the fragrance lasted longer.  I am very disappointed with this product and would not buy it again on line.</li>
            <li> Shalimar has been my signature fragrance for decades. For a while in my 30&#x27;s I used a less expensive similar alternative, but it was eventually discontinued and I came back to my beloved Shalimar. I never tire of the soft, subtle, powdery vanilla scent and have received many compliments on my scent over the years. I used it sparingly and a bottle can last up to a year. It makes an easy gift giving opportunity for my husband or daughters. I asked my husband for a new bottle for Christmas; though I usually get the eau de toilette, he got me the Eau de Parfum instead, and I&#x27;m not complaining!  The gift box is so elegant that I hate to throw it away....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The official Product Description (below) is quite a work of art.  I always feel &amp;#34;calmly intrepid&amp;#34; when wearing Shalimar !&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#34;Soft oriental voluptuous, sensual, spellbinding Tonic top notes of fresh flowers and bergamot are calmly intrepid. Like the savvy disorder of rumpled silk sheets, powdery notes of iris, jasmine and rose suggest or promise sensual embraces. The creamy softness of addictive vanilla, the penetrating charm of iris, the balmy roundness of opoponax and the gourmand warmth of Tonka bean orchestrate an intimate symphony of scent for languorous interludes.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> Although I can clearly tell it is a high quality product, it is not for me. It smells like a mix of talc and wood and I found it to be more of a masculine, vintage scent. Since can not be returned I will gift it.</li>
            <li> This has been my favorite perfume for many many years .  To find it on sale is heavenly</li>
            <li> Glad to see that you carried this parfum, hard to find in department stores.  Nice sized bottle that will last me for awhile... love it!  Priced just right too!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s my favorite and always will be.  It arrived on time and it was sealed properly, which is something you need to watch for in buying any product you wear of consume.</li>
            <li> This is the scent my wife has used for more than 20 years. I love it when she wares this scent. Makes the air I breath the best I can&#x27;t get enough of it.</li>
            <li> I have used Shalimr for over 40 years and love the compliments I get when I hug some people.  It seems to be compatible with my natural scent,  but I believe it would compliment any person with good taste.</li>
            <li> it is not the same fragrance of Shalimar as i thought I was getting. The one I had previously was better, this one is just okay.  Iam not sure what the difference is.</li>
            <li> My Mom was very happy, arrived on time and was exactly as advertised.</li>
            <li> Great price prompt shipping great product</li>
            <li> how do i tell its expiration date?  it seems very weak smelling</li>
            <li> Bought this for mother...she is not that crazy about it...it smells like baby powder...nothing special...I bought it just cuz there are a lot of reviews for this par fum. She is 62 yrs young.</li>
            <li> Good parfum.  As promised delivery.</li>
            <li> She loved the product.</li>
            <li> Dont pass up this amazing deal becouase of impatience! Although it smells like a fake at first, THIS IS THE REAL DEAL. I compared it side by side with shalimar I knew was real and was devastated when they didn&#x27;t smell the same, but after I shook the bottle up a bit, sprayed it twice, and let it settle for a half hour or so, it smelled the same as the tester. Any sprays after those two immediately smelled the same as the tester. This is an incredible deal, and amazing perfume. I plan to wear it for years to come.</li>
            <li> Wife says that it was not the real stuff. I would check with that vendor to insure people are getting the real Shalimar. My wife has used this perfume for most of her life and is now 73 years old</li>
            <li> Very strong scented (in the beginning), it smells nice but the scent begins to fade. I think it would be best to spray it on your clothes and not on your skin - it will last all day.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this lovely scent for years.  I never get tired of wearing it, and I often get compliments.  Thanks for having this great item available to us.</li>
            <li> What do you say about a perfume that&#x27;s been around for nearly a century? It&#x27;s subtle, with what I think of as vanilla notes. I didn&#x27;t have a real sense of what I was getting for the 3 oz. bottle—for a perfume bottle it is HUGE, and eau de parfum and not the weaker eau de cologne. A good buy.</li>
            <li> The aromatic fragrance is intoxicating.  When my wife lightly sprays herself, wherever part of the house I&#x27;m in I&#x27;m drawn in her direction and when I get there I want to devour her.  But beware if you feel this way so will others!</li>
            <li> I love this Shalimar Parfum spray, I used it for over 40 years, and I am very glad that you carry it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been giving my wife this perfume for over 40 years. The fragrance just doesn&#x27;t smell the same as it used to.</li>
            <li> Good products, quick deliveries.  Thank you.</li>
            <li> Buyers here have debated whether this is the &amp;#34;original&amp;#34; Shalimar scent.  I&#x27;m here to tell you:  one whiff of this beautiful fragrance and I was back at my prom.  I love Shalimar and haven&#x27;t worn it for years.  I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s for everyone.  It&#x27;s a bit heavy, like Tabu.  A little goes a long way.  Still, I am pleased and the scent IS the Shalimar original.  (the price is pretty good, too)</li>
            <li> Very satisfied, I recommend, Grateful.</li>
            <li> One of my favorites; very costly in the dept. stores; this was a great solution for me!</li>
            <li> This is the worst smelling perfume I have ever smelled.  And, this is supposed to be a classic, good perfume.  I ordered it because I live in a small town and there are no stores nearby that sell good perfumes so I was unable to sample it before bought it.  I just moved here from a large city so I normally would have gone to a perfume counter and sampled before I bought.  I did research on it on the internet though and wanted it because my boyfriend likes vanilla scent in perfume and supposedly this was a good perfume for that.  It smelled nothing like vanilla, it smelled awful.  And, Amazon won&#x27;t take it back because it is considered a hazardous material.  However, they were able to ship the &amp;#34;hazardous material&amp;#34; to me!  They should have told me when I ordered it that it was non-returnable.  I would not have ordered it.</li>
            <li> What a great bargain!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Shalimar for 30 years,  and was so happy to see this bottle priced comparatively to a 1 oz bottle.  This is the only fragrance I will wear.  I read other reviews stating this was not Shalimar, and I do not agree. I have been extremely pleased with my purchase,  and will purchase again.</li>
            <li> Gave as gift and the lady thought it was wonderful. I never smelled the perfume for it was shipped states away.</li>
            <li> It is a great product, big size and amazing prize for the size of the bottle.  Fast delivery too!  Very pleased overall!</li>
            <li> It was exactly what I expected and arrived on time. Great job!</li>
            <li> Bought this for my mom and she loves it.  Usually really expensive but this was a great price and it is the real thing.  My mom uses it and the bottle is very elegant.</li>
            <li> WAS JUST WHAT I WAS LOOKING FOR.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I SUGGEST THAT ;YOU CHANGE YOUR PROGRAM TO INCLUDE THE PRODUCT IN THE HEADLINE.</li>
            <li> Very weak ..Guess it&#x27;s true &amp;#34;you get what you pay for&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> Great value.  Fast delivery.</li>
            <li> My favorite perfume for years!  Price was unbeatable.</li>
            <li> my wife has used this product for years and still loves it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the real stuff people! Why is this like soooo much more $$$ in sephora/macys?!? Buy it here if you want this timeless, elegant, best fragrance of all time (IMHO). I&#x27;m not good at descriptions so look at fragrantica.com. I also like Guerlain la petite robe noir, and angel, and although not too similar to those, clean skin.</li>
            <li> great item- fast shipping- thank you</li>
            <li> I love this fragrance its subtle and not overpowering.it can be used everydayand there is no strong after smell., clean and fibrant.</li>
            <li> My wife loves this product - hence, so do I. Shalimar has been around for a long time; for good reason.  Update: re-ordered November 2015; wife still loves this product; same fragrance.</li>
            <li> I have been wearing Shalimar for many years.  Everyone always compliments me on the scent.  This is the se3cond time I purchased it from this vendor.  Great service and price!</li>
            <li> I think it was a Knock off. I had another bottle and they were not comparable. They weren&#x27;t the&lt;br /&gt;same color or same strength of smell</li>
            <li> I used to wear this in High School back in the 70&#x27;s. I was shocked when I got this bottle, I was expecting a smaller bottle and when I pulled this one out when it arrived it was huge compared to the tiny ones you buy in the store. I guess it will last me for a while. And I was worried when I read some of the reviews about how disappointed some were when they got theirs cause it didnt smell the same. I think it smells the same and I think I just may never go by those one star reviews ever again, it just might keep me from getting something I really want. Maybe what is good for me isnt what someone else wants......</li>
            <li> Fragrance too watered down for &amp;#34; eau de parfum&amp;#34; or even &amp;#34;eau de toilette&amp;#34; - which explains the price!</li>
            <li> I am use to a smaller bottle that I can take on trips. I think the size for the value is great and the same great fragrance that I have always loved with Shalimar.</li>
            <li> Great price, arrived quickly, and was the &amp;#34;real thing&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> VERY DISAPPOINTED, AND WAS WARNED I MIGHT GET A GENERIC SCENT, AND TO MY SURPRISE NOT &amp;#34;ONE&amp;#34; PERSON COMPLIMENTED ME ON MY FAVORITE SHALIMAR EAU DE PARFUM SPRAY FOR WOMEN...  I HAVE USED ONLY THIS SHALIMAR BECAUSE SO MANY PEOPLE HAVE COMPLIMENTED ME ON HOW BEAUTIFUL THIS LOVELY TRUE SCENT SMELLS ON MY BODY TYPE... BOTH MEN AND WOMEN HAVE STOPPED ME IN THE PAST YEARS, ASKING ME WHAT I WAS WEARING AND GIVING THE TRUE NORDSTROMS &amp;#34;SHALIMAR&amp;#34;  THE HIGHEST COMPLIMENTS... I BOUGHT FROM THIS SELLER IN DEC. 2012, AND I&#x27;M SO DISAPPOINTED THAT I HAVE WASTED MY MONEY... GUESS I&#x27;LL HAVE TO BUY FROM NORDSTROM&#x27;S ON LINE... IT&#x27;S TAKEN ME FIVE MONTHS TO GIVE MY OPINION BECAUSE I&#x27;VE JUST MOVED TO HAWAII, THE BIG ISLAND, AND MY TIME WAS CONSUMED WITH PACKING AND MOVING, THEN GETTING SETTLED IN FINALLY... I WISH I COULD GET A REFUND BUT YOU LOOSE SOME AND WIN SOME... BE CAREFUL, AND I WISH YOU GOOD LUCK IN YOUR CHOICE...  *GOD* BLESS YOU ALL...  JEANNIE, A FAITHFUL CUSTOMER OF AMAZON...</li>
            <li> I have been wearing Shalimar for more than 30 years, but purchasing it from Amazon I know it is not old and the fragrance is wonderful.  Purchasing it elsewhere has been disappointing because it had turned bad and I had to return it.  I have never had a problem with my Shalimar from Amazon.</li>
            <li> I have worn Shalimar for 35 years so I know what to expect.  The bottle I received is not what I expected it to be.  There is hardly any fragrance at all and what there is is not Shalimar.  Hugely disappointed.</li>
            <li> This is my first bottle of Shalimar, and I am very pleased with it.  I love the smell of vanilla sandlewood candles and that is what this fragrance reminds me alot of.  I see why it has been around for so many years.  The scent is  lovely,  it&#x27;s very unique.  Very pleased with it!  May purchase again.</li>
            <li> My wife was very HAPPY with her Christmas gift.</li>
            <li> Totally WRONG! I&#x27;ve worn Shalimar or over 50 years. This is NOT genuine as stated. It does NOT hold the scent. I read reviews and sadly believed them. This is simply a bottle of expensive colored water with a hint of scent. Very disappointed. VERY!</li>
            <li> This is my wife&#x27;s favorite perfume.  This offering was at a great price.</li>
            <li> Usually, I&#x27;m used to floral scents. I am talking about pure rose oil and loud floral perfumes like Anais Anais by Cacharel. However, one of my most favorite role models and most loved people, my Aunt, swears by this perfume. She was one of the first people (and a woman at that) in my family to get a college education. She got a math degree when it was weird for women to be doing things like that in the early 60&#x27;s. I look up to her and wanted to buy her favorite perfume. It smells a lot like Chantilly but a lot less citrusy and with more vanilla. It&#x27;s a very nice perfume and a good change of pace. I feel like a really powerful woman when I wear it.</li>
            <li> I have been wearing this perfume for 30+ years; it is one of my favorite scents.  So happy I can still purchase it; the classics never go out of favor.  Wish it was just a little cheaper now that I am retired and on a fixed income.  Have to use it more sparingly!</li>
            <li> Wife likes it that&#x27;s all that counts,she smell great when wearing it also.</li>
