            <li>It&#x27;s absolutely amazing</li>
            <li>and oh my gosh my skin looks so good and healthy even with the acne</li>
            <li>I honestly threw this bottle away.</li>
            <li>did arrive on time and packed nicely.</li>
            <li>I am so excited and happy with the results.  </li>
            <li>My skin is so soft best investment I have ever made!!!</li>
            <li>Makes my skin clear and flawless.</li>
            <li>That said, it&#x27;s really strong!</li>
            <li>Leaves a good TRUE crystalizing upon usage.</li>
            <li>This is just as strong and effective as the stuff you get from a doctor&#x27;s skin peel.  </li>
            <li>If you have very fair sensitive skin, this probably isn&#x27;t for you.</li>
            <li>I would say this is more of a TCA peel than salicyclic acid.</li>
            <li>After a couple days, my skin looked much better.</li>
            <li>that I know better</li>
            <li>its okay</li>
            <li>I am pleased with the results after just three weeks.</li>
            <li>I plan to use it once a week since it works better then any face cleansers.</li>
            <li>ok...</li>
            <li>I am so bummed about this because I was really enjoying the results.  </li>
            <li>The most damaged skin on my face is what peeled the most.  </li>
            <li>I love this peel, You feel the burn but its tolerable, there was frosting</li>
            <li>I have been using glycolic for about a year but this salicylic is much better at clearing up blackheads and skin tags than the glycolic was.  </li>
            <li>great product, I dillute it with purified water due to it&#x27;s strength and it works great for me.</li>
            <li>Not as strong as I had hoped, seems more like a 20%.</li>
            <li>It makes my skin feel very soft, great for blackheads too.</li>
            <li>Firstly, the company that sends these product ships extremely quickly which is great.</li>
            <li>It has a strong smell from the tea tree oil, but it fades very quickly after use.</li>
            <li>the instructions are easy to follow as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Easy to deal with.</li>
            <li>It was very mild but it cleared my skin up and made it brighter.</li>
            <li>The product is really strong.</li>
            <li>This stuff is super potent</li>
            <li>and I can already see a huge improvement on three of them.  </li>
            <li>fantastic product.</li>
            <li>I started out using the 20% salicylic acid peel made by the same company with great clearing results.  </li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s a light peel, I use it for my acne</li>
            <li>So far, so good.</li>
            <li>Fair warning, make sure you do not agitate your skin much prior to using, as you WILL BURN your face.</li>
            <li>This is very powerful so follow the instructions</li>
            <li>Super strong salicylic acid</li>
            <li>Although I did not experience significant peeling, the bumps did reduce in size.</li>
            <li>I am excited about seeing the results after using it for a month.</li>
            <li>Great product, comes with brush and apparently their new product is crystal clear, very nice.</li>
            <li>It also came in quickly</li>
            <li>so I didnt keep it on for long, but still got good results.</li>
            <li>(remember, it&#x27;s oil soluble and doesn&#x27;t mix all that well with water, so using something like benzoyl / ether / isopropyl alcohol for the dilution will work much better) to a 10-15% concentration and, while it definitely still stings and results in a pretty rapid peel, it is much more tolerable than the full 30%.  </li>
            <li>I work for a dermatologist and it&#x27;s better than the professional peels we do!</li>
            <li>During the flaking and peeling process I used a rotating brush very lightly along with Dove sensitive skin wash to help speed along the process.  </li>
            <li>but overall this worked amazing,</li>
            <li>so far it&#x27;s ok, I will buy another bottle.</li>
            <li>The first time I used this, I had been using glycolic acid and made the mistake of applying this at full strength.  </li>
            <li>This resulted in a much more intense &amp;#34;tingle&amp;#34; and much faster peeling process.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>But for the price it is worth it.</li>
            <li>I have used this item 3 times in the past two weeks and so far I am very happy with it.  </li>
            <li>there is still such a huge difference!</li>
            <li>I just got this in today and used it for the first time ever</li>
            <li>Eh.... First of all, I did not receive the fan brush with my order.</li>
            <li>I rinse three times for about a minute each, then I apply a baking soda solution (which always ends up neutralizing more acid), then I rinse one final time.&lt;br</li>
            <li>My skin was smoother immediately after the first treatment.</li>
            <li>, I was only able to leave it on for about 30 seconds or so.  </li>
            <li>Much better than 70% glycolic acid especially for oily skin.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve always done 20 percent at the doctor, at first</li>
            <li>I also lost a significant amount when I accidentally knocked it over, so that kind of sucks.</li>
            <li>my skin is super sensitive too, so it didn&#x27;t make sense...</li>
            <li>I read that for large one it may take up to 2 weeks</li>
            <li>word of caution -- this really is a 30% Salicyclic Acid solution.</li>
            <li>but this is too much.</li>
            <li>I made the mistake of lightly exfoliating prior to using it once, and it took a couple weeks for my skin to recover.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t really work on me</li>
            <li>It is very strong--almost two times the amount of salicylic acid that is in Compound W.</li>
            <li>Really work.</li>
            <li>This only managed to peel lightly my chin and nose after 2 applications.</li>
            <li>THIS IS NOT FOR YOU.I&#x27;m very tolerant to pain</li>
            <li>so do it when you have a couple of down time days &#x3D;)</li>
            <li>I would advise you mix with a mild solution such as Proactive.</li>
            <li>It burns less and gives a beautiful result with little to no peeling.</li>
            <li>I think I am now at a point where I know which areas can handle a little more time.</li>
            <li>I have used other peels before, but none compare to how strong this one is.</li>
            <li>be sure to follow included instructions, it will burn your skin if left on too long.</li>
            <li>beautiful and small black heads are gone.</li>
            <li>One of the drawbacks is that it is a lot more liquid-y than my other salicylic acid peel, so it tends to absorb into non-plastic applicators (cotton balls, etc.) and can drip onto floor if you&#x27;re not careful.</li>
            <li>The acne appears in the new skin like nothing..</li>
            <li>It burned my entire face to a crisp.</li>
            <li>It clears my acne a little, it&#x27;s not to strong, I like that about it.</li>
            <li>I use bottled water to wash my face with Neutrogena Deep Clean Facial Cleanser, and I pat dry with a fresh paper towel.</li>
            <li>Works great but use per the directions on the bottle and be prepared for your skin to look a little flaky and dry for the first few days.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s keepin my skin clear.</li>
            <li>Professional grade peel works as it should.</li>
            <li>My skin was burned in the chin area and started to bleed spent a whole weekend becoming dark skin.</li>
            <li>He never pealed and never dried up.</li>
            <li>Been using it for a week or so skin already started to peel but to those with sensitive skin</li>
            <li>I finally started to peel and appeared under the new skin is now very sensitive to everything.</li>
            <li>Most sensitive parts with acid reacted BECOMING white .. impossible to remove with water ..</li>
            <li>I already have the glycolic and lactic acid peels which can be pretty rough (burning and a lot of peeling).  </li>
            <li>Fairly mild with little burn and minimal peeling of skin on my first use.</li>
            <li>lol...never peeled never even had a reaction other than frosting when first applied...</li>
            <li>The lactic acid is much less intense and I would recommend that for people with sensitive skin types.</li>
            <li>5 applications and some scabs are peeling, but no full consistent peel.</li>
            <li>I was hoping for more dramatic effect.</li>
            <li>I have been reading a lot about various kinds of face peels and since I am apparently having a pro-life crisis at age 35</li>
            <li>When I initially began using this product, the results were even better than the 20%, however the past few times using the peel</li>
            <li>The only solution was all natural aloe vera plant.&lt;br /&gt;There is not a surface treatment is much deeper than you think my skin still has small holes open.</li>

            <li> It&#x27;s keepin my skin clear.</li>
            <li> Professional grade peel works as it should.</li>

            <li> He never pealed and never dried up.</li>
            <li> Been using it for a week or so skin already started to peel but to those with sensitive skin</li>
            <li> I finally started to peel and appeared under the new skin is now very sensitive to everything.</li>
            <li> Most sensitive parts with acid reacted BECOMING white .. impossible to remove with water ..</li>
            <li> I already have the glycolic and lactic acid peels which can be pretty rough (burning and a lot of peeling).  </li>
            <li> Fairly mild with little burn and minimal peeling of skin on my first use.</li>
            <li> lol...never peeled never even had a reaction other than frosting when first applied...</li>
            <li> The lactic acid is much less intense and I would recommend that for people with sensitive skin types.</li>
            <li> 5 applications and some scabs are peeling, but no full consistent peel.</li>
            <li> I was hoping for more dramatic effect.</li>
            <li> I have been reading a lot about various kinds of face peels and since I am apparently having a pro-life crisis at age 35</li>
            <li> When I initially began using this product, the results were even better than the 20%, however the past few times using the peel</li>
            <li> The only solution was all natural aloe vera plant.&lt;br /&gt;There is not a surface treatment is much deeper than you think my skin still has small holes open.</li>
            <li> My face, the ugliness, began to peel within the first three days.</li>
            <li> This little bottle has helped me clear up stubborn milia.  </li>
            <li> so you might want to dilute it a little bit if you have sensitive skin</li>
            <li> I am a 29 Dark skin (chocolate) african anerican female with oily acne prone skin.</li>
            <li> I have acne scarring, deep open pores, and dark spots.  </li>
            <li> I have to be extra careful with this product.</li>
            <li> However, I am still giving it 5 stars because the benefits still outweigh this minor drawback.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m using it every other day the real reason is to remove some warts already knocked out 1 small one medium</li>
            <li> i have extremely oily skin, am asian indian.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t leave on for very long however,</li>
            <li> I wrote the seller and they said to me everything that happened to me was normal and common..</li>
            <li> Do not think it&#x27;s bad product what happens is that the whole face is 30% too much.</li>
            <li> Did peel on the 3/4 day but its to be expected</li>
            <li> It was a pink liquid advertised for athlete&#x27;s foot</li>
            <li> use this as a primer, because it is oil soluble, prior to applying a second acid (usually TCA, 15%) because it cuts through the oil on my skin, opens up my pores,and allows the TCA to get in a little bit deeper.</li>
            <li> I will warn you, however, that when you rinse your face off, you should use only cold water and expect it to intensify the burn at first.  </li>
            <li> beware of extreme peeling though</li>
            <li> Be careful!</li>
            <li> I use mine every other week to help with acne scarring and prevention.</li>
            <li> I do this about every other week</li>
            <li> the dark spots are still on my face .</li>
            <li> This type of peel is a different type of acid (you should research it) and something that I could use at least once a week.</li>
            <li> All the dark spot disappear.</li>
            <li> type peels as they stay where I put them and don&#x27;t run down my face.</li>
            <li> one I&#x27;ll probably use once monthly to keep acne outbreaks down.</li>

            <li> I have been using this peel about once per week to week and a half.  </li>
            <li> cause it does burn a little.</li>
            <li> he product is like water which makes it tough to use it for targeted peeling and it only felt like 2% on the four or five cystic bumps under my chin.</li>
            <li> Expect 1 week downtime as you will experience heavy scabbing after day 2 on the area of application.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s salacylic acid combined with Tea Tree oil, aloe Vera and Green tea.</li>
            <li> It won&#x27;t be as harsh.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> It clears my acne a little, it&#x27;s not to strong, I like that about it. I&#x27;ve been using it once a week so far it&#x27;s ok, I will buy another bottle.</li>
            <li> I would say this is more of a TCA peel than salicyclic acid. Expect 1 week downtime as you will experience heavy scabbing after day 2 on the area of application. It goes away after day 6-7</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used lower concentrates but this one gave me slight frosting in some places. After a couple days, my skin looked much better.</li>
            <li> This stuff is super potent so you might want to dilute it a little bit if you have sensitive skin but overall this worked amazing, beware of extreme peeling though so do it when you have a couple of down time days &#x3D;)</li>
            <li> Great product, comes with brush and apparently their new product is crystal clear, very nice.</li>
            <li> It has helped me a lot clearing up a bad break out with serious cystic acne. It has a strong smell from the tea tree oil, but it fades very quickly after use. It did burn a bit for me so I didnt keep it on for long, but still got good results.</li>
            <li> I just got this in today and used it for the first time ever and oh my gosh my skin looks so good and healthy even with the acne there is still such a huge difference! My skin is so soft best investment I have ever made!!! It also came in quickly the instructions are easy to follow as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Very happy!!</li>
            <li> fantastic product. People who sell this are great to. Easy to deal with.</li>
            <li> Eh.... First of all, I did not receive the fan brush with my order. he product is like water which makes it tough to use it for targeted peeling and it only felt like 2% on the four or five cystic bumps under my chin. Although I did not experience significant peeling, the bumps did reduce in size. I will be trying a different brand.</li>
            <li> Great stuff.  buying my 2nd bottle.  I am 50 something and I have never used a peel product. I couldn&#x27;t be happier with the results.  My rosacea has improved moderately.  My skin looks beautiful and small black heads are gone. Fairly mild with little burn and minimal peeling of skin on my first use. Great seller too.</li>
            <li> This peel is amazing! I work for a dermatologist and it&#x27;s better than the professional peels we do! It burns less and gives a beautiful result with little to no peeling. It&#x27;s salacylic acid combined with Tea Tree oil, aloe Vera and Green tea. Best to start off just leaving it on for 30-90 seconds and increase as your skin tolerates. Have a good moisturizer to put on after and sunscreen is a must .</li>
            <li> Stronnng stuff but if u spot treat kills them instantly! Did peel on the 3/4 day but its to be expected will review again once im done with the bottle with final results</li>
            <li> Starting slow on a few skin tags on my neck. If no problems, will move to the face.</li>
            <li> This product is great and does the job! The stinging and peeling wasnt to bad.</li>
            <li> The first time I used this, I had been using glycolic acid and made the mistake of applying this at full strength.  Salicylic acid, though, is oil soluble (while glycolic acid is not).  This resulted in a much more intense &amp;#34;tingle&amp;#34; and much faster peeling process.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now that I know better, i dilute this (remember, it&#x27;s oil soluble and doesn&#x27;t mix all that well with water, so using something like benzoyl / ether / isopropyl alcohol for the dilution will work much better) to a 10-15% concentration and, while it definitely still stings and results in a pretty rapid peel, it is much more tolerable than the full 30%.  I will warn you, however, that when you rinse your face off, you should use only cold water and expect it to intensify the burn at first.  I rinse three times for about a minute each, then I apply a baking soda solution (which always ends up neutralizing more acid), then I rinse one final time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use this as a primer, because it is oil soluble, prior to applying a second acid (usually TCA, 15%) because it cuts through the oil on my skin, opens up my pores,and allows the TCA to get in a little bit deeper.</li>
            <li> its okay i used it on my acne , its gone but the dark spots are still on my face .</li>
            <li> Product arrived on time and I used as instructed with a cotton ball. My face, the ugliness, began to peel within the first three days. My skin was smoother immediately after the first treatment. I use bottled water to wash my face with Neutrogena Deep Clean Facial Cleanser, and I pat dry with a fresh paper towel. I am pleased with the results after just three weeks. I will continue to use this product. Finally, something that works!</li>
            <li> Great stuff! Makes my skin clear and flawless. Can&#x27;t leave on for very long however, cause it does burn a little.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only been using it for 2 days and already see a difference in my skin.  It does not burn when I put it on, but understand everyone&#x27;s experience is different.  SO FAR...LOVE!!!</li>
            <li> I have been reading a lot about various kinds of face peels and since I am apparently having a pro-life crisis at age 35 I wanted to try these out. I already have the glycolic and lactic acid peels which can be pretty rough (burning and a lot of peeling).  This type of peel is a different type of acid (you should research it) and something that I could use at least once a week. It was very mild but it cleared my skin up and made it brighter. I plan to use it once a week since it works better then any face cleansers. I use witch hazel as a toner and that has been great after the peels.</li>
            <li> This is very effective.  It cleared my black heads and acne in no time.  This is very powerful so follow the instructions and you will get great results.  This is just as strong and effective as the stuff you get from a doctor&#x27;s skin peel.  Very good!</li>
            <li> Professional grade peel works as it should. Leaves a good TRUE crystalizing upon usage. Been using this for a month and have seen great results.  I am a 29 Dark skin (chocolate) african anerican female with oily acne prone skin.</li>
            <li> Works well for controlling oil and breakouts!!!</li>
            <li> I honestly threw this bottle away. First brand I have used that smelled awful (reminded me of formaldehyde). I also couldn&#x27;t feel anything. I would look elsewhere.</li>
            <li> Works great but use per the directions on the bottle and be prepared for your skin to look a little flaky and dry for the first few days.</li>
            <li> This little bottle has helped me clear up stubborn milia.  I just apply it with a q-tip 2-3 times a day and within a day or two the spot goes away!</li>
            <li> This was a great product for a great price. Finally, a product that works! I&#x27;d had it with over-the-counter blackhead\acne treatments, so decided to try this. So far, so good. You can be as aggressive with the treatment as you feel you can handle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One word of caution -- this really is a 30% Salicyclic Acid solution. Follow the instructions included with the product to prevent over burning of the skin.</li>
            <li> The product is really strong. I used it only once and I have experience with acid .. but this is too much. Do not think it&#x27;s bad product what happens is that the whole face is 30% too much. My skin was burned in the chin area and started to bleed spent a whole weekend becoming dark skin. I finally started to peel and appeared under the new skin is now very sensitive to everything. The acne appears in the new skin like nothing..The only solution was all natural aloe vera plant.&lt;br /&gt;There is not a surface treatment is much deeper than you think my skin still has small holes open. The conclusion this acid not peel or even acts on the same level. Most sensitive parts with acid reacted BECOMING white .. impossible to remove with water .. it was painful for me this anymore. I wrote the seller and they said to me everything that happened to me was normal and common.. ok...</li>
            <li> I have used this item 3 times in the past two weeks and so far I am very happy with it.  I am excited about seeing the results after using it for a month.</li>
            <li> Love it! Great for callus removal</li>
            <li> Super strong salicylic acid, I&#x27;ve used a different brand and have never gotten the &amp;#34;frosting&amp;#34; often described. This however I could see immediately. Fair warning, make sure you do not agitate your skin much prior to using, as you WILL BURN your face. I made the mistake of lightly exfoliating prior to using it once, and it took a couple weeks for my skin to recover. Be careful!</li>
            <li> I started out using the 20% salicylic acid peel made by the same company with great clearing results.  I decided to pump up the percentage and move to the 30% salicylic acid peel.  I have been using this peel about once per week to week and a half.  When I initially began using this product, the results were even better than the 20%, however the past few times using the peel I noticed a reaction.  It&#x27;s almost as if different pores all over my cheeks, chin and even forehead got inflamed.  They are itching like crazy and have these raised bumps, almost like a pimple.  I am so bummed about this because I was really enjoying the results.  I thought I might give others a heads up about the potential risk involved</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t really work on me lol...never peeled never even had a reaction other than frosting when first applied...my skin is super sensitive too, so it didn&#x27;t make sense...did arrive on time and packed nicely.</li>
            <li> This is a great product. I prefer &amp;#34;gel&amp;#34; type peels as they stay where I put them and don&#x27;t run down my face. I have to be extra careful with this product. But for the price it is worth it.</li>
            <li> I think i need something stronger for my sons face. Trying to help remove his clogged surface skin and open up skin to his serums. He never pealed and never dried up. I will keep using it and increasing time as he increases tolerance</li>
            <li> Not as strong as I had hoped, seems more like a 20%. Though I would purchase again as I like the combination with the Tea Tree Extract.</li>
            <li> It burned my entire face to a crisp. And I&#x27;m already black! I was called bacon face at work for a week. Not for the weak hearted. I would advise you mix with a mild solution such as Proactive. It won&#x27;t be as harsh. But it will still work.</li>
            <li> I have two mosaic plantar warts on each of my feet and have tried all kinds of OTC treatments.  Nothing had worked until I found this product.  It has only been a week and I can already see a huge improvement on three of them.  The last one is stubborn but I think that if I stick with it I may finally be rid of them all.  I am ordering a second bottle today.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A word of caution, though.  Please exercise care if applying this to your face.  It is very strong--almost two times the amount of salicylic acid that is in Compound W.</li>
            <li> The peel worked and my skin feels softer. However I think that it is diluted and not as concentrated as it should be; i cold be wrong though.</li>
            <li> This stuff is awesome, Love it.  I have acne scarring, deep open pores, and dark spots.  I applied this stuff and it burnt like a son of a gun, I was only able to leave it on for about 30 seconds or so.  I rinsed with baking soda water.  The most damaged skin on my face is what peeled the most.  I  was very excited and happy with the results.  It took approximately a week for the flaking, peeling, and redness to subside.  I did use an antioxidant recovery cream several times a day along with Cerave facial moisturizing lotion with SPF 30 in it.  During the flaking and peeling process I used a rotating brush very lightly along with Dove sensitive skin wash to help speed along the process.  I have had several compliments on my skin.  I am so excited and happy with the results.  I will definitely be using and buying this product again.</li>
            <li> This does what it&#x27;s supposed to. I use mine every other week to help with acne scarring and prevention. Use the lotion!! Peeling for me happens the next day. It makes my skin feel very soft, great for blackheads too.</li>
            <li> great product, I dillute it with purified water due to it&#x27;s strength and it works great for me. be sure to follow included instructions, it will burn your skin if left on too long.</li>
            <li> didn&#x27;t find it very effective. after 3rd use, white crystals bulid up inside the bottle and ended up throwing away 1/4 of the product..wouldn&#x27;t buy it again. i have extremely oily skin, am asian indian.</li>
            <li> Remember when you could buy a product at the drug store called Blistisol?  It was a pink liquid advertised for athlete&#x27;s foot and it was salicylic acid, I think 15%.  Anyway, I bought this for treatment of psoriasis, to help remove flaky patches of skin.  I am currently using a 20% soon on my face which works to freshen the look of my skin.  After I rinse I use a thin layer of Vaseline to prevent dryness.  In between I use a product that contains Vit C, hyaluronic acid and I can see a difference in skin texture and evenness of tone.</li>
            <li> I love this peel, You feel the burn but its tolerable, there was frosting and you have to moisturize after, it&#x27;s a light peel, I use it for my acne and I have noticed the pimples get smaller after the next day and i also use it as a spot treatment and neutralize with baking soda and water mix.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s keepin my skin clear.</li>
            <li> Really work. My skin peel 2 days after. All the dark spot disappear. Much better than 70% glycolic acid especially for oily skin.</li>
            <li> I was hoping for more dramatic effect. This only managed to peel lightly my chin and nose after 2 applications. 5 applications and some scabs are peeling, but no full consistent peel. I am ordering 50% Glycolic peel now, will update you with the results.&lt;br /&gt;This one I&#x27;ll probably use once monthly to keep acne outbreaks down.</li>
            <li> I have used other peels before, but none compare to how strong this one is. It&#x27;s absolutely amazing how well it works to relieve my acne. One of the drawbacks is that it is a lot more liquid-y than my other salicylic acid peel, so it tends to absorb into non-plastic applicators (cotton balls, etc.) and can drip onto floor if you&#x27;re not careful. I also lost a significant amount when I accidentally knocked it over, so that kind of sucks. However, I am still giving it 5 stars because the benefits still outweigh this minor drawback.</li>
            <li> If you have a wart and want it gone - trust me.</li>
            <li> Been using it for a week or so skin already started to peel but to those with sensitive skin THIS IS NOT FOR YOU.I&#x27;m very tolerant to pain but this stings really bad maybe the area where I&#x27;m using it  around the neck.neck. I&#x27;m using it every other day the real reason is to remove some warts already knocked out 1 small one medium I read that for large one it may take up to 2 weeks so I&#x27;ll update then to see if it works.The reason for 3 stars and not 5 is the brush that came with it is junk the moment I use it the finish came of and did not like the idea that some remain suspended in the liquid.</li>
            <li> Firstly, the company that sends these product ships extremely quickly which is great. The product is just like a peel at the dermatologist. That said, it&#x27;s really strong! I&#x27;ve always done 20 percent at the doctor, at first I thought I made a mistake by getting 30... I can only leave this on my face for a very short time but I am seeing good results and I haven&#x27;t had any crazy burning or peeling. My recommendation is to start out using it for very short time, like literally on and off. Some areas of my face will peel from that. I think I am now at a point where I know which areas can handle a little more time. If you have very fair sensitive skin, this probably isn&#x27;t for you. I do this about every other week and I will do lactic acid in between. The lactic acid is much less intense and I would recommend that for people with sensitive skin types.</li>
            <li> I have been using glycolic for about a year but this salicylic is much better at clearing up blackheads and skin tags than the glycolic was.  Skin tag I had for a couple of years was gone after the second salicylic treatment.  I bought more!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great thank you!</li>
