            <li>It&#x27;s great to have a blower dryer on the wall all the time to just pick up and use.  </li>
            <li>This is a great buy...</li>
            <li>She used it at a resort and loved it.</li>

            <li>This is easy to install, and great to use.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so handy.  </li>
            <li>This is like being at a hotel in your own home.  </li>
            <li>The night light is very bright and even my parents can see by the night light.</li>
            <li>The installation was a very easy process.  </li>
            <li>This cleared off the top of the sink, and now we don&#x27;t have to worry about the kids dropping it into the sink.</li>
            <li>It fit perfect and worked better than the old one.</li>
            <li>I love having the dryer on the wall.  </li>

            <li>The night light is an added bonus!</li>
            <li>I love the convenience of this hairdryer.  </li>
            <li>and I love the night light that it has built into it.  </li>
            <li>One learning - be sure to clean the screen filter often as hair and lint builds up causing it to overheat.  </li>
            <li>The corn if out of the way and so easy to hang up.</li>
            <li>This one has great air flow and is smaller in size which makes it easy for kids to handle also.</li>
            <li>I had recently used a wall mounted hair dryer in a hotel and loved it because it had three speeds for heat and air flow, making it perfect to dry and style.</li>
            <li>The night light is great to have for those trips to the restroom in the middle of the night.  </li>
            <li>The wall mount feature saves counter space and is always available where needed--and in sight; no hunting required.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t care for the night lite and it has some chrome colored trim that I think is cheap looking.</li>
            <li>I liked it so much and didnt want to have to change the mount.</li>
            <li>I am waiting but want to buy another one while they are still available.</li>
            <li>the installation was quick and easy, like the size and space saving.  </li>
            <li>When done with it hangs out of the way in an accessible place to get to</li>
            <li>When I get up in the middle of the night, I don&#x27;t want bright bathroom lights in my eyes.</li>
            <li>I returned the item for a full refund.  </li>
            <li>It works great and is a strong little dryer.</li>
            <li>has been a great little dryer.</li>
            <li>I think the quality is even better than my old one</li>
            <li>I think if I would have cleaned the filter more often, I&#x27;d still be using my old one.</li>
            <li>but I do know that it is nowhere near the quality of the Sunbeam dryer that I was used to and that you find in many motels.</li>
            <li>But the dryer itself is as good as I expected it to be....</li>
            <li>After ordering two hairdryers before I found this one, you can save alot of time by just trying this first.</li>
            <li>This purchase was a replacement for one exactly like it that lasted about 15 years.</li>
            <li>The nightlight is an added bonus that the first one did not have.</li>
            <li>1500 watts is very efficient with a powerful motor.</li>
            <li>This one does exactly what I expect with style, and efficiency.  </li>
            <li>The hotel we frequent has the same wall-mounted dryer, that&#x27;s why I ordered this one because I really liked the hotel&#x27;s dryer.  </li>
            <li>Having seen the Sunbeam mounted dryer with light and 3 speeds in a hotel, I really wanted the same for home use.  </li>
            <li>Shipping was fast.</li>
            <li>The actual dryer and its handle snaps into a secure \\&quot;lock\\&quot; in the wall mount</li>
            <li>and I appreciated that.</li>
            <li>I really like this dryer.  </li>
            <li>It drys fast with a lot of power and is very convenient to use.</li>
            <li>It works well and has a very convenient wall mount.</li>
            <li>This one works as well as the old one and fit on the old mounting.  </li>
            <li>The only problem is the the dryer does not have a cool button so all you get is hot air.</li>
            <li>It wasn&#x27;t a Sunbeam/Oster brand, but when I searched, this one had the main feature I wanted.</li>
            <li>and I especially like the built-in night light that my old one didn&#x27;t have.  </li>
            <li>I asked for it to be refunded, too, since I had to pay more about the same to send it back.  </li>
            <li>I would highly recommend it to anyone.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>The air flow did not change as it should have, although it did get hotter on high than on medium.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>I have naturally curly hair and am able to blow it straighter with this dryer than with any other one I have ever tried.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a good thing that I have short hair because it would take way too long to dry my hair otherwise.  </li>
            <li>Works well, easy use and keeps the clutter down in the bathroom.  </li>
            <li>The new one is a little bit louder than the old one, but I think it&#x27;s because it&#x27;s got more power.  </li>
            <li>and I was lost without it, so I had to order a new one.</li>
            <li>My previous dryer finally broke after many years.  </li>
            <li>When it arrived, however, the item was an Oster and was very lightweight and not the same quality.  </li>
            <li>It takes up little space on the wall and it really dries my hair fast after I take a shower!</li>
            <li>Although it had 3 speeds, the medium and high speeds were the same.  </li>
            <li>The product arrived before I expected it, and was exactly what I wanted.  </li>
            <li>It operates on electricity using a standard wall outlet and there are low, medium and high settings.</li>
            <li>It is harder to turn on as the light has an extra button that is hard to press and the dryer won&#x27;t work unless it is on.  </li>

            <li> However, the cord is not all that long</li>
            <li> so this is a minor concern.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Only thing they should add is a cord hanger button like some other hairdryers have.</li>
            <li> The medium setting blows just as hard as the high and is too forceful for me to style as I dry</li>
            <li> The cord connecting the dryer to the unit hangs loose on  your bathroom vanity and that does take up space on your bathroom vanity.</li>
            <li> I purchased a so called quiet hairdryer to find it quiet but with very little air flow.</li>
            <li> Like the previous poster, I bought this as a replacement for the same one that I had for 17 years.  </li>
            <li> The last time I bought a wall mounted dryer, I tried a different brand, and was never really satisfied with it.  </li>
            <li> Not a big problem - just a little maintenance item.  </li>
            <li> I purchased this same hairdryer 10 years ago and it just wore out a few weeks ago</li>
            <li> I was not aware that it was a \\&quot;green\\&quot; product.  </li>
            <li> This appears to be an upgraded, version of what we had previously.  </li>
            <li> My wife uses it everyday.  </li>
            <li> It plugs into a wall plug so you can unplug if you are going to be gone for a few days.</li>
            <li> But their dryer is a \\&quot;normal\\&quot; one, not \\&quot;green\\&quot;, and it dries my hair in just a few minutes.  </li>
            <li> So, if you don&#x27;t want a green product and the seller isn&#x27;t upfront about his or her product being green, ask.</li>
            <li> To my disappointment, the \\&quot;three\\&quot; speed heat/air flow is only two.  </li>
            <li> I was extremely disappointed and upset that I couldn&#x27;t even use it!  </li>
            <li> I was very disappointed, but decided not to return it because the dryer was doing a \\&quot;satisfactory\\&quot; job of drying my hair.</li>

            <li> I purchased a so called quiet hairdryer to find it quiet but with very little air flow. This one has great air flow and is smaller in size which makes it easy for kids to handle also. Only thing they should add is a cord hanger button like some other hairdryers have. After ordering two hairdryers before I found this one, you can save alot of time by just trying this first.It&#x27;s a GREAT PICK !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> We had an earlier generation of the same dryer.  This appears to be an upgraded, version of what we had previously.  The wall mount feature saves counter space and is always available where needed--and in sight; no hunting required.  We don&#x27;t do \\&quot;fancy\\&quot; styling--it is a hairdryer and does what it needs to do.  The nightlight feature is also helpful.  When I get up in the middle of the night, I don&#x27;t want bright bathroom lights in my eyes.</li>
            <li> I had recently used a wall mounted hair dryer in a hotel and loved it because it had three speeds for heat and air flow, making it perfect to dry and style. It wasn&#x27;t a Sunbeam/Oster brand, but when I searched, this one had the main feature I wanted. I was hesitant to order a wall mounted, but the three-speeds won me over. To my disappointment, the \\&quot;three\\&quot; speed heat/air flow is only two.  The medium setting blows just as hard as the high and is too forceful for me to style as I dry, so I ended up purchasing what I already had... a two-speed hair dryer.</li>
            <li> My wife uses it everyday.  She used it at a resort and loved it. We purchased one for our lake home and plan to order for permanent resident.  The night light is great to have for those trips to the restroom in the middle of the night.  It plugs into a wall plug so you can unplug if you are going to be gone for a few days.</li>
            <li> This is easy to install, and great to use. This cleared off the top of the sink, and now we don&#x27;t have to worry about the kids dropping it into the sink. The night light is very bright and even my parents can see by the night light. It works great and is a strong little dryer. I would highly recommend it to anyone. PS... we are ordering one for our RV next.</li>
            <li> My previous dryer finally broke after many years.  I replaced it with the same model.  This one works as well as the old one and fit on the old mounting.  I don&#x27;t care for the night lite and it has some chrome colored trim that I think is cheap looking. I keep the safety breaker shut off when not in use to keep the night lite off. Shipping was fast.</li>
            <li> I bought my 1st Sunbeam/Oster wall mounted hairdryer about 13 years ago.  When it quit I wanted one just like it so I bought this one.  I think the quality is even better than my old one and I especially like the built-in night light that my old one didn&#x27;t have.  One learning - be sure to clean the screen filter often as hair and lint builds up causing it to overheat.  Not a big problem - just a little maintenance item.  I think if I would have cleaned the filter more often, I&#x27;d still be using my old one.</li>
            <li> I received the hairdryer (ordered Sunbeam) and nowhere on it did it claim the name Sunbeam, only Oster. I don&#x27;t know how it will last but I do know that it is nowhere near the quality of the Sunbeam dryer that I was used to and that you find in many motels. I would not buy another Oster!</li>
            <li> The only problem is the the dryer does not have a cool button so all you get is hot air.</li>
            <li> This purchase was a replacement for one exactly like it that lasted about 15 years. Works well, easy use and keeps the clutter down in the bathroom.  The nightlight is an added bonus that the first one did not have.</li>
            <li> I ordered this dryer because I had one that had blown up. I liked it so much and didnt want to have to change the mount. It fit perfect and worked better than the old one. I am waiting but want to buy another one while they are still available.</li>
            <li> Like the previous poster, I bought this as a replacement for the same one that I had for 17 years.  I had to replace it because the clips that hold the dryer finally gave out.  The new one is a little bit louder than the old one, but I think it&#x27;s because it&#x27;s got more power.  I love having the dryer on the wall.  It&#x27;s so handy.  I definitely recommend this product!!</li>
            <li> Is great for the family use and guest the installation was quick and easy, like the size and space saving.  I would recommend this product as mine has been a great little dryer.</li>
            <li> The hair dryer itself deserves 5 stars but I purchased one with the nightlight and it isn&#x27;t necessary.  It is harder to turn on as the light has an extra button that is hard to press and the dryer won&#x27;t work unless it is on.  But the dryer itself is as good as I expected it to be....would recommend it to anyone (without the nite-lite).  I have naturally curly hair and am able to blow it straighter with this dryer than with any other one I have ever tried.</li>
            <li> This is an excellent wall mounted hair dryer from Sunbeam. It takes up little space on the wall and it really dries my hair fast after I take a shower! It operates on electricity using a standard wall outlet and there are low, medium and high settings. It even has a nightlight which helps me avoid walking into bathroom walls at 3 in the morning. The actual dryer and its handle snaps into a secure \\&quot;lock\\&quot; in the wall mount so the dryer doesn&#x27;t fall out of its wall holder; and I like that, too. To release the hair dryer from the wall mount, just push on the buttons on both sides of the wall mount. The on and off buttons are inside the wall mount; you can see them after you remove the dryer from the wall mount. It&#x27;s really not that loud when you use it, either.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I only wish Sunbeam thought of some type of hanger for the cord as well. The cord connecting the dryer to the unit hangs loose on  your bathroom vanity and that does take up space on your bathroom vanity. However, the cord is not all that long so this is a minor concern.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, this hair dryer by Sunbeam is one of the best. I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Having seen the Sunbeam mounted dryer with light and 3 speeds in a hotel, I really wanted the same for home use.  When it arrived, however, the item was an Oster and was very lightweight and not the same quality.  Had it worked properly, for the price, I probably would have kept it.  Although it had 3 speeds, the medium and high speeds were the same.  The air flow did not change as it should have, although it did get hotter on high than on medium.  I prefer three speeds.  I returned the item for a full refund.  Also, the shipping was around $8.  I asked for it to be refunded, too, since I had to pay more about the same to send it back.  The company, Goodman&#x27;s, did refund their shipping charge also and I appreciated that.</li>
            <li> Years ago I bought a wall mounted hair dryer from a store and I loved it. I didn&#x27;t think they sold them anymore, but when I saw they had this one on Amazon, I had to buy it.  I love it.  It works great and I love the night light that it has built into it.  I would recommend this product to everyone.</li>
            <li> I really like this dryer.  It drys fast with a lot of power and is very convenient to use.</li>
            <li> Excellent product.  I purchased this same hairdryer 10 years ago and it just wore out a few weeks ago and I was lost without it, so I had to order a new one.</li>
            <li> Ordered this because I was pretty impressed with it when I used one at a hotel.  When I received the item, it had a 1 inch crack on the handle!  I was extremely disappointed and upset that I couldn&#x27;t even use it!  In the process of returning it.</li>
            <li> So convenient! Gives your dressing area the feel of a four star hotel. hangs out of the way yet always at arm&#x27;s length.</li>
            <li> This hair dryer is perfect for the motor home.  The installation was a very easy process.  The unit has two speeds.  I am very satisfied with this product and would recommend it.</li>
            <li> This is like being at a hotel in your own home.  It&#x27;s great to have a blower dryer on the wall all the time to just pick up and use.  This dryer also has a night light built in which is really nice.</li>
            <li> When I bought the Sunbeam 1500 Walmount Hairdryer w/light I was not aware that it was a \\&quot;green\\&quot; product.  It&#x27;s a good thing that I have short hair because it would take way too long to dry my hair otherwise.  I was very disappointed, but decided not to return it because the dryer was doing a \\&quot;satisfactory\\&quot; job of drying my hair. The hotel we frequent has the same wall-mounted dryer, that&#x27;s why I ordered this one because I really liked the hotel&#x27;s dryer.  But their dryer is a \\&quot;normal\\&quot; one, not \\&quot;green\\&quot;, and it dries my hair in just a few minutes.  So, if you don&#x27;t want a green product and the seller isn&#x27;t upfront about his or her product being green, ask.</li>
            <li> This is a great buy...similar to the ones you find at hotels. No need to leave it lying on the counter or put it away in a drawer since it just automatically shuts off when you put it neatly back in the wall mount. 1500 watts is very efficient with a powerful motor. It only has two speeds, but I would recommend this for your bathroom.</li>
            <li> I stay in hotels over 250 nights a year and find this model in most hotels and became addicted!  I have one in all the bathrooms and guest love them as well...can&#x27;t say enough!  Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> The product arrived before I expected it, and was exactly what I wanted.  The last time I bought a wall mounted dryer, I tried a different brand, and was never really satisfied with it.  This one does exactly what I expect with style, and efficiency.  The night light is an added bonus!</li>
            <li> I love the convenience of this hairdryer.  The corn if out of the way and so easy to hang up.</li>
            <li> My wife loves it. It works well and has a very convenient wall mount. If it ever wears out, we will buy another.</li>
            <li> Good hairdryer and chill chaser.  When done with it hangs out of the way in an accessible place to get to</li>
