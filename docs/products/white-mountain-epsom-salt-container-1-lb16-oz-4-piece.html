    <ol>
            <li> Awesome epsom salts. I use them almost every day.</li>
            <li> Perfect size Salt cartrons.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff. I wanted to let everyone know that the Dollar Tree Store sells this brand and size for a, wait for it...... DOLLAR !</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve bought this product many times and I have been happy every time! The salt doesn&#x27;t clump and I like having the smaller containers to the travel well.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t actually &amp;#34;love it&amp;#34; as the stars suggest, because after all, it is just Epsom salts, but I needed some and this package size was available and convenient.</li>
            <li> This is great stuff, I just wish you got more.  When I take a bath it calls for i think a cup or two and that is the whole container.  I dont think its worth the money.</li>
            <li> Item as described, fast shipping.</li>
            <li> Epsom Salt (or Magnesium Sulfate) is an old time remedy.  I soak in it every night.  Some people use it for other things, but I looked up some recent information on the benefits and found this:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There&#x27;s a nutrient that experts say helps your body produce its main source of energy and impacts at least 300 enzyme systems. It can also help treat the flu by regulating your temperature, helping you sleep, relaxing your muscles and giving you more energy.  It&#x27;s magnesium.  And compared to a century ago, the amount we consume in our diets has dropped by about 60 percent.  A lack of magnesium can contribute to dozens of health issues, including heart disease, high blood pressure, high cholesterol, anxiety, fatigue, muscle cramping and inflammation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To increase your body&#x27;s magnesium levels, doctors recommend  eating more dark greens, such as kale and collard greens, as well as nuts, pumpkin or sunflower seeds and seaweed and soaking in Epsom salt (magnesium sulfate) because magnesium is well absorbed through the skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I soak daily using 1 to 2 cups of Epsom salt per bath, but sometimes use more if I am working on especially tight muscles or a muscular injury.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t get me wrong, the item itself is great.  I love Epsom Salt baths during illness or to relieve muscular maladies.  At 2 cups per bath though these containers go fast.  I usually buy from the grocery store or local drug store at LESS THAN HALF THIS PRICE though.  Somehow I didn&#x27;t read/calculate carefully enough and I guess just figured that for the price, more than one of these half gallon containers would make it to me.  My bad, don&#x27;t make it yours!</li>
            <li> Well priced and fast shipping</li>
            <li> Come when it said it would and the packaging was great. You buy this it comes in separate little boxes. Technically on the box you&#x27;re suppose to use like half the box but I don&#x27;t I use just a little instead of all of it. Other than that, the product is great. Had no problems or worrys!</li>
            <li> This is the regular Epsom salt but gracious are these small cartons easer, particularly if you have trouble lifting the large sack.</li>
            <li> Perfect size, Just what i was looking for</li>
            <li> RECEIVED IN GOOD CONDITION AND ON TIME. I USE THIS IN MAKING MY BATH BLENDS AND MIX WITH PURE&lt;br /&gt;ESSENTIAL OILS, GREAT FOR SOAKING AFTER EXERCISE OR SHOVELING SNOW.&lt;br /&gt;FROM THE FLOWERGIRL</li>
            <li> Works great and really eases muscle tension and pain.</li>
            <li> These Four 1LB packages of Epson salts were a great find for me. The are much easier for me to use than a larger containers, due to my M.S.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have used Epson salts as a foot soak for many years.  Being born premature, I had many needle scars in both heels. This and wearing a brace is tiresome, most especially during &amp;#34;winter skin season&amp;#34;.  Using Epson salts is both soothing an helps keep my skin soft.  I would definitely recommend this product to others</li>
            <li> Product was as advertised and arrived when promised</li>
            <li> Purchased to use in my garden to feed my tomato plants.  I have 8 beautiful STURDY plants that are starting to get little tomatoes on them now.  The Epsom salts have keep the stems of my plants STRONG and unbroken through some very severe Chicago weather this past few weeks!  I am so happy I read in many of my gardening magazines about using them as support for my tomatoes, I won&#x27;t go another growing season without it ever again!</li>
            <li> Bought this for my daughter because she is a dancer and loves to soak her feet in epsom salt. She said this brand was just fine.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s the best price on Amazon at all but it&#x27;s a great product.  Epsom salt does so many things as you can easily see through googling.  What I mainly use it for is acne and muscle pain.  It&#x27;s amazing for acne and bacne!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s crazy amazing!  I have to go an a stupid two month business trip to China every year and the weather makes me break out so bad through all the sweating.  It probably wouldn&#x27;t work for everyone but it worked for me and my friend to cure our acne and bacne.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I could not believe it!  But it cleared everything in half the time as the expensive ($200) medication my derm had recommended last year.  Honestly, I would carry pounds of this stuff to China!</li>
