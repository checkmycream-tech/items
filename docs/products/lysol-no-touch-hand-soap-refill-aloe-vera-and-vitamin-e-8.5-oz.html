            <li>This is a great product and the price was very reasonable.</li>
            <li>, i love lysol</li>
            <li>I have many Lysol products in my home.</li>
            <li>Bout  these rfill bottles for use in pump which I love.</li>
            <li>Love this stuff.  </li>
            <li>so I am grateful to be able to acquire it elsewhere.</li>
            <li>but i learned to refill them myself from now on! :)</li>
            <li>I love the Lysol No-Touch Hand Soap Refill Dispenser.  </li>
            <li>I have to say I LOVE my no touch hand dispensers (bath &amp; kitchen).</li>
            <li>Then I drilled a 5/8 inch hole in the OEM Lysol refill top then inserted the tapered cork.  </li>
            <li>I love the scent  and feel of this soap.  </li>
            <li>Glad I did.</li>
            <li>This is my favorite scent.</li>
            <li>but I love this fragrance better</li>
            <li>Love the smell of this hand soap.</li>
            <li>Love this product leaves hands soft and smells good to!</li>
            <li>Love this product leaves hands soft and smells good to!</li>
            <li>I am not a big believe in antibacterial soaps but this version is very pleasant.</li>
            <li>Cannot live w/o my Lysol auto dispenser and buying the soap in bulk is great.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also an anti-bacterial soap, and most importantly it moisturizers.</li>
            <li>OK, I do like this soap and the hands free dispensers.  </li>
            <li>Find it a better method for keeping hands clean and sanitary.</li>
            <li>I found a easy solution that works for $0.20 per refill.  </li>
            <li>The soap itself is fine.</li>
            <li>The product itself is OK, but is it really worth $5</li>
            <li>smells so good and make your hands soft</li>
            <li>This soap keeps your hands soft and smell good.  </li>
            <li>The cost is not prohibitive and the increased sanitation from not touching the soap dispenser is priceless.</li>
            <li>JUST KEEP DISPENSER CLEAN AND</li>
            <li>Pleasant smell and the dispenser delivers just enough soap to clan hands, but not be wasteful.</li>
            <li>The product itself leaves your hands soft &amp; smelling nice.</li>
            <li>The clear ones (like cucumber splash) kept well, but the cloudy one, the aloe, grew some kind of mold in it.</li>
            <li>I am pregnant right now and can&#x27;t stand the smell of anything...except this soap!</li>
            <li>I love that I can get in on Amazon now and at a decent price.</li>
            <li>But I only hope it gets a lot more cheaper when you buy more.</li>
            <li>Came just as pictured and order came quick.</li>
            <li>I was reluctant to try something new that I couldn&#x27;t try ahead of time, but already I want to buy more of this</li>
            <li>I try to look for the bargains like most people &amp; find that the 4 pack usually offers this for me.</li>
            <li>so it was worth buying.</li>
            <li>they work as expected and are fairly pricey</li>
            <li>I drilled a whole in the top and just cover it with a clear piece of tape and refill them myself, saves SOOOO much money!!!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a tad expensive, but it has a nice, pleasant scent.</li>
            <li>and I live in a fairly medium size town with multiple size big box stores and many well known grocery chains.  </li>
            <li>Fast delivery, too!  </li>
            <li>Look at the bottom and the old style has two recessed holes to fit the pins in the unit.  </li>
            <li>It was what I wanted but higher priced than Wal Mart</li>
            <li>If you wash your hands a lot or live in a drier area, it&#x27;s definitely nice to have a soap that actually moisturizers your hands instead of drying them out.</li>
            <li>The Lysol No-Touch hand soap leaves my hands feeling soft and clean.  </li>
            <li>The Aloe Vera &amp; Vitamin E makes my hands really soft while ensuring they are thoroughly clean.</li>
            <li>And these has made mines soft and clean.</li>
            <li>I not only love the Lysol no hands soap dispenser, but really need it to fight germs and disease.</li>
            <li>I really like this Aloe Vera one.  </li>
            <li>Really softens hands.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s much creamier.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Since I already had 3 of this scent I would have appreciated getting the item</li>
            <li>Luckily these refills that I ordered from Amazon were just what I needed although I could not find any refills locally</li>
            <li>Being able to buy a multiple count package was an extra bonus.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it to everyone.</li>
            <li>The Aloe Very does not dry out my hands as much.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t live without them......</li>
            <li>It says it prevents from touching a dirty or germ filled soap pump</li>
            <li>The aloe in this product helps keep my hands soft being that my hands are always in water.</li>
            <li>Drilled a matching hole and it worked in the old unit.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not harsh on the skin and keeps your hands moisturized.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using these Lysol Aloe Vera soft soap refills for about three years.</li>
            <li>No waste.</li>
            <li>(just don&#x27;t buy these individually, always buy in 4 packs and only buy the scents that are reasonably priced at the time, they always fluctuate and sometimes your favourite scent will be twice the price, just wait, you&#x27;ll find it again for the &amp;#34;normal&amp;#34; price).</li>
            <li>now I only use it when I absolutely need it and have gone back to a regular soap dispenser the rest of the time.</li>
            <li>The soap is OK, but I discovered too late I can purchase the same refills for a lot less at the local Kroger.</li>

            <li> These items are easy to work with and aren&#x27;t too expensive, expecially if bought in bulk.  </li>
            <li> This has been cleaning my family&#x27;s hands for a long time now.</li>
            <li> The batteries on the dispenser do last a long time, but sometimes motion of the boat triggers the sensor, so I turn it off when we are underway if it&#x27;s rough.</li>
            <li> Same as my other review.</li>
            <li> Aloe vera and Vitamin E Scent gives the soap a subtle smell that is gentle to the hands too.  </li>
            <li> received 4 bottles of soap,  loose in a zippered plastic bag, in a box with NO paperwork.&lt;br</li>
            <li> have several handsfree soap dispensers in house... cuts down on germs by sharing bars of soap...  </li>
            <li> I work with people all of the time since I am a nurse, and I HATE having to go shopping on my days off--dealing with more people!  </li>
            <li> Arrived timely and as expected.</li>
            <li> I like that every drop of soap is used when empty.  </li>
            <li> It is what was expected</li>
            <li> Some of the other sense are kid of medicinal, like you&#x27;d find in the doctors office.  </li>
            <li> They are hard to find in my local area markets</li>
            <li> BTW it is hard to find the soap in our local stores.  </li>
            <li> Like this one, but other options are tempting!</li>
            <li> but I still think the price is a little pricey for what you get in each bottle</li>
            <li> Would not fit.  </li>
            <li> It is less expensive to buy them in a 4 pack</li>
            <li> While I like having the option of getting soap without touching the nozzle especially after cutting chicken the refills are horribly expensive.&lt;br /&gt;For</li>
            <li> but this is dumb.</li>
            <li> The dispenser has started randomly releasing soap though</li>
            <li> Amazon saved me from having to throw away the dispenser and being seriously frustrated.</li>
            <li> But, $20 for a 4 pack is outrageous!!!  </li>

            <li> So much better than keeping a bar of soap on the counter!</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for over a year.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know what I&#x27;ll do if you ever stop selling these on line....  I can&#x27;t live without them......</li>
            <li> I love the smell! I am pregnant right now and can&#x27;t stand the smell of anything...except this soap! I was reluctant to try something new that I couldn&#x27;t try ahead of time, but already I want to buy more of this so I never run out.</li>
            <li> I have &amp; use 3 of the Lysol No-Touch hand soap dispensers in our home &amp; prefer the Lysol Aloe Vera Refills. They are hard to find in my local area markets so I prefer to buy via Amazon. I try to look for the bargains like most people &amp; find that the 4 pack usually offers this for me. The product itself leaves your hands soft &amp; smelling nice.</li>
            <li> I work with people all of the time since I am a nurse, and I HATE having to go shopping on my days off--dealing with more people!  Plus, I would never remember what brand my no-touch hand soap dispenser was when I was out shopping, so this was ideal to order for me and my family!  Great price, and I&#x27;ve got extras for the future!  Fast delivery, too!  As a nurse, I love the fact that this product goes in my &amp;#34;no-touch&amp;#34; dispenser!  No germ contact!</li>
            <li> These are the dumbes ideas ever! It says it prevents from touching a dirty or germ filled soap pump but YOU ARE WASHING YOUR HANDS ANYWAY!!!!!!!!!!!!  I dont like this, i love lysol but this is dumb.</li>
            <li> perfect method of getting these</li>
            <li> Perfect.  Just what I wanted, refills for my Lysol No-Touch Hand Soap Dispenser.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using these for years. The cost is not prohibitive and the increased sanitation from not touching the soap dispenser is priceless. (just don&#x27;t buy these individually, always buy in 4 packs and only buy the scents that are reasonably priced at the time, they always fluctuate and sometimes your favourite scent will be twice the price, just wait, you&#x27;ll find it again for the &amp;#34;normal&amp;#34; price).</li>
            <li> The soap itself is fine. The dispenser has started randomly releasing soap though (we&#x27;ve tried changing the battery, turning it on/off, etc), and it hasn&#x27;t been a year since we bought it.</li>
            <li> The Lysol No-Touch hand soap leaves my hands feeling soft and clean.  I also like the scent. I highly recommend it to everyone.</li>
            <li> I have many Lysol products in my home. The aloe in this product helps keep my hands soft being that my hands are always in water.</li>
            <li> Love this product leaves hands soft and smells good to! And another good thing is it is antibacterial which is a good thing this time of year!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> I always use this No-touch hand soap refill as my daily hand wash .&lt;br /&gt;I like it but will change to nature material made to avoid chemical  in the future.</li>
            <li> Lysol is an industry standard you can trust.  Aloe vera and Vitamin E Scent gives the soap a subtle smell that is gentle to the hands too.  I love it!</li>
            <li> it smells just wonderful ! works great &amp; cleans just great too !</li>
            <li> Arrived timely and as expected.</li>
            <li> This has been cleaning my family&#x27;s hands for a long time now. I love that I can get in on Amazon now and at a decent price.</li>
            <li> I am not a big believe in antibacterial soaps but this version is very pleasant.</li>
            <li> The product itself is OK, but is it really worth $5+ each?  Not in my opinion.  I have bought a refillable one; The Simply Human brand and it&#x27;s excellent!</li>
            <li> Just got these today.  It is less expensive to buy them in a 4 pack but I still think the price is a little pricey for what you get in each bottle</li>
            <li> Bout  these rfill bottles for use in pump which I love. have put one in  every sink in my house.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lila</li>
            <li> smells so good and make your hands soft</li>
            <li> Use this refill in my Lysol dispenser. The Aloe Very does not dry out my hands as much.</li>
            <li> I had an earlier version of the pump and now they have come out with a &amp;#34;fancier&amp;#34; version.  I ordered these thinking they would work with my earlier version. Would not fit.  Look at the bottom and the old style has two recessed holes to fit the pins in the unit.  This has only one.  Got my drill out.  Drilled a matching hole and it worked in the old unit.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff.  My local stores no longer stock it so I am grateful to be able to acquire it elsewhere.</li>
            <li> Use this product daily in kitchen and bathrooms.  Find it a better method for keeping hands clean and sanitary.</li>
            <li> got these on sale for a discount so it was worth buying. they work as expected and are fairly pricey but i learned to refill them myself from now on! :)</li>
            <li> Smells good and does a great job at washing your hands. I love the convenience of the auto dispense! I use it in the kitchen</li>
            <li> After purchasing an automatic soap dispenser for my kitchen sink I could not find the correct size of refills since Lysol had manufactured two different, yet similar dispeners which used different size refills. Luckily these refills that I ordered from Amazon were just what I needed although I could not find any refills locally and I live in a fairly medium size town with multiple size big box stores and many well known grocery chains.  Amazon saved me from having to throw away the dispenser and being seriously frustrated.Being able to buy a multiple count package was an extra bonus.</li>
            <li> The soap is OK, but I discovered too late I can purchase the same refills for a lot less at the local Kroger.</li>
            <li> These items are easy to work with and aren&#x27;t too expensive, expecially if bought in bulk.  I really like this Aloe Vera one.  It&#x27;s not harsh on the skin and keeps your hands moisturized.  Some of the other sense are kid of medicinal, like you&#x27;d find in the doctors office.  I like this one best so far.</li>
            <li> Like this one, but other options are tempting! May try another on next order!</li>
            <li> Pleasant smell and the dispenser delivers just enough soap to clan hands, but not be wasteful.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a tad expensive, but it has a nice, pleasant scent. It&#x27;s also an anti-bacterial soap, and most importantly it moisturizers. If you wash your hands a lot or live in a drier area, it&#x27;s definitely nice to have a soap that actually moisturizers your hands instead of drying them out.</li>
            <li> Great price quick delivery</li>
            <li> I love the Lysol No-Touch Hand Soap Refill Dispenser.  The Aloe Vera &amp; Vitamin E makes my hands really soft while ensuring they are thoroughly clean.</li>
            <li> I have to say I LOVE my no touch hand dispensers (bath &amp; kitchen). However these soaps cost a fortune. I drilled a whole in the top and just cover it with a clear piece of tape and refill them myself, saves SOOOO much money!!!</li>
            <li> OK, I do like this soap and the hands free dispensers.  But, $20 for a 4 pack is outrageous!!!  I found a easy solution that works for $0.20 per refill.  I purchased tapered bottle corks on Amazon for $6 (pack of 6).  Then I drilled a 5/8 inch hole in the OEM Lysol refill top then inserted the tapered cork.  Works perfectly, and it now only costs 20 cents to refill and it works flawlessly!</li>
            <li> Arrived on time very satisfied</li>
            <li> Really softens hands.</li>
            <li> It was what I wanted but higher priced than Wal Mart</li>
            <li> Have been using this product for quite sometime.  The only reason I did not give 5 stars is the fact that I would like to have had a variety pack.</li>
            <li> This is a great product and the price was very reasonable.</li>
            <li> Great for guest bathrooms and has a really nice clean smell to it.  Cleans and makes your hand feel good also.</li>
            <li> Love this product leaves hands soft and smells good to! And another good thing is it is antibacterial which is a good thing this time of year. But I only hope it gets a lot more cheaper when you buy more.</li>
            <li> I love the scent  and feel of this soap.  Always have it &#x27;on-hand.&#x27;  I love all of the no-touch line of products, but this is my favorite!</li>
            <li> While I like having the option of getting soap without touching the nozzle especially after cutting chicken the refills are horribly expensive.&lt;br /&gt;For me personally I think you get double the soap you need in each squirt and I don&#x27;t think there is a way to adjust the amount that is dispensed.&lt;br /&gt;So now I only use it when I absolutely need it and have gone back to a regular soap dispenser the rest of the time.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using these Lysol Aloe Vera soft soap refills for about three years. I not only love the Lysol no hands soap dispenser, but really need it to fight germs and disease. This white creamy moisturizing aloe soap is the only type that I buy.</li>
            <li> Was looking for another scent. Saw these were cheaper, so I bought them. Glad I did. They are for cleaning your hand. And these has made mines soft and clean. And getting four is a good bargain.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite scent. I&#x27;ve tried all of them but I love this fragrance better and it&#x27;s much creamier.</li>
            <li> Cannot live w/o my Lysol auto dispenser and buying the soap in bulk is great.  BTW it is hard to find the soap in our local stores.  Tis is good soap, I recommend it with its auto dispenser.  This is a repeat buy for me and will continue to do so.</li>
            <li> Love the smell of this hand soap.</li>
            <li> I like not having to touch the soap dispenser to get soap.  This soap keeps your hands soft and smell good.  I like that every drop of soap is used when empty.  No waste.</li>
            <li> Great value for being able to shop from my computer and recieve a product in bulk and be exactally what we need</li>
            <li> We were heading out of the US on a boat and I bought some of the multi-packs to save money and because I thought I would not find refills where we were going. The clear ones (like cucumber splash) kept well, but the cloudy one, the aloe, grew some kind of mold in it. We thought it was just separating because of summer heat so we put it into the dispenser, and our handwashes started to smell moldy! Avoid buying the non-clear refills in bulk: buy and use immediately if you have to have the extra hand conditioners. The batteries on the dispenser do last a long time, but sometimes motion of the boat triggers the sensor, so I turn it off when we are underway if it&#x27;s rough.</li>
            <li> have several handsfree soap dispensers in house... cuts down on germs by sharing bars of soap...  will continue to by these refills in various sccents...</li>
            <li> I like this soap but IT WAS NOT WHAT I ORDERED!&lt;br /&gt;I ordered a different Lysol soap and was sent this scent NOT packaged as shown.&lt;br /&gt;I received 4 bottles of soap,  loose in a zippered plastic bag, in a box with NO paperwork.&lt;br /&gt;Since I already had 3 of this scent I would have appreciated getting the item I ordered.&lt;br /&gt;I kept the product because I didn&#x27;t want to fool with returning it and it is an item I will use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lysol is a good product BUT the company that shipped it could use some training especially since I responded to their survey and got no response!</li>
            <li> works great with the dispencer</li>
            <li> Came just as pictured and order came quick.</li>
            <li> Love it!!  JUST KEEP DISPENSER CLEAN AND BATTERIES GOOD...</li>
            <li> It is what was expected</li>
            <li> Same as my other review.</li>
