            <li>, I use it along with tanning lotion works great</li>
            <li>Smells divine with great oils &amp; without too many chemicals!  </li>
            <li>You get what you pay for, and if you like oil intensifiers, then this may be a good product for you.  </li>
            <li>It does not smell good at all</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s definitely good for your skin while tanning.</li>
            <li>IT IS A GOOD ITEM</li>
            <li>The price is great, it moisturizes great, it smells amazing and the package got here really quick.</li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>Got a nice tan throughout the summer.</li>
            <li>Keeps me nicely tanning.</li>
            <li>I am light skinned with now a year around golden tan-not orange plus a great skin moisturizer!</li>
            <li>I find it better to use sun bathing.</li>
            <li>Love the product.</li>
            <li>I got a lovely tan on the samll areas that I applied it to.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a lovely Brown Skinned Sister and this tanning oil</li>
            <li>I have used it for 2 years and expect to continue as my favorite.</li>
            <li>BUT I LIKE THE ACCELERATOR BETTER.</li>
            <li>Am enjoying it right now at the pool.</li>
            <li>it actually worked better out in the sun!</li>
            <li>so you will get a nice, quick, dark tan as advertised</li>
            <li>Very fast shipping.</li>
            <li>I love Australian Gold tanning products.  </li>
            <li>Loved the way this oil made me tam, fast and dark!</li>
            <li>/&gt;Yes, its really oily, hence oil.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t take a whole lot.</li>
            <li>Thanks.</li>
            <li>Smells goo and moisturizes very well.</li>

            <li>I don&#x27;t know that it works any better than any other tanning product</li>
            <li>Just make sure the UV index is high for the day and you&#x27;ll get that dark luster you have always been looking for.</li>
            <li>The good thing is that you don&#x27;t smell strong or bad after tanning.</li>
            <li>I am going to purchese this product today 8/21/2014 and use it for the rest of the Hot Sunny Days we have left!  </li>
            <li>Oh the tanned ares is still quite dark and pretty!  </li>
            <li>Its a lot cheaper than a lot of high end tanners, but you get the same results.&lt;br</li>

            <li> Its a lot cheaper than a lot of high end tanners, but you get the same results.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I used this with Australian Gold Dry Oil Intensifier.  </li>
            <li> I once was white but now am black.</li>
            <li> I decided to go dark with Australian Gold Dark Tanning Accelerator.  </li>
            <li> It has no sunscreen so be very careful.</li>
            <li> This stuff has made me dark.</li>
            <li> I have had trouble keeping my husband out of it.  </li>
            <li> I suggest if you don&#x27;t have a base tan started, spend a little time out there with it on maybe 5 to 10 minutes the first few times to achieve a base tan if you haven&#x27;t already, people expect results the first time for about 20 - 3 hours all that will do is destroy your skin.</li>
            <li> I used a small dab for this from a Friend while on the Beach.  </li>
            <li> nothing out of the ordinary...</li>
            <li> To me, the product is too hard to rinse off and too runny/messy while applying.</li>
            <li> What disappointed me about this product was that I was looking for something with a coconut smell and several reviews said this product had that.</li>
            <li> Australian Gold does not make a bad product!</li>
            <li> We all know tanning is bad for us, but we continue to do it.</li>
            <li> but it burned me so bad I had blisters all over my skin.  </li>
    </ol>

    <ol>
            <li> this stuff has no sun screen so you will get a nice, quick, dark tan as advertised however it will also allow you to get a severe sunburn if you are not careful about how long you are in the sun.</li>
            <li> This is the greatest tan enhancer! Smells divine with great oils &amp; without too many chemicals!  And it works! I am light skinned with now a year around golden tan-not orange plus a great skin moisturizer!</li>
            <li> I love this stuff I used it before I started self tanning, but sadly I needed to stop using self tanner after I became a mother. Its a lot cheaper than a lot of high end tanners, but you get the same results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yes, its really oily, hence oil. We all know tanning is bad for us, but we continue to do it. I suggest if you don&#x27;t have a base tan started, spend a little time out there with it on maybe 5 to 10 minutes the first few times to achieve a base tan if you haven&#x27;t already, people expect results the first time for about 20 - 3 hours all that will do is destroy your skin. It has no sunscreen so be very careful. I find it better to use sun bathing. I&#x27;ve had no problem with washing this stuff off. Everybody is different so see for yourself!</li>
            <li> Love the product. Works as it should.</li>
            <li> Holy darkness. I once was white but now am black. This stuff has made me dark. I kinda did the opposite of Micheal Jackson. He decided to go white with bleach. I decided to go dark with Australian Gold Dark Tanning Accelerator.  Doesn&#x27;t take a whole lot. Just make sure the UV index is high for the day and you&#x27;ll get that dark luster you have always been looking for.</li>
            <li> Works as advertised. Got a nice tan throughout the summer. Thanks.</li>
            <li> Australian Gold does not make a bad product! Love it!</li>
            <li> You get what you pay for, and if you like oil intensifiers, then this may be a good product for you.  To me, the product is too hard to rinse off and too runny/messy while applying.</li>
            <li> I bought this based on reviews I read. I like using the oil in stand up tanning bed. I don&#x27;t know that it works any better than any other tanning product but I feel like it helps keep my skin moisturized during the tanning process. What disappointed me about this product was that I was looking for something with a coconut smell and several reviews said this product had that. Believe me it smells nothing like coconuts!!  It does not smell good at all but I have got to the point that I can tolerate the smell. The good thing is that you don&#x27;t smell strong or bad after tanning.</li>
            <li> I get the best tan with this stuff!</li>
            <li> I used a small dab for this from a Friend while on the Beach.  This STUFF works great!  I got a lovely tan on the samll areas that I applied it to. I am going to purchese this product today 8/21/2014 and use it for the rest of the Hot Sunny Days we have left!  Oh the tanned ares is still quite dark and pretty!  I&#x27;m a lovely Brown Skinned Sister and this tanning oil turned me in to a  5&#x27;9 CHOCOLATE GODDESS!!</li>
            <li> I have the best tan i have ever had with this.  I have had trouble keeping my husband out of it.  LOL.  Very fast shipping.</li>
            <li> It prob. works but it burned me so bad I had blisters all over my skin.  I used this with Australian Gold Dry Oil Intensifier.  OOH THE PAIN!!!</li>
            <li> I love Australian Gold tanning products.  Have used them for years.  This arrived on time and in excellent condition.  Am enjoying it right now at the pool.</li>
            <li> nothing out of the ordinary...it actually worked better out in the sun!</li>
            <li> I like the oil it gives my body a glowing tan , I use it along with tanning lotion works great</li>
            <li> Smells goo and moisturizes very well. Keeps me nicely tanning. I have used it for 2 years and expect to continue as my favorite.</li>

            <li> IT IS A GOOD ITEM BUT I LIKE THE ACCELERATOR BETTER. ONLY THING I DIDNT LIKE IS THE GREASY FELLING</li>
            <li> Loved the way this oil made me tam, fast and dark! I&#x27;d recommend it to anyone that spends any time in the sun</li>
