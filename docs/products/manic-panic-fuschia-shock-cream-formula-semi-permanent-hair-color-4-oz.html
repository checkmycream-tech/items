            <li>Love Manic Panic!</li>
            <li>haven&#x27;t tried it out yet, but i&#x27;m very excited to!</li>
            <li>We didn&#x27;t even apply heat.&lt;br /&gt;Afterwards, we rinsed her hair (didn&#x27;t wash it), and it looked simply amazing.</li>
            <li>The jar arrived nicely wrapped and in a plastic bag.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a nice red-violet wine-ish color.</li>
            <li>but the end product is reallyyyy nice</li>
            <li>It came out a nice red/purplish/pinkish color on my pre-bleached hair.</li>
            <li>Love love love manic panic!!</li>
            <li>Beautiful fuchsia pigment, easy to apply and doesn&#x27;t have strong smell.</li>
            <li>A really pretty color, and lasts a good while too!</li>

            <li>Work great, gave my hair a super bright bold color without using bleach</li>
            <li>and it still is vibrant and gorgeous and its almost march!</li>
            <li>Super pigmented, wonderfully bright dye.  </li>
            <li>More on the purple side than the picture looks.</li>
            <li>and when I was done I put more dye in and coconut oil in to make it pop more</li>
            <li>well I love it...</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this color.</li>
            <li>love Manic Panic.</li>
            <li>Now I&#x27;m 37 and sharing it with my daughter. :)</li>
            <li>I love the color a lot</li>
            <li>I would recommend this to anyone looking for some fun bright color to add to their do.</li>
            <li>I love this color in my hair.</li>
            <li>it looks more brown.</li>
            <li>Fantastic dye!</li>
            <li>Most of the pigment took best where my hair isn&#x27;t so chemically treated with dark color.&lt;br /&gt;Some</li>
            <li>Came quick and my kids love</li>
            <li>but assumed they wouldn&#x27;t put one color on the bottle then another in the bottle but will be sure to check it first</li>
            <li>Excited to see the results.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s still a hot reddish-pink in the jar and came out more of a dark fuchsia in my hair, and it&#x27;s a beautiful color, just not what you see</li>
            <li>a warning though, came right out when my girls went to the pool!</li>
            <li>I do know that since we are only using as a rise the color is not going to be bright (we are not using bleach) but..........</li>
            <li>it looks cool.</li>
            <li>COOL</li>
            <li>SO IT LOOKS SUPER ELECTRIC PURPLE/FUCHSIA.</li>
            <li>The important step is to clean the surfaces quick so the pigment doesn&#x27;t have too much time to sit and get absorbed.</li>
            <li>I used a lot less dye than the girl did at the salon but still got great coverage.</li>
            <li>so it looks nice, but it looks red.</li>
            <li>and I got it pretty quickly in the mail.</li>
            <li>I honestly thought it was my purple haze at first before I read what color it actually was.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used this dye for years and it&#x27;s fantastic for creating vibrant colors.</li>
            <li>After I put the Fuchsia Shock in, it was just the perfect shade, not too light and not too dark but very vivid especially in sunlight.  </li>
            <li>love the color, I barely had to lighten my hair.</li>
            <li>The color is FUSCHIA shock, its more of a red or maroon color if you are wanting the BRIGHT PINK like on bottle</li>
            <li>It always comes out great, and the only two downsides are that it doesn&#x27;t come with gloves (most hair dyes do) and it makes a mess of the bathroom!</li>
            <li>Mixed about 3 parts conditioner 1 part dye and still got brilliant color that left my hair super soft.</li>
            <li>I have used many colors of Manic Panic and this one seemed to be the most messy</li>
            <li>I loved the color in the jar but on my hair it was a mess.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used lots of different manic panic colors and this is my new favorite!</li>
            <li>The color is really pretty.</li>
            <li>This is exactly the color I had been hoping for.  </li>
            <li>so I had to use a bleach kit first.  </li>
            <li>but I get many compliments on it and will probably purchase it again in the future.</li>
            <li>Would probably be more red on darker hair.</li>
            <li>My highlights hold the color better than the undyed parts of my hair so if you want longer lasting brighter color I would suggest bleaching first.  </li>
            <li>When I first put it in it was more of a purple then faded into a wine red now</li>
            <li>The color is amazing though and totally worth the mess.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s easier to fade away compared to purple haze and other kind of purple color.</li>
            <li>and it comes out pretty fast.</li>
            <li>Very vibrant color, color still coming out in shower.</li>
            <li>This color is vibrant and lasts forever!</li>
            <li>Extremely vibrant, with bleach first or not.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love Manic Panic and have used it numerous times, but this particular kind seemed messier than usual.</li>
            <li>Bought this to freshen up my salon hair color, which is a bright pink with red undertones.</li>
            <li>Arrived very timely.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>It coordinates well with my 5r light red brown hair.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>and I did the whole process</li>
            <li>I only bleached it until my hair was a light orangish color.  </li>
            <li>you&#x27;ll dye everything you love pink.</li>
            <li>However, this particular shade, for whatever reason, is VERY stain and bleed-prone.</li>
            <li>It is the easiest thing to apply to your hair and i would highly recommend it to anyone who wants quality hair dye for their locks.</li>
            <li>My color looks salon new again!</li>
            <li>and she&#x27;s washed her hair twice since then and still the color is as vibrant.</li>
            <li>Dyed hair 2+ weeks and still vibrant.</li>
            <li>It has vibrant look</li>
            <li>Hopefully it will stop bleeding so much after a few washes (I shampood 3 times on the first rinse), but I&#x27;m hesitate to use it again because the bleeding is a huge pain.</li>
            <li>Seems to wash out okay, but if you don&#x27;t rinse long enough</li>
            <li>I was really hoping for the hot pink color shown in the photo here, but the product is much redder than that.</li>
            <li>So to anyone using this producf, i would recommend it only if you are dying more hair than i was or if you don&#x27;t mind having all your hair pink.</li>
            <li>I dyed the tips of my naturally blonde and highlighted hair without using bleach first.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried pretty much every shade of pink or purple but never fuchia shock.</li>
            <li>The only issue is that this dye bleeds for a while after you first do it, so you need to be careful with towels, pillowcases, and shirts at first.</li>
            <li>I had to use straight bleach all over the bathroom to get rid of the dye, and am still (a week later) getting color transfer on my pillow and clothes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Even if you rinse it for a long time, you&#x27;ll see it on your pillow and shirts for the first week or two.</li>
            <li>I have natural blonde hair and this dye stays vibrant in my hair for 3-4 months without having to redo it.</li>
            <li>This particular one stains worse than most.</li>
            <li>It does fade pretty fast but since it does not have harsh chemicals I can retouch it when ever.</li>
            <li>The pink washed out the first time I took a shower.</li>
            <li>finish dyed color is a dark deep Pink which looks super pretty.</li>
            <li>Some bleach shower spray took care of that quickly but after several washes my white pillow case is still hot pink and the back of my neck stayed pink for about a week after I put the color on.  </li>
            <li>AND I BARELY</li>
            <li>My hair is a coffee brown and natural and it can be seen without any bleaching prior.</li>
            <li>the color when you first get it out of the package and before you open the bottle is very dark.</li>
            <li>No seriously, this is very very pink.</li>
            <li>I looked a mess and made a huge mess in my bathroom.</li>

            <li> AND I BARELY</li>
            <li> My hair is a coffee brown and natural and it can be seen without any bleaching prior.</li>
            <li> the color when you first get it out of the package and before you open the bottle is very dark.</li>
            <li> No seriously, this is very very pink.</li>
            <li> I looked a mess and made a huge mess in my bathroom.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s worth having pink hands for a few days.</li>
            <li> : (  I re did the pink with Manic Panic and my hair looks great.</li>
            <li> My natural hair color is medium to dark brown with red under tones.</li>
            <li> I tried two different Manic Panic colors on my daughter (a blue and a pink).</li>
            <li> I think the color is a lot of fun and doesn&#x27;t last too long that I get tired of it.  </li>
            <li> it does not stay long even when heat is used...</li>
            <li> The actual color of the hair dye looks nothing like the one showed it&#x27;s not that pink.</li>
            <li> When i used this product i intended to only dye the bottom, under layer of my hair pink.</li>
            <li> When i washed out the dye, it seeped into the rest of my hair and the bottom 8 inches of my hair were deeply tinted pink.</li>
            <li> That being said, the product stayed in a long time for a semi-permanent dye, which was what i was hoping for!</li>
            <li> Also did not leave hair feeling dry or straw-like.</li>
            <li> My bathtub was pink, shower curtain, walls, pillow case, several shirts, I even had pink spots on my legs or if I scratched my head and touched something afterwards.  </li>
            <li> I have dark brown hair, did not bleach, left color on for 3 hours.</li>
            <li> , my hair is dirty blonde naturally and it took the color really well.</li>
            <li> the only problem is it&#x27;s a freaking mess like I had it all over me</li>
            <li> Love the color to bad</li>
            <li> My hands and face are all pink after washing it out and it still comes off on my hand if I rub my head.</li>
            <li> (minus the roots, but that&#x27;s unavoidable).</li>
            <li> Even stained my hands pink when I was washing it out</li>
            <li> so I had my hair bleached and dyed with a pink and purple from pravana.</li>
            <li> My hair dresser was amazed when i told her i died my hair pink at christmas</li>
            <li> AND IT DYED TH REST OF MY HAIR PINK.</li>
            <li> i bought this hoping to try out the color pink since that&#x27;s the one color I have yet to have my hair.</li>
            <li> Everything is pink.</li>
            <li> I can now have pink hair</li>
            <li> This hasn&#x27;t happened with any of the other colors I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> But I&#x27;ve had stray grey hairs for a few years now</li>
            <li> so I color my roots with medium chocolate brown color and every other month</li>
            <li> After and Epic fail with another brand of pink hair color, I checked out Amazon&#x27;s reviews to see which dye to try next.</li>
            <li> This will stain everything it touches except your hair, seems to wash out faster than Splat or other semi-permanent hair colors.</li>
            <li> The color starts out dark fuchsia, almost purple and fades to cotton candy pink in about 4 weeks.  </li>
            <li> I had to get a drastic haircut to hide the unintended pink!</li>
            <li> and I have a medium to dark brown hair</li>
            <li> She has dark brown hair.</li>
            <li> IT washes out easily so just use cold water when shampooing to slow down the fading process.</li>
            <li> I have naturally dark brown, almost black hair</li>
            <li> All I did was put a little bit in with my conditioner and let the mixture sit on my hair while I showered (5-10 mins), then rinsed.</li>
            <li> and we dried it.</li>
            <li> few warnings though:&lt;br</li>
            <li> people pointed out that this hair dye gets very messy, it does.</li>
            <li> Scrubbing bubbles and Lysol wipes work well to remove the stains in the hard surfaces of the bathroom.</li>
            <li> dirty blonde hair after washing it with dish soap to rid it of all oils</li>
            <li> SO NOW INSTEAD OF AN EVEN AMOUNT OF HILITES, I HAVE FADED OMBRE PINK AND SOME CRAZY HIGHLIGHTS.</li>
            <li> Am I doing something wrong?</li>
            <li> or I just got a bad batch.</li>
            <li> AND IT DOESNT LOOK BAD.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Awesome colors! Arrived in a week i am sooooo happy! Thank you guys!</li>
            <li> I loved the color in the jar but on my hair it was a mess. I looked a mess and made a huge mess in my bathroom. I did this months ago and the stain is still on my grout in my shower.</li>
            <li> I use Manic Panic all the time. Have for years. I&#x27;ve tried pretty much every shade of pink or purple but never fuchia shock. The color is really pretty. More on the purple side than the picture looks. However, this particular shade, for whatever reason, is VERY stain and bleed-prone. My hands and face are all pink after washing it out and it still comes off on my hand if I rub my head. This hasn&#x27;t happened with any of the other colors I&#x27;ve used. I&#x27;m worried about what it&#x27;s going to do to my pillow tonight. Hopefully it will stop bleeding so much after a few washes (I shampood 3 times on the first rinse), but I&#x27;m hesitate to use it again because the bleeding is a huge pain. Don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s the shade or I just got a bad batch.</li>
            <li> Very nice bright color</li>
            <li> Super pigmented, wonderfully bright dye.  Mixed about 3 parts conditioner 1 part dye and still got brilliant color that left my hair super soft. The only issue is that this dye bleeds for a while after you first do it, so you need to be careful with towels, pillowcases, and shirts at first.</li>
            <li> Beautiful fuchsia pigment, easy to apply and doesn&#x27;t have strong smell. But I might need to bleach my hair next time for it to take a lighter shade. I did a strand &amp;#34;test&amp;#34; on the back of my head. My natural hair color is medium to dark brown with red under tones. But I&#x27;ve had stray grey hairs for a few years now so I color my roots with medium chocolate brown color and every other month I do the ends to refresh the shade.&lt;br /&gt;The finish dyed color is a dark deep Pink which looks super pretty. Most of the pigment took best where my hair isn&#x27;t so chemically treated with dark color.&lt;br /&gt;Some people pointed out that this hair dye gets very messy, it does. I do my hair color at home, so I have the stain remover. The important step is to clean the surfaces quick so the pigment doesn&#x27;t have too much time to sit and get absorbed. Scrubbing bubbles and Lysol wipes work well to remove the stains in the hard surfaces of the bathroom.</li>
            <li> the color when you first get it out of the package and before you open the bottle is very dark. I honestly thought it was my purple haze at first before I read what color it actually was. haven&#x27;t tried it out yet, but i&#x27;m very excited to!</li>
            <li> Bought this to freshen up my salon hair color, which is a bright pink with red undertones. This did the job perfectly. All I did was put a little bit in with my conditioner and let the mixture sit on my hair while I showered (5-10 mins), then rinsed. My color looks salon new again! (minus the roots, but that&#x27;s unavoidable). Do recommend!</li>
            <li> This review is for all three colors. Came quick and my kids love it looks cool.</li>
            <li> I love Manic Panic and have used it numerous times, but this particular kind seemed messier than usual. The color is amazing though and totally worth the mess.</li>
            <li> Awesome product! Love Manic Panic! This color is vibrant and lasts forever!</li>
            <li> After and Epic fail with another brand of pink hair color, I checked out Amazon&#x27;s reviews to see which dye to try next. This was the chosen one. And I am thrilled! This will forever be our go-to brand!&lt;br /&gt;We streaked a chunk of my daughters dirty blonde hair after washing it with dish soap to rid it of all oils and we dried it. Then we applied product with a brush, wrapped in foil so it didn&#x27;t stain surrounding hair, and left in for 40 minutes. (It doesn&#x27;t harm your hair it conditions it.) We didn&#x27;t even apply heat.&lt;br /&gt;Afterwards, we rinsed her hair (didn&#x27;t wash it), and it looked simply amazing. It&#x27;s been 5 days since it&#x27;s been applied and she&#x27;s washed her hair twice since then and still the color is as vibrant. I&#x27;m impressed and she loves it. I will be doing a streak in my hair next.</li>
            <li> The jar arrived nicely wrapped and in a plastic bag. No leaks or spills. Arrived very timely.&lt;br /&gt;I love the color, I barely had to lighten my hair. I did peekaboos of this color. I still haven&#x27;t had to touch it up since I&#x27;ve got it. It&#x27;s a nice red-violet wine-ish color. It coordinates well with my 5r light red brown hair.&lt;br /&gt;I always sleep with Manic Panic in my hair, it lasts WEEKS. Would purchase again xoxo</li>
            <li> No seriously, this is very very pink. I have dark brown hair, did not bleach, left color on for 3 hours. Very vibrant color, color still coming out in shower. Dyed hair 2+ weeks and still vibrant. Also did not leave hair feeling dry or straw-like.</li>
            <li> This will stain everything it touches except your hair, seems to wash out faster than Splat or other semi-permanent hair colors. If you use it keep something like &amp;#34;Comet/Ajacks&amp;#34; on hand and sprinkle it on the spots around the sink area and it comes out pretty fast. Love the color to bad it does not stay long even when heat is used...</li>
            <li> I bought this an it came in 3 days and I did the whole process and when I was done I put more dye in and coconut oil in to make it pop more I guess...the only problem is it&#x27;s a freaking mess like I had it all over me but the end product is reallyyyy nice and I have a medium to dark brown hair and it shows reallyyy well I love it...I think imma do a blue next cause basically I just did a purple and red already</li>
            <li> This is exactly the color I had been hoping for.  I have naturally dark brown, almost black hair so I had to use a bleach kit first.  I only bleached it until my hair was a light orangish color.  After I put the Fuchsia Shock in, it was just the perfect shade, not too light and not too dark but very vivid especially in sunlight.  The only reason I did not give it 5 stars is because it stained everything!  My bathtub was pink, shower curtain, walls, pillow case, several shirts, I even had pink spots on my legs or if I scratched my head and touched something afterwards.  Some bleach shower spray took care of that quickly but after several washes my white pillow case is still hot pink and the back of my neck stayed pink for about a week after I put the color on.  I even used vaseline around my hairline to prevent this from happening.  I have used many colors of Manic Panic and this one seemed to be the most messy but I get many compliments on it and will probably purchase it again in the future.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this color. It came out a nice red/purplish/pinkish color on my pre-bleached hair. Would probably be more red on darker hair. Mine was quite blonde. The actual color of the hair dye looks nothing like the one showed it&#x27;s not that pink. Take precaution when using this it stains everything instantly. Even stained my hands pink when I was washing it out but it&#x27;s worth having pink hands for a few days. I&#x27;ve used lots of different manic panic colors and this is my new favorite!</li>
            <li> The color is FUSCHIA shock, its more of a red or maroon color if you are wanting the BRIGHT PINK like on bottle this is not it, I know I should of read bottle but assumed they wouldn&#x27;t put one color on the bottle then another in the bottle but will be sure to check it first</li>
            <li> Loved the color!  a warning though, came right out when my girls went to the pool!</li>
            <li> I have brown hair so I had my hair bleached and dyed with a pink and purple from pravana. The pink washed out the first time I took a shower. : (  I re did the pink with Manic Panic and my hair looks great. I used a lot less dye than the girl did at the salon but still got great coverage. This works for my hair!</li>
            <li> I was really hoping for the hot pink color shown in the photo here, but the product is much redder than that. It&#x27;s still a hot reddish-pink in the jar and came out more of a dark fuchsia in my hair, and it&#x27;s a beautiful color, just not what you see here.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love Manic Panic. It always comes out great, and the only two downsides are that it doesn&#x27;t come with gloves (most hair dyes do) and it makes a mess of the bathroom! (And your shirt, and your skin.) This particular one stains worse than most. It got all over my hands, ears, towels, pillowcase, wall, etc. even though I&#x27;d worn gloves and put lotion on my ears and face to prevent this. I had to use straight bleach all over the bathroom to get rid of the dye, and am still (a week later) getting color transfer on my pillow and clothes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used to use this when I was a teenager. Now I&#x27;m 37 and sharing it with my daughter. :)</li>
            <li> A really pretty color, and lasts a good while too!</li>
            <li> Love it....exceeded my expectations!!</li>
            <li> I love the color a lot but it&#x27;s easier to fade away compared to purple haze and other kind of purple color.</li>
            <li> I chose five stars because this company makes the best bright color hair dye out there. I would recommend this to anyone looking for some fun bright color to add to their do. I have natural blonde hair and this dye stays vibrant in my hair for 3-4 months without having to redo it. My hair dresser was amazed when i told her i died my hair pink at christmas and it still is vibrant and gorgeous and its almost march! It is the easiest thing to apply to your hair and i would highly recommend it to anyone who wants quality hair dye for their locks.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m naturally blonde. Dye took 5 weeks to come out of my hair.</li>
            <li> I get compliments on my hair all the time.  IT washes out easily so just use cold water when shampooing to slow down the fading process.</li>
            <li> This product came just as ordered.  I dyed the tips of my naturally blonde and highlighted hair without using bleach first.  The color starts out dark fuchsia, almost purple and fades to cotton candy pink in about 4 weeks.  My highlights hold the color better than the undyed parts of my hair so if you want longer lasting brighter color I would suggest bleaching first.  I think the color is a lot of fun and doesn&#x27;t last too long that I get tired of it.  After I use up this jar I&#x27;m going to buy another in a different color and try that out for a while.</li>
            <li> SO I PULLED SOME LOCKS FROM THE BOTTOM PORTION OF MY HAIR TO DYE. HD IT IN FOR 12 HOURS (SLEEPING IN IT ETC) SO IT LOOKS SUPER ELECTRIC PURPLE/FUCHSIA. I WASH IT OUT AND IT DYED TH REST OF MY HAIR PINK. SO NOW INSTEAD OF AN EVEN AMOUNT OF HILITES, I HAVE FADED OMBRE PINK AND SOME CRAZY HIGHLIGHTS. IT TURNED OUT COOL BUT NOT WHAT I WANTED. I AM AMAZED BY THIS COLOR BECAUSE IT SAYS LEAVE IT IN 30 MIN AND I BARELY HAD IT TOUCH MY COVERED ENDS JUST TO WASH AND IT DYED THEM. ITS BEEN 3 WEEKS AND IT DOESNT LOOK BAD.</li>
            <li> Love love love manic panic!!</li>
            <li> I love this color in my hair. My hair is a coffee brown and natural and it can be seen without any bleaching prior. When I first put it in it was more of a purple then faded into a wine red now it looks more brown. It does fade pretty fast but since it does not have harsh chemicals I can retouch it when ever.</li>
            <li> however, it looks red...i bought this hoping to try out the color pink since that&#x27;s the one color I have yet to have my hair. so it looks nice, but it looks red.</li>
            <li> I tried two different Manic Panic colors on my daughter (a blue and a pink). Neither had any effect. She has dark brown hair. I do know that since we are only using as a rise the color is not going to be bright (we are not using bleach) but.......... neither color made one bit of difference. I even tried using heat (sat her under a dryer) the second time... still nothing. Am I doing something wrong?</li>
            <li> Love this color, love this brand! It has vibrant look &amp; I&#x27;m very satisfied!</li>
            <li> Fantastic dye! Great hair color. Extremely vibrant, with bleach first or not.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A few warnings though:&lt;br /&gt;- It says &amp;#34;rinse until water runs clear&amp;#34;. This will never happen. Everything is pink. Forever. It&#x27;ll look like you slayed a unicorn in there.&lt;br /&gt;- This color bleeds a lot. Even if you rinse it for a long time, you&#x27;ll see it on your pillow and shirts for the first week or two. Seems to wash out okay, but if you don&#x27;t rinse long enough you&#x27;ll dye everything you love pink.</li>
            <li> When i used this product i intended to only dye the bottom, under layer of my hair pink. But. When i washed out the dye, it seeped into the rest of my hair and the bottom 8 inches of my hair were deeply tinted pink. I had to get a drastic haircut to hide the unintended pink! So to anyone using this producf, i would recommend it only if you are dying more hair than i was or if you don&#x27;t mind having all your hair pink. That being said, the product stayed in a long time for a semi-permanent dye, which was what i was hoping for!</li>
            <li> Everything was great.  Got the product on time and as advertised.  Hoping to use it this weekend.  Excited to see the results.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this dye for years and it&#x27;s fantastic for creating vibrant colors. Follow the instructions when applying though or you&#x27;ll end up with color in places you don&#x27;t want!</li>
            <li> MAnic panic is great!</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing! It works great and I got it pretty quickly in the mail. I can now have pink hair but it will wash out!</li>
            <li> Great color!  Work great, gave my hair a super bright bold color without using bleach, my hair is dirty blonde naturally and it took the color really well.</li>
