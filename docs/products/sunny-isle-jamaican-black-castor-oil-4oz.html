            <li>This is by far the best hair care product I have ever purchased!  </li>
            <li>I thought it would be more along the lines of argan oil, but that isn&#x27;t the case.</li>

            <li>:) i personally love the smell.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so glad I purchased this product</li>
            <li>Love this product, it helped with hair growth</li>
            <li>This oil has so many uses -</li>
            <li>I massage it on my edges and on the top of my head at night</li>
            <li>Love the oil.</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s astonishing to see the results after I have tried so many dif products.</li>
            <li>I love this</li>
            <li>I really love this oil</li>
            <li>My hair grows faster and is becoming so much more thicker.</li>
            <li>I am excited to see what growth and thickness I have gotten once I take out my extensions!</li>
            <li>My hair is soft and healthy and it works great in my hair treatment.</li>
            <li>I liked the energy boost I got from using this right before I  worked out.</li>
            <li>The smell isn&#x27;t overbearing and as strong either.</li>
            <li>If you find yourself getting bumps on your scalp, undiluted may be too strong for you.  </li>
            <li>and I have really fine hair</li>
            <li>(I have fine hair).  </li>
            <li>A great buy overall!  </li>
            <li>-I mix it with some cocunut oil--but still curiously waiting for some growth and good results!</li>
            <li>Its not the best smelling oil and pretty viscous (as was expected).  </li>
            <li>Then it will be worth it!</li>
            <li>This is the first time i try castor oil on my eyelashes since they say that it will make them better.</li>
            <li>I see significant reduction of hairfall.</li>
            <li>this is really thick (and doesn&#x27;t smell the greatest).  </li>
            <li>I purchase this, because a lot of people were saying, it was good for growing/regrowing your hair back.</li>
            <li>I LOVE it and would highly recommend it to anyone.</li>
            <li>I was able to comfortably extend to an hour  and have enough energy for a smile when I was done!</li>
            <li>The oil was exactly as I ordered it and came on time!</li>
            <li>I actually like the scent it has a warm nutty smell.  </li>
            <li>so far it has been showing improvement in my eyelashes, however, i do wonder if there is anything else better than this in the market.</li>
            <li>While transitioning, I wore my fair share of weaves and other \\&quot;protective\\&quot; styles, I suffered some damage and thining edges.</li>
            <li>right</li>
            <li>right?</li>
            <li>Shipping is really quick, I love this product, my edges had fallen out a while back</li>
            <li>ITS AWESOME FOR AFRICAN AMERICAN NATURAL HAIR</li>
            <li>Many other reviews said that it has a strong odor.  </li>
            <li>The oil is a bit thick and the smell is a bit strong, but it works great for my natural hair.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve noticed a change in the amount of thickness in my hair after the first bottle.</li>
            <li>But if it works really really well!</li>
            <li>This has healed my scalp so much, it&#x27;s a miracle!</li>
            <li>This bottle has lasted a couple months and still has some more left.</li>
            <li>This is exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li>I have been relaxer free for 8 months thus far and the softness and thickness</li>
            <li>and I did this every night, alone with a hot oil treatment once a week.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so glad I decided to try this out and my local beauty store now sells it!&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have not been using this very long and will update my review after I&#x27;ve seen more changes and hopefully hair growth.</li>
            <li>Black Castor oil is simply amazing, it makes my hair so sof.</li>
            <li>My 1.5yo pulled out large clumps of hair, so I have been applying g this to her bald spots 2x a day.</li>
            <li>I use this very sparingly.  </li>
            <li>This product really works.</li>
            <li>Fast Shipping.</li>
            <li>I really like this JBCO brand.</li>
            <li>Shipping was fast (I have Prime) and it was packaged well</li>
            <li>Fortunately I found it locally, so I won&#x27;t have to pay the shipping fees!!</li>
            <li>really helps as I am transitioning with up-dos.</li>
            <li>my scalp was very flaky.  </li>
            <li>Been using it for a month on my eyelashes and they have really gotten longer.</li>
            <li>I took before and aftr  pics and can really see the difference.</li>
            <li>I expected much more but it is doing its part in &#x27;some&#x27; hair growth.</li>
            <li>Too soon to really tell--but the positive is tht it makes my hair soft</li>
            <li>and I notice my edges are starting to become full again.  </li>
            <li>However, I have been able to use it as a smoother to lay my hair down rather than using a gel.</li>
            <li>I use it mainly on my edges and eyebrows.  </li>
            <li>This is a quick simple review.</li>
            <li>I have really high hopes for this product.</li>
            <li>So I got it and starting using it right away</li>
            <li>I let the oil sit for a few hours, directly on my scalp and my hair feels soft, shiny and healthy.</li>
            <li>In just a few days I have seen amazing improvement in the texture of my dry hair.</li>
            <li>I mix it with other oils to thin it a bit in order to apply it more easily.</li>
            <li>I bought this as a product to seal the ends of my natural hair when styling.</li>
            <li>I have never used anything that soothed and tamed the ends of my hair so completely instantaneously.</li>
            <li>Smells very nutty, I suggest mixing it with an essential oil if you&#x27;re using it for every day hair maintenance.</li>
            <li>Makes your hair soft.</li>
            <li>so I decided to go natural and this product has helped alot.  </li>
            <li>I gave it 4 stars only because the residue feeling isn&#x27;t a plus but what do you really expect with castor oil,</li>
            <li>My hair fells soft and managable.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so grateful to have read about this product on a FB page for girls w natural hair regimens.</li>
            <li>which is important because if this stuff leaks, it&#x27;s really messy!</li>
            <li>Got exactly what i expected.</li>
            <li>I have used a few different brands but this one is the exact consistently that I like.</li>
            <li>and I can honesty say that I started seeing new growth by the second week.</li>
            <li>so I buy several brands as long as they are 100% / pure castor.  </li>
            <li>Well, I say the complete opposite...</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a nice thick, dark castor oil and works wonders for my hair growth.</li>
            <li>Purchase this to use in my hair to prevent hair breakage not sure if it&#x27;s worth the purchase yet</li>
            <li>it is super thick</li>
            <li>It is light and not as sticky as other brands I have purchased in the past.</li>
            <li>I have 3b fine, thin hair</li>
    </ol>

            <li> It smells like any other oil(maybe vegetable oil), and unless you&#x27;re dipping your entire head in this thing, no one is going to smell it unless they put their face in your head.</li>

            <li> I have really dry hair</li>
            <li> I have dry scalp, which causes a lot of flaking.</li>

            <li> and I have used it on my nape/temple areas where I had thinning due to age and struggle with PCOS.</li>
            <li> just look for 100% or pure and you can&#x27;t go wrong with either type or brand.</li>
            <li> and I wanted them to grow back really thick again like they were before and the castor oil is working.  </li>
            <li> I have thick, coarse, African-American hair.</li>
            <li> so I was worried about weighing my hair down.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also a bit pricey and for such a small bottle?!</li>
            <li> This product will leave your hair slightly greasy, so if it is applied at night I&#x27;d recommend wearing a cap or head covering of some sort</li>
            <li> I have had this product for a little over 3 weeks now</li>
            <li> I try to apply everyday.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for a few weeks and my hair is doing wonderful!&lt;br</li>
            <li> If you need a heavy duty oil that is thicker than olive oil</li>
            <li> but I will update you in a few months.</li>
            <li> This oil is thick and not runny, if you don’t like the smell or thickness you can mix with other carrier oils.   </li>
            <li> I massage my edges and scalp with Jamaican Black Castor Oil at least every two days</li>
            <li> I ALso massage it on my scalp and have seen the difference how it grew little hairs where it was getting kinda thin.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t know it would be this thick</li>

            <li> I saw minimal results to my edges compared to other users,  and the smell to me is awful.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Excellent product.. :)</li>
            <li> My package arrived and the lid to the bottle was cracked and would not screw back on.  But, I like the product.</li>
            <li> WAYYY thicker than I expected. I thought it would be more along the lines of argan oil, but that isn&#x27;t the case. However, I have been able to use it as a smoother to lay my hair down rather than using a gel.</li>
            <li> I bought this as a product to seal the ends of my natural hair when styling. It works great! I suffer from terrible split ends but I can already feel the softness and smoothness of this product after 2 days! I have never used anything that soothed and tamed the ends of my hair so completely instantaneously.</li>
            <li> Black Castor oil is simply amazing, it makes my hair so sof. I&#x27;ve definitly noticed a lot of growth and thickness in my hair since i started using it.</li>
            <li> Love castor! Smells very nutty, I suggest mixing it with an essential oil if you&#x27;re using it for every day hair maintenance. I&#x27;ve noticed a change in the amount of thickness in my hair after the first bottle. May buy another bottle, but experimenting with other oils right now!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good buy!</li>
            <li> ITS AWESOME FOR AFRICAN AMERICAN NATURAL HAIR I PURCHASED SOME FROM A STORE BEFORE AND IT SEEMED DIFFERENT FROM THIS ONE IN FEEL OF MY HAIR BUT IT WORKS WONDERS AND MY HAIR FEELS MOISTURIZED WITH THE PRODUCT</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve seen reviews that say this is watery.  Well, I say the complete opposite...this is really thick (and doesn&#x27;t smell the greatest).  I didn&#x27;t know it would be this thick and I have really fine hair so I was worried about weighing my hair down.  I use this very sparingly.  I don&#x27;t have to get relaxers and I don&#x27;t have kinky hair, but I have notice my hair thinning on the side I sleep on.  I have not been using this very long and will update my review after I&#x27;ve seen more changes and hopefully hair growth.</li>
            <li> This is by far the best hair care product I have ever purchased!  My hair grows faster and is becoming so much more thicker. Great for thinning edges.</li>
            <li> Works nicely in my hair.</li>
            <li> Purchase this to use in my hair to prevent hair breakage not sure if it&#x27;s worth the purchase yet</li>
            <li> Excellent product. I love it. I mix it with other oils to thin it a bit in order to apply it more easily.</li>
            <li> The oil was exactly as I ordered it and came on time! This oil is perfect for hair growth; woks really fast too!</li>
            <li> I bought this for hair growth.  Many other reviews said that it has a strong odor.  I actually like the scent it has a warm nutty smell.  I haven&#x27;t been using it long enough to say if it works yet for hair growth but it has made my hair shinier and healthier.  I have 3b fine, thin hair and I apply the product at night to my scalp and the when I get up in the morning I rub it on my ends as well.  The product will last forever since you only need a few drops to cover your scalp or ends.[[ASIN:B003K9T2JI Jamaican Black Castor Oil 4 Oz.]]</li>
            <li> The product worked as advertised.  A great buy overall!  This product will leave your hair slightly greasy, so if it is applied at night I&#x27;d recommend wearing a cap or head covering of some sort so your pillow doesn&#x27;t get any residue.</li>
            <li> This help my hair and my thinning edges but with a combination by using Biotin, it a slow process it depend how bad your hair has thinning and mine thin really bad around my edges. So Good luck !</li>
            <li> I love this product and I have recommended it to my co-workers too. I will be purchasing more when I run out. Tks for a great product!</li>
            <li> I use this product in my hair cream and I love it.  It&#x27;s a nice thick, dark castor oil and works wonders for my hair growth.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff! I am seeing some growth around my thinning edges. I apply this daily morning and night.</li>
            <li> Great product and seller</li>
            <li> This product really works. It does everything that it describes. I have really dry hair and it helps my scalp also.</li>
            <li> Fast Shipping. Got exactly what i expected. Will purchase again when i run out and i would reccomend buying it. Great Price</li>
            <li> Makes your hair soft. It did not smell weird to me but some people don&#x27;t like it, a little goes a long way and it is super thick so yea... good stuff.</li>
            <li> I just got this in the mail yesterday. I have very thin edges and get annoyed sometimes when I wear my hair up in buns, so I decided to order this product based on several youtube videos and reviews all over the web.I thought it was going to be a dark black colored oil, but to my surprise its golden like any other oil. I can&#x27;t comment on how well it works because I just got it yesterday, but I do think I need to put something about the smell. Some people are describing it as unbearable or something that they feel like they can&#x27;t wear out in public, and I want to know what product they are using. Does it smell? Yes it does but it is not that bad! It smells like any other oil(maybe vegetable oil), and unless you&#x27;re dipping your entire head in this thing, no one is going to smell it unless they put their face in your head. I take my pinky and dip it in the bottle and dab some on my edges and no, you cannot smell it. I have really high hopes for this product.</li>
            <li> I have noticed a big difference in my hair</li>
            <li> I massage my edges and scalp with Jamaican Black Castor Oil at least every two days (I have fine hair).  It has definitely thickened my edges.  I have lupus and have occasional hair loss so I decided to go natural and this product has helped alot.  I also use this product to moisturize and seal my hair!</li>
            <li> it arrived much earlier than expected. and its an amazing product, it helped strengthen and grow my hair. i will most defiantly buy this product again. also it was well packaged</li>
            <li> Too soon to really tell--but the positive is tht it makes my hair soft-I mix it with some cocunut oil--but still curiously waiting for some growth and good results! It&#x27;s also a bit pricey and for such a small bottle?! But if it works really really well! Then it will be worth it!</li>
            <li> if you looking for something to help restore you hair or even try to get that fullness eyelash or even out you eyebrow. this oil does all of that. i try this like a month now and please with the result.</li>
            <li> Great product, works for my hair.</li>
            <li> I have been using this on my scalp once a week for hair growth. I have dry scalp, which causes a lot of flaking. This has healed my scalp so much, it&#x27;s a miracle! I let the oil sit for a few hours, directly on my scalp and my hair feels soft, shiny and healthy. This bottle has lasted a couple months and still has some more left.</li>
            <li> I did my big chop 3 months ago and I heard about JBC oil on youtube and decided to purchase it.  This is a great product what castor oil is meant to do it does.  I use it mainly on my edges and eyebrows.  My eyebrows have been a bit thin and I wanted them to grow back really thick again like they were before and the castor oil is working.  I see the hair coming through and I notice my edges are starting to become full again.  I am very pleased with this product I will always keep this in my product bag.  This is a must have if you need hair growth with eyelash, eyebrows or hair.  I did not use it on my face yet but I will be doing that soon just to see if it works well on my skin as a oil treatment.</li>
            <li> Just started my hair journey last month and have only used the product for two weeks.  Using to thicken my edges and nape.  Read positve reviews and thought i&#x27;d give it a try. I like the texture of the oil it actually maintains my edges.  I have relaxed 3c/4b hair type... I think.</li>
            <li> I saw minimal results to my edges compared to other users,  and the smell to me is awful. I have to add it together with other products to hide the smell.</li>
            <li> I really like this JBCO brand. It is light and not as sticky as other brands I have purchased in the past. The smell isn&#x27;t overbearing and as strong either. I will definitely purchase this oil again!</li>
            <li> This is exactly what I was looking for. I have used a few different brands but this one is the exact consistently that I like. I use it for my facial washes and for a hair treatment.. It&#x27;s amazing!!! Shipping was fast (I have Prime) and it was packaged well which is important because if this stuff leaks, it&#x27;s really messy!</li>
            <li> i&#x27;ve used it today once and my scalp start itching and irritating! i just want a refund because i&#x27;m vary scary about the effects on my hair now!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know how I feel about this product. I have not seen any effect on my 4c hair at all.</li>
            <li> I use regular castor on my hair all the time but this just smells horrible.  I would not recommend this produce.</li>
            <li> I liked the energy boost I got from using this right before I  worked out. The boost actually came after I was exercising for twenty minutes...I was able to comfortably extend to an hour  and have enough energy for a smile when I was done!</li>
            <li> While transitioning, I wore my fair share of weaves and other \\&quot;protective\\&quot; styles, I suffered some damage and thining edges. You must believe the hype on this product. Since I have been using this, my edges are growing back. I will continue to use and purchase this product. Fortunately I found it locally, so I won&#x27;t have to pay the shipping fees!!</li>
            <li> This is the first time i try castor oil on my eyelashes since they say that it will make them better. so far it has been showing improvement in my eyelashes, however, i do wonder if there is anything else better than this in the market. but this product is really good! I do recomend it. :)</li>
            <li> I started using peppermint oil about 3 weeks prior to this purchase and noticed a hairline I never thought I had start to grow in the front. Now adding this as is daily has started to grown in hair both in the front and back in the past two weeks alone.  I can&#x27;t imagine how my results will be in 6 months. I gave it 4 stars only because the residue feeling isn&#x27;t a plus but what do you really expect with castor oil, right? I will be buying the 8 ox of extra dark next time for me and my mother you is trying to grow her hair in again after decades of home relaxers. I have been relaxer free for 8 months thus far and the softness and thickness this provides really helps as I am transitioning with up-dos.</li>
            <li> I suffered with dry scalp and within a week of using this product i no longer suffer with dry scalp. I washed my hair every week because before the week was out (not to be disgusting) my scalp was very flaky.  After using this product my scalp is no longer flaky by week end.</li>
            <li> I am currently using this item. I have seen some growth on my edges. I am happy with it. I try to apply everyday. I just need to remember to continue to.</li>
            <li> This is an excellent hair oil. In just a few days I have seen amazing improvement in the texture of my dry hair. I have thick, coarse, African-American hair. This oil is extremely thick, but exactly what my hair and scalp needed to restore its moisture balance. Daily use of this oil has not weighed my hair down at all. I highly recommended this thick oil.</li>
            <li> Love this oil. Been using it for a month on my eyelashes and they have really gotten longer. I took before and aftr  pics and can really see the difference. I ALso massage it on my scalp and have seen the difference how it grew little hairs where it was getting kinda thin. :) i personally love the smell.</li>
            <li> My hair is soft and healthy and it works great in my hair treatment. I know why everyone loves this oil why this</li>
            <li> Great product!!! I&#x27;ve only used it for three weeks and it appears to work already on our hair. I&#x27;m so glad I purchased this product</li>
            <li> Love this product, it helped with hair growth and it&#x27;s a great oil for the scalp. The oil is a bit thick and the smell is a bit strong, but it works great for my natural hair. I would recommend this product.</li>
            <li> This oil has so many uses - but I use this on my scalp. This is wonderful for hair growth and strengthening plus it&#x27;s a great moisturizer! Just rub this on the scalp a couple of times a day and you will be AMAZED! This oil is thick and not runny, if you don’t like the smell or thickness you can mix with other carrier oils.   I had a severe hair loss issue and using this oil helped me grow my hair back in a couple of months! Consistency is the KEY! I LOVE it and would highly recommend it to anyone. If you find yourself getting bumps on your scalp, undiluted may be too strong for you.  Simply mix other olive, jojoba or another oil to ease the sensitivity.  I have used NUMEROUS brands of Regular Castor and Black Castor Oil - just look for 100% or pure and you can&#x27;t go wrong with either type or brand. I have indeed posted reviews on different brands because I have used these brands.  I use castor oil on my hair and my daughters’ hair and I mix my own hair products so I buy several brands as long as they are 100% / pure castor.  I hope this review helps!!</li>
            <li> I have had this product for a little over 3 weeks now and I&#x27;m loving it. I purchase this, because a lot of people were saying, it was good for growing/regrowing your hair back. So I got it and starting using it right away and I can honesty say that I started seeing new growth by the second week. I massage it on my edges and on the top of my head at night and I did this every night, alone with a hot oil treatment once a week.</li>
            <li> I gave 3 stars because the oil was leaking out the bottle.</li>
            <li> Love the oil. My hair fells soft and managable. I see significant reduction of hairfall.</li>
            <li> I have notice some growth with this, its not a miracle solution..I know.  I expected much more but it is doing its part in &#x27;some&#x27; hair growth.</li>
            <li> My hair has never been so healthy in so many years! I decided to pick this up after my hair got damaged and a big chop had to happen. I&#x27;ve been using it for a few weeks and my hair is doing wonderful!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A lot of my damaged areas are filling in and I&#x27;m noticing growth everywhere on my head. I&#x27;m so glad I decided to try this out and my local beauty store now sells it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m definitely picking up the next biggest size when I run out! I will definitely be buying this from now on! I love it!</li>
            <li> Its not the best smelling oil and pretty viscous (as was expected).  I am excited to see what growth and thickness I have gotten once I take out my extensions!</li>
            <li> I ordered this product a month ago and I have used it on my nape/temple areas where I had thinning due to age and struggle with PCOS. I actually have hair regrowth in that area, it&#x27;s astonishing to see the results after I have tried so many dif products. I use it daily at night and morning, no pony tails anymore so that my hair can rest from being tugged. My hair dresser wanted to know what I had been doin bcus I was bald on the sides and now I have hair, actual hair growing back in. I&#x27;m so grateful to have read about this product on a FB page for girls w natural hair regimens. I love this and I shipped a bottle to my sis in TX</li>
            <li> I ordered this on either Thursday or Friday and it came on Monday. Shipping is really quick, I love this product, my edges had fallen out a while back and I used this and I saw results.</li>
            <li> This oil is great. it helps keep hair moisture and you can use it for multiple things like cuts and burns.Also good to put on eyes lashes before bed to help grow them.</li>
            <li> thank you!! Just received my bottle. Love it!!</li>
            <li> I really love this oil it&#x27;s amazing.</li>
            <li> This product has helped my hair to regain its thickness and moisture. You can use it as a pre-treatment before washing or apply to scalp as needed.</li>
            <li> This is a quick simple review. If you need a heavy duty oil that is thicker than olive oil this is it! I can&#x27;t speak on hair growth yet but I will update you in a few months. My 1.5yo pulled out large clumps of hair, so I have been applying g this to her bald spots 2x a day.</li>
