            <li> The charger didn&#x27;t work with that new one either, so I can only presume these chargers are not compatible with the Wahl 9818 (S004MU0400090) as claimed.</li>

            <li> Doesn&#x27;t get hot or anything weird.</li>
            <li> Makes a weird humming noise as it charges but for the price that really doesn&#x27;t bother me.  </li>
            <li> I am not sure if the voltage is too high or what is wrong.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if I would want to keep this thing plugged in 24/7</li>
            <li> Frankly the sizzling noise was a bit scary as we have never heard of a charger making noise while charging an item.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Charger stopped working within one month, inexplicably.</li>

            <li> Product exactly as described. Works perfectly</li>
            <li> I bought 2 of these to replace a last charger for my Wahl 9818 (S004MU0400090) trimmer. The first one didn&#x27;t work, so I returned it for a full refund. The second still didn&#x27;t work, so I bought the same model trimmer. The charger didn&#x27;t work with that new one either, so I can only presume these chargers are not compatible with the Wahl 9818 (S004MU0400090) as claimed. I have no complaints with the customer service and would give it 5 stars, as I was refunded for the first and will receive a refund for the second, but the product simply didn&#x27;t do what it was supposed to, and therefore, 1 star so I can warn others with my model trimmer.</li>
            <li> Works great. Arrived fast. That is all.</li>
            <li> Lost my original Wahl charger and this one works great.  Makes a weird humming noise as it charges but for the price that really doesn&#x27;t bother me.  Would recommend to anyone looking for a replacement/extra charger.</li>
            <li> It worked as expected with no problems.</li>
            <li> Item worked as expected...just as good as the OEM charger. Definitely recommend product and seller 100%</li>
            <li> This charger is perfect. It does exactly what it is supposed to do and it does it flawlessly.</li>
            <li> Works fine. Bought to replace a lost charger for my wahl electric shaver. Two stars off as it makes an unsettling semi-loud electrical buzzing sound when plugged in and charging the shaver. I&#x27;m not sure if I would want to keep this thing plugged in 24/7</li>
            <li> Charger stopped working within one month, inexplicably. Used standard American plug and Wahl buzzer that is claimed to be compatible.</li>
            <li> Had it 3 months no problems. The razor is so good that I&#x27;ve only charged it twice since them but its been perfect each time.</li>
            <li> The shipping on this item was quick, and it came as described in the posting. I choose a 5 star rating because the charger works very well and I am happy with all aspects of the order. I would recommend this to anyone looking for this type of charger.</li>
            <li> Carefull, plugged the charger to my wahl trimer immediately started to smoke. The chatger is a fire hazard..! -5 stars..</li>
            <li> Does not work with the 9818L stainless steel model, even though the description of this charger as S004mu0400090 means it should work with. When plugged in, the charging light initially turns blue but turns off after about 10-15 seconds and the trimmer never charges.</li>

            <li> I am so glad my wife gave me the idea to look on Amazon to find this charger because I lost it. I actually lost this one too, would love a new one. I won&#x27;t lose this one</li>
            <li> Perfect , does the job !</li>
            <li> Was looking for a power cord for my pet because she chewed it up. I think she didit on purpose. Purchased this and it work wonderfully.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I wanted</li>
            <li> Purchased this charger with high hopes due to the reviews.&lt;br /&gt;When the trimmer is plugged in the charger the charger makes a sizzling noise and the trimmer would not turn on while plugged in. We gave it 20 to 30 minutes hoping that it would charge the battery, no such luck. Frankly the sizzling noise was a bit scary as we have never heard of a charger making noise while charging an item.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The trimmer worked prior to losing the manufacture charger.</li>
            <li> This charger might be a little bit bigger (not sure that&#x27;s a negative), but the first charger was lost, and this one works just as well, if not better than the original.</li>
            <li> it work great thank you. I recommended  to everybody buy these product is perfect :)</li>
            <li> This charges my Wahl 9854 trimmer just fine!</li>
            <li> Perfect replacement charger</li>
            <li> Works as good as OEM original. In fact, this looks like it may actually BE an OEM original.</li>
            <li> Wahl doesn&#x27;t sell a replacement adapter for my charger off their website. I&#x27;ve had no issues with this one, plus since I&#x27;m a prim member on amazon 2 delivery is not bad. I would recommend to a friend</li>
            <li> Perfect fit.  Saved me from buying a new razor</li>
            <li> - As usual this Amazon purchase came quickly - whew! - and worked quite well for what it was meant to do (replace my lost one).</li>
            <li> Great charger. Perfect match for my wahl razor.</li>
            <li> Works fine haven&#x27;t had any problems so far</li>
            <li> My old charger got chewed up by my dog, I bought this one and it works just fine.</li>
            <li> functions well, no complaints</li>
            <li> Worked Perfect, fit like a charm.</li>
            <li> Seems like this is overly powerful for the unit I am trying to charge.  My device becomes very hot to the touch within 30 minutes of charging.</li>
            <li> Works better than the adapter that came with the unit! Best buy!</li>
            <li> Exactly what I needed. Fast shipping...absolutely no complaints :)</li>
            <li> Very awesome product. Idk what I would of done with out it. I use it for my rechargeable wahl edges for work.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this product for about three months now, with absoultely no problems. I would highly recommend this, well worth the price!</li>
            <li> Long-term review&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good things....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This in fact charges your trimmer and it does it quickly like the factory charger. It also has a nice long cord, and it does not take up much space.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Less than good things....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The mechanism that triggers the lights to blink, and be blue or red was fried instantly when plugged into this charger. I am not sure if the voltage is too high or what is wrong. The trimmer seems to function properly, though it ruined a feature on my $100 trimmer. The light now just always blinks blue anytime it is on. You also never know if the device if fully charged either.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line, I would not have bought this if I could have found the OEM model. But it does charge the trimmer, even if it seemingly broke it.</li>
            <li> Price was right, arrived quickly, and did the job.  Charged up my Wahl without issue.  Saved me from buying a whole new hair trimmer.</li>
            <li> Working fine , but the socket is not exactly the same .</li>
            <li> No problems what so ever. Lost my original and this was a perfect replacement. Good quality and good price.</li>
            <li> I liked it just fine before I dropped and broke my whal trimmer!</li>
            <li> Seems to work for 9818 but makes an awful high pitched sound the whole time the trimmer is charging.</li>
