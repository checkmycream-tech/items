            <li>Amazing.</li>
            <li>Amazing.</li>
            <li>Really great cleanser that made my face feel smooth after taking my makeup off.</li>
            <li>Nice Foaming cleanser.</li>
            <li>Nice fragrance though.</li>
            <li>The price is good and can&#x27;t ask for much more.  </li>
            <li>This cleanser fits the bill nicely.</li>
            <li>For that reason, I can&#x27;t honestly recommend this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m torn here, so take this for what it is and make your own decision regarding the product.  </li>
            <li>It was nice to use</li>
            <li>it was nice</li>
            <li>I very much liked using this cleanser.</li>
            <li>and I actually liked it.</li>
            <li>I like the rose scent.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t want my perfume choice to have to \\&quot;compete\\&quot; with the rose of this cleaning</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used kaolin clay masks before and liked them a lot.</li>
            <li>It had a strong, pleasant, feminine scent that dissipated soon after use.</li>
            <li>Pleasant fragrance that I found to be light, but noticeable.  </li>
            <li>It is very overwhelming with a very sweet, cloying scent.</li>
            <li>I prefer a bit more noticeable grit in my exfoliating cream, but this seems to do a nice job...</li>
            <li>found the fragrance to be just right - pleasant without being overpowering.  </li>
            <li>Love the lather and smell.</li>
            <li>This line of products are fantastic!</li>
            <li>okay, $15.  </li>
            <li>but there are definitely better ones.</li>
            <li>Love this product and have not been able to find it at my grocers or Walgreen&#x27;s or CVS.  </li>
            <li>So pleased that I ordered for both my daughters.</li>
            <li>But daily use isn&#x27;t the best in my opinion.</li>
            <li>I feel as if I could keep washing my face and continue to get more stuff off it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It does work better when used with exfoliating pads though.</li>
            <li>This has a lovely scent and a creamy consistency.  </li>
            <li>but I was expecting something more</li>
            <li>feel some scrub... and that nice, smooth feeling you get afterwards.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>my nose and lip area (what a better time to arrive),as well as makeup to cover the pimple.</li>
            <li>but you look light in a nice</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t know about Pond&#x27;s and how great their products really are, I don&#x27;t need a monthly subscription that&#x27;ll cost me $400.00 a year.</li>
            <li>Okay</li>
            <li>I would recommend this if you want a more cleaner and softer skin.</li>
            <li>I only gave 4 stars because I feel that this isn&#x27;t the best for acne-prone skin.</li>
            <li>The more I use this product the better my skin feels and looks.</li>
            <li>I won&#x27;t give up my Purity, but one change at a time :)</li>
            <li>It reminds you more of a body product, with a lot of scent.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used it off and on over a 2 week period, in the shower and out, and have been satisfied by both types of usage.</li>
            <li>Just OK, wouldn&#x27;t buy again</li>
            <li>Got this for my wife and she said:  The product has a nice consistency and does smooth your skin a bit.  </li>
            <li>I use it every day and my skin is super clean and feels great after using it.</li>
            <li>Again, I&#x27;ve used many products over the years</li>
            <li>Did an okay job.</li>
            <li>It has more \\&quot;Fragrance\\&quot;</li>
            <li>&quot; - this is a smooth liquid rather than a grainy substance - but my skin sure felt good and clean after using it.</li>
            <li>I also loved the light and fresh smell!  </li>
            <li>I really liked the Ponds Luminous Clean Cream Cleanser.  </li>
            <li>The one thing I don&#x27;t see is my face becoming more luminous from using the cleanser.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It is rich and creamy and has a nice, light fragrance.  </li>
            <li>, it had a nice clean scent that had a light floral sent.</li>
            <li>The very fine granual feels nice on your skin when gently rubbed in, and it washes off fully.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Summary - if you just want a \\&quot;frothy soap\\&quot; that has a strong rose scent, and your skin doesn&#x27;t mind being hit with chemicals, this could be just right for you.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Summary - if you just want a \\&quot;frothy soap\\&quot; that has a strong rose scent, and your skin doesn&#x27;t mind being hit with chemicals, this could be just right for you.</li>
            <li>leaves my skin very clean and smooth.</li>
            <li>It leaves my skin feeling very clean and smooth.</li>
            <li>It moisturized wonderfully and seemed to make my skin brighter than when using other exfoliating cleansers.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have ordered the cream soap which may be more suited for drier skin, i curretnly use marykay moisturizer, but i have ordered the moisturizer for this line and am excited to try it.</li>
            <li>The exfoliation is very mild (compared to some of the peach cleansers I have used) but it works well without over drying your skin.  </li>
            <li>I love the way the POND&#x27;S Luminous Clean Cream Cleanser makes my face feel after I wash.  </li>
            <li>Strongly recommend.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know whether I&#x27;m just catching up with their improvements, but I liked this exfoliating cleanser that smelled nice and left my skin feeling softened and clean.</li>
            <li>and I was inundated with this strong perfume smell</li>
            <li>The cream smells great (which is not always the case for facial cleansers), is nice and creamy, and leaves the face feeling fresh.</li>
            <li>So, if you&#x27;re someone that never breaks out, yet have dark spots that you want to lighten, this is perfect for you!</li>
            <li>So I must say that the new Ponds cream cleanser is a good product.</li>
            <li>my skin feels quite smooth after using.  </li>
            <li>The whole line of Luminous products by Ponds is amazing.</li>
            <li>Okay ladies, it&#x27;s actually worth the money.</li>
            <li>This product has gentle, exfoliating beads and is creamy and foams nicely.</li>
            <li>If you have sensitive skin and need a good cleanser, you might want to give this one a try.</li>
            <li>The cleanser has a nice, pleasant scent and it left my face feeling fresh, clean, and smooth.  </li>
            <li>Very gentle and perfect for dry skin!</li>
            <li>I love this product my face feels clean and fresh</li>
            <li>Very creamy but does the job in cleaning pores and making your face feel nice and clean.  </li>
            <li>This soap removes my makeup, (I love makeup) leaves my skin feeling fresh and clean.</li>
            <li>For me though, I really love the way my skin feels right after my weekly scrub, like I&#x27;m 100% clean and glowing.</li>
            <li>leaves my skin clean and smooth.</li>
            <li>Leaves my skin feeling smooth and clean.  </li>
            <li>I like how it feels going on--and my face feels clean and smooth after use.</li>
            <li>I only had 9 days to use so on day one I looked at the packaging , which I thought was very nice and clean looking.</li>
            <li>I like it much better than some of the higher priced products.</li>
            <li>When I first used this product, my skin was more baby like, softer, and even My acne was disapearing.</li>
            <li>Clean scent.</li>
            <li>Leaves your face feeling so refreshed and clean.  </li>
            <li>The Luminous clean cleanser</li>
            <li>Otherwise, I am satisfied with this product and would recommend it for all types of skin, even those with more sensitive cleansing needs.</li>
            <li>I want my pores to be clean.</li>
            <li>If I&#x27;m going to use a scent, I want to choose it myself, after I am clean.</li>
            <li>Nice and soft!</li>
            <li>Leaves my skin clean, but nothing special at all about this product.  </li>
            <li>The rose scent is pretty strong in this cleanser and should be toned down, and I like a nice rose smell as much as anyone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>But when I used this my skin looked really bright and refreshed, and I love the micro beads, they aren&#x27;t overly harsh, so it&#x27;s a nice gentle scrub.</li>
            <li>Today, since there are so many choices on the shelves, it&#x27;s not always easy to find something new and trust that it won&#x27;t irritate your skin.  </li>
            <li>For those of you who like or love this product including other \\&quot;new\\&quot; Ponds products, you should enjoy the product now because like prior good products by Ponds, this product might be history in another 2 to 5 years!!!</li>
            <li>I also have very sensitive skin - I easily get a rash if something has too many chemicals or coloring in it.</li>
            <li>I liked the way that the very creamy Ponds Luminous Cleanser felt going on and found that it cleaned my face pretty well</li>
            <li>It makes my skin feel fresh and smooth.</li>
            <li>Yes, Pond&#x27;s leaves my face super clean, and knowing that the cleanser will not clog my pores is an added perk.</li>
            <li>I loved the color which was like a pearlized white color.</li>
            <li>: Nice scent, Nice amount microbeads, decrease in acne and black heads, clean luminous skin</li>
            <li>Affordable and gives a really good deep cleaning</li>
            <li>This is a good cleanser that goes a step above by adding micro-beads (for exfoliation) and clay.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s not a bad product.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d notice a feeling of this tingling sensation on my face and, not a bad feeling a smoothing sensation so</li>
            <li>i love the little exfoliating beads and it smells good</li>
            <li>I personally love the smell, compared to the older Pond&#x27;s products.</li>
            <li>It is gentle and good for sensitive skin, too.  </li>
            <li>This much rose smell is really too much.</li>
            <li>From the very first use I noticed a difference.</li>
            <li>I then too a good long look at my face.</li>
            <li>The smell is pleasant and the exfoliating beads are not too rough.</li>
            <li>Although I like a \\&quot;clean\\&quot; scent from my cleansers, the rosey smell was much too strong for me.</li>
            <li>It was silky smooth in the heat of the shower and came off cleanly when applied over the sink, followed by a warm wet washcloth.</li>
            <li>Rinses clean easily and leaves my skin feeling really soft and clean.</li>
            <li>I would classify this as a gentle and pleasant facial cleanser.  </li>
            <li>It is extremely gentle and mild and goes on smooth.  </li>
            <li>nice light smell.big tube and very little is required for each wash as the product is very rich and not liquid.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s fairly decent at removing eye makeup in warm water, it lathers beautifully, and the microbeads are not too irritating for me.</li>
            <li>Thanks again to Bzz agent as well as thanks to Pond&#x27;s for creating such a great product at an affordable price</li>
            <li>Also worth noting is that it will not clog your pores to precipitate acne like some of the competing products on the market.  </li>
            <li>What&#x27;s more, as an adult who still struggles with acne from time to time, this product does NOT exacerbate that problem.</li>
            <li>That was okay though, the cleanser&#x27;s benefits far outweighed that.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin and tend to try and scrub it even though I know better.</li>
            <li>I still think it’s worth a try</li>
            <li>This product just wasn&#x27;t for me because I like things with lighter smells that aren&#x27;t so powerful, plus when you put it on your face it smells even stronger because it&#x27;s right under your nose.</li>
            <li>Okay, here&#x27;s the deal; you take the rich, creamy and luminescent white cleanser formula, wrap it up in a posh-looking package design and change the price tag from $6.42 to $30...</li>
            <li>I have so many other cleansers that work better that to choose this one</li>
            <li>I had the biggest pimple on my face right beteew</li>
            <li>Also, it lathered well - but, again, to just the right amount.  </li>
            <li>I will say this product lathers up nicely and seems to clean well enough, although I didn&#x27;t particularly notice any &amp;#34;luminous&amp;#34; results either.</li>
            <li>As a 40-something woman with a fair complexion and oily skin that seems to get more sensitive with each passing year I was a little concerned that this product might not work well for me-</li>
            <li>Nice exfoliating cleanser that doesn&#x27;t dry out your face.</li>
            <li>- I&#x27;m really sensitive to strong fragrances</li>
            <li>The Ponds Luminous exfoliating cleanser is a mild cleanser that works very well.  </li>
            <li>Overall this is great for daily use.</li>
            <li>I have very oily skin and wear light make-up, I found that this cleanser worked very well to remove my make-up and oil without feeling like it stripped my face.  </li>
            <li>This is such a great product and low priced unlike some of the &amp;#34;big names&amp;#34; out there.  </li>
            <li>had high hopes for Pond&#x27;s Luminous Clean.</li>
            <li>love the scent and small microbeads.. great for daily use.</li>
            <li>Very gentle.  </li>
            <li>This is a very nice, gentle everyday cleanser.</li>
            <li>/&gt;First, it is very gentle and moisturizing, as one would expect from a Pond&#x27;s cleanser.</li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;The smell is not too high, or too sweet, it&#x27;s just right.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>This cleanser works very well!</li>
            <li>This is so helpful in getting rid of my deadskin and making my face so smooth and soft, I still have to use lotion immediately after.</li>
            <li>Each person is sure to have differing opinions on face washes but Pond&#x27;s hasn&#x27;t ever left my face...refreshed.</li>
            <li>Overall, you could do better</li>
            <li>/&gt;Unfortunately, that does not happen with this product and really left me wanting more.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve found something way better and,the cost is lesser.</li>
            <li>First off, I am not a fan of any cream cleansers.</li>
            <li>My first response to the cleanser was....</li>
            <li>It works every bit as well as the higher priced products out there.</li>
            <li>I love facial scrubs, but I am picky with them.</li>
            <li>but unfortunately, I have lost trust in the longevity of their \\&quot;new\\&quot; great products!!!</li>
            <li>I will say, however, that my skin is definitely smoother since I started using these products, and the rosacea-esque areas on my face seem to be blending much better with the rest of my skin tone.</li>
            <li>It has a nice scent, gentle exfoliation, lathers well, rinses well and doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin.  </li>
            <li>The scent is pleasant and not overpowering, for me, but it seems different people have a lot of different preferences in the smell category.</li>
            <li>It makes your skin feel clean and soft.</li>
            <li>I have oily skin, and have tried hundreds of products over the years to keep my skin both clean and unblemished.</li>
            <li>So I pretty much stayed away from any Pond&#x27;s products...</li>
            <li>I also like the scent, which is soft and sweet.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t like dry skin, and it irritates me to have to re-wash my face as it were, but the not-so-long-term effect of this product has me satisfied.  </li>
            <li>It cleans well and does not leave the skin too dry as many cleaners do.</li>
            <li>, I am still acne prone during certain times of the month.</li>
            <li>My face is left very soft and smooth, which I love, and there are no dry patches after I towel off.  </li>
            <li>I have had no increase in acne, a significant decrease in visible black heads on my nose and chin and no increase in fine lines.</li>
            <li>Best part, it doesn&#x27;t leave your face feeling tight and dried out.</li>
            <li>As a man, however, I will say that this is a product that&#x27;s really for women (I picked it up as an Amazon Vine freebie), because the smell is so \\&quot;pretty\\&quot; and feminine.</li>
            <li>I feel that this is so gentle</li>
            <li>, I didn&#x27;t feel it exfoliated very well.  </li>
            <li>think maybe this is for someone much younger.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Thanks to Bzz Agent</li>
            <li>I really like this exfoliating cleanser.</li>
            <li>Mission accomplished with this one.</li>
            <li>$60 is too much these days.</li>
            <li>It seemed to work well, despite its gentle feeling</li>
            <li>However, I highly recommend as a cleanser!</li>
            <li>I really like it and am looking forward to washing my face at night and not having to glom on a bunch of moisturizer afterwards.</li>
            <li>Also, it took off makeup very well while washing.</li>
            <li>It does foam a bit, but not so much until after you&#x27;ve scrubbed with it and are rinsing your face.</li>
            <li>No matter how gentle the product purported to be, it was too much.  </li>
            <li>/looking is what really mattered.  </li>
            <li>absolutely will seek out/buy this product, now that I am almost finished with my inaugural tube.</li>
            <li>I also want to be gentle with my skin so it doesn&#x27;t look like a lobster.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>So one would think it was gentle.</li>
            <li>I absolutely don&#x27;t want or need it to be adding fragrance to me.</li>
            <li>, I didn&#x27;t get any sense that it was much of an exfoliator.</li>
            <li>are gentle.</li>
            <li>The product claims to have \\&quot;gentle</li>
            <li>microbeads\\&quot; - and maybe the *microbeads* are gentle but the chemicals used are not.</li>
            <li>But it wasn&#x27;t very ex-foliating.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It turns out this product doesn&#x27;t really work for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I was fortunate enough to receive samples of these products to review through BzzAgent</li>
            <li>and I hope you like them as much as I do.</li>
            <li>course, what really matters is the contents itself, and, that considered, I especially like that the exfoliating beads in the cleanser are so subtle that they easily wash off my face--and not, like most of the other exfoliating cleansers that I&#x27;ve used--get caught in my eyes--not a good feeling!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>clay in this cleanser was a more gentle exfoliant than the rougher salts and sands in other cleansers.</li>
            <li>Before getting this product, I would have wanted to know that it was good for dry skin because some cleaners leave my dry skin flaky and this one did not.</li>
            <li>(I truly believe this product cannot exfoliate and just leads to more breakouts due to clogged pores).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>PONDS has a long tradition of offering gentle and effective facial cleansing creams.  </li>
            <li>I tried the Pond&#x27;s luminous clean daily exfoliating cleanser for a while</li>
            <li>My face ACTUALLY feels clean.  </li>
            <li>that it doesn’t fully remove some waterproof eye products (which is true, but I have yet to find a “gentle” daily cleanser that does).</li>
            <li>, the actual consistency was much too fine as far as the exfoliating particles.</li>
            <li>I have extremely dry sensitive skin and have an allergic reaction to most products.  </li>
            <li>I was surprised how much I liked this, since I have tended to avoid daily facial cleansers that had any sort of exfoliating element.  </li>
            <li>I said though, as a single use every so often this is a perfectly fine product.</li>
            <li>For me, I won&#x27;t continue to use as it felt drying to my skin (normal to dry) and the smell was too strong (maybe floral).</li>
            <li>The towelettes really make it hard to find an excuse to go to bed without removing my makeup, and the cream cleanser ranks as one of the best ones I’ve used in recent years.</li>
            <li>had hoped that because it has kaolin clay it would be better for my oily skin than a typical moisturizing cleanser.</li>
            <li>I use it daily and my skin is soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>Pond&#x27;s face cleanser is decent.</li>
            <li>If your skin is very tender or sensitive I would suggest this cleanser because it was extremely gentle on your face.</li>
            <li>, I was lucky enough to participate in the Pond&#x27;s BzzCampaigns.</li>
            <li>When I want an exfoliating cleanser, I want something with a decent amount of grit to it, so I know it is exfoliating.</li>
            <li>concerns I read about before trying this product involved the scent (which I personally find both soothing and refreshing), the tightness after use (which for me starts about 1 minute after use and only lasts a couple of minutes), and</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this cleanser for normal to oily skin</li>
            <li>I would usually not want to use an exfoliator on a daily basis, but I have no hesitation with this one because it is so mild and leaves my skin feeling refreshed and moisturized.</li>
            <li>But it does clean well and does not leave your face feeling dry.</li>
            <li>, I really like, Your skin feels refreshed, soft and looks luminous</li>
            <li>However, this is truly gentle, yet it had more \\&quot;oomph\\&quot; to it than my usual gel/lotion</li>
            <li>There is no grime or residue left over, just a fresh face.  </li>
            <li>wouldn&#x27;t feel right recommending this product, especially as an exfoliator.</li>
            <li>The Ponds daily exfoliating cleanser left my face feeling very refreshed and clean.</li>
            <li>I live in the Caribbean</li>
            <li>Ponds is still a trusted name even with new versions of their products.  </li>
            <li>I got this product, hoping my skin would feel new and to use their word: luminous.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The New Pond&#x27;s Luminous Clean Cream Cleanser and the Pond&#x27;s Wet Cleansing Towelettes is a must have.</li>
            <li>I have used many facial cleansers and never really been too tickled with them.</li>
            <li>This daily cleanser squeezes out from a tube like toothpaste, is glossy white with scrubbing flecks, and is lightly fragrant.  </li>
            <li>a little hard to wash off sometimes but otherwise a good product!</li>
            <li>Itis very gentle, so I can understand why it could be used daily, and some people with very sensitive skin may benefit from this product.</li>
            <li>However, this product doesn&#x27;t have very much kaolin - you can see in the ingredient list that it&#x27;s one of the last ingredients.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had it for several months now, hoping to find the right ratio of when to use it, and I just can&#x27;t bring myself to use it frequently.</li>
            <li>my face has a natural glow,the cream cleanser has the texture of a Mask or Clay but not as heavy, when on the face,I love the soft scent (it&#x27;s not a overwhelming scent)I love</li>
            <li>A toning clarifier afterward proved no residue of makeup remained, even after a formal event that had required more (makeup) than usual.</li>
            <li>I really only use this cleanser once a week though even though it&#x27;s gentle, mainly because I don&#x27;t want to over-exfoliate my face for no reason.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Compared to other brands I don&#x27;t find my face as clean as I did with them.</li>
            <li>I wan to see if my face is really clean, so I washed face as normal and then washed again with my normal face cleanser,</li>
            <li>the other hand, like other Pond&#x27;s cleansers, this one did leave my skin nice and soft.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This is a very gently exfoliating facial cleanser, so gentle in fact, you might feel as if you simply washed with liquid hand soap.</li>
            <li>Pond&#x27;s Luminous Clean Daily Exfoliating Cleanser may be a lovely product, but this user was unable to test it thoroughly due to the strong scent.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s clear and soft and I&#x27;ve had two people ask me what new make-up</li>
            <li>I have dry, sensitive skin, and the product the not irritate my face, so that&#x27;s a very positive sign.</li>
            <li>I also have rosacea, so if I scrub too hard, or use products with too many chemicals, my skin turns read.</li>
            <li>Initially, the Pond&#x27;s product feels very thick and creamy, which is nice, but it really keeps the exfoliating part from working.</li>
            <li>I definitely would not recommend it for anyone with sensitive skin due to the strong scent.</li>
            <li>So I only use this when I have NO breakouts because the cleanser I have for acne-prone skin helps to clear my skin up much faster.</li>
            <li>I would really recommend trying this exfoliator, especially for people with sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>I have to say I was really surprised at how it works.</li>
            <li>exfoliation keeps the skin young</li>
            <li>As far as long-lasting results, I think my skin is just as \\&quot;renewed\\&quot; and \\&quot;luminous\\</li>
            <li>Makes my face young and glowing.</li>
            <li>So, my complaint is more like a half-complaint.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Maybe they are trying to do too much with this cleanser, or not enough.</li>
            <li>After three days of using both of these Pond&#x27;s products my11 year old son came up to me and said.\\&quot; Mom are you getting lighter or something\\</li>
            <li>It came with two sets, so my mother is a Ponds user, she like the old Pond products...</li>
            <li>It leaves my skin smooth and not at all dried out.  </li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin</li>
            <li>face did feel soft after using it, so I guess that is a plus, but with as heavily scented as it is, I have to wonder if it is just more \\&quot;crap\\&quot; in it that made my skin feel soft and slippery and not the actual exfoliation</li>
            <li>, it somehow makes me feel like I&#x27;m really getting the cleanest, freshest face possible before bed.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been a fan of Clinique&#x27;s Seventh Day scrub cream for years - this product just completely replaced it.</li>
            <li>I am 38 years old and have aging, acne prone combination skin.</li>
            <li>For those sensitive to fragrance or those with breathing issues, this is not for you.  </li>
            <li>and I’ve been pleasantly surprised.</li>
            <li>way\\&quot; I&#x27;ve have, had problem with acne and dark spots,I used this products for about five days now,not even a full week</li>
            <li>This cleanser is very gentle and maybe it&#x27;s because I have dry (old) skin</li>
            <li>It has a faint rose smell (typical to Ponds products) and is fairly easy to apply and wash off.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used plenty of exfoliating cleansers but most dry my skin out and give that tight feeling.</li>
            <li>First of all, I wasn&#x27;t a very big Pond&#x27;s fan, since I tried using one of their creams when I was younger (can&#x27;t remember which one)</li>
            <li>But, Doesn&#x27;t clean skin well enough, or get makeup off barley like other face washes.</li>
            <li>All I have to say is WOW, for anyone looking for a new face cleanser look no further!</li>
            <li>I personally like my exfoliants a little rougher, like to feel as though I can feel them working, but I can&#x27;t deny how soft and smooth the clay and beads made my face feel.</li>
            <li>The first thing I did was, pull out the wet cleansing towelettes and start wiping my face.</li>
            <li>your face is more delicate and fragile, you don&#x27;t need/</li>
            <li>No other product is needed.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d heard that using a gentle exfoliating product every day is better for your skin than my usual routine of using a plain cleanser every day and a scrub once a week.</li>
            <li>After using it my skin felt really clean, soft, and moisturized;  it didn&#x27;t have that tight and dry feeling that some exfoliators leave.  </li>
            <li>Hardly any fragrance, leaves my face baby smooth and my makeup goes on like a dream.</li>
            <li>They also have the towelettes to go with it and the swipe make-up right off, again without your face feeling sticky, itchy and tight.</li>
            <li>My skin is somewhat sensitive, so I was worried about drying effects from using it daily, but that did not occur.</li>
            <li>My skin is left feeling soft and refreshed and moisturized.  </li>
            <li>The only product I&#x27;ve found so far</li>
            <li>greasy-looking with occasional to frequent breakouts.</li>
            <li>I find that when I use this, my breakouts don&#x27;t respond at all - they don&#x27;t get better, but they don&#x27;t get worse either.</li>
            <li>It also helps to lighten up dark spots - although slowly, but still effective.</li>
            <li>My skin is a bit dry and flaky so I need exfoliation, but it needs to be gentle enough</li>
            <li>far as scent goes, contrary to what many of the other reviewers say, I smell a delicate, non-intrusive aroma that accentuates the product.</li>
            <li>The \\&quot;sand\\&quot; that makes other exfoliating scrubs feel like you&#x27;re really doing something just isn&#x27;t there.</li>
            <li>I will be going back to my old facial cleanser and exfoliating scrub.</li>
            <li>does not dry out face</li>
            <li>that kind of works without starting a reaction is an expensive department store brand.</li>
            <li>I only gave this product 3 stars because some may find the product&#x27;s smell to be too strong and because the exfoliation factor was not good.</li>
            <li>i recommend it to other girls and women with normal skin.</li>

            <li> Amazing.</li>
            <li> Really great cleanser that made my face feel smooth after taking my makeup off.</li>
            <li> Nice Foaming cleanser.</li>
            <li> Nice fragrance though.</li>
            <li> The price is good and can&#x27;t ask for much more.  </li>
            <li> This cleanser fits the bill nicely.</li>
            <li> For that reason, I can&#x27;t honestly recommend this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m torn here, so take this for what it is and make your own decision regarding the product.  </li>
            <li> It was nice to use</li>
            <li> it was nice</li>
            <li> I very much liked using this cleanser.</li>
            <li> and I actually liked it.</li>
            <li> I like the rose scent.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t want my perfume choice to have to \\&quot;compete\\&quot; with the rose of this cleaning</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used kaolin clay masks before and liked them a lot.</li>
            <li> It had a strong, pleasant, feminine scent that dissipated soon after use.</li>
            <li> Pleasant fragrance that I found to be light, but noticeable.  </li>
            <li> It is very overwhelming with a very sweet, cloying scent.</li>
            <li> I prefer a bit more noticeable grit in my exfoliating cream, but this seems to do a nice job...</li>
            <li> found the fragrance to be just right - pleasant without being overpowering.  </li>
            <li> Love the lather and smell.</li>
            <li> This line of products are fantastic!</li>
            <li> okay, $15.  </li>
            <li> but there are definitely better ones.</li>
            <li> Love this product and have not been able to find it at my grocers or Walgreen&#x27;s or CVS.  </li>
            <li> So pleased that I ordered for both my daughters.</li>
            <li> But daily use isn&#x27;t the best in my opinion.</li>
            <li> I feel as if I could keep washing my face and continue to get more stuff off it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It does work better when used with exfoliating pads though.</li>
            <li> This has a lovely scent and a creamy consistency.  </li>
            <li> but I was expecting something more</li>
            <li> feel some scrub... and that nice, smooth feeling you get afterwards.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> my nose and lip area (what a better time to arrive),as well as makeup to cover the pimple.</li>
            <li> but you look light in a nice</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t know about Pond&#x27;s and how great their products really are, I don&#x27;t need a monthly subscription that&#x27;ll cost me $400.00 a year.</li>
            <li> Okay</li>
            <li> I would recommend this if you want a more cleaner and softer skin.</li>
            <li> I only gave 4 stars because I feel that this isn&#x27;t the best for acne-prone skin.</li>
            <li> The more I use this product the better my skin feels and looks.</li>
            <li> I won&#x27;t give up my Purity, but one change at a time :)</li>
            <li> It reminds you more of a body product, with a lot of scent.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it off and on over a 2 week period, in the shower and out, and have been satisfied by both types of usage.</li>
            <li> Just OK, wouldn&#x27;t buy again</li>
            <li> Got this for my wife and she said:  The product has a nice consistency and does smooth your skin a bit.  </li>
            <li> I use it every day and my skin is super clean and feels great after using it.</li>
            <li> Again, I&#x27;ve used many products over the years</li>
            <li> Did an okay job.</li>
            <li> It has more \\&quot;Fragrance\\&quot;</li>
            <li> &quot; - this is a smooth liquid rather than a grainy substance - but my skin sure felt good and clean after using it.</li>
            <li> I also loved the light and fresh smell!  </li>
            <li> I really liked the Ponds Luminous Clean Cream Cleanser.  </li>
            <li> The one thing I don&#x27;t see is my face becoming more luminous from using the cleanser.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It is rich and creamy and has a nice, light fragrance.  </li>
            <li> , it had a nice clean scent that had a light floral sent.</li>
            <li> The very fine granual feels nice on your skin when gently rubbed in, and it washes off fully.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Summary - if you just want a \\&quot;frothy soap\\&quot; that has a strong rose scent, and your skin doesn&#x27;t mind being hit with chemicals, this could be just right for you.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Summary - if you just want a \\&quot;frothy soap\\&quot; that has a strong rose scent, and your skin doesn&#x27;t mind being hit with chemicals, this could be just right for you.</li>
            <li> leaves my skin very clean and smooth.</li>
            <li> It leaves my skin feeling very clean and smooth.</li>
            <li> It moisturized wonderfully and seemed to make my skin brighter than when using other exfoliating cleansers.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have ordered the cream soap which may be more suited for drier skin, i curretnly use marykay moisturizer, but i have ordered the moisturizer for this line and am excited to try it.</li>
            <li> The exfoliation is very mild (compared to some of the peach cleansers I have used) but it works well without over drying your skin.  </li>
            <li> I love the way the POND&#x27;S Luminous Clean Cream Cleanser makes my face feel after I wash.  </li>
            <li> Strongly recommend.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know whether I&#x27;m just catching up with their improvements, but I liked this exfoliating cleanser that smelled nice and left my skin feeling softened and clean.</li>
            <li> and I was inundated with this strong perfume smell</li>
            <li> The cream smells great (which is not always the case for facial cleansers), is nice and creamy, and leaves the face feeling fresh.</li>
            <li> So, if you&#x27;re someone that never breaks out, yet have dark spots that you want to lighten, this is perfect for you!</li>
            <li> So I must say that the new Ponds cream cleanser is a good product.</li>
            <li> my skin feels quite smooth after using.  </li>
            <li> The whole line of Luminous products by Ponds is amazing.</li>
            <li> Okay ladies, it&#x27;s actually worth the money.</li>
            <li> This product has gentle, exfoliating beads and is creamy and foams nicely.</li>
            <li> If you have sensitive skin and need a good cleanser, you might want to give this one a try.</li>
            <li> The cleanser has a nice, pleasant scent and it left my face feeling fresh, clean, and smooth.  </li>
            <li> Very gentle and perfect for dry skin!</li>
            <li> I love this product my face feels clean and fresh</li>
            <li> Very creamy but does the job in cleaning pores and making your face feel nice and clean.  </li>
            <li> This soap removes my makeup, (I love makeup) leaves my skin feeling fresh and clean.</li>
            <li> For me though, I really love the way my skin feels right after my weekly scrub, like I&#x27;m 100% clean and glowing.</li>
            <li> leaves my skin clean and smooth.</li>
            <li> Leaves my skin feeling smooth and clean.  </li>
            <li> I like how it feels going on--and my face feels clean and smooth after use.</li>
            <li> I only had 9 days to use so on day one I looked at the packaging , which I thought was very nice and clean looking.</li>
            <li> I like it much better than some of the higher priced products.</li>
            <li> When I first used this product, my skin was more baby like, softer, and even My acne was disapearing.</li>
            <li> Clean scent.</li>
            <li> Leaves your face feeling so refreshed and clean.  </li>
            <li> The Luminous clean cleanser</li>
            <li> Otherwise, I am satisfied with this product and would recommend it for all types of skin, even those with more sensitive cleansing needs.</li>
            <li> I want my pores to be clean.</li>
            <li> If I&#x27;m going to use a scent, I want to choose it myself, after I am clean.</li>
            <li> Nice and soft!</li>
            <li> Leaves my skin clean, but nothing special at all about this product.  </li>
            <li> The rose scent is pretty strong in this cleanser and should be toned down, and I like a nice rose smell as much as anyone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> But when I used this my skin looked really bright and refreshed, and I love the micro beads, they aren&#x27;t overly harsh, so it&#x27;s a nice gentle scrub.</li>
            <li> Today, since there are so many choices on the shelves, it&#x27;s not always easy to find something new and trust that it won&#x27;t irritate your skin.  </li>
            <li> For those of you who like or love this product including other \\&quot;new\\&quot; Ponds products, you should enjoy the product now because like prior good products by Ponds, this product might be history in another 2 to 5 years!!!</li>
            <li> I also have very sensitive skin - I easily get a rash if something has too many chemicals or coloring in it.</li>
            <li> I liked the way that the very creamy Ponds Luminous Cleanser felt going on and found that it cleaned my face pretty well</li>
            <li> It makes my skin feel fresh and smooth.</li>
            <li> Yes, Pond&#x27;s leaves my face super clean, and knowing that the cleanser will not clog my pores is an added perk.</li>
            <li> I loved the color which was like a pearlized white color.</li>
            <li> : Nice scent, Nice amount microbeads, decrease in acne and black heads, clean luminous skin</li>
            <li> Affordable and gives a really good deep cleaning</li>
            <li> This is a good cleanser that goes a step above by adding micro-beads (for exfoliation) and clay.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s not a bad product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d notice a feeling of this tingling sensation on my face and, not a bad feeling a smoothing sensation so</li>
            <li> i love the little exfoliating beads and it smells good</li>
            <li> I personally love the smell, compared to the older Pond&#x27;s products.</li>
            <li> It is gentle and good for sensitive skin, too.  </li>
            <li> This much rose smell is really too much.</li>
            <li> From the very first use I noticed a difference.</li>
            <li> I then too a good long look at my face.</li>
            <li> The smell is pleasant and the exfoliating beads are not too rough.</li>
            <li> Although I like a \\&quot;clean\\&quot; scent from my cleansers, the rosey smell was much too strong for me.</li>
            <li> It was silky smooth in the heat of the shower and came off cleanly when applied over the sink, followed by a warm wet washcloth.</li>
            <li> Rinses clean easily and leaves my skin feeling really soft and clean.</li>
            <li> I would classify this as a gentle and pleasant facial cleanser.  </li>
            <li> It is extremely gentle and mild and goes on smooth.  </li>
            <li> nice light smell.big tube and very little is required for each wash as the product is very rich and not liquid.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s fairly decent at removing eye makeup in warm water, it lathers beautifully, and the microbeads are not too irritating for me.</li>
            <li> Thanks again to Bzz agent as well as thanks to Pond&#x27;s for creating such a great product at an affordable price</li>
            <li> Also worth noting is that it will not clog your pores to precipitate acne like some of the competing products on the market.  </li>
            <li> What&#x27;s more, as an adult who still struggles with acne from time to time, this product does NOT exacerbate that problem.</li>
            <li> That was okay though, the cleanser&#x27;s benefits far outweighed that.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and tend to try and scrub it even though I know better.</li>
            <li> I still think it’s worth a try</li>
            <li> This product just wasn&#x27;t for me because I like things with lighter smells that aren&#x27;t so powerful, plus when you put it on your face it smells even stronger because it&#x27;s right under your nose.</li>
            <li> Okay, here&#x27;s the deal; you take the rich, creamy and luminescent white cleanser formula, wrap it up in a posh-looking package design and change the price tag from $6.42 to $30...</li>
            <li> I have so many other cleansers that work better that to choose this one</li>
            <li> I had the biggest pimple on my face right beteew</li>
            <li> Also, it lathered well - but, again, to just the right amount.  </li>
            <li> I will say this product lathers up nicely and seems to clean well enough, although I didn&#x27;t particularly notice any &amp;#34;luminous&amp;#34; results either.</li>
            <li> As a 40-something woman with a fair complexion and oily skin that seems to get more sensitive with each passing year I was a little concerned that this product might not work well for me-</li>
            <li> Nice exfoliating cleanser that doesn&#x27;t dry out your face.</li>
            <li> - I&#x27;m really sensitive to strong fragrances</li>
            <li> The Ponds Luminous exfoliating cleanser is a mild cleanser that works very well.  </li>
            <li> Overall this is great for daily use.</li>
            <li> I have very oily skin and wear light make-up, I found that this cleanser worked very well to remove my make-up and oil without feeling like it stripped my face.  </li>
            <li> This is such a great product and low priced unlike some of the &amp;#34;big names&amp;#34; out there.  </li>
            <li> had high hopes for Pond&#x27;s Luminous Clean.</li>
            <li> love the scent and small microbeads.. great for daily use.</li>
            <li> Very gentle.  </li>
            <li> This is a very nice, gentle everyday cleanser.</li>
            <li> /&gt;First, it is very gentle and moisturizing, as one would expect from a Pond&#x27;s cleanser.</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;The smell is not too high, or too sweet, it&#x27;s just right.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> This cleanser works very well!</li>
            <li> This is so helpful in getting rid of my deadskin and making my face so smooth and soft, I still have to use lotion immediately after.</li>
            <li> Each person is sure to have differing opinions on face washes but Pond&#x27;s hasn&#x27;t ever left my face...refreshed.</li>
            <li> Overall, you could do better</li>
            <li> /&gt;Unfortunately, that does not happen with this product and really left me wanting more.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve found something way better and,the cost is lesser.</li>
            <li> First off, I am not a fan of any cream cleansers.</li>
            <li> My first response to the cleanser was....</li>
            <li> It works every bit as well as the higher priced products out there.</li>
            <li> I love facial scrubs, but I am picky with them.</li>
            <li> but unfortunately, I have lost trust in the longevity of their \\&quot;new\\&quot; great products!!!</li>
            <li> I will say, however, that my skin is definitely smoother since I started using these products, and the rosacea-esque areas on my face seem to be blending much better with the rest of my skin tone.</li>
            <li> It has a nice scent, gentle exfoliation, lathers well, rinses well and doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin.  </li>
            <li> The scent is pleasant and not overpowering, for me, but it seems different people have a lot of different preferences in the smell category.</li>
            <li> It makes your skin feel clean and soft.</li>
            <li> I have oily skin, and have tried hundreds of products over the years to keep my skin both clean and unblemished.</li>
            <li> So I pretty much stayed away from any Pond&#x27;s products...</li>
            <li> I also like the scent, which is soft and sweet.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like dry skin, and it irritates me to have to re-wash my face as it were, but the not-so-long-term effect of this product has me satisfied.  </li>
            <li> It cleans well and does not leave the skin too dry as many cleaners do.</li>
            <li> , I am still acne prone during certain times of the month.</li>
            <li> My face is left very soft and smooth, which I love, and there are no dry patches after I towel off.  </li>
            <li> I have had no increase in acne, a significant decrease in visible black heads on my nose and chin and no increase in fine lines.</li>
            <li> Best part, it doesn&#x27;t leave your face feeling tight and dried out.</li>
            <li> As a man, however, I will say that this is a product that&#x27;s really for women (I picked it up as an Amazon Vine freebie), because the smell is so \\&quot;pretty\\&quot; and feminine.</li>
            <li> I feel that this is so gentle</li>
            <li> , I didn&#x27;t feel it exfoliated very well.  </li>
            <li> think maybe this is for someone much younger.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Thanks to Bzz Agent</li>
            <li> I really like this exfoliating cleanser.</li>
            <li> Mission accomplished with this one.</li>
            <li> $60 is too much these days.</li>
            <li> It seemed to work well, despite its gentle feeling</li>
            <li> However, I highly recommend as a cleanser!</li>
            <li> I really like it and am looking forward to washing my face at night and not having to glom on a bunch of moisturizer afterwards.</li>
            <li> Also, it took off makeup very well while washing.</li>
            <li> It does foam a bit, but not so much until after you&#x27;ve scrubbed with it and are rinsing your face.</li>
            <li> No matter how gentle the product purported to be, it was too much.  </li>
            <li> /looking is what really mattered.  </li>
            <li> absolutely will seek out/buy this product, now that I am almost finished with my inaugural tube.</li>
            <li> I also want to be gentle with my skin so it doesn&#x27;t look like a lobster.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> So one would think it was gentle.</li>
            <li> I absolutely don&#x27;t want or need it to be adding fragrance to me.</li>
            <li> , I didn&#x27;t get any sense that it was much of an exfoliator.</li>
            <li> are gentle.</li>
            <li> The product claims to have \\&quot;gentle</li>
            <li> microbeads\\&quot; - and maybe the *microbeads* are gentle but the chemicals used are not.</li>
            <li> But it wasn&#x27;t very ex-foliating.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It turns out this product doesn&#x27;t really work for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I was fortunate enough to receive samples of these products to review through BzzAgent</li>
            <li> and I hope you like them as much as I do.</li>
            <li> course, what really matters is the contents itself, and, that considered, I especially like that the exfoliating beads in the cleanser are so subtle that they easily wash off my face--and not, like most of the other exfoliating cleansers that I&#x27;ve used--get caught in my eyes--not a good feeling!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> clay in this cleanser was a more gentle exfoliant than the rougher salts and sands in other cleansers.</li>
            <li> Before getting this product, I would have wanted to know that it was good for dry skin because some cleaners leave my dry skin flaky and this one did not.</li>
            <li> (I truly believe this product cannot exfoliate and just leads to more breakouts due to clogged pores).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> PONDS has a long tradition of offering gentle and effective facial cleansing creams.  </li>
            <li> I tried the Pond&#x27;s luminous clean daily exfoliating cleanser for a while</li>
            <li> My face ACTUALLY feels clean.  </li>
            <li> that it doesn’t fully remove some waterproof eye products (which is true, but I have yet to find a “gentle” daily cleanser that does).</li>
            <li> , the actual consistency was much too fine as far as the exfoliating particles.</li>
            <li> I have extremely dry sensitive skin and have an allergic reaction to most products.  </li>
            <li> I was surprised how much I liked this, since I have tended to avoid daily facial cleansers that had any sort of exfoliating element.  </li>
            <li> I said though, as a single use every so often this is a perfectly fine product.</li>
            <li> For me, I won&#x27;t continue to use as it felt drying to my skin (normal to dry) and the smell was too strong (maybe floral).</li>
            <li> The towelettes really make it hard to find an excuse to go to bed without removing my makeup, and the cream cleanser ranks as one of the best ones I’ve used in recent years.</li>
            <li> had hoped that because it has kaolin clay it would be better for my oily skin than a typical moisturizing cleanser.</li>
            <li> I use it daily and my skin is soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> Pond&#x27;s face cleanser is decent.</li>
            <li> If your skin is very tender or sensitive I would suggest this cleanser because it was extremely gentle on your face.</li>
            <li> , I was lucky enough to participate in the Pond&#x27;s BzzCampaigns.</li>
            <li> When I want an exfoliating cleanser, I want something with a decent amount of grit to it, so I know it is exfoliating.</li>
            <li> concerns I read about before trying this product involved the scent (which I personally find both soothing and refreshing), the tightness after use (which for me starts about 1 minute after use and only lasts a couple of minutes), and</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this cleanser for normal to oily skin</li>
            <li> I would usually not want to use an exfoliator on a daily basis, but I have no hesitation with this one because it is so mild and leaves my skin feeling refreshed and moisturized.</li>
            <li> But it does clean well and does not leave your face feeling dry.</li>
            <li> , I really like, Your skin feels refreshed, soft and looks luminous</li>
            <li> However, this is truly gentle, yet it had more \\&quot;oomph\\&quot; to it than my usual gel/lotion</li>
            <li> There is no grime or residue left over, just a fresh face.  </li>
            <li> wouldn&#x27;t feel right recommending this product, especially as an exfoliator.</li>
            <li> The Ponds daily exfoliating cleanser left my face feeling very refreshed and clean.</li>
            <li> I live in the Caribbean</li>
            <li> Ponds is still a trusted name even with new versions of their products.  </li>
            <li> I got this product, hoping my skin would feel new and to use their word: luminous.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The New Pond&#x27;s Luminous Clean Cream Cleanser and the Pond&#x27;s Wet Cleansing Towelettes is a must have.</li>
            <li> I have used many facial cleansers and never really been too tickled with them.</li>
            <li> This daily cleanser squeezes out from a tube like toothpaste, is glossy white with scrubbing flecks, and is lightly fragrant.  </li>
            <li> a little hard to wash off sometimes but otherwise a good product!</li>
            <li> Itis very gentle, so I can understand why it could be used daily, and some people with very sensitive skin may benefit from this product.</li>
            <li> However, this product doesn&#x27;t have very much kaolin - you can see in the ingredient list that it&#x27;s one of the last ingredients.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had it for several months now, hoping to find the right ratio of when to use it, and I just can&#x27;t bring myself to use it frequently.</li>
            <li> my face has a natural glow,the cream cleanser has the texture of a Mask or Clay but not as heavy, when on the face,I love the soft scent (it&#x27;s not a overwhelming scent)I love</li>
            <li> A toning clarifier afterward proved no residue of makeup remained, even after a formal event that had required more (makeup) than usual.</li>
            <li> I really only use this cleanser once a week though even though it&#x27;s gentle, mainly because I don&#x27;t want to over-exfoliate my face for no reason.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Compared to other brands I don&#x27;t find my face as clean as I did with them.</li>
            <li> I wan to see if my face is really clean, so I washed face as normal and then washed again with my normal face cleanser,</li>
            <li> the other hand, like other Pond&#x27;s cleansers, this one did leave my skin nice and soft.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This is a very gently exfoliating facial cleanser, so gentle in fact, you might feel as if you simply washed with liquid hand soap.</li>
            <li> Pond&#x27;s Luminous Clean Daily Exfoliating Cleanser may be a lovely product, but this user was unable to test it thoroughly due to the strong scent.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s clear and soft and I&#x27;ve had two people ask me what new make-up</li>
            <li> I have dry, sensitive skin, and the product the not irritate my face, so that&#x27;s a very positive sign.</li>
            <li> I also have rosacea, so if I scrub too hard, or use products with too many chemicals, my skin turns read.</li>
            <li> Initially, the Pond&#x27;s product feels very thick and creamy, which is nice, but it really keeps the exfoliating part from working.</li>
            <li> I definitely would not recommend it for anyone with sensitive skin due to the strong scent.</li>
            <li> So I only use this when I have NO breakouts because the cleanser I have for acne-prone skin helps to clear my skin up much faster.</li>
            <li> I would really recommend trying this exfoliator, especially for people with sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li> I have to say I was really surprised at how it works.</li>
            <li> exfoliation keeps the skin young</li>
            <li> As far as long-lasting results, I think my skin is just as \\&quot;renewed\\&quot; and \\&quot;luminous\\</li>
            <li> Makes my face young and glowing.</li>
            <li> So, my complaint is more like a half-complaint.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Maybe they are trying to do too much with this cleanser, or not enough.</li>
            <li> After three days of using both of these Pond&#x27;s products my11 year old son came up to me and said.\\&quot; Mom are you getting lighter or something\\</li>
            <li> It came with two sets, so my mother is a Ponds user, she like the old Pond products...</li>
            <li> It leaves my skin smooth and not at all dried out.  </li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin</li>
            <li> face did feel soft after using it, so I guess that is a plus, but with as heavily scented as it is, I have to wonder if it is just more \\&quot;crap\\&quot; in it that made my skin feel soft and slippery and not the actual exfoliation</li>
            <li> , it somehow makes me feel like I&#x27;m really getting the cleanest, freshest face possible before bed.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been a fan of Clinique&#x27;s Seventh Day scrub cream for years - this product just completely replaced it.</li>
            <li> I am 38 years old and have aging, acne prone combination skin.</li>
            <li> For those sensitive to fragrance or those with breathing issues, this is not for you.  </li>
            <li> and I’ve been pleasantly surprised.</li>
            <li> way\\&quot; I&#x27;ve have, had problem with acne and dark spots,I used this products for about five days now,not even a full week</li>
            <li> This cleanser is very gentle and maybe it&#x27;s because I have dry (old) skin</li>
            <li> It has a faint rose smell (typical to Ponds products) and is fairly easy to apply and wash off.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used plenty of exfoliating cleansers but most dry my skin out and give that tight feeling.</li>
            <li> First of all, I wasn&#x27;t a very big Pond&#x27;s fan, since I tried using one of their creams when I was younger (can&#x27;t remember which one)</li>
            <li> But, Doesn&#x27;t clean skin well enough, or get makeup off barley like other face washes.</li>
            <li> All I have to say is WOW, for anyone looking for a new face cleanser look no further!</li>
            <li> I personally like my exfoliants a little rougher, like to feel as though I can feel them working, but I can&#x27;t deny how soft and smooth the clay and beads made my face feel.</li>
            <li> The first thing I did was, pull out the wet cleansing towelettes and start wiping my face.</li>
            <li> your face is more delicate and fragile, you don&#x27;t need/</li>
            <li> No other product is needed.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d heard that using a gentle exfoliating product every day is better for your skin than my usual routine of using a plain cleanser every day and a scrub once a week.</li>
            <li> After using it my skin felt really clean, soft, and moisturized;  it didn&#x27;t have that tight and dry feeling that some exfoliators leave.  </li>
            <li> Hardly any fragrance, leaves my face baby smooth and my makeup goes on like a dream.</li>
            <li> They also have the towelettes to go with it and the swipe make-up right off, again without your face feeling sticky, itchy and tight.</li>
            <li> My skin is somewhat sensitive, so I was worried about drying effects from using it daily, but that did not occur.</li>
            <li> My skin is left feeling soft and refreshed and moisturized.  </li>
            <li> The only product I&#x27;ve found so far</li>
            <li> greasy-looking with occasional to frequent breakouts.</li>
            <li> I find that when I use this, my breakouts don&#x27;t respond at all - they don&#x27;t get better, but they don&#x27;t get worse either.</li>
            <li> It also helps to lighten up dark spots - although slowly, but still effective.</li>
            <li> My skin is a bit dry and flaky so I need exfoliation, but it needs to be gentle enough</li>
            <li> far as scent goes, contrary to what many of the other reviewers say, I smell a delicate, non-intrusive aroma that accentuates the product.</li>
            <li> The \\&quot;sand\\&quot; that makes other exfoliating scrubs feel like you&#x27;re really doing something just isn&#x27;t there.</li>
            <li> I will be going back to my old facial cleanser and exfoliating scrub.</li>
            <li> does not dry out face</li>
            <li> that kind of works without starting a reaction is an expensive department store brand.</li>
            <li> I only gave this product 3 stars because some may find the product&#x27;s smell to be too strong and because the exfoliation factor was not good.</li>
            <li> i recommend it to other girls and women with normal skin.</li>
            <li> With its promise to counteract the effects of make-up, Pond&#x27;s Luminous Clean Daily Exfoliating Cleanser is probably being marketed to women, but as a guy who has a history of skin trouble (oily skin, acne, etc), I prefer such products to plain soap which I&#x27;ve heard can clog the pores.  </li>
            <li> The kaolin clay is so cool, when it comes out it has this dilluted silly putty texture that&#x27;s really gimmicky and fun.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t feel like I had to race for my daily moisturizer because my cleanser left my face feeling dry.  </li>
            <li> I seen some small blackhead begin to surface right on the side of my lower jaw line, and all my dry patches of dry skin disappeared.</li>
            <li> My face now soft, the dark spots are fading away</li>
            <li> The cleansing beads are almost non-existent and too small to be of any real significance.  </li>
            <li> Also, there were no sensitive or red areas, notwithstanding the exfoliating</li>
            <li> The exfoliating beads are tiny and no matter how hard I scrubbed, didn&#x27;t do much of anything.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;First of all, the first thing I noticed is that it is VERY heavily scented!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve spent hundred&#x27;s of dollars on lotions and potions for my skin, low and behold</li>
            <li> I did not think that it left my skin feeling overly dry and rough, but again it could be because of my oily skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin.</li>
            <li> but I do still need to moisturize as my skin tends to the dry side.</li>
            <li> so I don&#x27;t get too dry.</li>
            <li> In fact, I have to rinse my face again and scrub off the dry skin before leaving the house.  </li>
            <li> This Pond&#x27;s product cleans and exfoliates but doesn&#x27;t overly dry my face</li>
            <li> /&gt;First, my skin is combination to dry.</li>
            <li> It provides enough moisture that my skin doesn&#x27;t feel tight and dry when I finish...</li>
            <li> Shortly after using this product my face gets extremely tight and dry and my skin gets flakey.  </li>
            <li> If your skin is very dry this may not be the soap for you because it does not leave my skin feeling moisturied</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t mind a little bit of scent, but for a facial product, this is just way too overpowering.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s very thick and creamy, doesn&#x27;t have too much grit in it, and didn&#x27;t cause any sensitivity issues for me.</li>
            <li> than a few soft little</li>
            <li> I feel like it took all the dead skin off my face (that my regular face wash just didn&#x27;t do).</li>
            <li> like this cleanser - feels a bit rough on skin - but it is supposed to exfolidate, after all.  </li>
            <li> but it dried my skin out a lot, so could only use it once a week or so.</li>
            <li> When I bought this cleanser, I wanted a gentle exfoliator that I could use without worrying about it irritating my skin.</li>
            <li> I spoke about earlier was dried out and nothing but a scab.</li>
            <li> That means it is... not very scrubby.</li>
            <li> I usually use a creamy facial cleanser, either Neutrogena or L&#x27;Oreal Paris, when I wash my face in the morning and before bed.</li>
            <li> I agree with the advertising, that it is not complicated, time-consuming or expensive to use.&lt;br</li>
            <li> so I used the other set.</li>
            <li> Next I read the directions and proceeded to dampen my face and place a small amount in my palm.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just like any other on the self cleanser.</li>
            <li> That turned me off a little because I just don&#x27;t feel like facial products should be so heavily scented -</li>
            <li> The only negative, and it&#x27;s not really too terrible, is that I would prefer it had a bit more lathering element to it, since even with a generous amount on the face and enough water, there is really not much suds working.  </li>
            <li> My grandma used her jar of cold cream for decades and had the smoothest, softest skin for anyone in their golden years.  </li>
            <li> I fully expected this stuff to join the parade of products I pass on to family members due to the allergic reaction I would get from it.  </li>
            <li> It does have a slightly creamy lather, which I didn&#x27;t mind, but the exfoliation was just not to my liking/preference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> While using it, it does have a slightly greasy feel, but does not leave the skin greasy after it is rinsed off.</li>
            <li> I have this on subscribe and save and purchase it for less than in the stores...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure it is removing any dry or dead skin.  </li>
            <li> The exfoliating factor is pretty insignificant and would be disappointing if you were counting on it.  </li>
            <li> The only reason I didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars was because as other reviewers have said: it&#x27;s not a great exfoiliater.  </li>
            <li> Some of it gets dry and to be blunt thick feeling.</li>
            <li> The flowery scent was a little overbearing for me.</li>
            <li> Microbeads are those little bits of grit that some cleansers contain.</li>
            <li> There are little pearlescent beads in here that are supposed to help remove the dead skin on your face.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s darker than it should be and is a bit tired, and I&#x27;m ONLY 27!</li>
            <li> I can feel a difference after just a few uses.</li>
            <li> You could see the results in few days.</li>
            <li> Then once a week, I use an exfoliating scrub to remove dead skin cells.</li>
            <li> it didn&#x27;t form up until I started to wash off once I was done washing off and pat dried my face</li>
            <li> and I believe it would work wonders for those with sensitive skin that are unable to use rougher exfoliants.</li>
            <li> If you have oily skin, this may be too heavy for you.</li>
            <li> My one complaint, as other reviewers have noted, is the overpowering fragrance.</li>
            <li> I have very dry skin for my age, it always so much worse in the winter.</li>
            <li> I am used to using a cleanser with exfoliant in it and usually don&#x27;t like ones without it -</li>
            <li> Not overwhelming to me.  </li>
            <li> 2 because its hard to wash off.</li>
            <li> I use about a nickel-size amount and, no matter how hard I tried, I couldn&#x27;t get the cleanser to foam in my hand.</li>
            <li> So it&#x27;s a delicate balance.</li>
            <li> I remember Pond&#x27;s products as being thick and rather greasy.</li>
            <li> I did notice that you must use a moisturizer with this product because it will dry your face out, too bad Ponds didn&#x27;t provide a sample of their moisturizer</li>
            <li> but you could definitely do worse.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m on a mission to save some money on expensive beauty products.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately for me, my skin tends to be oily, and moisturizing cleansers often leave me feeling still oily - like I didn&#x27;t get</li>
            <li> Disappointing...</li>
            <li> Like the cold creams I gave her one to use and to let me know what she felt about it.</li>
            <li> As a just cleanser, maybe, IF you like heavily, artificially scented products for your face and just want a cleanser</li>
            <li> but boy was I wrong!</li>
            <li> /&gt;I was disappointed.</li>
            <li> The worst thing about this product is the smell.</li>
            <li> It wasn&#x27;t a terrible cleanser.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> It&#x27;s okay! But, Doesn&#x27;t clean skin well enough, or get makeup off barley like other face washes.</li>
            <li> I have to say I was really surprised at how it works. My skin looked brighter almost instantly after one use. It makes my skin feel fresh and smooth. Love the lather and smell. Doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin. Amazing.</li>
            <li> This cleanser works very well! The smell is pleasant and the exfoliating beads are not too rough. I use it daily and my skin is soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> love the scent and small microbeads.. great for daily use.</li>
            <li> Nice Foaming cleanser. Clean scent. a little hard to wash off sometimes but otherwise a good product!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve spent hundred&#x27;s of dollars on lotions and potions for my skin, low and behold I try a sample of this product and I am hooked. This is the best my skin has looked in many years!  This line of products are fantastic! Love the wipes too!</li>
            <li> First of all, I wasn&#x27;t a very big Pond&#x27;s fan, since I tried using one of their creams when I was younger (can&#x27;t remember which one) and I broke out every time. So I pretty much stayed away from any Pond&#x27;s products...Until now.&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t know what to expect when I bought this product since I&#x27;d gotten it on a whim, but OH MY GOODNESS! I&#x27;m in LOVE with this stuff! From the very first use I noticed a difference. I live in the Caribbean so my skin gets a lot of sun, and as a result it&#x27;s darker than it should be and is a bit tired, and I&#x27;m ONLY 27! But when I used this my skin looked really bright and refreshed, and I love the micro beads, they aren&#x27;t overly harsh, so it&#x27;s a nice gentle scrub. I feel like it took all the dead skin off my face (that my regular face wash just didn&#x27;t do). PLUS I didn&#x27;t break out :D&lt;br /&gt;The smell is not too high, or too sweet, it&#x27;s just right.&lt;br /&gt;I would sooooo recommend this product to anyone, it&#x27;s fantastic!!</li>
            <li> leaves my skin clean and smooth. it is creamy gel with micro beads which foams when you massage it. leaves my skin very clean and smooth. nice light smell.big tube and very little is required for each wash as the product is very rich and not liquid. i recommend it to other girls and women with normal skin. exfoliation keeps the skin young</li>
            <li> Nice exfoliating cleanser that doesn&#x27;t dry out your face.</li>
            <li> This product made my skin breakout.  I had no blemishes before.  After I discontinued use, my skin cleared up.  Nice fragrance though.</li>
            <li> seems to work well.  Leaves my skin feeling smooth and clean.  Good texture and pleasant smell.  I can feel a difference after just a few uses.</li>
            <li> like this cleanser - feels a bit rough on skin - but it is supposed to exfolidate, after all.  follow up with moisturizer for best results.</li>
            <li> This is a very gently exfoliating facial cleanser, so gentle in fact, you might feel as if you simply washed with liquid hand soap. The \\&quot;sand\\&quot; that makes other exfoliating scrubs feel like you&#x27;re really doing something just isn&#x27;t there. But it does clean well and does not leave your face feeling dry. As a man, however, I will say that this is a product that&#x27;s really for women (I picked it up as an Amazon Vine freebie), because the smell is so \\&quot;pretty\\&quot; and feminine.</li>
            <li> I like this exfoliating cleanser.  It is rich and creamy and has a nice, light fragrance.  I prefer a bit more noticeable grit in my exfoliating cream, but this seems to do a nice job...my skin feels quite smooth after using.  It provides enough moisture that my skin doesn&#x27;t feel tight and dry when I finish...but I do still need to moisturize as my skin tends to the dry side.</li>
            <li> Okay, here&#x27;s the deal; you take the rich, creamy and luminescent white cleanser formula, wrap it up in a posh-looking package design and change the price tag from $6.42 to $30...okay, $15.  Will it sell?  Yes, Pond&#x27;s cleanser looks and feels that good!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Of course, what really matters is the contents itself, and, that considered, I especially like that the exfoliating beads in the cleanser are so subtle that they easily wash off my face--and not, like most of the other exfoliating cleansers that I&#x27;ve used--get caught in my eyes--not a good feeling!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As far as scent goes, contrary to what many of the other reviewers say, I smell a delicate, non-intrusive aroma that accentuates the product. Yes, Pond&#x27;s leaves my face super clean, and knowing that the cleanser will not clog my pores is an added perk. As far as long-lasting results, I think my skin is just as \\&quot;renewed\\&quot; and \\&quot;luminous\\&quot; as before I used this Pond&#x27;s product...at my age, I do not expect any miracles from any product, regardless of what skincare manufacturers promote or promise.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Stacy Lytwyn, Marketing Guru/Motivational Speaker/Journalist&lt;br /&gt;Author: CONSUMMATE CONNECTICUT: DAY TRIPS WITH PANACHE</li>
            <li> This is an excellent product.  Works as well as more expensive  brands.  I highly recommend this cleanser for normal to oily skin</li>
            <li> This product is excellent.  Leaves your face feeling so refreshed and clean.  I like it much better than some of the higher priced products.</li>
            <li> It is a great product for the skin. Great quality and great price. You could see the results in few days.</li>
            <li> This does not have enough exfoliation in my opinion, to notice/feel any difference, even after using for several days.  Leaves my skin clean, but nothing special at all about this product.  Disappointing...</li>
            <li> Keep one of these in the shower.  It has a nice scent, gentle exfoliation, lathers well, rinses well and doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin.  The price is good and can&#x27;t ask for much more.  Will continue to buy.</li>
            <li> Amazing. I have very dry skin for my age, it always so much worse in the winter. I have been using Ponds since my teenage years, I am still acne prone during certain times of the month. This is so helpful in getting rid of my deadskin and making my face so smooth and soft, I still have to use lotion immediately after. I used to use an apricot scrub in the wingter but it dried my skin out a lot, so could only use it once a week or so. I can use this one every morning or everyother morning. I wish they would come out with a heavier lotion for this line. The whole line of Luminous products by Ponds is amazing. I personally love the smell, compared to the older Pond&#x27;s products. Buy this your face will thank you.</li>
            <li> When I bought this cleanser, I wanted a gentle exfoliator that I could use without worrying about it irritating my skin. This cleanser fits the bill nicely. I really only use this cleanser once a week though even though it&#x27;s gentle, mainly because I don&#x27;t want to over-exfoliate my face for no reason.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It cleans my skin and doesn&#x27;t clog my pores, just as advertised. It has never caused me any breakouts either (I&#x27;m acne-prone). I also like the smell of the cleanser - I&#x27;m really sensitive to strong fragrances but this cleanser doesn&#x27;t bother me at all. The one thing I don&#x27;t see is my face becoming more luminous from using the cleanser.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, I am starting to stray away from buying products with microbeads in them, since they are known to be harmful to the environment and as well as for your face, since the microbeads can form microscopic tears. For that reason, I can&#x27;t honestly recommend this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a good cleanser but there are definitely better ones.</li>
            <li> If I did not have rosacea, I would use only this wash. Makes my face young and glowing. No other product is needed.</li>
            <li> I love this product my face feels clean and fresh i love the little exfoliating beads and it smells good does not dry out face&lt;br /&gt;great buy</li>
            <li> Love this product and have not been able to find it at my grocers or Walgreen&#x27;s or CVS.  Ordered two so I won&#x27;t run out!</li>
            <li> This cleanser is the best I&#x27;ve found already.  Very creamy but does the job in cleaning pores and making your face feel nice and clean.  I would recommend this product to anyone.</li>
            <li> So pleased that I ordered for both my daughters. It leaves my skin feeling very clean and smooth.</li>
            <li> I heard about this on the blogosphere and immediately had to try it. My skin is a bit dry and flaky so I need exfoliation, but it needs to be gentle enough so I don&#x27;t get too dry. This does all that and more! It&#x27;s fairly decent at removing eye makeup in warm water, it lathers beautifully, and the microbeads are not too irritating for me. I also love the texture! The kaolin clay is so cool, when it comes out it has this dilluted silly putty texture that&#x27;s really gimmicky and fun. Strongly recommend.</li>
            <li> I usually use a creamy facial cleanser, either Neutrogena or L&#x27;Oreal Paris, when I wash my face in the morning and before bed. Then once a week, I use an exfoliating scrub to remove dead skin cells. I was intrigued by this product by Pond&#x27;s, hoping I could use just one product instead of two. Initially, the Pond&#x27;s product feels very thick and creamy, which is nice, but it really keeps the exfoliating part from working. I didn&#x27;t feel like it was scrubbing my skin at all. Itis very gentle, so I can understand why it could be used daily, and some people with very sensitive skin may benefit from this product. The worst thing about this product is the smell. It is very overwhelming with a very sweet, cloying scent. I will be going back to my old facial cleanser and exfoliating scrub.</li>
            <li> Pond&#x27;s face cleanser is decent. If you don&#x27;t have anything else and you just need to use something for a day or two, by all means use this. But daily use isn&#x27;t the best in my opinion. Compared to other brands I don&#x27;t find my face as clean as I did with them. Each person is sure to have differing opinions on face washes but Pond&#x27;s hasn&#x27;t ever left my face...refreshed. I feel as if I could keep washing my face and continue to get more stuff off it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As I said though, as a single use every so often this is a perfectly fine product. It does work better when used with exfoliating pads though. Don&#x27;t forget those. Overall, you could do better but you could definitely do worse.</li>
            <li> This has a lovely scent and a creamy consistency.  There are little pearlescent beads in here that are supposed to help remove the dead skin on your face. I feel that this is so gentle I&#x27;m not sure it is removing any dry or dead skin.  If your skin is very tender or sensitive I would suggest this cleanser because it was extremely gentle on your face.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m torn here, so take this for what it is and make your own decision regarding the product.  Shortly after using this product my face gets extremely tight and dry and my skin gets flakey.  In fact, I have to rinse my face again and scrub off the dry skin before leaving the house.  This happens EVERY TIME I use this product.  That being said, after two weeks of using this, my skin does look healthier.  It looks cleaner and younger.  It even has a richer color to it.  So, my complaint is more like a half-complaint.  I don&#x27;t like dry skin, and it irritates me to have to re-wash my face as it were, but the not-so-long-term effect of this product has me satisfied.  I also like the scent, which is soft and sweet.  Overall, this works but it is not without its detractors.</li>
            <li> This cleanser is very gentle and maybe it&#x27;s because I have dry (old) skin, I didn&#x27;t feel it exfoliated very well.  It was nice to use but I was expecting something more than a few soft little beads.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think maybe this is for someone much younger.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But it&#x27;s not a bad product.</li>
            <li> I liked the way that the very creamy Ponds Luminous Cleanser felt going on and found that it cleaned my face pretty well (I have an oily complexion).  I did not think that it left my skin feeling overly dry and rough, but again it could be because of my oily skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, I found the scent almost overpowering.  Although I like a \\&quot;clean\\&quot; scent from my cleansers, the rosey smell was much too strong for me.</li>
            <li> .  The Luminous clean cleanser, I really like, Your skin feels refreshed, soft and looks luminous the Kaolin clay definately cleans the skin well and your skin is left with a radient glow. Great cleanser!!!</li>
            <li> With its promise to counteract the effects of make-up, Pond&#x27;s Luminous Clean Daily Exfoliating Cleanser is probably being marketed to women, but as a guy who has a history of skin trouble (oily skin, acne, etc), I prefer such products to plain soap which I&#x27;ve heard can clog the pores.  I didn&#x27;t notice any \\&quot;microbeads\\&quot; - this is a smooth liquid rather than a grainy substance - but my skin sure felt good and clean after using it. Recommended.</li>
            <li> I dunno, when I think exfoliating, I wanna feel some scrub... and that nice, smooth feeling you get afterwards.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately, that does not happen with this product and really left me wanting more.  The exfoliating beads are tiny and no matter how hard I scrubbed, didn&#x27;t do much of anything.  I will say this product lathers up nicely and seems to clean well enough, although I didn&#x27;t particularly notice any &amp;#34;luminous&amp;#34; results either. The rose scent is pretty strong in this cleanser and should be toned down, and I like a nice rose smell as much as anyone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Maybe they are trying to do too much with this cleanser, or not enough. Either way, I wouldn&#x27;t purchase or recommend it.</li>
            <li> This was a very good product for the stated purpose.  It is gentle and good for sensitive skin, too.  I agree with the advertising, that it is not complicated, time-consuming or expensive to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It definitely removed the skin oils without being too abrasive either.  The scent is pleasant and not overpowering, for me, but it seems different people have a lot of different preferences in the smell category.</li>
            <li> The New Pond&#x27;s Luminous Clean Cream Cleanser and the Pond&#x27;s Wet Cleansing Towelettes is a must have.Thanks to Bzz Agent, I was lucky enough to participate in the Pond&#x27;s BzzCampaigns.I had the biggest pimple on my face right beteew my nose and lip area (what a better time to arrive),as well as makeup to cover the pimple.The first thing I did was, pull out the wet cleansing towelettes and start wiping my face. I&#x27;d notice a feeling of this tingling sensation on my face and, not a bad feeling a smoothing sensation so, I had to go look and the mirror and;with one towelette.I&#x27;d taken all the make up off (woohoo money saver).Later that night I took a shower,I&#x27;d applied the cleanser cream on my face. I let the cleanser set on my face then I rinse my face last. The next morning that big pimple.I spoke about earlier was dried out and nothing but a scab.After three days of using both of these Pond&#x27;s products my11 year old son came up to me and said.\\&quot; Mom are you getting lighter or something\\&quot; I said why,I look lighter?\\&quot;He said yes,but you look light in a nice way\\&quot; I&#x27;ve have, had problem with acne and dark spots,I used this products for about five days now,not even a full week and I&#x27;ve seen changes.My face now soft, the dark spots are fading away my face has a natural glow,the cream cleanser has the texture of a Mask or Clay but not as heavy, when on the face,I love the soft scent (it&#x27;s not a overwhelming scent)I love this product and I&#x27;ll keep buying and telling everyone,I know about this product especially if they have embarrassed skin moments like myself,I also wanna let y&#x27;all know I&#x27;d used Pond&#x27;s once daily to get the result I&#x27;ve gotten.I didn&#x27;t know about Pond&#x27;s and how great their products really are, I don&#x27;t need a monthly subscription that&#x27;ll cost me $400.00 a year.I&#x27;ve found something way better and,the cost is lesser. Thanks again to Bzz agent as well as thanks to Pond&#x27;s for creating such a great product at an affordable price</li>
            <li> First off, I am not a fan of any cream cleansers. 1 because I like to see the cleanser to foam. 2 because its hard to wash off. When I received my buzz package of the Ponds cleanser and towelettes . It came with two sets, so my mother is a Ponds user, she like the old Pond products... Like the cold creams I gave her one to use and to let me know what she felt about it. Okay so I used the other set. I only had 9 days to use so on day one I looked at the packaging , which I thought was very nice and clean looking. Next I read the directions and proceeded to dampen my face and place a small amount in my palm. I loved the color which was like a pearlized white color. I the toke a smell, it had a nice clean scent that had a light floral sent.( which I am not a fan of any floral scent). So, I then started applying the cream to my face it was nice it didn&#x27;t form up until I started to wash off once I was done washing off and pat dried my face I then too a good long look at my face. My first response to the cleanser was.... It&#x27;s just like any other on the self cleanser. But I thought to myself that one was was not a fare feed back. So I then continued to was the same way for  the next 3 days. I did notice that you must use a moisturizer with this product because it will dry your face out, too bad Ponds didn&#x27;t provide a sample of their moisturizer but I have a day and night moisturizer that use in conjunction.  So on day 5 I continued to use the product but I changed some things up some.... I left the cleanser on my face for 5 minutes and next proceeded to use my clarasonic with it. Then I noticed a difference in my skin I seen some small blackhead begin to surface right on the side of my lower jaw line, and all my dry patches of dry skin disappeared. So I  said to myself I wan to see if my face is really clean, so I washed face as normal and then washed again with my normal face cleanser, I didn&#x27;t see any dirt left over on my face towel. So I must say that the new Ponds cream cleanser is a good product.</li>
            <li> I am pleasantly suprised with this cleanser.  I am used to using a cleanser with exfoliant in it and usually don&#x27;t like ones without it - but this product is the exception.  It leaves my skin smooth and not at all dried out.  I have sensitive skin and I don&#x27;t get any irritation with this cleanser.</li>
            <li> The Ponds Luminous exfoliating cleanser is a mild cleanser that works very well.  It has a faint rose smell (typical to Ponds products) and is fairly easy to apply and wash off.  The exfoliation is very mild (compared to some of the peach cleansers I have used) but it works well without over drying your skin.  Also worth noting is that it will not clog your pores to precipitate acne like some of the competing products on the market.  Overall this is great for daily use.</li>
            <li> This is a very pleasant product.  Pleasant fragrance that I found to be light, but noticeable.  Not overwhelming to me.  The cleansing beads are almost non-existent and too small to be of any real significance.  I have very oily skin and wear light make-up, I found that this cleanser worked very well to remove my make-up and oil without feeling like it stripped my face.  Very gentle.  I would classify this as a gentle and pleasant facial cleanser.  The exfoliating factor is pretty insignificant and would be disappointing if you were counting on it.  I only gave this product 3 stars because some may find the product&#x27;s smell to be too strong and because the exfoliation factor was not good.</li>
            <li> All I have to say is WOW, for anyone looking for a new face cleanser look no further! This is one of the best products I have used. It&#x27;s a must have!</li>
            <li> I really like this exfoliating cleanser. My skin is somewhat sensitive, so I was worried about drying effects from using it daily, but that did not occur. The cream smells great (which is not always the case for facial cleansers), is nice and creamy, and leaves the face feeling fresh. What&#x27;s more, as an adult who still struggles with acne from time to time, this product does NOT exacerbate that problem. Will buy in the future. Recommended.</li>
            <li> When I first used this product, my skin was more baby like, softer, and even My acne was disapearing. I would recommend this if you want a more cleaner and softer skin.</li>
            <li> This is a very nice, gentle everyday cleanser. It makes your skin feel clean and soft. It also helps to lighten up dark spots - although slowly, but still effective. I only gave 4 stars because I feel that this isn&#x27;t the best for acne-prone skin. I have hormonal breakouts from time-to-time. I find that when I use this, my breakouts don&#x27;t respond at all - they don&#x27;t get better, but they don&#x27;t get worse either. So I only use this when I have NO breakouts because the cleanser I have for acne-prone skin helps to clear my skin up much faster. So, if you&#x27;re someone that never breaks out, yet have dark spots that you want to lighten, this is perfect for you!</li>
            <li> The Ponds daily exfoliating cleanser left my face feeling very refreshed and clean. I have dry, sensitive skin, and the product the not irritate my face, so that&#x27;s a very positive sign. The more I use this product the better my skin feels and looks.</li>
            <li> Really great cleanser that made my face feel smooth after taking my makeup off. Does not have that oily feeling that some cleansers have when you use them and the pads were great! Very gentle and perfect for dry skin! Before getting this product, I would have wanted to know that it was good for dry skin because some cleaners leave my dry skin flaky and this one did not.</li>
            <li> I love the way the POND&#x27;S Luminous Clean Cream Cleanser makes my face feel after I wash.  My skin is left feeling soft and refreshed and moisturized.  I was not a big fan of the scent.  The flowery scent was a little overbearing for me.</li>
            <li> This is such a great product and low priced unlike some of the &amp;#34;big names&amp;#34; out there.  It works every bit as well as the higher priced products out there.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m on a mission to save some money on expensive beauty products. Mission accomplished with this one. I have used Philosophy Micro wash for over 5 years. $60 is too much these days. This is an exfoliating wash that is even better! Hardly any fragrance, leaves my face baby smooth and my makeup goes on like a dream. I use this in the morning. I won&#x27;t give up my Purity, but one change at a time :)</li>
            <li> When I want an exfoliating cleanser, I want something with a decent amount of grit to it, so I know it is exfoliating. I love facial scrubs, but I am picky with them. This one does not pass my test.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First of all, the first thing I noticed is that it is VERY heavily scented! I don&#x27;t mind a little bit of scent, but for a facial product, this is just way too overpowering. It reminds you more of a body product, with a lot of scent. That turned me off a little because I just don&#x27;t feel like facial products should be so heavily scented - your face is more delicate and fragile, you don&#x27;t need/want all the extra \\&quot;crap\\&quot; that goes into a product to make it so scented.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Next, the actual consistency was much too fine as far as the exfoliating particles. They are sooo teeny tiny that they themselves clog your pores because they can defiitely get in there and there wasn&#x27;t enough of them anyway.It does have a slightly creamy lather, which I didn&#x27;t mind, but the exfoliation was just not to my liking/preference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My face did feel soft after using it, so I guess that is a plus, but with as heavily scented as it is, I have to wonder if it is just more \\&quot;crap\\&quot; in it that made my skin feel soft and slippery and not the actual exfoliation (I truly believe this product cannot exfoliate and just leads to more breakouts due to clogged pores).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wouldn&#x27;t feel right recommending this product, especially as an exfoliator. As a just cleanser, maybe, IF you like heavily, artificially scented products for your face and just want a cleanser. I definitely would not recommend it for anyone with sensitive skin due to the strong scent.</li>
            <li> I very much liked using this cleanser. It had a strong, pleasant, feminine scent that dissipated soon after use. It moisturized wonderfully and seemed to make my skin brighter than when using other exfoliating cleansers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The clay in this cleanser was a more gentle exfoliant than the rougher salts and sands in other cleansers. It seemed to work well, despite its gentle feeling and I believe it would work wonders for those with sensitive skin that are unable to use rougher exfoliants. I personally like my exfoliants a little rougher, like to feel as though I can feel them working, but I can&#x27;t deny how soft and smooth the clay and beads made my face feel.</li>
            <li> I have extremely dry sensitive skin and have an allergic reaction to most products.  The only product I&#x27;ve found so far that kind of works without starting a reaction is an expensive department store brand. I saw a recommendation for this online and decided to give it a try (I&#x27;m always looking for cheaper alternatives to what i&#x27;m using.)  I fully expected this stuff to join the parade of products I pass on to family members due to the allergic reaction I would get from it.  When I opened it an caught the scent, I almost didn&#x27;t even bother trying it.  Scent &#x3D; red ichy skin for me.  I tried it once and when I didn&#x27;t have a reaction I have kept on using it.  I&#x27;ve been using it two weeks now and my face looks amazing!!!  It&#x27;s clear and soft and I&#x27;ve had two people ask me what new make-up I&#x27;m using!  The only reason I didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars was because as other reviewers have said: it&#x27;s not a great exfoiliater.  I am still using my St. Ives aprocot scrub a couple times a week for that function.  However, I highly recommend as a cleanser!</li>
            <li> Okay ladies, it&#x27;s actually worth the money. I tried it out and I actually liked it. I have used many facial cleansers and never really been too tickled with them. This cleanser is bang for your buck. You only need a dime size amount to wash your entire face no matter how coated in make-up it is. Best part, it doesn&#x27;t leave your face feeling tight and dried out. They also have the towelettes to go with it and the swipe make-up right off, again without your face feeling sticky, itchy and tight. I really like it and am looking forward to washing my face at night and not having to glom on a bunch of moisturizer afterwards.</li>
            <li> I would really recommend trying this exfoliator, especially for people with sensitive skin.  It is extremely gentle and mild and goes on smooth.  After using it my skin felt really clean, soft, and moisturized;  it didn&#x27;t have that tight and dry feeling that some exfoliators leave.  I also loved the light and fresh smell!  I would usually not want to use an exfoliator on a daily basis, but I have no hesitation with this one because it is so mild and leaves my skin feeling refreshed and moisturized.</li>
            <li> I remember Pond&#x27;s products as being thick and rather greasy. I don&#x27;t know whether I&#x27;m just catching up with their improvements, but I liked this exfoliating cleanser that smelled nice and left my skin feeling softened and clean. I&#x27;ve used it off and on over a 2 week period, in the shower and out, and have been satisfied by both types of usage. It was silky smooth in the heat of the shower and came off cleanly when applied over the sink, followed by a warm wet washcloth. A toning clarifier afterward proved no residue of makeup remained, even after a formal event that had required more (makeup) than usual.</li>
            <li> Exfoliating seems like a stretch. I can feel the beads, but it doesn&#x27;t seem to exfoliate. Just OK, wouldn&#x27;t buy again</li>
            <li> PONDS has a long tradition of offering gentle and effective facial cleansing creams.  My grandma used her jar of cold cream for decades and had the smoothest, softest skin for anyone in their golden years.  Today, since there are so many choices on the shelves, it&#x27;s not always easy to find something new and trust that it won&#x27;t irritate your skin.  Ponds is still a trusted name even with new versions of their products.  This daily cleanser squeezes out from a tube like toothpaste, is glossy white with scrubbing flecks, and is lightly fragrant.  The very fine granual feels nice on your skin when gently rubbed in, and it washes off fully.  My face is left very soft and smooth, which I love, and there are no dry patches after I towel off.  The only negative, and it&#x27;s not really too terrible, is that I would prefer it had a bit more lathering element to it, since even with a generous amount on the face and enough water, there is really not much suds working.  I like to see the foamy soap while I wash off the day&#x27;s grime, it somehow makes me feel like I&#x27;m really getting the cleanest, freshest face possible before bed.  Otherwise, I am satisfied with this product and would recommend it for all types of skin, even those with more sensitive cleansing needs.</li>
            <li> Got this for my wife and she said:  The product has a nice consistency and does smooth your skin a bit.  Goes on and washes off well.  For me, I won&#x27;t continue to use as it felt drying to my skin (normal to dry) and the smell was too strong (maybe floral).</li>
            <li> I tried the Pond&#x27;s luminous clean daily exfoliating cleanser for a while and this is my opinion. It cleans well and does not leave the skin too dry as many cleaners do. While using it, it does have a slightly greasy feel, but does not leave the skin greasy after it is rinsed off.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t even use this product.  I opened the shipping envelope and I was inundated with this strong perfume smell and I didn&#x27;t even open the item because I didn&#x27;t like the smell.  This product just wasn&#x27;t for me because I like things with lighter smells that aren&#x27;t so powerful, plus when you put it on your face it smells even stronger because it&#x27;s right under your nose.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used plenty of exfoliating cleansers but most dry my skin out and give that tight feeling. This Pond&#x27;s product cleans and exfoliates but doesn&#x27;t overly dry my face, I would re-buy.</li>
            <li> Microbeads are those little bits of grit that some cleansers contain. I&#x27;ve been a fan of Clinique&#x27;s Seventh Day scrub cream for years - this product just completely replaced it. It&#x27;s a scrub and cleanser in one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First, my skin is combination to dry. If you have oily skin, this may be too heavy for you. I also have very sensitive skin - I easily get a rash if something has too many chemicals or coloring in it. Now that all said, this was a great cleansing cream for me and didn&#x27;t cause any adverse effects at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s very thick and creamy, doesn&#x27;t have too much grit in it, and didn&#x27;t cause any sensitivity issues for me. Also, it took off makeup very well while washing. It does foam a bit, but not so much until after you&#x27;ve scrubbed with it and are rinsing your face. I use about a nickel-size amount and, no matter how hard I tried, I couldn&#x27;t get the cleanser to foam in my hand. That was okay though, the cleanser&#x27;s benefits far outweighed that. I use it every day and my skin is super clean and feels great after using it. This stuff is definitely a keeper!</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and tend to try and scrub it even though I know better. This product has gentle, exfoliating beads and is creamy and foams nicely. I like how it feels going on--and my face feels clean and smooth after use. I like the rose scent. I find it just enough. If you have sensitive skin and need a good cleanser, you might want to give this one a try. I&#x27;ve been using it for awhile and am very pleased with the product.</li>
            <li> This is a really nice face wash, lathers well, feels great. Rinses clean easily and leaves my skin feeling really soft and clean. My one complaint, as other reviewers have noted, is the overpowering fragrance. This much rose smell is really too much.</li>
            <li> I am 38 years old and have aging, acne prone combination skin. This soap removes my makeup, (I love makeup) leaves my skin feeling fresh and clean. I have had no increase in acne, a significant decrease in visible black heads on my nose and chin and no increase in fine lines. If your skin is very dry this may not be the soap for you because it does not leave my skin feeling moisturied but I always use moisturizer anyway. My entire family is using this soap, including teenage boys. I recommend this soap to everyone. I have ordered the cream soap which may be more suited for drier skin, i curretnly use marykay moisturizer, but i have ordered the moisturizer for this line and am excited to try it. I will leave a review after I have used them. I have this on subscribe and save and purchase it for less than in the stores...&lt;br /&gt;Pros: Nice scent, Nice amount microbeads, decrease in acne and black heads, clean luminous skin&lt;br /&gt;Cons: none for me</li>
            <li> For those of you who like or love this product including other \\&quot;new\\&quot; Ponds products, you should enjoy the product now because like prior good products by Ponds, this product might be history in another 2 to 5 years!!! I like Ponds products but unfortunately, I have lost trust in the longevity of their \\&quot;new\\&quot; great products!!!</li>
            <li> I was surprised how much I liked this, since I have tended to avoid daily facial cleansers that had any sort of exfoliating element.  No matter how gentle the product purported to be, it was too much.  However, this is truly gentle, yet it had more \\&quot;oomph\\&quot; to it than my usual gel/lotion cleansers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I found the fragrance to be just right - pleasant without being overpowering.  Also, it lathered well - but, again, to just the right amount.  In the end, though, the way it left my skin feeling/looking is what really mattered.  It felt and looked cleaner and brighter - and moisturized, too.  I didn&#x27;t feel like I had to race for my daily moisturizer because my cleanser left my face feeling dry.  Also, there were no sensitive or red areas, notwithstanding the exfoliating ingredients.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I absolutely will seek out/buy this product, now that I am almost finished with my inaugural tube.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried several cleansers over the years.  I really liked the Ponds Luminous Clean Cream Cleanser.  My face ACTUALLY feels clean.  There is no grime or residue left over, just a fresh face.  I will recommend this to friends and family... and continue to buy this product.</li>
            <li> I have oily skin, and have tried hundreds of products over the years to keep my skin both clean and unblemished. I also have rosacea, so if I scrub too hard, or use products with too many chemicals, my skin turns read. So it&#x27;s a delicate balance. I want my pores to be clean. I want my skin to be oil-free. I also want to be gentle with my skin so it doesn&#x27;t look like a lobster.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had high hopes for Pond&#x27;s Luminous Clean. Ponds is a fairly well known brand. This product markets itself as a \\&quot;daily exfoliating cleanser\\&quot;, not a scrub. So one would think it was gentle. Also, it says it has Kaolin clay in it. I&#x27;m a fan of clay products, to draw gunk out of pores.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately, this just isn&#x27;t the product for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First, the scent. I want my scrubs to REMOVE everything from my face. I absolutely don&#x27;t want or need it to be adding fragrance to me. Both for chemical reasons and for scent reasons. If I&#x27;m going to use a scent, I want to choose it myself, after I am clean. I don&#x27;t want my perfume choice to have to \\&quot;compete\\&quot; with the rose of this cleaning product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Next, I didn&#x27;t get any sense that it was much of an exfoliator. Yes, one might call it a \\&quot;bubbly cleanser\\&quot;. But an exfoliator? I don&#x27;t think so. If someone needs exfoliation, this isn&#x27;t the product to go with.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And finally, my face felt tingly and chemical-reactant when I was done. Again, I&#x27;ve used many products over the years so I know that some products are chemical-laden and others are gentle. The product claims to have \\&quot;gentle microbeads\\&quot; - and maybe the *microbeads* are gentle but the chemicals used are not. I definitely can&#x27;t use this every day. I&#x27;ve had it for several months now, hoping to find the right ratio of when to use it, and I just can&#x27;t bring myself to use it frequently. I have so many other cleansers that work better that to choose this one instead feels like a \\&quot;trial\\&quot; I have to go through in order to properly do this review. And I only do it on days I know I won&#x27;t be leaving the house.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Summary - if you just want a \\&quot;frothy soap\\&quot; that has a strong rose scent, and your skin doesn&#x27;t mind being hit with chemicals, this could be just right for you. For me, I can&#x27;t even bring myself to finish off the one container provided to me by Amazon Vine to do my review. I may have to foist the rest on a friend and see what they think.I know I won&#x27;t be leaving the house.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Summary - if you just want a \\&quot;frothy soap\\&quot; that has a strong rose scent, and your skin doesn&#x27;t mind being hit with chemicals, this could be just right for you.

            <li> AMAZING!!! Affordable and gives a really good deep cleaning</li>
            <li> I have combination skin. Some of it gets dry and to be blunt thick feeling. I got this product, hoping my skin would feel new and to use their word: luminous.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was disappointed. It wasn&#x27;t a terrible cleanser. Did an okay job. But it wasn&#x27;t very ex-foliating.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not recommended.</li>
            <li> I love the way this cleanser makes my face feel afterwards! Nice and soft!</li>
            <li> Use it fastidious.  Cannot go without it.</li>
            <li> It turns out this product doesn&#x27;t really work for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First, it is very gentle and moisturizing, as one would expect from a Pond&#x27;s cleanser. Unfortunately for me, my skin tends to be oily, and moisturizing cleansers often leave me feeling still oily - like I didn&#x27;t get all-the-way clean.&lt;br /&gt;I had hoped that because it has kaolin clay it would be better for my oily skin than a typical moisturizing cleanser. I&#x27;ve used kaolin clay masks before and liked them a lot. However, this product doesn&#x27;t have very much kaolin - you can see in the ingredient list that it&#x27;s one of the last ingredients. It has more \\&quot;Fragrance\\&quot; than it has \\&quot;Kaolin\\&quot;. If you&#x27;re looking for the &#x27;draws out impurities&#x27; power of the clay - I&#x27;d say you won&#x27;t get that from this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Second, it is a DAILY exfoliating cleanser. That means it is... not very scrubby. I&#x27;d heard that using a gentle exfoliating product every day is better for your skin than my usual routine of using a plain cleanser every day and a scrub once a week. For me though, I really love the way my skin feels right after my weekly scrub, like I&#x27;m 100% clean and glowing. The product never gives you that feeling. It&#x27;s just too gentle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the other hand, like other Pond&#x27;s cleansers, this one did leave my skin nice and soft.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I guess it depends on your skin and what you like. I&#x27;d say if you have oily skin like me, this might not be a good cleanser for you.</li>
            <li> Pond&#x27;s Luminous Clean Daily Exfoliating Cleanser may be a lovely product, but this user was unable to test it thoroughly due to the strong scent.  For those sensitive to fragrance or those with breathing issues, this is not for you.  Perhaps an unscented version is in order?</li>
            <li> This is a good cleanser that goes a step above by adding micro-beads (for exfoliation) and clay.  The clay is supposed to draw out impurities.  The cleanser has a nice, pleasant scent and it left my face feeling fresh, clean, and smooth.  I would use it again (at Walmart&#x27;s price, though, not Amazon&#x27;s).</li>
            <li> You can always count on Pond&#x27;s for skin products. My face felt great after using this cleanser. No oily residue like some cleanser&#x27;s have.&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend it for anyone look for a good exfoliating cleaser.</li>
            <li> I was fortunate enough to receive samples of these products to review through BzzAgent and I’ve been pleasantly surprised. As a 40-something woman with a fair complexion and oily skin that seems to get more sensitive with each passing year I was a little concerned that this product might not work well for me- but boy was I wrong! I can’t speak to the “luminous” claims because I’ve never known my skin to be anything but greasy-looking with occasional to frequent breakouts. I will say, however, that my skin is definitely smoother since I started using these products, and the rosacea-esque areas on my face seem to be blending much better with the rest of my skin tone. The towelettes really make it hard to find an excuse to go to bed without removing my makeup, and the cream cleanser ranks as one of the best ones I’ve used in recent years. I can even tell if I’ve missed a spot because there’s an obvious difference in texture. I am truly impressed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some concerns I read about before trying this product involved the scent (which I personally find both soothing and refreshing), the tightness after use (which for me starts about 1 minute after use and only lasts a couple of minutes), and that it doesn’t fully remove some waterproof eye products (which is true, but I have yet to find a “gentle” daily cleanser that does). None of these are deal-breakers for me but are at least worth mentioning so you know what to expect. I have no hesitation recommending this to anyone, but we are all different so your results might not match mine. I still think it’s worth a try and I hope you like them as much as I do.</li>
