            <li> I used this line for about 4 months and loved how it would make my fine thin hair more full and seemed to control the frizz on humid days.  The only downside is that I had to stop after a few months as with all of the heat styling I do I was noticing more damage and breakage.  I think it&#x27;s a good product and i will use again but I have to take breaks for the health of my hair and go back to Kerastase.</li>
