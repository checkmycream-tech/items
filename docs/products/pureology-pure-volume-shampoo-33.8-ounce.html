            <li>No problems with order or shipping and am satisfied with my experience and purchase.</li>
            <li>I have had better shampoo at $3.99 from the drugstore.&lt;br /&gt;Used</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used the old formula for years, with great results.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li>Fast shipment, good product</li>
            <li>And I am fine with putting animal fat in my hair if it saves me money...</li>
            <li>The BEST product for color treated hair, make the color last so much longer.</li>
            <li>will return to the original formula - if it&#x27;s still available.</li>
            <li>In 2007, L&#x27;Oreal bought out the developers of this absolutely unique hair-care product line.  </li>
            <li>Not the rich lather or fragrance it should be.</li>
            <li>This has to be a knockoff &amp; not the original product.  </li>
            <li>And I&#x27;m done paying full price for a destroyed treasure.  </li>
            <li>Leaves my hair full of volume and shine.  </li>
            <li>ANYONE WITH FINE THIN HAIR IT HELPS AND FEELS SO GOOD!!</li>
            <li>Arrived very fast.</li>
            <li>The shampoo seems fine otherwise, but I have no desire to go around smelling like an old man.</li>
            <li>No shampoo over $5 and that better be for a BIG bottle!  </li>
            <li>And if it extends the time before your next color, it may be worth it for you too!!</li>
            <li>Thanks for this product.</li>
            <li>the real one for years &amp; never had this before.  </li>
            <li>I have long baby fine colored treated hair.  </li>
            <li>but you need very little for each shampoo and it lathers up nicely.</li>
            <li>Better than any previous shampoo I have used.</li>
            <li>So I am normally a thrifty person.  </li>
            <li>This shampoo smells exactly like my former Bishop&#x27;s aftershave.  </li>
            <li>It is not harsh on my color and leaves my hair soft without conditioner.</li>
            <li>Makes your hair feel and soft and manageable.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t need to use much, lasts a long time</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not sure it was filled with the correct shampoo...</li>
            <li>You only use a little and it leaves my hair manageable and clean.</li>
            <li>The destruction must have occurred in stages as the full negative effects have</li>
            <li>I will keep it due to the high cost of shipping.</li>

            <li> only* been truly felt this past year with &#x27;watering down&#x27; and removal of the more expensive ingredients that made Pureology so fabulous.  </li>

            <li> This shampoo smells exactly like my former Bishop&#x27;s aftershave.  The shampoo seems fine otherwise, but I have no desire to go around smelling like an old man.</li>
            <li> Great product. Arrived very fast.</li>
            <li> So I am normally a thrifty person.  No shampoo over $5 and that better be for a BIG bottle!  And I am fine with putting animal fat in my hair if it saves me money...so the vegan aspect of this brand wouldn&#x27;t have swayed my decision either.  It does however, maintain my haircolor and highlights for a very long time. It is FANTASTIC!  Even a month and a half after my color, people were still asking me if I had just had it colored.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is expensive, but a little goes a long way.  I have short hair adn use about a quarter-size drop.  And if it extends the time before your next color, it may be worth it for you too!!</li>
            <li> Love this product, completely satisfied.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used the old formula for years, with great results.&lt;br /&gt;This formula leaves my hair matted and tangled.&lt;br /&gt;I will return to the original formula - if it&#x27;s still available.</li>
            <li> I HAVE TRIED THIS PRODUCT AND IT IS GREAT. ANYONE WITH FINE THIN HAIR IT HELPS AND FEELS SO GOOD!!</li>
            <li> In 2007, L&#x27;Oreal bought out the developers of this absolutely unique hair-care product line.  The destruction must have occurred in stages as the full negative effects have *only* been truly felt this past year with &#x27;watering down&#x27; and removal of the more expensive ingredients that made Pureology so fabulous.  It&#x27;s done.  It&#x27;s ruined.  And I&#x27;m done paying full price for a destroyed treasure.  I can&#x27;t believe I&#x27;m saying goodbye and with all destroyed relationships, I&#x27;ll never look back.  Sigh.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Pureology for years and love it. My hairdresser recommended I try it several years ago and I never looked back. You only use a little and it leaves my hair manageable and clean. Thanks for this product.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed. I received my shampoo and it leaked everywhere. A third of the product was gone. I wrote a comment regarding packaging and haven&#x27;t heard a thing back.</li>
            <li> I have long baby fine colored treated hair.  My hair stylist recommended Pureology hair products as to not strip my color.  This shampoo is wonderful. Leaves my hair full of volume and shine.  The scent if awesome.</li>
            <li> Great product , works great. Better than any previous shampoo I have used. I liked the price and will buy again.</li>
            <li> My hair is thin and this gives it plenty of volume without any damage to my hair.  I have use this product for a year now and my hair has never look better.  I would recommend this product to everyone.</li>
            <li> Great shampoo.  Expensive, but isn&#x27;t your hair worth it?  This size provides great savings over salon prices.  Who doesn&#x27;t like saving money?</li>
            <li> I already used this product and was glad to find it in this size.  No problems with order or shipping and am satisfied with my experience and purchase.</li>
            <li> This shampoo seems to be watery. Not the rich lather or fragrance it should be. I will keep it due to the high cost of shipping.</li>
            <li> Same product beautician buys at supply house but cheaper.</li>
            <li> It lives up to it&#x27;s claim. It is not harsh on my color and leaves my hair soft without conditioner.</li>
            <li> Got this product from my hair dresser and loved it, but cost $35.00 for an 8oz bottle.  This bottle is 4 bottles for the price of one.  Great deal</li>
            <li> The BEST product for color treated hair, make the color last so much longer. Don&#x27;t need to use much, lasts a long time</li>
            <li> This has been my shampoo for quiet a while.  Tried other shampoos and came back to Pureology.</li>
            <li> This has to be a knockoff &amp; not the original product.  Its thin &amp; watery - I&#x27;m using 4 times the amount &amp; I still dont get a lather.  I have had better shampoo at $3.99 from the drugstore.&lt;br /&gt;Used the real one for years &amp; never had this before.  Be careful where you purchase it. Mine came from Posh Cosmetics &amp; cost me $50.</li>
            <li> I have been bleaching my hair for 40 years.  Pureology shampoo leaves my hair in the best condition ever.  I have been using it for about 2 years.  I also us pureology conditioner. Your hair color will not fade.</li>
            <li> The bottle is correct but the product used to be pink.  This is white and will hardly develop any suds.  I&#x27;m not sure it was filled with the correct shampoo...</li>
            <li> This product is great. Makes your hair feel and soft and manageable. Doesn&#x27;t dry or hurt colored hair I had already used it and that is why I went for the 32oz. It is on the pricey side but you need very little for each shampoo and it lathers up nicely.</li>
            <li> This bottle of shampoo arrived with scotch tape over cap which left me wondering if it had been tampered with. When I have ordered this shampoo from other vendors it arrived sealed.</li>
            <li> Fast shipment, good product</li>
            <li> Love the smell and the product!</li>
            <li> My wife loves it and it is the only shampoo she will use. We will contine to puchase this product from this site.</li>
            <li> This product works great for me. It is same as I purchase in the salon, but a lot less expensive. Ypu only need a small amount.</li>
            <li> Makes&#x27;s your hair feel like straw!!!</li>
