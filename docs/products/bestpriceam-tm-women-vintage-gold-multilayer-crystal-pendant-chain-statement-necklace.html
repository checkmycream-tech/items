            <li>It&#x27;s a cute necklace.</li>
            <li>It looks like the photo for the most part .</li>
            <li>All in all, cute .</li>
            <li>if you want to keep up with the untangling all night go for it because it is cute and</li>
            <li>but so cute</li>
            <li>In love with this.</li>
            <li>Absolutley love this, but the chain does tangle</li>
            <li>cheap made.</li>
            <li>It was so cheap, but didn&#x27;t look so.  </li>
            <li>The golf is not as light as it is in this picture</li>
            <li>The price was right and the chain is really cute</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s workable and the price was super cheap.</li>
            <li>It also came way before expected date which is always great.</li>
            <li>when I first got it, it had weight to it which means it won&#x27;t break easy.</li>
            <li>but it did change color quickly</li>
            <li>But still very pretty.</li>
            <li>Exactly what I wanted!</li>
            <li>I was expecting it to be very cheap but was pleasantly surprised.</li>
            <li>I love these little pieces of trendy jewelry offered.  </li>
            <li>The chains are not a uniform length, so they dont lay the right way on your chest.</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s a great look but not ideal, since it&#x27;s easily tangled on your neck.  </li>
            <li>The quality matches the price, so be aware.</li>
            <li>It was ok till it tarnished on the 2nd wearing to copper...</li>
            <li>Very upset , nothing like the picture showed.&lt;br /&gt;Very</li>
            <li>Does not lye straight like it should.</li>
            <li>But since it&#x27;s so cheap, I&#x27;m not too upset that I&#x27;ll only wear it once.</li>
            <li>This necklace looks nice on the model but it only stays that way if you just sit still in the same position.  </li>
            <li>This is a cute necklace, it does look a little cheap but not super cheap.</li>
            <li>Decent quality for the price.</li>
            <li>I know very inexpensive but WHY put a photo of a TOTALLY different necklace?!</li>
            <li>Looks cheap nothing like the pic waste of money smh</li>
            <li>There was no little diamond on my necklace.</li>
            <li>I wore it for the first time today &amp; like any other layer necklace</li>
    </ol>

            <li> I wore it for the first time today &amp; like any other layer necklace</li>
            <li> I loved the look of this necklace but sadly after wearing it a few times the &amp;#34;gold&amp;#34; wore off.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really shiny and obviously fake, but for the price you can&#x27;t really complain.</li>
            <li> although it does take a long time to arrive due to international shipping.</li>
            <li> Other than that I like it for price and came a few weeks early.</li>
            <li> The long bar will be sideways since one side of the cord is longer than the other.</li>
            <li> Cute when it arrived but it became an ugly copper color</li>
            <li> I expected it the be centered, but they aren&#x27;t at all</li>
            <li> Looks a little chunkier than in picture.</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t waste your money unless you want a disposable necklace that you will end up tossing in the trash after a couple times wearing it.</li>
            <li> I would recommend if symmetry is not important to you.</li>
            <li> The product did not look like the picture, it came in a dusty clear bag &amp; also the necklace was broken into pieces.</li>
            <li> turns your skin green!</li>
            <li> Its ok.. it tangles horribly very annoying</li>
            <li> Gold looks a little fake.</li>
            <li> A little disappointed though, when you put it on, if you want the jewel to lign up it throws the bar off, and vice versa.</li>
            <li> Came broken and don&#x27;t even know where to begin to even try and fix it!</li>
            <li> This  necklace gets twisted up and  tangled when you wear it.</li>
            <li> Bad quality.</li>
            <li> Then i hated it</li>
            <li> changed color after wearing it once... terrible..</li>

            <li> It was so cheap, but didn&#x27;t look so.  Cute!</li>
            <li> There was no little diamond on my necklace.</li>
            <li> Product as describe hope it last longer than two uses.</li>
            <li> I wouldnt even give it a star if I could write a review. It came in the mail tangled and it doesn&#x27;t even look like the picture. Honesty I tossed it in the trash and didnt bother with detangling it.</li>
            <li> turns your skin green!</li>

            <li> Not tangled, adjustable and cute as can be!  Any woman will love it.</li>
            <li> The chains are not a uniform length, so they dont lay the right way on your chest. The long bar will be sideways since one side of the cord is longer than the other. Buy from someone else.</li>

            <li> Its ok.. it tangles horribly very annoying</li>
            <li> This is a cute necklace, it does look a little cheap but not super cheap. It&#x27;s workable and the price was super cheap. The rhinestone flips over ALL the time so I am constantly fixing it. All in all, cute .</li>

            <li> This  necklace gets twisted up and  tangled when you wear it. if you want to keep up with the untangling all night go for it because it is cute and the price you can not beat. I won&#x27;t be ordering anymore because I don&#x27;t like untangling my necklace all night.</li>
            <li> A little disappointed though, when you put it on, if you want the jewel to lign up it throws the bar off, and vice versa. Does not lye straight like it should. But still very pretty. Arrived on time. I would recommend if symmetry is not important to you.</li>
