            <li>i really love these brush guards!</li>

            <li>The guards are effective in protecting the brushes&#x27; shape.  </li>
            <li>I plan on buying these for every brush I own.</li>
            <li>love it and good price</li>
            <li>so it sits up nicely in a cup</li>
            <li>A great way to store makeup brushes and a wonderful way to dry makeup brushes after cleaning.</li>
            <li>Love love love!</li>
            <li>They were sent all the way to Guam, and so quickly!!</li>
            <li>Liked how easy it slid onto my brushes, I would recommend this product to any who wear makeup and use makeup brushes.</li>
            <li>I waited to clean my brushes till I got these b/c of the great review from Michelle Phan&#x27;s youtube video on \\&quot;Squeaky Clean Brushes!\\&quot; :) [..]</li>
            <li>One tip for using the product - these come in many sizes</li>
            <li>Awesome, yet simple product.</li>
            <li>I just bought more.</li>
            <li>There is nothing better that you can say about a product except that it works and does what you need it to.</li>
            <li>I am so glad that I found out about this product.</li>
            <li>I buy more of these as needed.</li>
            <li>Anyone who wants to keep their makeup brushes looking great should consider buying this product.</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>Now they all fit nicely in a cup</li>
            <li>You can also use cable sleeving, but ordering a pack of these is just so much more convenient.</li>
            <li>Plus, it&#x27;s free shipping! :)</li>
            <li>I took it all apart to make sure I hadn&#x27;t missed it.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m not quite sure where my Brush Guards are now.</li>
            <li>and then a couple more</li>
            <li>Easy to use, makes maintenance of brushes easy!</li>
            <li>Some are even better than when I originally bought them!</li>
            <li>I absolutely love these for cleaning my brushes and for KEEPING them clean!</li>
            <li>Perfect for letting my brushes air dry, keeps shape well.</li>
            <li>; when drying your brushes, make sure you pick the size of Brush Guard that TIGHLY fits around the ferrule of the brush (you may have to stretch out the Brush Guard to fit it over the handle).</li>
            <li>If you are careful, though, they&#x27;re wonderful!</li>
            <li>I got this one and opened it right up!!</li>
            <li>As what other reviews say, this brush guard is a perfect protector for my brushes.</li>
            <li>The brush guards are great for keeping the shape of most style of makeup brushes, though they are obviously not intended for speciality shapes like fan brushes.  </li>
            <li>They are easy on, easy off and seem to be durable.</li>
            <li>Really nice, easily cleanable, stay fit and really works!</li>
            <li>I think it would work best in conjunction with the use of a brush holder that has the little elastic loops to secure the brushes in place, and the brush guards would just be added protection.</li>
            <li>and I love it so much, very good product and same as the picture showed, will order again, thanks.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s absolutely worth it to spend five more and get these.</li>
            <li>however the ends free after a while.</li>
            <li>I got these items quite promptly, (the second day of the arrival time window) and they were in great condition.</li>
            <li>They didn&#x27;t fit my foundation brushes anyway.  </li>
            <li>A classmate had originally given me a set for free.  </li>
            <li>Keeping my brushes clean got a lot easier.  </li>
            <li>So easy to use and so useful for who use brush makeup.</li>
            <li>These are great for reshaping my brushes while they dry after a wash.</li>
            <li>good for travel and keeps their original shape after i wash them (daily)!  </li>
            <li>Slow shipping but great item!!</li>
            <li>and it just took so much counter top space.</li>
            <li>I always struggled trying to pick just a few brushes that would fit into my travel roll; now I can bring as many as I want and just throw them into a big makeup bag with all of my makeup because the bristles are all perfectly protected in The Brush Guard.</li>
            <li>I have a feeling I will keep buying these until every single brush of mine has its own Guard!</li>
            <li>I love these things, they protect my brushes and keep them straight and fresh after I&#x27;ve cleaned them like nothing else</li>
            <li>Plus, shipping is amazingly quick...</li>
            <li>quality at a high level, this seller quickly sent the goods, the idea is very original position</li>
            <li>They arrived quickly, and do exactly what they are supposed to do!</li>
            <li>These work great for storing your brushes with the brush side down after washing them.  </li>
            <li>Great little guards for keeping your brushes nice, especially for travel.</li>
            <li>This is the important use because it really helps maintain the quality of the brush.</li>
            <li>Well worth the purchase.</li>
            <li>I love that they have a variety of sizes to fit big, medium, and the smallest brushes (eyeliner and brow brushes).  </li>
            <li>Definitly worth it.</li>
            <li>it makes it so much easier to wash my brushes!i highly recommend to everyone!!!</li>
            <li>It keeps my brushes look clean and new.</li>
            <li>Similarly, I will buy more.</li>
            <li>The Brush Guard does exactly what it is suppose to do - protects and preserves my make up brushes.    </li>
            <li>A must-have for anyone who wants to maintain their brushes!</li>
            <li>My only misgivings is I would like more in the variety pack.</li>
            <li>these are essential for keeping brushes in top condition.  </li>
            <li>I got the variety pack to give it a try and am back for more.</li>
            <li>Nope sure enough.</li>
            <li>I have different brands, but mostly they are from Sephora.</li>
            <li>These actually did more damage to my brushes then before I use them.</li>
            <li>I bought my first set of Brush Guards about two months ago, and it didn&#x27;t take long for me to fall in love.</li>
            <li>The problem is they do slide pretty easily, and when the slide opposite the direction of the brush hairs, it catches some and bends them.</li>
            <li>I use another product for my large brushes.</li>
            <li>Michelle Phan made it seem really easy to do, but it was a lot more different than I expected.</li>
            <li>These are what you would expect and work fine, but you do not get enough pieces for the price.</li>
            <li>The brush guard really met my expectation.</li>
            <li>I gives this four stars because they don&#x27;t stay secure and also because they can&#x27;t be used on double ended brushes.</li>
            <li>Brush holds its shape very well.</li>
            <li>I really like these brush guards.</li>
            <li>I also appreciate the reasonable price.</li>
            <li>I really like this product.</li>
            <li>I would return, but too much hassle.</li>
            <li>I really dreaded washing my brushes because I have to lay them out on a towel</li>
            <li>It really does keep the shape.</li>
            <li>This is the only brand I have found that fits eye brushes, so it wins by default!</li>
            <li>I just wish the Guards shrunk back to their original form.</li>
            <li>I clean my brushes often and after I clean them I would gently squeeze out the water, I then use the guard over the brush and leave about 1/4 inch past the tip of the brushes.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s really helpful when transporting the brushes and they dry faster and keep their original shapes.</li>
            <li>These were decent.</li>
            <li>I use them mainly when they&#x27;re in my cosmetic bag being carted around and for while they&#x27;re drying.</li>
            <li>After removal, the bristles are nicely shaped, and I like to keep my brushes in the glass cup for at least 1-2 days depending on the size of the brush​ and weather</li>
            <li>but they don&#x27;t need to last a super long time at the price to still be worth it.</li>
            <li>After washing and drying upside-down in The Brush Guard, my brushes are all shaped as though they were brand new.</li>
            <li>They are like new.</li>
            <li>I feel like my brushes are much healthier and happier, and will last much longer, since I started using these.</li>
            <li>It definitely keeps my brushes in its original shape after deep cleansing.</li>
            <li>does ok for the mid-sized brushes (Outer-v brushes, crease brushes, small tapered blending);  </li>
            <li>This product really delivers - I would highly recommend the entire line of all sizes!</li>
            <li>On top of restoring the shape of my brushes, I really like how I can dry my brushes upside down all in a cup.</li>
            <li>The brush guard is super simple, like a chinese finger trap.</li>
            <li>and I could not find one single eyeshadow or liner brush that would fit in this tiny skinny thing.</li>
            <li>tried these on a few of my eyeshadow brushes and I was surprised at how snug they fit.</li>
            <li>I invest in professional grade brushes, so this product was a no-brainer.  </li>
            <li>However, I really like how they adjust to each individual brush and maintain the brush&#x27;s shape.</li>
            <li>Very inexpensive, would totally recommend to friends.</li>
            <li>I liked the quality and quantity of the brush guard but they are all the same size and do NOT fit my big brushes:/</li>
            <li>I think that there are other similar products out there, but I prefer the original brush guard.</li>
            <li>so they fit the brushes well, but I&#x27;m not sure how well they will stay on the brushes.</li>
            <li>The guard is so small, even my eye liner and thinnest brushes can&#x27;t possibly fit into these.</li>
            <li>It only fit my eyeliner brush, as it is too narrow.</li>
            <li>Aside from the free set I got, I also purchased one with only small sized brushed guards because I have a lot of eyeshadow brushes, as well as a multi-sized set.  </li>
            <li>The brushes keep their form but the brushes do not dry.</li>
            <li>I counted them and thought only getting 9 to a package was kind of weird.</li>

            <li> I bought my first set of Brush Guards about two months ago, and it didn&#x27;t take long for me to fall in love.</li>
            <li> The problem is they do slide pretty easily, and when the slide opposite the direction of the brush hairs, it catches some and bends them.</li>
            <li> I use another product for my large brushes.</li>
            <li> Michelle Phan made it seem really easy to do, but it was a lot more different than I expected.</li>
            <li> These are what you would expect and work fine, but you do not get enough pieces for the price.</li>
            <li> The brush guard really met my expectation.</li>
            <li> I gives this four stars because they don&#x27;t stay secure and also because they can&#x27;t be used on double ended brushes.</li>
            <li> Brush holds its shape very well.</li>
            <li> I really like these brush guards.</li>
            <li> I also appreciate the reasonable price.</li>
            <li> I really like this product.</li>
            <li> I would return, but too much hassle.</li>
            <li> I really dreaded washing my brushes because I have to lay them out on a towel</li>
            <li> It really does keep the shape.</li>
            <li> This is the only brand I have found that fits eye brushes, so it wins by default!</li>
            <li> I just wish the Guards shrunk back to their original form.</li>
            <li> I clean my brushes often and after I clean them I would gently squeeze out the water, I then use the guard over the brush and leave about 1/4 inch past the tip of the brushes.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s really helpful when transporting the brushes and they dry faster and keep their original shapes.</li>
            <li> These were decent.</li>
            <li> I use them mainly when they&#x27;re in my cosmetic bag being carted around and for while they&#x27;re drying.</li>
            <li> After removal, the bristles are nicely shaped, and I like to keep my brushes in the glass cup for at least 1-2 days depending on the size of the brush​ and weather</li>
            <li> but they don&#x27;t need to last a super long time at the price to still be worth it.</li>
            <li> After washing and drying upside-down in The Brush Guard, my brushes are all shaped as though they were brand new.</li>
            <li> They are like new.</li>
            <li> I feel like my brushes are much healthier and happier, and will last much longer, since I started using these.</li>
            <li> It definitely keeps my brushes in its original shape after deep cleansing.</li>
            <li> does ok for the mid-sized brushes (Outer-v brushes, crease brushes, small tapered blending);  </li>
            <li> This product really delivers - I would highly recommend the entire line of all sizes!</li>
            <li> On top of restoring the shape of my brushes, I really like how I can dry my brushes upside down all in a cup.</li>
            <li> The brush guard is super simple, like a chinese finger trap.</li>
            <li> and I could not find one single eyeshadow or liner brush that would fit in this tiny skinny thing.</li>
            <li> tried these on a few of my eyeshadow brushes and I was surprised at how snug they fit.</li>
            <li> I invest in professional grade brushes, so this product was a no-brainer.  </li>
            <li> However, I really like how they adjust to each individual brush and maintain the brush&#x27;s shape.</li>
            <li> Very inexpensive, would totally recommend to friends.</li>
            <li> I liked the quality and quantity of the brush guard but they are all the same size and do NOT fit my big brushes:/</li>
            <li> I think that there are other similar products out there, but I prefer the original brush guard.</li>
            <li> so they fit the brushes well, but I&#x27;m not sure how well they will stay on the brushes.</li>
            <li> The guard is so small, even my eye liner and thinnest brushes can&#x27;t possibly fit into these.</li>
            <li> It only fit my eyeliner brush, as it is too narrow.</li>
            <li> Aside from the free set I got, I also purchased one with only small sized brushed guards because I have a lot of eyeshadow brushes, as well as a multi-sized set.  </li>
            <li> The brushes keep their form but the brushes do not dry.</li>
            <li> I counted them and thought only getting 9 to a package was kind of weird.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend it for anyone who has a lot or a few makeup brushes.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know how long they will last</li>
            <li> and I am using them not only to dry my brushes but also to protect them in the case.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little difficult at first to get the guard on the brush, but after you do that first time, putting them back on is a breeze.</li>
            <li> These are unbelievably cheap to produce and the profit margin is probably crazy high, so there is no excuse to skimp the customer with just a few guards per pack.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s really simple, and i feel kinda dumb buying something so simple, but it really does work.</li>
            <li> They clear at the end after a few uses.</li>
            <li> they last a long time, and don&#x27;t rough up the brushes</li>
            <li> Also, when they&#x27;re drying, you can keep them upside down in a jar because the tip of the brush guard supports it easily, and the weight of any brush isn&#x27;t enough to push the guard in the wrong direction, so it won&#x27;t catch or bend any hairs.</li>
            <li> It took me a long time for the brushes to dry.</li>
            <li> The guard help hold the shape of the brush and it lets air through to help the brushes dry faster.</li>
            <li> After I wash my brushes, I just slip the brush guard over them and let them dry.</li>
            <li> or I slant it on a towel when I dry my brushes.  </li>
            <li> The reason why I bought these was because I wanted the brushes to dry standing up, but they don&#x27;t dry with the Brush Guard on.</li>
            <li> I will probably cut them down to smaller sizes because they are quite long.</li>
            <li> will not live without them ever again!</li>
            <li> I ended up using the foundation pack for my shadow and liner brushes even though the Brush guards were a little bit big.</li>
            <li> Huge disappointment.</li>
            <li> My only complaints: cannot be used on double-ended brushes, and I have a few of those.</li>
            <li> Rather expensive for what they are but worth it.</li>
            <li> Helps with shape of brush, but they are often still wet on the inside after the outside has dried.</li>
            <li> This is a stiff guard; not flexible enough to taper your brushes.  </li>
            <li> And I just use a cup and put the bushes upside down in it to dry.</li>
            <li> I put them brush tip down in a cup to dry.</li>
            <li> they dry upside down.</li>
            <li> I use these after washing my brushes in order to keep their shape as well as to elevate them so they do not sit in any water that has dripped down as they dry.  </li>
            <li> Generic (purple) guards and the long tube from China does not fit the small eye brushes.  </li>
            <li> I have all the sizes, the small shadow/liner ones here that I bought again and also the bigger ones for blush and powder brushes.</li>
            <li> You have to be very careful.</li>
            <li> You choose a size that looks much smaller than your brush and it expands to fit the brush as you slide it up from the base, smoothing the bristles and keeping them straight.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It will not fit your tiny brushes (pencil brushes, eye liner brushes, small concealer brushes);  </li>
            <li> They have never let me down.</li>
            <li> After placing the brush guard on the brushes, I leave a little room at the end and turn the brushes bristle side down in a tall drinking glass cup.</li>
            <li> I know I&#x27;ve spent a small fortune on all my brushes.</li>
            <li> Also, if the tube gets pushed back even a little by accident (like when I put them in a cup after they&#x27;ve been cleaned), sometimes it will catch the brush hairs and bend them, making them even worse than when we started.</li>
            <li> I also use them when I bring a few brushes in a makeup case/bag while traveling.  </li>
            <li> They are also stiff</li>
            <li> The small ones do stretch.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t lose anything and gained a lot of protection for my expensive makeup brushes.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m disappointed but they at least retain their shape.</li>
            <li> and i don&#x27;t feel bad about gunky brushes</li>
            <li> and I have to say I was shocked when I opened this one.</li>
            <li> I was really disappointed with this purchase.</li>
            <li> This is annoying, since I want the brush guards to stay in place while in my cosmetic bag.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> These are great and I feel my brushes are protected from dust and they keep my makeup bag clean as well!</li>
            <li> I spend alot on my brushes and expect them to last.  The guards are effective in protecting the brushes&#x27; shape.  Recommended.</li>
            <li> The brush guard really met my expectation. It definitely keeps my brushes in its original shape after deep cleansing. Brush lovers, you gotta have them!!</li>
            <li> The description says this is for eyeshadow and eyeliner brushes. It only fit my eyeliner brush, as it is too narrow.</li>
            <li> I know I&#x27;ve spent a small fortune on all my brushes. It&#x27;s absolutely worth it to spend five more and get these. They hold the shape during drying (so your blushers don&#x27;t get pouffier and pouffier) and it also protects them during travel.</li>
            <li> Very nice idea however the ends free after a while. They clear at the end after a few uses. The idea is for improving on.</li>
            <li> These were decent. They are tiny so they fit the brushes well, but I&#x27;m not sure how well they will stay on the brushes. I will probably cut them down to smaller sizes because they are quite long.</li>
            <li> Helps with shape of brush, but they are often still wet on the inside after the outside has dried.</li>
            <li> This product really delivers - I would highly recommend the entire line of all sizes! After washing and drying upside-down in The Brush Guard, my brushes are all shaped as though they were brand new. Some are even better than when I originally bought them! This has also revolutionized my ability to bring brushes on travel. I always struggled trying to pick just a few brushes that would fit into my travel roll; now I can bring as many as I want and just throw them into a big makeup bag with all of my makeup because the bristles are all perfectly protected in The Brush Guard. I have a feeling I will keep buying these until every single brush of mine has its own Guard! One tip for using the product - these come in many sizes; when drying your brushes, make sure you pick the size of Brush Guard that TIGHLY fits around the ferrule of the brush (you may have to stretch out the Brush Guard to fit it over the handle). If the Guard is too big for the ferrule, you will not get the desired effect and the bristles will stick out of the wire mesh as the brush dries and fans apart. Buy this...you won&#x27;t regret it!</li>
            <li> I invest in professional grade brushes, so this product was a no-brainer.  The Shadow/Liner Package comes with an excellent variety of skinny Brush Guards which keep my investments in as-new shape.  I don&#x27;t know how I ever did without them.  I can&#x27;t recommend them highly enough.</li>
            <li> The brush guard is super simple, like a chinese finger trap. The problem is they do slide pretty easily, and when the slide opposite the direction of the brush hairs, it catches some and bends them. This is annoying, since I want the brush guards to stay in place while in my cosmetic bag. I think it would work best in conjunction with the use of a brush holder that has the little elastic loops to secure the brushes in place, and the brush guards would just be added protection. I gives this four stars because they don&#x27;t stay secure and also because they can&#x27;t be used on double ended brushes. However, I really like how they adjust to each individual brush and maintain the brush&#x27;s shape. I use them mainly when they&#x27;re in my cosmetic bag being carted around and for while they&#x27;re drying. This is the important use because it really helps maintain the quality of the brush. Also, when they&#x27;re drying, you can keep them upside down in a jar because the tip of the brush guard supports it easily, and the weight of any brush isn&#x27;t enough to push the guard in the wrong direction, so it won&#x27;t catch or bend any hairs. I plan on buying these for every brush I own.</li>
            <li> Works as advertised, will purchase again. Well worth the purchase.</li>
            <li> i really love these brush guards! it makes it so much easier to wash my brushes!i highly recommend to everyone!!!</li>
            <li> Bought The Brush Guard--Shadow/Liner Package. excellent case for brushes. Brush holds its shape very well. The hair does not stick out. Similarly, I will buy more.</li>
            <li> Slow shipping but great item!!</li>
            <li> Perfect for letting my brushes air dry, keeps shape well. Very inexpensive, would totally recommend to friends. Could see my self repurchasing.</li>
            <li> I love these things, they protect my brushes and keep them straight and fresh after I&#x27;ve cleaned them like nothing else has. I feel like my brushes are much healthier and happier, and will last much longer, since I started using these. My only complaints: cannot be used on double-ended brushes, and I have a few of those. Also, if the tube gets pushed back even a little by accident (like when I put them in a cup after they&#x27;ve been cleaned), sometimes it will catch the brush hairs and bend them, making them even worse than when we started. You have to be very careful. If you are careful, though, they&#x27;re wonderful!</li>
            <li> The Brush Guard does exactly what it is suppose to do - protects and preserves my make up brushes.    Keeping my brushes clean got a lot easier.  I&#x27;m very happy with this product.</li>
            <li> This is a stiff guard; not flexible enough to taper your brushes.  It will not fit your tiny brushes (pencil brushes, eye liner brushes, small concealer brushes);  does ok for the mid-sized brushes (Outer-v brushes, crease brushes, small tapered blending);  works best with large eye brushes (blending, tapered blending).  Generic (purple) guards and the long tube from China does not fit the small eye brushes.  This is the only brand I have found that fits eye brushes, so it wins by default!</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s really simple, and i feel kinda dumb buying something so simple, but it really does work. and i don&#x27;t feel bad about gunky brushes</li>
            <li> As what other reviews say, this brush guard is a perfect protector for my brushes. It keeps my brushes look clean and new.</li>
            <li> I really like these brush guards. They arrived quickly, and do exactly what they are supposed to do! I ordered 3 different sets because I plan on replacing my current brushes with quality ones over time. The \\&quot;Shadow/Liner\\&quot; package comes with 10 brush guards. All 10 brush guards are 1/4\\&quot;, or \\&quot;XS\\&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried these on a few of my eyeshadow brushes and I was surprised at how snug they fit. I have one blending eye shadow brush with a bigger handle that I am going to use a bigger brush guard on, because I have the bigger sizes and because I don&#x27;t want to stretch out the smaller ones. If I had pricey brushes I probably would not trust the guards alone for travel protection. I bought these guards for drying and protecting my brushes after washing them, and they are perfect for that. A must-have for anyone who wants to maintain their brushes!</li>
            <li> I like this product. quality at a high level, this seller quickly sent the goods, the idea is very original position</li>
            <li> Awesome, yet simple product. Yet does what it says and protects my brushes inexpensively. My only misgivings is I would like more in the variety pack.</li>
            <li> I bought my first set of Brush Guards about two months ago, and it didn&#x27;t take long for me to fall in love. I just bought more. My brushes are an investment, and these protect them. Plus, shipping is amazingly quick...ordered Saturday, received Monday. Can&#x27;t beat that!</li>
            <li> This guard is the best for makeup brush. I clean my brushes often and after I clean them I would gently squeeze out the water, I then use the guard over the brush and leave about 1/4 inch past the tip of the brushes. And I just use a cup and put the bushes upside down in it to dry. The guard help hold the shape of the brush and it lets air through to help the brushes dry faster. Also it is perfect to protect the brush when traveling.</li>
            <li> Easy to use, makes maintenance of brushes easy! Liked how easy it slid onto my brushes, I would recommend this product to any who wear makeup and use makeup brushes.</li>
            <li> There is nothing better that you can say about a product except that it works and does what you need it to.</li>
            <li> I am so glad that I found out about this product. I think it&#x27;s genius. A great way to store makeup brushes and a wonderful way to dry makeup brushes after cleaning. I have been using these brush guards for about a year now and they do a good job of keeping my makeup brushes in good condition. After I wash my brushes, I just slip the brush guard over them and let them dry. This product is great at keeping the shape of the brushes. They are like new. I don&#x27;t know how I managed without these brush guards. I think that there are other similar products out there, but I prefer the original brush guard. I also appreciate the reasonable price. I buy more of these as needed. I have all the sizes, the small shadow/liner ones here that I bought again and also the bigger ones for blush and powder brushes. They have never let me down. A reliable product that will keep my precious makeup brushes in great condition and protect them if I travel. Anyone who wants to keep their makeup brushes looking great should consider buying this product. It&#x27;s a good investment!</li>
            <li> I got these items quite promptly, (the second day of the arrival time window) and they were in great condition. They seem really great and I&#x27;m currently drying my brushes in them as I write this. I waited to clean my brushes till I got these b/c of the great review from Michelle Phan&#x27;s youtube video on \\&quot;Squeaky Clean Brushes!\\&quot; :) [..]</li>
            <li> Performs as described. I have recycled it over and over and still am using the multi-pack variety. After placing the brush guard on the brushes, I leave a little room at the end and turn the brushes bristle side down in a tall drinking glass cup. After removal, the bristles are nicely shaped, and I like to keep my brushes in the glass cup for at least 1-2 days depending on the size of the brush​ and weather the of course.</li>
            <li> these are essential for keeping brushes in top condition.  they last a long time, and don&#x27;t rough up the brushes</li>
            <li> Great. I wash my eye make up brushes and put these guards on to help them maintain their shape. I put them brush tip down in a cup to dry. Leave enough of the guard at the tip so the brush head is protected. The small ones do stretch. I only use this for my smaller brushes. I use another product for my large brushes.</li>
            <li> I saw these in a YouTube video and decided to try them. At $5.50 what did I have to lose? I didn&#x27;t lose anything and gained a lot of protection for my expensive makeup brushes. You choose a size that looks much smaller than your brush and it expands to fit the brush as you slide it up from the base, smoothing the bristles and keeping them straight.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These guards are quit sturdy feeling once on the brush and I am using them not only to dry my brushes but also to protect them in the case. I don&#x27;t know how long they will last but they don&#x27;t need to last a super long time at the price to still be worth it. The brushes that were getting all out of shape in the case are now tamed and in perfect shape again. I&#x27;m very happy with these brush guards.</li>
            <li> I love this product. I bought three different sized packages to use for all my brushes. Helps keep your brushes perfect.</li>
            <li> Really nice, easily cleanable, stay fit and really works! This is now my &amp;#34;must have&amp;#34; for my cleaning process  of my brushes!</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s really helpful when transporting the brushes and they dry faster and keep their original shapes. I just wish the Guards shrunk back to their original form. I think they would last longer.</li>
            <li> It took me a long time for the brushes to dry. Michelle Phan made it seem really easy to do, but it was a lot more different than I expected.</li>
            <li> good for travel and keeps their original shape after i wash them (daily)!  will not live without them ever again!</li>
            <li> love it and good price</li>
            <li> These are what you would expect and work fine, but you do not get enough pieces for the price. These are unbelievably cheap to produce and the profit margin is probably crazy high, so there is no excuse to skimp the customer with just a few guards per pack.</li>
            <li> A practical product. So easy to use and so useful for who use brush makeup. I really like this product.</li>
            <li> A classmate had originally given me a set for free.  I love that they have a variety of sizes to fit big, medium, and the smallest brushes (eyeliner and brow brushes).  They are also stiff so it sits up nicely in a cup or I slant it on a towel when I dry my brushes.  Aside from the free set I got, I also purchased one with only small sized brushed guards because I have a lot of eyeshadow brushes, as well as a multi-sized set.  I also bought the cleaning kit which came with more brush guards!! I would highly recommend it for anyone who has a lot or a few makeup brushes.</li>
            <li> I was really disappointed with this purchase. I have MAC, Sephora, Bobbi Brown and Coastal brushes and I could not find one single eyeshadow or liner brush that would fit in this tiny skinny thing. Basically just a toothpick.  I purchased one of each of the varieties offered. I ended up using the foundation pack for my shadow and liner brushes even though the Brush guards were a little bit big. They didn&#x27;t fit my foundation brushes anyway.  But I will do another review for that variety.  I would return, but too much hassle.</li>
            <li> The brushes keep their form but the brushes do not dry. The reason why I bought these was because I wanted the brushes to dry standing up, but they don&#x27;t dry with the Brush Guard on. I&#x27;m disappointed but they at least retain their shape.</li>
            <li> On top of restoring the shape of my brushes, I really like how I can dry my brushes upside down all in a cup. I really dreaded washing my brushes because I have to lay them out on a towel and it just took so much counter top space. Now they all fit nicely in a cup and I don&#x27;t have to be paranoid about water penetrating where it&#x27;s not supposed to since now they dry upside down. I got the variety pack to give it a try and am back for more. The sizes do vary depending on the thickness of your brush head and handle. For example,I used the blush size (S) for some of my shadow brushes and foundation size (M) for blush brushes, but this doesn&#x27;t bother me at all. I would recommend ordering the variety pack as a starter.</li>
            <li> I liked the quality and quantity of the brush guard but they are all the same size and do NOT fit my big brushes:/</li>
            <li> These are great for reshaping my brushes while they dry after a wash. You can also use cable sleeving, but ordering a pack of these is just so much more convenient. Plus, it&#x27;s free shipping! :)</li>
            <li> I got this one and opened it right up!! I counted them and thought only getting 9 to a package was kind of weird. So I looked at the cover and it said I should have gotten 10. I took it all apart to make sure I hadn&#x27;t missed it. Nope sure enough. I only got 9.</li>
            <li> Perfect for protecting eye makeup brushes while traveling.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use a lot of brushes (mostly for my eye makeup) and these brushes fit perfectly. I have different brands, but mostly they are from Sephora. It&#x27;s a little difficult at first to get the guard on the brush, but after you do that first time, putting them back on is a breeze. I absolutely love these for cleaning my brushes and for KEEPING them clean!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so glad I heard about these!! Cleaning my brushes has never been so easy!! They were sent all the way to Guam, and so quickly!!</li>
            <li> The brush guards are great for keeping the shape of most style of makeup brushes, though they are obviously not intended for speciality shapes like fan brushes.  I use these after washing my brushes in order to keep their shape as well as to elevate them so they do not sit in any water that has dripped down as they dry.  I also use them when I bring a few brushes in a makeup case/bag while traveling.  They have held up well and I&#x27;ve not had any begin to deteriorate.  I would purchase these again in a heartbeat...and that may be sooner than later as I just moved and I&#x27;m not quite sure where my Brush Guards are now.</li>
            <li> This actually does what it says. After I wash my brushes I put these on them. It really does keep the shape. Definitly worth it.</li>
            <li> Great little guards for keeping your brushes nice, especially for travel. Rather expensive for what they are but worth it.</li>
            <li> Perfect for brush storage to keep bristles from fraying, also great for drying brushes after washing them.  Best thing is they&lt;br /&gt;are inexpensive!</li>
            <li> These actually did more damage to my brushes then before I use them.</li>
            <li> My girl friends and I love it so much, very good product and same as the picture showed, will order again, thanks.</li>
            <li> This product works! I heard about it from YouTube and then I bought a couple packs to try and then a couple more once I realized they worked and now I can&#x27;t wash my brushes without them! Love love love!</li>
            <li> I purchased the variety pack and as well as this one and I have to say I was shocked when I opened this one. The guard is so small, even my eye liner and thinnest brushes can&#x27;t possibly fit into these. Huge disappointment.</li>
            <li> These work great for storing your brushes with the brush side down after washing them.  Plus, I leave the guards on until I use the brush so I know which ones I need to wash.  They are easy on, easy off and seem to be durable.</li>
