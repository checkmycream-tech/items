            <li>Save yourself some money, there are better products on the market!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s simply an amazing machine for the price</li>
            <li>just need some tightening and would be nice to get rid of some freckles</li>
            <li>the product came in a nice box.</li>
            <li>It was barely warm.</li>
            <li>but I am impressed so far.</li>
            <li>I just wanted to be able to do it at my own convenience.</li>
            <li>and it becomes even more effective...</li>
            <li>Really love this device.</li>
            <li>He has been noticeably pleased with the results.</li>
            <li>pleased with my purchase.</li>
            <li>I love this device.  </li>
            <li>My instructions are perfect and in English</li>
            <li>I love this,</li>
            <li>my face looks better</li>
            <li>Couldn&#x27;t feel the appropriate amount if heat on the face ...</li>
            <li>have  read that many people get paid to leave reviews on Amazon</li>
            <li>Great product, fast shipping.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>the heat just dries out your skin and gives MORE wrinkles...</li>
            <li>and I guess it gave my skin a better glow ...</li>
            <li>love this product.</li>
            <li>I find it to work better for me.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>There are better products.</li>
            <li>I do however find that I get better pricing on products on Amazon when I do locate them here.</li>
            <li>Glad I can return it</li>
            <li>I will have to give it more time.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It has been a bit more than a month since I used this machine.</li>
            <li>, I&#x27;ve been an Esthetician for 15 years (google me) and I have to say this machine is just ok.  </li>
            <li>I feel I get better lifting with microcurrent.</li>
            <li>it is ok.</li>
            <li>I was and am very excited to receive this item.  </li>
            <li>Was very excited to get this product</li>
            <li>I returned for a full refund and George was nice and refunded my return shipping</li>
            <li>The translation into English isn&#x27;t very good, but serviceable.</li>
            <li>The vendor very kindly emailed me to tell me not to use it so frequently (use about twice a week) based upon some comments I had made and thank you!  </li>
            <li>but I was so lucky to have a kind and attentive vendor.</li>
            <li>thanks for great service and quick shipping.&lt;br /&gt;carolyn</li>
            <li>This could be the most amazing dot matrix home device on the planet, but if you don&#x27;t know how to use it, it really doesn&#x27;t matter.</li>
            <li>I did contact them about an issued, it was addressed very quickly.  </li>
            <li>I had a sebaceous cyst removed from my right cheek last year &amp; my surgeon to her credit did a wonderful job</li>
            <li>and then the product and it seems to get warm/hot just fine.</li>
            <li>this device is amazing, I have tried several things like this but have to agree as an expert in&lt;br /&gt;the skin field , I love this!  </li>
            <li>I have an area of concern and that is under my eyes where I tend to have stubborn fine lines that I have treated with fillers and injections, and now this, and this has helped smooth them out.  </li>
            <li>Makes my skin feel smooth,</li>
            <li>I am so happy with my purchase that when I next see my surgeon I am taking this machine with me to show her.</li>
            <li>When I saw this, I thought it was really cheap for a device of it&#x27;s type</li>
            <li>but that&#x27;s good so far as I know its doing something.  </li>
            <li>1 of my favorite things in the world right now.</li>
            <li>Others interested in looking better for reasonable$$and effort&lt;br /&gt;Glad</li>
            <li>/&gt;That said, I&#x27;m pretty pleased.</li>
            <li>Of course professional Esthetician treatments are better, safer, and more comfortable.</li>
            <li>for result,  I&#x27;ve not seen significant improvement yet</li>
            <li>Works wonderfully on face,  too small for body parts</li>
            <li>Some with significantly sagging skin may see a result quicker</li>
            <li>At certain times, I had to move it because it hurt too much - which is good,</li>
            <li>I will check back after a fair amount of usage.  </li>
            <li>so it makes me wonder if THESE reviews are all true.</li>
            <li>I really thought it would lift more, but it doesn&#x27;t.  </li>
            <li>I have to say that this machine was packaged very nice, however the machine does not get hot enough</li>
            <li>In other words, if you&#x27;ve already had an Ultherapy treatment or a Fraxel treatment, your skin has the foundation upon which to have great results.  </li>
            <li>I was lucky enough to receive my instructions in English &amp; Lisa also contacted me &amp; sent me the instructions, they provide excellent customer service.  </li>
            <li>Those do go away quickly however if it does occur.</li>
            <li>I was lucky I did not pass over my eyes.</li>
            <li>I am now using the High setting in most areas.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>exilis gets VERY HOT</li>
            <li>No flushing( it barely got warm)</li>
            <li>I really concentrate on my lines between my eyebrows, my elevens :) this device really helps smooth them out.</li>
            <li>:  This is my new favorite tool.</li>
            <li>My face is in pretty good shape already, because I use sunscreen and retin-a religiously.</li>
            <li>I really haven&#x27;t seen remarkable results but then again, I haven&#x27;t used on a regular basis.</li>
            <li>I have used frequency generators for other uses successfully but this one didn&#x27;t work for me.</li>
            <li>Again since this is my first day I cant give a proper review just yet but will update later for sure if I can figure out how to update lol.  </li>
            <li>but if you are patient enough the results are amazing.</li>
            <li>fun.</li>
            <li>It does come nicely packaged, and the instructions are in English.</li>
            <li>Takes a while to see results but worth it.</li>
            <li>and I have not been able to really feel much of anything</li>
            <li>a little lifted love it!!</li>
            <li>I received it right on time</li>
            <li>Way too time consuning to use, so not worth it, packaged well, good instructions, but, who has timecto hold againsnt every perceived line???</li>
            <li>Just like everything if you want to see results you must be consistent, and spend the right amount of time in order to achieve results.  </li>
            <li>Useless product don&#x27;t know where they got all those good reviews from must be their own.</li>
            <li>Purchased through Amazon from  NORLANYA, delivered very fast.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to use and there are many helpful, professional videos out there for this specific product.</li>
            <li>Reviews are important for me and so far I am glad I seen the good ones before the latest bad reviews.  </li>
            <li>I am an Esthetician and have many devices in my armory, including microcurrent, which I use daily.</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>love it just the same!  </li>
            <li>I bought my gel first</li>
            <li>this machine really works!</li>
            <li>it gets hot</li>
            <li>The machine WILL get hot if you hold it one place.</li>
            <li>Also, my guess is I am tending to focus more on the wrinkle located on the lower left side that starts at my lip and ends at the jaw.  </li>
            <li>If you are willing to be vigilant and patient, go for this product.  </li>
            <li>&amp; I have been diligent in making sure that there is only the smallest trace of a scar.  </li>
            <li>but if set at 2nd mode ok  eyes use mode 1  </li>
            <li>I purchase many things from Bliss, The Skin Store and Amazon on a constant basis.</li>
            <li>sure you use the low setting when you first begin or</li>
            <li>My first product didn&#x27;t work</li>
            <li>Skin tightening, pore reduction, wrinkle reduction and just an overall better appearance to the skin in my face.  </li>
            <li>I have also used this in conjunction with my derma roller, derma roll first then use this</li>
            <li>The first day I noticed pore reduction</li>
            <li>Be aware that this machine can work</li>
            <li>but they make me look older, incredibly older 5-10 years !!!</li>
            <li>I found significant improvement with one 2-minute treatment in the maxilla &amp; mandible area that is comparable to professional fractional laser.</li>
            <li>Product worked very well at first but quit within a 3-4 weeks of purchase.</li>
            <li>and I love how it holds a charge for a long time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Easy to read english translated manual.</li>
            <li>I am about to start an experiment with large amounts of C and the Dot Matrix.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very pleased with this little gadget!</li>
            <li>A few days ago I realized that my chronic back pain had greatly lessened.  </li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t really tell any difference</li>
            <li>This mini machine really works &amp; I really like it.</li>
            <li>George worked along with me via email, answering me promptly; and was very patient with me as I figured out how to get the desired results from the device--even resorting to using one himself to answer my questions.</li>
            <li>( I noticed if I go to a spot with out the gel I don&#x27;t feel to much)  </li>
            <li>The device doesn&#x27;t look or feel cheap, but again, serviceable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used ultrasound gel with this, which I think you must use (ultrasound gel can be had for about $10 for two big bottles on Amazon).</li>
            <li>I am very displeased with this product.</li>
            <li>I really don&#x27;t notice any difference, been 3 weeks</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very hsppy with the miniportable, anti again,i used one a wk.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used it 2 times a week for a month and really can see why women go gaga over this thing.</li>
            <li>It really works but you have to be patient if you have &#x27;real&amp;#34; wrinkles and saggy skin.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very scared and desperate!!!!&lt;br /&gt;Stay</li>
            <li>so you can&#x27;t really do a peel before or you would really sensitize the skin.  </li>
            <li>You have to leave it in one spot until you really feel the heat.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never had such great results with taking something for such a short time.  </li>
            <li>If anyone wants to join me, please posts your results in the comments section.</li>
            <li>The high setting is strong for the eyes a medium to low works well.</li>
            <li>I have other devices that work better.</li>
            <li>The only con about this is, ofcourse it&#x27;s not as strong as one from a professional place</li>
            <li>This is my first review and its to soon to say if this works but people are rushing to judgment far to soon.  </li>
            <li>Professional but pretty packaging.</li>
            <li>When you work on another person, you must make contact with their skin with the hand not holding the machine in order to complete the circuit and get the red light on.</li>
            <li>For the cost and realistic expectation, I would recommend this product.</li>
            <li>When you get older you have to bump up your skin care routine from just getting products at Rite Aid.</li>
            <li>Maybe useful if you&#x27;re under 40 with just a few, light lines.</li>
            <li>the Medium and High may cause redness and bumps.</li>
            <li>The treatments I do to my skin with this machine are hardcore, 40 mins to an hour on high, sometimes longer.  </li>
            <li>Both before and upon receiving this item I emailed her several times with questions, she promptly answered all my questions and was very helpful, I would highly recommend this product for anyone who is interested in keeping their skin looking youthful.</li>
            <li>More like do some every few days.  </li>
            <li>the product itself looks cheap and I am not sure if worth the money</li>
            <li>After the first treatment on my hands, my hands looked much lighter, the same thing with my face, so that it seemed sun damage was being reversed.</li>
            <li>First of all, it does not come with English instructions but the seller was sweet enough to send them to me after I contacted them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>So really, I have no idea how the product works because I don&#x27;t know it I am using it correctly and have ended up with only dry skin, much like you have after a light chemical peel.</li>
            <li>Took some time and persistence to get a new head.</li>
            <li>I am not sure someone without any knowledge would get the most benefit from this machine.</li>
            <li>It did not get hot or leave my face red..</li>
            <li>Even after my first use the next day my skin felt tighter &amp; it looked like I was wearing foundation.  </li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t even make my face red or hot.</li>
            <li>The first week I used low setting.</li>
            <li>I am very impatient and thought the more I used it, the quicker the results.  </li>
            <li>I use with clear ultrasound gel.</li>
            <li>I like it so far.</li>
            <li>no mention also of how frequently do I need to use it to maximize its effect....</li>
            <li>exilis worked and i feel that i will get similar results with this much cheaper option</li>
            <li>I think if you use it frequently you will see results over time.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a 37 year old who is OCD, and always has ben about taking care of her skin.  </li>
            <li>My neck now looks like a 60 year old.</li>
            <li>Results are showing slowly but surely.</li>
            <li>It is a step above my dermawand, which is really useful for minor face flaws.</li>
            <li>First, shipping was about two weeks, which was what I expected.</li>
            <li>Especially considering that I forked over a Ben Franklin for this cheaply made little doohickey.</li>
            <li>I love this little machine will continue to leave results!!!</li>
            <li>Received this product quickly, have been using a few months with no noticeable difference.</li>
            <li>I noticed a difference in my slightly sagging neck skin immediately with the first treatment ( I am 62 years old ).</li>
            <li>Read the directions carefully if you really want this to work.</li>
            <li>It no longer heated up or lit up and barely produced heat.</li>
            <li>I hope I did not damage my lymph nodes as others say on Professional Thermage reviews because I passed this machine over my nodes without knowing the possible effects.</li>
            <li>It is clear that a non native English speaker tried to create the directions and quite honestly I had to turn to the reviews section for this product to even get a vague idea of how to use this device.</li>
            <li>I think this is probably a much less powerful version of ematrix; but those treatments will likely cost you about $1,000 a pop at a derm or med-spa.</li>
            <li>I have to find out how long it can go without needing a new head but</li>
            <li>My skin looks smoother and less saggy right after treatment, but doesn&#x27;t last.</li>
            <li>So I won&#x27;t really notice any real collagen regeneration results for at least a month.</li>
            <li>They are written in english but clearly by someone who speaks little to no english which isn&#x27;t a crime, but omg, it&#x27;s the right of consumer to be given the ability to properly use the items they purchase and the responsibility of the seller to provide them with that ability.</li>
            <li>I however keep noticing changes, for instance my previously discrete marionette lines are now evident and deep.</li>
            <li>I use it on the highest level and barely feel any heat, only around the eyes do I feel it.</li>
            <li>i am a seventy-one year  old woman who wants to remove or try to some small crows feet around my eyes and some sagging skin around my chin area.</li>
            <li>What I have found is that if one holds the head in one place, as mentioned in other reviews, for a second or two while pressing firmly, the results are quite quick.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> just need some tightening and would be nice to get rid of some freckles</li>
            <li> the product came in a nice box.</li>
            <li> It was barely warm.</li>
            <li> but I am impressed so far.</li>
            <li> I just wanted to be able to do it at my own convenience.</li>
            <li> and it becomes even more effective...</li>
            <li> Really love this device.</li>
            <li> He has been noticeably pleased with the results.</li>
            <li> pleased with my purchase.</li>
            <li> I love this device.  </li>
            <li> My instructions are perfect and in English</li>
            <li> I love this,</li>
            <li> my face looks better</li>
            <li> Couldn&#x27;t feel the appropriate amount if heat on the face ...</li>
            <li> have  read that many people get paid to leave reviews on Amazon</li>
            <li> Great product, fast shipping.</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> the heat just dries out your skin and gives MORE wrinkles...</li>
            <li> and I guess it gave my skin a better glow ...</li>
            <li> love this product.</li>
            <li> I find it to work better for me.</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> There are better products.</li>
            <li> I do however find that I get better pricing on products on Amazon when I do locate them here.</li>
            <li> Glad I can return it</li>
            <li> I will have to give it more time.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It has been a bit more than a month since I used this machine.</li>
            <li> , I&#x27;ve been an Esthetician for 15 years (google me) and I have to say this machine is just ok.  </li>
            <li> I feel I get better lifting with microcurrent.</li>
            <li> it is ok.</li>
            <li> I was and am very excited to receive this item.  </li>
            <li> Was very excited to get this product</li>
            <li> I returned for a full refund and George was nice and refunded my return shipping</li>
            <li> The translation into English isn&#x27;t very good, but serviceable.</li>
            <li> The vendor very kindly emailed me to tell me not to use it so frequently (use about twice a week) based upon some comments I had made and thank you!  </li>
            <li> but I was so lucky to have a kind and attentive vendor.</li>
            <li> thanks for great service and quick shipping.&lt;br /&gt;carolyn</li>
            <li> This could be the most amazing dot matrix home device on the planet, but if you don&#x27;t know how to use it, it really doesn&#x27;t matter.</li>
            <li> I did contact them about an issued, it was addressed very quickly.  </li>
            <li> I had a sebaceous cyst removed from my right cheek last year &amp; my surgeon to her credit did a wonderful job</li>
            <li> and then the product and it seems to get warm/hot just fine.</li>
            <li> this device is amazing, I have tried several things like this but have to agree as an expert in&lt;br /&gt;the skin field , I love this!  </li>
            <li> I have an area of concern and that is under my eyes where I tend to have stubborn fine lines that I have treated with fillers and injections, and now this, and this has helped smooth them out.  </li>
            <li> Makes my skin feel smooth,</li>
            <li> I am so happy with my purchase that when I next see my surgeon I am taking this machine with me to show her.</li>
            <li> When I saw this, I thought it was really cheap for a device of it&#x27;s type</li>
            <li> but that&#x27;s good so far as I know its doing something.  </li>
            <li> 1 of my favorite things in the world right now.</li>
            <li> Others interested in looking better for reasonable$$and effort&lt;br /&gt;Glad</li>
            <li> /&gt;That said, I&#x27;m pretty pleased.</li>
            <li> Of course professional Esthetician treatments are better, safer, and more comfortable.</li>
            <li> for result,  I&#x27;ve not seen significant improvement yet</li>
            <li> Works wonderfully on face,  too small for body parts</li>
            <li> Some with significantly sagging skin may see a result quicker</li>
            <li> At certain times, I had to move it because it hurt too much - which is good,</li>
            <li> I will check back after a fair amount of usage.  </li>
            <li> so it makes me wonder if THESE reviews are all true.</li>
            <li> I really thought it would lift more, but it doesn&#x27;t.  </li>
            <li> I have to say that this machine was packaged very nice, however the machine does not get hot enough</li>
            <li> In other words, if you&#x27;ve already had an Ultherapy treatment or a Fraxel treatment, your skin has the foundation upon which to have great results.  </li>
            <li> I was lucky enough to receive my instructions in English &amp; Lisa also contacted me &amp; sent me the instructions, they provide excellent customer service.  </li>
            <li> Those do go away quickly however if it does occur.</li>
            <li> I was lucky I did not pass over my eyes.</li>
            <li> I am now using the High setting in most areas.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> exilis gets VERY HOT</li>
            <li> No flushing( it barely got warm)</li>
            <li> I really concentrate on my lines between my eyebrows, my elevens :) this device really helps smooth them out.</li>
            <li> :  This is my new favorite tool.</li>
            <li> My face is in pretty good shape already, because I use sunscreen and retin-a religiously.</li>
            <li> I really haven&#x27;t seen remarkable results but then again, I haven&#x27;t used on a regular basis.</li>
            <li> I have used frequency generators for other uses successfully but this one didn&#x27;t work for me.</li>
            <li> Again since this is my first day I cant give a proper review just yet but will update later for sure if I can figure out how to update lol.  </li>
            <li> but if you are patient enough the results are amazing.</li>
            <li> fun.</li>
            <li> It does come nicely packaged, and the instructions are in English.</li>
            <li> Takes a while to see results but worth it.</li>
            <li> and I have not been able to really feel much of anything</li>
            <li> a little lifted love it!!</li>
            <li> I received it right on time</li>
            <li> Way too time consuning to use, so not worth it, packaged well, good instructions, but, who has timecto hold againsnt every perceived line???</li>
            <li> Just like everything if you want to see results you must be consistent, and spend the right amount of time in order to achieve results.  </li>
            <li> Useless product don&#x27;t know where they got all those good reviews from must be their own.</li>
            <li> Purchased through Amazon from  NORLANYA, delivered very fast.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to use and there are many helpful, professional videos out there for this specific product.</li>
            <li> Reviews are important for me and so far I am glad I seen the good ones before the latest bad reviews.  </li>
            <li> I am an Esthetician and have many devices in my armory, including microcurrent, which I use daily.</li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> love it just the same!  </li>
            <li> I bought my gel first</li>
            <li> this machine really works!</li>
            <li> it gets hot</li>
            <li> The machine WILL get hot if you hold it one place.</li>
            <li> Also, my guess is I am tending to focus more on the wrinkle located on the lower left side that starts at my lip and ends at the jaw.  </li>
            <li> If you are willing to be vigilant and patient, go for this product.  </li>
            <li> &amp; I have been diligent in making sure that there is only the smallest trace of a scar.  </li>
            <li> but if set at 2nd mode ok  eyes use mode 1  </li>
            <li> I purchase many things from Bliss, The Skin Store and Amazon on a constant basis.</li>
            <li> sure you use the low setting when you first begin or</li>
            <li> My first product didn&#x27;t work</li>
            <li> Skin tightening, pore reduction, wrinkle reduction and just an overall better appearance to the skin in my face.  </li>
            <li> I have also used this in conjunction with my derma roller, derma roll first then use this</li>
            <li> The first day I noticed pore reduction</li>
            <li> Be aware that this machine can work</li>
            <li> but they make me look older, incredibly older 5-10 years !!!</li>
            <li> I found significant improvement with one 2-minute treatment in the maxilla &amp; mandible area that is comparable to professional fractional laser.</li>
            <li> Product worked very well at first but quit within a 3-4 weeks of purchase.</li>
            <li> and I love how it holds a charge for a long time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Easy to read english translated manual.</li>
            <li> I am about to start an experiment with large amounts of C and the Dot Matrix.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very pleased with this little gadget!</li>
            <li> A few days ago I realized that my chronic back pain had greatly lessened.  </li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t really tell any difference</li>
            <li> This mini machine really works &amp; I really like it.</li>
            <li> George worked along with me via email, answering me promptly; and was very patient with me as I figured out how to get the desired results from the device--even resorting to using one himself to answer my questions.</li>
            <li> ( I noticed if I go to a spot with out the gel I don&#x27;t feel to much)  </li>
            <li> The device doesn&#x27;t look or feel cheap, but again, serviceable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used ultrasound gel with this, which I think you must use (ultrasound gel can be had for about $10 for two big bottles on Amazon).</li>
            <li> I am very displeased with this product.</li>
            <li> I really don&#x27;t notice any difference, been 3 weeks</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very hsppy with the miniportable, anti again,i used one a wk.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it 2 times a week for a month and really can see why women go gaga over this thing.</li>
            <li> It really works but you have to be patient if you have &#x27;real&amp;#34; wrinkles and saggy skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very scared and desperate!!!!&lt;br /&gt;Stay</li>
            <li> so you can&#x27;t really do a peel before or you would really sensitize the skin.  </li>
            <li> You have to leave it in one spot until you really feel the heat.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never had such great results with taking something for such a short time.  </li>
            <li> If anyone wants to join me, please posts your results in the comments section.</li>
            <li> The high setting is strong for the eyes a medium to low works well.</li>
            <li> I have other devices that work better.</li>
            <li> The only con about this is, ofcourse it&#x27;s not as strong as one from a professional place</li>
            <li> This is my first review and its to soon to say if this works but people are rushing to judgment far to soon.  </li>
            <li> Professional but pretty packaging.</li>
            <li> When you work on another person, you must make contact with their skin with the hand not holding the machine in order to complete the circuit and get the red light on.</li>
            <li> For the cost and realistic expectation, I would recommend this product.</li>
            <li> When you get older you have to bump up your skin care routine from just getting products at Rite Aid.</li>
            <li> Maybe useful if you&#x27;re under 40 with just a few, light lines.</li>
            <li> the Medium and High may cause redness and bumps.</li>
            <li> The treatments I do to my skin with this machine are hardcore, 40 mins to an hour on high, sometimes longer.  </li>
            <li> Both before and upon receiving this item I emailed her several times with questions, she promptly answered all my questions and was very helpful, I would highly recommend this product for anyone who is interested in keeping their skin looking youthful.</li>
            <li> More like do some every few days.  </li>
            <li> the product itself looks cheap and I am not sure if worth the money</li>
            <li> After the first treatment on my hands, my hands looked much lighter, the same thing with my face, so that it seemed sun damage was being reversed.</li>
            <li> First of all, it does not come with English instructions but the seller was sweet enough to send them to me after I contacted them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> So really, I have no idea how the product works because I don&#x27;t know it I am using it correctly and have ended up with only dry skin, much like you have after a light chemical peel.</li>
            <li> Took some time and persistence to get a new head.</li>
            <li> I am not sure someone without any knowledge would get the most benefit from this machine.</li>
            <li> It did not get hot or leave my face red..</li>
            <li> Even after my first use the next day my skin felt tighter &amp; it looked like I was wearing foundation.  </li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t even make my face red or hot.</li>
            <li> The first week I used low setting.</li>
            <li> I am very impatient and thought the more I used it, the quicker the results.  </li>
            <li> I use with clear ultrasound gel.</li>
            <li> I like it so far.</li>
            <li> no mention also of how frequently do I need to use it to maximize its effect....</li>
            <li> exilis worked and i feel that i will get similar results with this much cheaper option</li>
            <li> I think if you use it frequently you will see results over time.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a 37 year old who is OCD, and always has ben about taking care of her skin.  </li>
            <li> My neck now looks like a 60 year old.</li>
            <li> Results are showing slowly but surely.</li>
            <li> It is a step above my dermawand, which is really useful for minor face flaws.</li>
            <li> First, shipping was about two weeks, which was what I expected.</li>
            <li> Especially considering that I forked over a Ben Franklin for this cheaply made little doohickey.</li>
            <li> I love this little machine will continue to leave results!!!</li>
            <li> Received this product quickly, have been using a few months with no noticeable difference.</li>
            <li> I noticed a difference in my slightly sagging neck skin immediately with the first treatment ( I am 62 years old ).</li>
            <li> Read the directions carefully if you really want this to work.</li>
            <li> It no longer heated up or lit up and barely produced heat.</li>
            <li> I hope I did not damage my lymph nodes as others say on Professional Thermage reviews because I passed this machine over my nodes without knowing the possible effects.</li>
            <li> It is clear that a non native English speaker tried to create the directions and quite honestly I had to turn to the reviews section for this product to even get a vague idea of how to use this device.</li>
            <li> I think this is probably a much less powerful version of ematrix; but those treatments will likely cost you about $1,000 a pop at a derm or med-spa.</li>
            <li> I have to find out how long it can go without needing a new head but</li>
            <li> My skin looks smoother and less saggy right after treatment, but doesn&#x27;t last.</li>
            <li> So I won&#x27;t really notice any real collagen regeneration results for at least a month.</li>
            <li> They are written in english but clearly by someone who speaks little to no english which isn&#x27;t a crime, but omg, it&#x27;s the right of consumer to be given the ability to properly use the items they purchase and the responsibility of the seller to provide them with that ability.</li>
            <li> I however keep noticing changes, for instance my previously discrete marionette lines are now evident and deep.</li>
            <li> I use it on the highest level and barely feel any heat, only around the eyes do I feel it.</li>
            <li> i am a seventy-one year  old woman who wants to remove or try to some small crows feet around my eyes and some sagging skin around my chin area.</li>
            <li> What I have found is that if one holds the head in one place, as mentioned in other reviews, for a second or two while pressing firmly, the results are quite quick.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think the device looks cheap just a little plain, but for the price what do you expect to get???  </li>
            <li> I got this little device after reading decent reviews.</li>
            <li> If you have sensitive skin, or use drugstore products with low levels of active ingredients, your skin may take longer to recover from a treatment, so keep that in mind.</li>
            <li> Weather to use it anticlockwise / clockwise , or use pressure for few seconds on a particular part ...</li>
            <li> The charge lasts long enough but you do need a lot of patience and keeping up with it.</li>
            <li> but you dont feel any/much heat unless the treatment head is left in an area too long....</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t had it long enough to speak on long term results</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t used it long enough to make a stronger statement but so far it does seem to appear it has tightened a little in the neck area and jawline.  </li>
            <li> I would not normally be writing a review  with such infrequent usage, but I wanted to share a discovery.    </li>
            <li> Some other reviewers wrote of the device leaving red dots on their faces, and I think that is the reason why, overuse and low quality products that don&#x27;t help the skin heal</li>
            <li> Doctors are not sure the fat melting is reversible and so far I have not seen any improvement after daily use of skin nutritional quality products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Be careful when using it--you may think nothing is happening, and the next day you are \\&quot;sunburned\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> 30 minutes seems like a long time</li>
            <li> Anyway, I&#x27;ve wanted to try Thermage for a long time now since my aunts, mom and cousins swear by it.</li>
            <li> Instructions were not clear with the manual ...</li>
            <li> It barely turns on, much less is beneficial for my skin.</li>
            <li> however, this was likely due to a &amp;#</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it several times, and as other reviewers have said, it takes time to see results.</li>
            <li> I only use it once every other week</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve also discovered that I can combine peels and other modalities with this, as I use LED in all my facial treatments to hasten healing of the skin.  </li>
            <li> I have only been using the devise for a few weeks and with themage, the results will take a few weeks to be completely observed.  </li>
            <li> but I can tell a difference in the lines in my face and the loose skin on my chin.</li>
            <li> In a week, I have got the operation procedure down pat, and even wrote a set of directions and sent them to George to help out future clients.</li>
            <li> I actually find it relaxing to use now that I have found the proper amount of water based contact gel for me, very little stinging.  </li>
            <li> If left on the skin too long it can burn you and I&#x27;ve burned myself a few times, not</li>
            <li> I received this in the mail about a week and a half ago, and I see results from the several times I have already used it.  </li>
            <li> I lost about 1/2 inch of volume, my face now looks long instead of round, my entire contour shrunk!!!</li>
            <li> If you follow their (extremely conservative) instructions it will take a long time to get results.  </li>
            <li> That&#x27;s how it is with all of these machines, from the least to the most expensive, your collagen still needs time to regenerate.</li>
            <li> Work into using it carefully, and be patient.</li>
            <li> BTW I am 41 and have no real wrinkles but age</li>
            <li> But the geek in me has been curious about this device for months.</li>
            <li> I have a feeling someone with some venture-capital money behind them could get this FDA-cleared, spruce up the marketing, and sell it for five-times as much.</li>
            <li> I carefully read all the reviews on this product and decided to buy it.  </li>
            <li> the guide was not very complete...did not say what gel or oil to use when using the machine...</li>
            <li> I have spent over 1500 on doctors, supplements and topicals trying to recover.</li>
            <li> like I expected from other reviews.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> of use, I have no positive results whatsoever.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t let the small size, low cost, and pink satin lined box distract you.</li>
            <li> At first I was skeptical when I bought this product</li>
            <li> used the machine twice with my usual facial serum</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;ve seen some of my other reviews, you know that I&#x27;m a product junkie.</li>
            <li> every other day for over a month saw ZERO results.</li>
            <li> (like other reviewers I did not feel any heat)  </li>
            <li> (like other reviewers I did not feel any heat)  </li>
            <li> I tried to think of what I had done differently in the past month.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had exilis a few times and other than the size of the area that can be treated by the device head there is not much difference in feeling.....</li>
            <li> did a few treatment on my husband, who is usually a sceptic about such things.</li>
            <li> In a week, the puckery wrinkles above my thyroid surgery scar, caused by the stretching of the skin by my swollen thyroid (been like this since late 2011) has almost vanished.</li>
            <li> I started using it in late May, 2014, and believe I am starting to see results.  </li>
            <li> I have actual wrinkles and this did not lessen them in the least.</li>
            <li> Not worth it.</li>
            <li> As a licensed aesthetician I have always been pro-active with anti-aging and understand the technology behind Thermage as well as the expense of professional Thermage</li>
            <li> The day I received the DM, the price went down.</li>
            <li> I have spent 700 trying to repair what it did to me!!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really not a quick fix</li>
            <li> Pictures are less than a month apart.&lt;br</li>
            <li> This little piece of anti-aging equipment packs a punch.</li>
            <li> but you do feel something is working because you feel a little burn.</li>
            <li> As an aesthetician I will say yes  a little burn pain</li>
            <li> For me, the treatments take a lot of time and effort (compared to microcurrent or microphototherapy, for example) and the treatment head scratches the face a little bit</li>
            <li> ; of lower skin layers, not collagen growth - the theory behind machines such as this is that they target lower levels - in effect damaging them, which causes collagen to regenerate in respond to the damaging or wounding of the lower hidden layer.</li>
            <li> If you are a man, the treatment head gets a little stuck on facial stubble and can be a bit irritating.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money....</li>
            <li> I wasted my time until I contacted Lisa Liao of Norlanya.&lt;br /&gt;She</li>
            <li> I made my conductivity gel with a 4 oz mix of aloe vera, green tea, and hyaluronic acid, plus 1/2- 1 teaspoon of himalayan salt.  </li>
            <li> I have not seen any results after using this product for a few months now.</li>
            <li> It was a waste of money because now I&#x27;m looking into getting something else to replace this machine.</li>
            <li> But as of now, it has been nothing but time consuming and it dried out my skin to the point it is peeling.</li>
            <li> get a conductor gel  works in like  few days if used  as protocal says.</li>
            <li> I do have very slight reddish spots</li>
            <li> The reviewer who mentioned they dermaroll first and then use this is crazy, or has thick, bionic skin.  </li>
            <li> It did not warm up and then would work for a few minutes and then stop working.</li>
            <li> I usually use it three days a week for around 10 min per area..</li>
            <li> (If you want an immediate fix, go with a micro-current machine; I&#x27;m not sure if micro-current stimulates collagen regeneration though, so you would have to keep up with</li>
            <li> but small amounts of tingling if that, and some redness.</li>
            <li> Allowed it to heat up on the areas but was not satisfied with the results.</li>
            <li> away from this Evil product that does exactly the opposite of what it promises!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Very disappointed with how long it took to get this product, how cheaply is was designed and how poorly it worked.</li>
            <li> Does not warm up at all.</li>
            <li> If it had, at least that would tell me its doing something...</li>
            <li> But collagen growth takes at least a month.</li>
            <li> I was told that I should wait at least three days before using again so the collagen in my face is stimulated and has time to surface.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used at least once per week, sometimes twice, and No Joke...</li>
            <li> The worst NIGHTMARE of my life!!!face now looks long instead of round, my entire contour shrunk!!!</li>
            <li> It is FAR less expensive and painful than cosmetic surgery.</li>
            <li> Anyhow, one of the areas that has subtly changed is the beginning of the chin &#x27;jowls.&#x27;  </li>
            <li> and I could not decipher the ridiculous nonsensical directions.    </li>
            <li> I googled back pain and Vitamin C, and was shocked.  </li>
            <li> and I feel like it made my neck worse Not better!</li>
            <li> /&gt;First off let me just say that the instructions for this item are VERY hard to understand.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, I&#x27;ve been using this product for a couple of months</li>
            <li> This procedure is not recommended in the instructions, is uncomfortable, and should not be repeated until the dermis has healed (a week or so).</li>
            <li> Sorry to say it did nothing for me.</li>
            <li> A little disappointed!</li>
            <li> but I was very skeptical.  </li>
            <li> Also, the included directions are IMPOSSIBLE TO UNDERSTAND.</li>
            <li> I have not seen any results : (</li>
            <li> I am very unhappy with this purchase.</li>
            <li> Vendor from China, very badly made.  </li>
            <li> Very Disappointed!!</li>
            <li> I just hope this is the worst of the damage</li>
            <li> but as I read on one blog, the worst may take months to show!!!</li>
            <li> /&gt;This is the WORST product I have ever purchased with DEVASTATING effects on my looks and skin.</li>
            <li> The worst part is I did not feel anything!!!!</li>
            <li> The worst part is I did not feel anything!!!!</li>
            <li> The worst NIGHTMARE of my life!!!</li>

    <ol>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money. Used it for months with no results.</li>
            <li> I ordered this product and it was defective from the beginning. It did not warm up and then would work for a few minutes and then stop working. I wish I had read all the reviews before spending the money on this item. Contacted the seller and they would not replace the unit or refund the purchase price.  Don&#x27;t bother purchasing this item.Save your money!</li>
            <li> I bought this item in Dec.&#x27;14 and now 4 months later it stopped working. And now they won&#x27;t let me return or replace?</li>
            <li> Really love this device.</li>
            <li> Makes my skin feel smooth,</li>
            <li> This little piece of anti-aging equipment packs a punch. I am an Esthetician and have many devices in my armory, including microcurrent, which I use daily. I noticed a difference in my slightly sagging neck skin immediately with the first treatment ( I am 62 years old ). I am now using the High setting in most areas.&lt;br /&gt;I did a few treatment on my husband, who is usually a sceptic about such things. He has been noticeably pleased with the results. When you work on another person, you must make contact with their skin with the hand not holding the machine in order to complete the circuit and get the red light on. This indicates the machine is working.&lt;br /&gt;Very pleased with my purchase.</li>
            <li> Very Disappointed!! I&#x27;ve been using it for about a month and I feel like it made my neck worse Not better! Don&#x27;t waste your money....</li>
            <li> Does not warm up at all. I read the reviews and took a chance!</li>
            <li> The 5 stars are given for the great customer service.  I received my dot matrix and used it once a week.&lt;br /&gt;I followed Christine Byer&#x27;s instuctions.  But I never felt the heat no matter what serum I used.  I wasted my time until I contacted Lisa Liao of Norlanya.&lt;br /&gt;She gave me several options.  I chose to have her send me another dot matrix head.  It took 7 business days from the time it was shipped to arrive.&lt;br /&gt;Ahh, this head emitted wonderful heat!  I made my conductivity gel with a 4 oz mix of aloe vera, green tea, and hyaluronic acid, plus 1/2- 1 teaspoon of himalayan salt.  I used an artist&#x27;s fan brush to apply to one section at a time.  I will update in a month with my progress.&lt;br /&gt;One thing that Lisa Liao did mention is that you&#x27;re not supposed to put a lot of pressure against the skin because this might damage the head.</li>
            <li> Product worked very well at first but quit within a 3-4 weeks of purchase. The seller informed me that I could purchase parts from them to fix it but it was cheaper to just throw it away and take a loss.</li>
            <li> i hope this product does what it claims to do. i am a seventy-one year  old woman who wants to remove or try to some small crows feet around my eyes and some sagging skin around my chin area. so because the price was good i thought i would try it out. if it does the job i may purchase the more expensive product you sell on amazon.</li>
            <li> the product does not heat. I do not see any change in my skin. I lost my money. I do not recommend it. maria</li>
            <li> I have not seen any results after using this product for a few months now. If left on the skin too long it can burn you and I&#x27;ve burned myself a few times, not fun. It was a waste of money because now I&#x27;m looking into getting something else to replace this machine.</li>
            <li> I have only been using the devise for a few weeks and with themage, the results will take a few weeks to be completely observed.  I like it so far. I am working on my sagging jowls and jawline so it may take awhile.  I do have some questions and need to contact the company.  I am a licensed esthetician and have knowledge of the muscle and bone structure of the face.  I am not sure someone without any knowledge would get the most benefit from this machine.</li>
            <li> I have used frequency generators for other uses successfully but this one didn&#x27;t work for me.</li>
            <li> arrived not working. Took some time and persistence to get a new head. Can&#x27;t really tell any difference</li>
            <li> This mini machine really works &amp; I really like it. I hope they can make a bigger machine so I can use it for my body.</li>
            <li> This device is obviously not for sale in the US for a reason--it works, and no plastic surgeon would want that. It is a step above my dermawand, which is really useful for minor face flaws. This DM device was beautifully packaged, and easy to put together. However, the directions needed to be written in a font larger than a 2, and in English. I have no use for the enclosed set that is written in Chinese, from the manufacturer. As a result, I had problems using the device. George worked along with me via email, answering me promptly; and was very patient with me as I figured out how to get the desired results from the device--even resorting to using one himself to answer my questions. In a week, I have got the operation procedure down pat, and even wrote a set of directions and sent them to George to help out future clients. The day I received the DM, the price went down. George agreed that I could have the $20 refund or a replacement DM head, and I chose the latter, which he is sending me. In a week, the puckery wrinkles above my thyroid surgery scar, caused by the stretching of the skin by my swollen thyroid (been like this since late 2011) has almost vanished. That is in one week. Be careful when using it--you may think nothing is happening, and the next day you are \\&quot;sunburned\\&quot;. Work into using it carefully, and be patient. Thanks!</li>
            <li> I love this device.  I have already seen improvement as surprising as that seems.  The representative, Lisa , was enormously helpful and I felt prepared to use.  I&#x27;ve already recommended it to a friend</li>
            <li> this device is amazing, I have tried several things like this but have to agree as an expert in&lt;br /&gt;the skin field , I love this!  I have to find out how long it can go without needing a new head but&lt;br /&gt;I love it just the same!  thanks for great service and quick shipping.&lt;br /&gt;carolyn a</li>
            <li> I personally like this. My skin is smoother overall after three months of use</li>
            <li> I have other devices that work better. It is acceptable but not my go to equipment when trying to achieve thermage or fraxel.</li>
            <li> I have not seen any results : (</li>
            <li> Great product, great seller !!!</li>
            <li> Others interested in looking better for reasonable$$and effort&lt;br /&gt;Glad I tried it !  Takes a cumulative effort. . No overbite  story.  More like do some every few days.  Nice.&lt;br /&gt;Mbowley</li>
            <li> This is my first review and its to soon to say if this works but people are rushing to judgment far to soon.  If yours doesn&#x27;t work talk to your seller as you may have received a defective device.  I was and am very excited to receive this item.  I have been watching reviews and notice some are having issues.  Maybe they aren&#x27;t using the conductive gel.( I noticed if I go to a spot with out the gel I don&#x27;t feel to much)  I bought my gel first and then the product and it seems to get warm/hot just fine. I have only tried the low and med setting.  I just received mine today charged it and was good to go.  Again since this is my first day I cant give a proper review just yet but will update later for sure if I can figure out how to update lol.  I do have very slight reddish spots but that&#x27;s good so far as I know its doing something.  I don&#x27;t think the device looks cheap just a little plain, but for the price what do you expect to get???  My instructions are perfect and in English and I have no problem with them.  I just felt I had to write something to let people know don&#x27;t be discouraged just yet.  Reviews are important for me and so far I am glad I seen the good ones before the latest bad reviews.  I HAVE HOPE.  BTW I am 41 and have no real wrinkles but age is definitely taking its tow just need some tightening and would be nice to get rid of some freckles but I don&#x27;t think this will help that.</li>
            <li> Jury still out on this. This seems to take a lot of time that it appears I just don&#x27;t have. It&#x27;s easy to use and there are many helpful, professional videos out there for this specific product. I&#x27;m looking forward to when the technology progresses to a booth you can step into and have the entire body zapped all at once. Looking for instant gratification in this regard.</li>
            <li> the product came in a nice box. the product itself looks cheap and I am not sure if worth the money I will not recommend this to a friend</li>
            <li> jury&#x27;s still out - in all fairness I haven&#x27;t used it enough to give a review.  30 minutes seems like a long time and I need to get into a routine.  I will check back after a fair amount of usage.  I did take a before picture which I will post which an after photo once I use it for awhile.</li>
            <li> Of course this isn&#x27;t going to give you the same look as a spa laser treatment. My skin looks smoother and less saggy right after treatment, but doesn&#x27;t last. For the cost and realistic expectation, I would recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I love this, im treating my strech marks with it and my husband age lines and I can see the difference,  I usually use it three days a week for around 10 min per area..this machine really works!</li>
            <li> Omg just used this! Its awesome it gets hot my face looks better a little lifted love it!!! I received it right on time I didn&#x27;t have conduit gel so I used aloe vera  gel it works. I love this little machine will continue to leave results!!!</li>
            <li> Couldn&#x27;t feel the appropriate amount if heat on the face ... Instructions were not clear with the manual ... Weather to use it anticlockwise / clockwise , or use pressure for few seconds on a particular part ...</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t had it long enough to speak on long term results but I am impressed so far. It got rid of the under eye puffs from my allergies. Professional but pretty packaging. Easy to read english translated manual. I use with clear ultrasound gel. I am ordering another for use on clients.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, I&#x27;ve been using this product for a couple of months and I see no difference. I use it on the highest level and barely feel any heat, only around the eyes do I feel it. A little disappointed!</li>
            <li> Bought this from Maya beauty..I can not see how this unit could do anything anti aging.....It did not get hot or leave my face red..If it had, at least that would tell me its doing something...It was barely warm.Maybe it was defective....I returned for a full refund and George was nice and refunded my return shipping also.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have  read that many people get paid to leave reviews on Amazon so it makes me wonder if THESE reviews are all true.Not alot you can trust anymore these days.</li>
            <li> First, shipping was about two weeks, which was what I expected. It does come nicely packaged, and the instructions are in English. The translation into English isn&#x27;t very good, but serviceable. The device doesn&#x27;t look or feel cheap, but again, serviceable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used ultrasound gel with this, which I think you must use (ultrasound gel can be had for about $10 for two big bottles on Amazon). After the first treatment on my hands, my hands looked much lighter, the same thing with my face, so that it seemed sun damage was being reversed. The machine WILL get hot if you hold it one place. At certain times, I had to move it because it hurt too much - which is good, because I know it&#x27;s doing something. I did notice tightening - however, this was likely due to a &amp;#34;plumping up&amp;#34; of lower skin layers, not collagen growth - the theory behind machines such as this is that they target lower levels - in effect damaging them, which causes collagen to regenerate in respond to the damaging or wounding of the lower hidden layer. The machine is designed to target lower skin layers, not the upper skin layer that you see - avoiding unsightly damage that you would get with a laser or deep chemical peel. But collagen growth takes at least a month. That&#x27;s how it is with all of these machines, from the least to the most expensive, your collagen still needs time to regenerate. So I won&#x27;t really notice any real collagen regeneration results for at least a month. (If you want an immediate fix, go with a micro-current machine; I&#x27;m not sure if micro-current stimulates collagen regeneration though, so you would have to keep up with micro-current.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That said, I&#x27;m pretty pleased. I think this is probably a much less powerful version of ematrix; but those treatments will likely cost you about $1,000 a pop at a derm or med-spa. I plan on using this device for about 40 minutes once a week, and will try to update my results. My face is in pretty good shape already, because I use sunscreen and retin-a religiously. But the geek in me has been curious about this device for months. I have a feeling someone with some venture-capital money behind them could get this FDA-cleared, spruce up the marketing, and sell it for five-times as much. Wish it were me, because I think this has a lot of potential.</li>
            <li> I carefully read all the reviews on this product and decided to buy it.  I started using it in late May, 2014, and believe I am starting to see results.  The vendor very kindly emailed me to tell me not to use it so frequently (use about twice a week) based upon some comments I had made and thank you!  I was told that I should wait at least three days before using again so the collagen in my face is stimulated and has time to surface.  I am very impatient and thought the more I used it, the quicker the results.  Anyhow, one of the areas that has subtly changed is the beginning of the chin &#x27;jowls.&#x27;  I cannot see them anymore!  Also, my guess is I am tending to focus more on the wrinkle located on the lower left side that starts at my lip and ends at the jaw.  I can see a difference there, too.  I have not told my husband nor friends; I am hoping they will notice soon.  If you are willing to be vigilant and patient, go for this product.  It is FAR less expensive and painful than cosmetic surgery.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t let the small size, low cost, and pink satin lined box distract you. This unit is all business. What I have found is that if one holds the head in one place, as mentioned in other reviews, for a second or two while pressing firmly, the results are quite quick. This procedure is not recommended in the instructions, is uncomfortable, and should not be repeated until the dermis has healed (a week or so). I found significant improvement with one 2-minute treatment in the maxilla &amp; mandible area that is comparable to professional fractional laser. Of course professional Esthetician treatments are better, safer, and more comfortable.</li>
            <li> Great product, fast shipping.</li>
            <li> I really haven&#x27;t seen remarkable results but then again, I haven&#x27;t used on a regular basis.</li>
            <li> At first I was skeptical when I bought this product but it&#x27;s been about three months now and using it as directed two times a week I have noticed some results. The only con about this is, ofcourse it&#x27;s not as strong as one from a professional place but you do feel something is working because you feel a little burn. The charge lasts long enough but you do need a lot of patience and keeping up with it. Results are showing slowly but surely. I&#x27;m glad I bought it!!</li>
            <li> I purchased this machine after reading all the excellent reviews but I was very skeptical.  I was lucky enough to receive my instructions in English &amp; Lisa also contacted me &amp; sent me the instructions, they provide excellent customer service.  I had a sebaceous cyst removed from my right cheek last year &amp; my surgeon to her credit did a wonderful job &amp; I have been diligent in making sure that there is only the smallest trace of a scar.  Even after my first use the next day my skin felt tighter &amp; it looked like I was wearing foundation.  I have now used it 4 times &amp; I can&#x27;t even see where the incision was made on my face.  You do need a conductive gel for it to work &amp; you may think that nothing is happening but it works.  I am so happy with my purchase that when I next see my surgeon I am taking this machine with me to show her.</li>
            <li> 1 of my favorite things in the world right now. When you get older you have to bump up your skin care routine from just getting products at Rite Aid. I use this all the time. I see it helping my face already and I haven.t even had it a month. I really concentrate on my lines between my eyebrows, my elevens :) this device really helps smooth them out. I love it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it several times, and as other reviewers have said, it takes time to see results. I will wait patiently and continue using it. But as of now, it has been nothing but time consuming and it dried out my skin to the point it is peeling. I only use it once every other week and I did use the aquasonic ultrasound gel sold here on amazon.    Also, the included directions are IMPOSSIBLE TO UNDERSTAND. It is clear that a non native English speaker tried to create the directions and quite honestly I had to turn to the reviews section for this product to even get a vague idea of how to use this device. Unacceptable.  I see that one reviewer claims he rewrote their directions in conversational English. All I can say is, send those out! I am a communicator and writer by trade and I could not decipher the ridiculous nonsensical directions.    So really, I have no idea how the product works because I don&#x27;t know it I am using it correctly and have ended up with only dry skin, much like you have after a light chemical peel. This could be the most amazing dot matrix home device on the planet, but if you don&#x27;t know how to use it, it really doesn&#x27;t matter. My advice, do not buy this unless they edit their directions.</li>
            <li> Takes a while to see results but worth it. Read the directions carefully if you really want this to work. The gel, liquid or water based lotion is the key to feeling the heat and getting results</li>
            <li> I think the reason it works on some and not others is that the device needs a foundation.  In other words, if you&#x27;ve already had an Ultherapy treatment or a Fraxel treatment, your skin has the foundation upon which to have great results.  I&#x27;m very pleased with this little gadget!</li>
            <li> Have been using for just over two weeks and can already see results.  I actually find it relaxing to use now that I have found the proper amount of water based contact gel for me, very little stinging.  Purchased through Amazon from  NORLANYA, delivered very fast.  I did contact them about an issued, it was addressed very quickly.  So I give them five stars for a great product and also excellent customer service.</li>
            <li> I am very displeased with this product. It barely turns on, much less is beneficial for my skin. Now I can&#x27;t even return it. I am very unhappy with this purchase.</li>
            <li> This is garbage.....the heat just dries out your skin and gives MORE wrinkles...Useless product don&#x27;t know where they got all those good reviews from must be their own.</li>
            <li> As an aesthetician I will say yes  a little burn pain but if set at 2nd mode ok  eyes use mode 1  get a conductor gel  works in like  few days if used  as protocal says. The shipper /sellar is awesome  great contact and  you may trust this company.. julie</li>
            <li> Sorry to say it did nothing for me.I&#x27;ve been using it for a while now and haven&#x27;t seen any improvement. The device doesn&#x27;t  even get Lukewarm and I can only feel some warmth on the highest setting around my eyes.</li>
            <li> I have used this faithfully and I see NO CHANGE</li>
            <li> Sent me a Chinese instruction guide so I need to write them to email me an English translation of the guide...the guide was not very complete...did not say what gel or oil to use when using the machine...no mention also of how frequently do I need to use it to maximize its effect....used the machine twice with my usual facial serum and I guess it gave my skin a better glow ...</li>
            <li> love this product. can see a difference with regular use</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve received my product in good time and condition.  Product works as stated and seller has been prompt in her response.&lt;br /&gt;As for result,  I&#x27;ve not seen significant improvement yet but I believe results take time.</li>
            <li> Very impressive potent mini device. I actually skip the conductive gel and instead I use a coton soaked with a specific toner to keep the skin moist while using the device. I find it to work better for me. Results are progressive and consistency is key. It&#x27;s really not a quick fix but if you are patient enough the results are amazing. Expect 6-8 months . Love it.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t work so well. Not so well made. There are better products.</li>
            <li> I really don&#x27;t notice any difference, been 3 weeks</li>
            <li> Way too time consuning to use, so not worth it, packaged well, good instructions, but, who has timecto hold againsnt every perceived line???</li>
            <li> it hurts the skin and does nothing. it is wast of time and money</li>
            <li> After 4 mos. of use, I have no positive results whatsoever. I&#x27;ve used at least once per week, sometimes twice, and No Joke...I have MORE lines than when I started! I&#x27;ve followed the instructions, and this item just doesn&#x27;t work. Maybe useful if you&#x27;re under 40 with just a few, light lines. I have actual wrinkles and this did not lessen them in the least. Save your money and go see your dermatologist....</li>
            <li> I have to say that this machine was packaged very nice, however the machine does not get hot enough and I have not been able to really feel much of anything but small amounts of tingling if that, and some redness. I had a dermatologist P.A. look at the machine and she stated that the machine does not get to the correct temp to actually stimulate collagen production. She also looked at the reviews and felt that they were sent from the company owners or employees to bust sales. I would not recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I broke in red dots that actually hurt. Used it twice and did not see any improvement whatsoever. I used the water based conductor. Allowed it to heat up on the areas but was not satisfied with the results.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very hsppy with the miniportable, anti again,i used one a wk.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;ve seen some of my other reviews, you know that I&#x27;m a product junkie. I purchase many things from Bliss, The Skin Store and Amazon on a constant basis. I do however find that I get better pricing on products on Amazon when I do locate them here. Anyway, I&#x27;ve wanted to try Thermage for a long time now since my aunts, mom and cousins swear by it. I just wanted to be able to do it at my own convenience. When I saw this, I thought it was really cheap for a device of it&#x27;s type but bit the bullet and ordered. First of all, it does not come with English instructions but the seller was sweet enough to send them to me after I contacted them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You need to use a conductor gel in order for this to work. You can use any of the device serums or gels found here on amazon. I&#x27;ve used it 2 times a week for a month and really can see why women go gaga over this thing. It really works but you have to be patient if you have &#x27;real&amp;#34; wrinkles and saggy skin. Those of us using it as preventative will see results almost immediately however. It&#x27;s simply an amazing machine for the price and I love how it holds a charge for a long time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Make sure you use the low setting when you first begin or the Medium and High may cause redness and bumps. Those do go away quickly however if it does occur.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used it but 2 times but I can tell a difference in the lines in my face and the loose skin on my chin.</li>
            <li> Vendor from China, very badly made.  Need to return it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had exilis a few times and other than the size of the area that can be treated by the device head there is not much difference in feeling.....exilis gets VERY HOT but you dont feel any/much heat unless the treatment head is left in an area too long....exilis worked and i feel that i will get similar results with this much cheaper option</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t used it long enough to make a stronger statement but so far it does seem to appear it has tightened a little in the neck area and jawline.  I will give another report later.  I requested instructions in English but it&#x27;s only basic.  I was told start off using low to medium RF for 20 minutes at a time.</li>
            <li> Received this product quickly, have been using a few months with no noticeable difference. It may just take me longer to see results.</li>
            <li> Works good. I think if you use it frequently you will see results over time.</li>
            <li> Works wonderfully on face,  too small for body parts</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t even make my face red or hot. How is this supposed to tighten skin then? Been using every night for two weeks. Going to return item. Not worth it. Glad I can return it</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t tell that this is working at all. I will have to give it more time.</li>
            <li> To soon to tell if its working for me.</li>
            <li> My first product didn&#x27;t work but I was so lucky to have a kind and attentive vendor. Your skin must be moisturized or hold some moisture for it to work. The high setting is strong for the eyes a medium to low works well.</li>
            <li> Was very excited to get this product but after two uses it was defective. It no longer heated up or lit up and barely produced heat. Good luck contacting customer service. After 3 attempts, I have not received one word from them. Very disappointed with how long it took to get this product, how cheaply is was designed and how poorly it worked. Not to mention the non existant customer service. Save yourself some money, there are better products on the market!</li>
            <li> Excellent in all aspects.</li>
            <li> Purchased after reading Amazon reviews. Will be 43 this year and just now starting to notice some loss of firmness in my lower face and neck. As a licensed aesthetician I have always been pro-active with anti-aging and understand the technology behind Thermage as well as the expense of professional Thermage treatments($2500!).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First off let me just say that the instructions for this item are VERY hard to understand. They are written in english but clearly by someone who speaks little to no english which isn&#x27;t a crime, but omg, it&#x27;s the right of consumer to be given the ability to properly use the items they purchase and the responsibility of the seller to provide them with that ability. Especially considering that I forked over a Ben Franklin for this cheaply made little doohickey. Contacted the seller about the instructions and they were zero help although a couple of the reviews raved about their customer service. Hmm...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Used every other day for over a month saw ZERO results. No flushing( it barely got warm) like I expected from other reviews.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My advice...skip it and the frustration it delivers.</li>
            <li> great product and the transaction was excellent.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a 37 year old who is OCD, and always has ben about taking care of her skin.  I read the reviews on this product and decided to give it a try... and very happy I did.  I received this in the mail about a week and a half ago, and I see results from the several times I have already used it.  Skin tightening, pore reduction, wrinkle reduction and just an overall better appearance to the skin in my face.  I have an area of concern and that is under my eyes where I tend to have stubborn fine lines that I have treated with fillers and injections, and now this, and this has helped smooth them out.  I have also used this in conjunction with my derma roller, derma roll first then use this and it becomes even more effective... love it!! Just like everything if you want to see results you must be consistent, and spend the right amount of time in order to achieve results.  This review would not be complete without mentioning the superb and excellent customer service I received from seller &amp;#34;NORLANYA&amp;#34;.  Both before and upon receiving this item I emailed her several times with questions, she promptly answered all my questions and was very helpful, I would highly recommend this product for anyone who is interested in keeping their skin looking youthful.</li>
            <li> I got this little device after reading decent reviews. Used the device 3 times on the lowest setting and for seconds. The first day I noticed pore reduction so I was very pleased. The second day I used all over the face again and the third day over the neck. I started seeing changes I not only dislike but they make me look older, incredibly older 5-10 years !!! My cheeks appear to be flattened (like ironed), my facial features are changing. I stopped using the device 5 days ago. I however keep noticing changes, for instance my previously discrete marionette lines are now evident and deep. I just hope this is the worst of the damage but as I read on one blog, the worst may take months to show!!! I hope I did not damage my lymph nodes as others say on Professional Thermage reviews because I passed this machine over my nodes without knowing the possible effects. If anyone can share how to stop these adverse effects please contact me. I&#x27;m very scared and desperate!!!!&lt;br /&gt;Stay away from this Evil product that does exactly the opposite of what it promises!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update:&lt;br /&gt;It has been a bit more than a month since I used this machine. I have spent 700 trying to repair what it did to me!! Doctors are not sure the fat melting is reversible and so far I have not seen any improvement after daily use of skin nutritional quality products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is the WORST product I have ever purchased with DEVASTATING effects on my looks and skin. This  product should not be in the market!!!&lt;br /&gt;Before and after pictures attached showing the damage. The melting continued for over 20 days after use. Pictures are less than a month apart.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update:&lt;br /&gt;It has been almost 3 months since I used this machine, no improvement yet. I have spent over 1500 on doctors, supplements and topicals trying to recover. This machine burnt collagen and a lot of fat. I was lucky I did not pass over my eyes. My neck now looks like a 60 year old. I lost about 1/2 inch of volume, my face now looks long instead of round, my entire contour shrunk!!! I got deep scar like tissues on my forehead and neck.  The worst part is I did not feel anything!!!! I even thought it was not working (like other reviewers I did not feel any heat)  It FRIED my face. Doctors already quoted 5K for fat grafting and 4800 for fillers. The worst NIGHTMARE of my life!!!face now looks long instead of round, my entire contour shrunk!!!

            <li> 8/20/14  My video review:  http://youtu.be/ykGwa5u0JKc&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ok, I&#x27;ve been an Esthetician for 15 years (google me) and I have to say this machine is just ok.  I did see some tightening under the chin but you have to leave it in one spot until you can&#x27;t stand the heat anymore and then move to the next spot.  I feel I get better lifting with microcurrent. The treatments I do to my skin with this machine are hardcore, 40 mins to an hour on high, sometimes longer.  I really thought it would lift more, but it doesn&#x27;t.  I guess for the price it is ok. I bought this product because of the good reviews. For me, the treatments take a lot of time and effort (compared to microcurrent or microphototherapy, for example) and the treatment head scratches the face a little bit so you can&#x27;t really do a peel before or you would really sensitize the skin.  The reviewer who mentioned they dermaroll first and then use this is crazy, or has thick, bionic skin.  No way I would do that to a client. If you are a man, the treatment head gets a little stuck on facial stubble and can be a bit irritating.  Be aware that this machine can work but it takes a lot of time and effort.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE:  This is my new favorite tool. It does work but don&#x27;t look for results for about a month.  Some with significantly sagging skin may see a result quicker but it took a month for me. If you follow their (extremely conservative) instructions it will take a long time to get results.  You have to leave it in one spot until you really feel the heat., then move on. I&#x27;ve also discovered that I can combine peels and other modalities with this, as I use LED in all my facial treatments to hasten healing of the skin.  If you have sensitive skin, or use drugstore products with low levels of active ingredients, your skin may take longer to recover from a treatment, so keep that in mind. Some other reviewers wrote of the device leaving red dots on their faces, and I think that is the reason why, overuse and low quality products that don&#x27;t help the skin heal quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, this device is a keeper!w quality products that don&#x27;t help the skin heal quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, this device is a keeper!</li>
            <li> Works but takes 4 -6 weeks to start seeing the results.  I use it 3 times a week on med. The first week I used low setting.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m giving this five stars..  I got it in August of  2014, and starting just a month later, I lost two family members and two friends, so I would have to say my use has been derailed.  Several months after I stopped using it I thought those hills and valleys under my lips were a bit smoother.  The instructions did say that it took a while for results to show.  I would not normally be writing a review  with such infrequent usage, but I wanted to share a discovery.    I had eye surgery Feb 3.  The eye doctor wanted me to \\&quot;eat bananas and take 500-1000 milligrams of vitamin c the week before surgery and afterwards.\\&quot;  Well, I started taking the C and didn&#x27;t  stop.  A few days ago I realized that my chronic back pain had greatly lessened.  I tried to think of what I had done differently in the past month.  The answer was Vitamin C.  I googled back pain and Vitamin C, and was shocked.  Vitamin C promotes collagen growth, and helps repair those discs in your spine.  I&#x27;ve never had such great results with taking something for such a short time.  The only side effect has been really really yellow P.  Here is a link I found:  http://www.doctoryourself.com/stenosis.html     I wondered if taking lots of C while using the Mini Dot Matrix would accelerate the formation of collagen.  I am about to start an experiment with large amounts of C and the Dot Matrix.  If anyone wants to join me, please posts your results in the comments section. I will be taking 1000 mg of C per day.  I will probably wait several months or whenever I see some change to update my review.    Back to the Dot Matrix...I can also say that mine is sturdy, works well, is still working.  I use Trader Joe&#x27;s Aloe Vera Gel, which does not make me break out.</li>
