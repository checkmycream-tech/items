            <li> I pierced my ears with this needle a few months ago so that I could begin stretching. It worked exactly as I needed it to. This sure beats spending $50-$80 for a professional to do it.</li>
            <li> I got this product to pierce a friends lip and of course it worked. I liked the cheap availability of this product and that it is sterilized before it comes so no tampering. I also like how when it arrived it had toppers on the end so that the needles wouldn&#x27;t pierce the bag. All in all a very good product.</li>
            <li> Came fast, looks just like the picture, and clean too! Pieced my own lip and worked great! Just hurt a lot. :0</li>
            <li> Worked awesome. Came in sanitary package and I still sanitized it anyway. I&#x27;ve had my piercing almost 2 months now. No problems.</li>
            <li> I loved this piercing needle. I used it to pierce my navel, even though you&#x27;re suppose to pierce your navel with a 12g to put in a 14g belly button ring, this needle still works as well. The 12g needle just makes it easier for the belly button ring to go in. But other than that, it is a great product. OH!  And it even tells you when it expires, which is good. :)</li>
            <li> Good product, thank you for the reliable service.</li>
            <li> You get what you order! its exactly what i needed to pierce my lip with easy access to put it in</li>
            <li> It arrived all nicely sealed and protected perfectly. The needle works perfectly, slides in perfectly and slides out perfectly. Would recommend this company to others!!!</li>
            <li> This needle is great for piercing almost anything, I&#x27;ve done my lip, gauges, eyebrow, labrets with it. The needle claims single use but it can be multi use, after you&#x27;ve done your ears or lip or something soak the needle in alcohol for an hour, then rinse with warm water. My needle got bent by accident when I dropped it, I bent it back straight and it works just fine. Good quality!</li>
            <li> I used this needle to pierce my tongue, and it was so much easier than I expected it to be! It went through with minimal struggle, and it came in a sterile package. Both ends are hollow, so I could easily slip the jewelry into the bottom of it and pull it through to slide the barbell right in. Would purchase again!</li>
            <li> Wassnt that sharp at all once so ever .. hurt the person I was doing piercing on because wassnt that sharp</li>
            <li> Pierced my smiley with this. It goes through with ease, it comes inside an envelope, and I will be ordering another soon. :)</li>
            <li> Love this item! The shipping was amazingly fast, much quicker than expected and they were sealed individually in plastic. They were EXTREMELY sharp and made piercing my cartilage a breeze! And really quite painless. I highly recommend this product! : D&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Beck S.</li>
            <li> i used this needle to pierce my belly button. it was absolutely amazing! slid through so easily and painlessly. the tip is so sharp i didn&#x27;t feel a thing. i definately recommend this to anyone who is piercing themselves at home</li>
            <li> This needle was absolutely perfect! I was doing a painful piercing so it hurt badly, but this needle definitely lessened the pain! The packaging was perfect. 5/5 stars no doubt</li>
            <li> Fast shipping and great price for just one needle.</li>
            <li> Definitely what I wanted! And my boyfriend has just told me that he wants his lip pierced again, so I will be ordering from them again soon!</li>
            <li> I like the needle I ordered. I like when it came with something that covers the needle so it didn&#x27;t pierce the bag. I also like its sharpness cuz it lessen the pain when piercing. I got an industrial piercing last week with this needle. Thumb up!</li>
            <li> really fast . very very sharp . it went thru really quick. I have to say 5 star . I used it to redo my belly . I just did it &amp;I had to give it a great review</li>
            <li> arived after the estimated date in a regular envlope. Other than that the needle its self was good quality and didnt expire for a really long time. i would buy these again</li>
            <li> This needle pierced through my skin like a knife through butter. It didn&#x27;t hurt at all. And it shipped super quick. I love it!</li>

            <li> I was impressed with the needle, tri beveled and super sharp. The needle came in its own sterilized packet marked with what it was sterilized with and when it expires, had well over a year left until expiration. They arrived super fast well before expected date, however they came in a normal letter envelope...nothing was damaged but still. I gave this a 4 rating only because I seemed to bleed a super lot after piercing.could have been just me but seemed unusual because I never bleed after piercings. I would still highly recommend these needles and seller. Will be buying from them again for sure.</li>
            <li> Came before expected delivery date, yet my belly rings don&#x27;t fit inside the hollow hole.</li>

            <li> The needle was extremely sharp and sterile. I had a small issue with the shipment (the problem of the post office) and Arizona Tattoo and Piercing Supply went above and beyond to fix the issue.</li>
            <li> All i can say here is this was just what i needed and just the right price i thought so</li>
            <li> Product does what it&#x27;s supposed to. got  here early  and is very sharp. If you touch the tip it will go through your finger skin.</li>
            <li> My order didn&#x27;t go through the first time but then I emailed them and they sent me one almost immediately. I would recommend them to anybody.</li>
            <li> This was amazingggg! My friend used it to do her belly button and she could hardly feel it because it was sharp and went straight through with no problem!!! (I sterilized it and also did my double cartilage, it also worked great with that!)</li>
