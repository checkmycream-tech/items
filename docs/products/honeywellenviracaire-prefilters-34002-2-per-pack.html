    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> These generic brand(s) have the same in thickness as the available Honeywell version. Honeywell has changed to a \\&quot;Universal Replacement\\&quot; version for all it&#x27;s prefilters, and yes, they are (all) not as thick as they once were. I have recently used both Honewell and other manufacturer&#x27;s versions of this product, results seem the same for any maker. Thickness may not be the issue, read on to see why.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; The key seems to be the activated carbon component or lack thereof. Some of these prefilters seem almost non-effective to the point I&#x27;ve considered they might be just sprayed/colored black, and could be lacking (or highly under utilizing) any activated carbon. I am concerned about quality control here. The original filters were, at first, terrific, giving a thrilling improvement in my breathing. However, this result dissipated quickly, I suspect because of the surface area of the activated carbon being \\&quot;used up\\&quot; in having done it&#x27;s job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The \\&quot;Universal Replacement\\&quot; prefilters are less thick than the original prefilters, but increased thickness may not be the solution. I have tried doubling them. After a point, a certain thickness of the mesh prefilters is sufficient to collect particulates (dust, pollen, lint etc). The prefilter stops larger stuff, the inner, HEPA filter takes out smaller (specs say to .03 microns). But the porosity of the mesh prefilter must be balanced to let air come in while allowing an efficient quantity of air to come into contact with the activated carbon surface. Once the carbon is \\&quot;used up\\&quot; it is no longer effective. At that point the machine may still be filtering particulates, but no longer effects VOC&#x27;s and other things for which the activated carbon is useful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My solution is to change these prefilters very, very frequently (twice a week!). The prefilters have 2 jobs, but they cease to be usfull as active carbon components long before they stop being useful as larger particulate filters. It&#x27;s fairly easy to feel the results. New prefilter &#x3D; better breathing. I have reduced household contaminants/exposure. It&#x27;s unlikely that there is an unusual out-gassing problem in my home. I have had similar difficulties at multiple venues.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To clean the air, the air must contact the carbon (this is why the noisy fans, an entire review issue in itself, are be necessary). I&#x27;m now researching units containing much larger amounts of activated carbon (like Austin Air HealthMate). My concern is the surface area of the activated carbon. Despite having 17 pounds of carbon in them, once the surface area of the carbon becomes coated with the contaminantes it removes, new air just passes over. Will I need to have a truckload of the carbon beads/rocks in the garage? Could a stirring mechanism/some way to clean/recycle the carbon beads be added? I&#x27;d love constructive responses.ilter &#x3D; better breathing. I have reduced household contaminants/exposure. It&#x27;s unlikely that there is an unusual out-gassing problem in my home.

            <li> Confirmed observation by previous reviewer - not the same as a Honeywell-branded filter - about half as thick. Advertising a little misleading which does imply a \\&quot;Honeywell/Enviracaire\\&quot; prefilter. I am anticipating my HEPA filter will now clog more quickly unless I replace these about twice as often as I&#x27;m used to. The ad should not say \\&quot;Honeywell\\&quot; in it.</li>
            <li> they are a little thin , but seem to work just fine. I bought a few packs for this price.</li>
            <li> I bought a load of these. These filters are sized for the Honeywell 50250 air purifier, no cutting for height required! I did not expect that when I purchased them, and had only realized it when I received them and tried to install one. I was super happy. If this seller sticks around selling 2-pack filters, I will be buying more in the future.</li>
            <li> Until I found these and the replacement filter at Amazon, I know exactly where to order more when needed.  Item was packed well and arrived ahead of time.  Good job.</li>
            <li> Just what I needed to replace my old ones.</li>
            <li> It seems to be working just as I would have expected.</li>
            <li> Not the same as a Honeywell-branded filter&lt;br /&gt;Why are these filters so thin compared to the ones that I used to buy and where are the Velcro fasteners that are shown in the picture?&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll give them a try but will order elsewhere from now on.&lt;br /&gt;I am concerned that that the lifespan of the expensive inner filter will be compromised by these junky looking things.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Once again I wonder why Amazon even carries this item.</li>
            <li> We ordered two prefilters but only received one.</li>
            <li> Pre-filter exactly as previously purchased but at much better price.</li>
            <li> No problem with filter, good price</li>
            <li> Great for those who smoke indoors.</li>
            <li> good product for dust free and clean air, helps with my COPD</li>
            <li> No frills on this product. It&#x27;s just the filters and the Velcro tabs. But that&#x27;s ok. After all, who needs a plastic bag and hang tag, anyway? I just hope I remember what and where the second filter is - in three years when it&#x27;s time to change the filter again...</li>
            <li> Though I&#x27;d save money and buy these. They are about half as thick as the original charcoal prefilter, so I doubt they will do as an effective job or last as long as the originals.</li>
            <li> Good product. Shipping takes a long time.</li>
            <li> Good filters. Very pleased with company and service. I liked that you can cut the filters to whatever size you need. This feature makes this product quite versatile.</li>
            <li> The refilters work very well. I have bought generic filters in the past and they have not fit tight enough causing leaks to occur.&lt;br /&gt;These are the real McCoy and cover the hepa filter tight. Hope I can get another 2 years out of the hepfilter with replacing these prefilters every 6 months.</li>
            <li> The filters were sent on time and fit my machine. You can&#x27;t get too excited about filters but they did what they were intended to do.</li>
            <li> Just received in mail.  Installation was very easy.  Since this filter media was noticeably thinner than the original I did not even have to cut it to fit (it overlapped about 7inches, which I directed toward the wall our filter sits next to).  I wrapped the hepa filter snuggly and used the plastic clips to hold the end in place.  We have an old enviracaire 63500.  I cleaned the outer shell and installed the new outer filter; Everything fit like a charm.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Our air quality noticeably improved immediately upon installing this filter. These filters are carbon treated and made the air seem &amp;#34;alpine&amp;#34; fresh.  Having just installed it I do not yet know how long this filter will last.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Our HEPA filter has three settings, low, medium and high.  The unit runs quite loud even on the low setting.  We run our filter continously every day, turn it up to high at night, and only turn it off when we have company.  I am planning on replacing the this newly installed filter in 60 days at which time I will assess its longevity.  Ours is a harsh environment since the laudry room is a closet adjoining the room (LOT OF FINE LINT).  If I get 60 days out of this filter I will be satisfied.  If I am able to get longer life out these, even better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thus far I heartily recommend this filter as an economical replacement for an Enviracaire prefilter.</li>
            <li> Took 2 1/2 weeks to show up was missing velcro strips&lt;br /&gt;was the correct item , very unhappy, wont do this again.</li>
            <li> Fits my Honeywell Air Purifier perfectly.</li>
            <li> Shipped fast and was just as described.</li>
            <li> Not a popular product so I was very happy to find at the price offered. Have not installed yet (still have some life on my current one) but everything looks like an exact fit and of the same if not better quality than original.</li>
            <li> You just wrap this around the HEPA filter and you&#x27;re done. This filter is easy to install and essential in working with the HEPA filter.</li>
            <li> Was just what we needed for our air filter.  Thank You!!!</li>
            <li> the product works as advertised. it fit the filter well and it also has enough Velcro strip to hold it in place.</li>
