            <li>Try a better brand that give you more for your money.</li>
            <li>I guess I wasn&#x27;t sure what to expect</li>
            <li>I use it every day and works amazingly well and light weight.</li>
            <li>I may have fat arms, but nothing more than what this should have fit for its size!</li>
            <li>it does help you lose calorie by cloging the pores and making you sweat more during your workouts.</li>
            <li>It was cheap</li>
            <li>Didnt even fit right and didnt stay in place.</li>
            <li>;) !</li>
            <li>, it didn&#x27;t feel it would be effective with reducing the size of my upper arm.</li>
            <li>DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY!!!!</li>
            <li>Made very cheap...not worth the money,  Company was very accommodating and credited the money immediately.</li>

            <li>Your better off buying some knee-highs from Dollar Store, cut the foot off, and pull them up past your elbows.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t fit tight so it does nothing.</li>

            <li> Very cheap and doesnt do the job needed to shape your arms, and highly tight and uncomfortable.</li>

            <li> Didnt even fit right and didnt stay in place. Elastic was weak. Needs to be a lil bigger and thicker.</li>
            <li> DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY!!!!</li>
            <li> Very cheap and doesnt do the job needed to shape your arms, and highly tight and uncomfortable. Seems as if this could cause blood clots its so tight and wears off very quickly. Not worth it. Try a better brand that give you more for your money.</li>
            <li> These were pretty useless. I guess I wasn&#x27;t sure what to expect but I certainly would not suggest that anyone buy them.  They don&#x27;t cause you to sweat and are so tight they cut off the circulation of my arms. I never should have wasted the money.</li>
            <li> Serious waste of money! They aren&#x27;t for anyone with big arms because they roll down. I thought they would make the area of your arm sweat but it doesn&#x27;t. It&#x27;s just like a fancy dress sock on your arm.</li>
            <li> this is no good maybe if youe cold then use it but is not staying in your arms..</li>
            <li> i like this product i just got it so am new on this but so far.. good !!!! ;) !</li>
            <li> Not what I expected. It was cheap but I guess that&#x27;s what I get for ordering online. Its like wearing a scruchy stocking on your arm and its very itchy and annoying</li>
            <li> This product was terrible. It was merely a nylon stocking you put around your arm. It doesn&#x27;t fit tight so it does nothing. Don&#x27;t waste your money on this. I&#x27;m sorry I did.</li>
            <li> Served no purpose, they cut off my circulation, they were uncomfortable go figure. Not impressed. I wouldn&#x27;t waste my money.</li>
            <li> use the product with sweat cream and sauna suit for wi nter sweatout they do work  satisifed with the product</li>
            <li> Made very cheap...not worth the money,  Company was very accommodating and credited the money immediately.</li>
            <li> The product was similar to pantyhose fabric.  I purchased it to wear under t-shirts where the sleeve is too short.  I was hoping the product would help cover my large arms.  It didn&#x27;t help with that and due to the fabric, it didn&#x27;t feel it would be effective with reducing the size of my upper arm.</li>
            <li> Everything arrived on time undamaged and in perfect conditions I love this product. I am very satisfied with it. I use it every day and works amazingly well and light weight.</li>
            <li> Buyers beware.... Your better off buying some knee-highs from Dollar Store, cut the foot off, and pull them up past your elbows. Not worth price.  Product description very misleading.</li>
            <li> If it was possible, I would have given this a half star rating. I purchased this product hoping it would help slim my arms as I excercised throughout the day. It turns out, all they did were cut off my circulation and tug at my skin all day. My arms were red from the harsh compression. I may have fat arms, but nothing more than what this should have fit for its size! Didn&#x27;t help at all.</li>
            <li> IIt was Uncomfortable and the size was to small. It not for everybody ho need to slim their arms fast</li>
            <li> Horribleeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee!&lt;br /&gt;Hahahahahahaha.&lt;br /&gt;Hard to put on and when you get it... You want to get out because it hurts!&lt;br /&gt;Well, I don&#x27;t recommende because DOESN&#x27;T WORK IT.&lt;br /&gt;Now it&#x27;s up to you guys.</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this prouduct to anyone.  I wanted to loose weight.  Thought, yeah need help. NO help at all.</li>
            <li> it does help you lose calorie by cloging the pores and making you sweat more during your workouts. only bad side is that it some times roll down.</li>
            <li> I LIKE THE ARM SHAPER I TRY TO WEAR THEM EVERY DAY. I HAVE GOOD SUPPORT ON MY ARMS AND I CAN EVEN WEAR THEM UNDER A BLOUSE OR T-SHIRT</li>
