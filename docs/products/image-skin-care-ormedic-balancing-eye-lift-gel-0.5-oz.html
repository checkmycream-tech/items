            <li>Great product.</li>
            <li>Feels great going on.</li>
            <li>This product works and I am so happy I got it</li>
            <li>Good moisturizer</li>

            <li>I love this eye gel!</li>
            <li>As with the rest of the Ormedic line, I love the smell!</li>
            <li>Has a nice scent too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then</li>
            <li>And Honestly If I skip even 2 days of this you can tell.</li>
            <li>This is one of the best products I&#x27;ve tried - light, creamy and easily absorbed.</li>
            <li>any image skin care product is going to be good, but the ormedic line is fantastic.</li>
            <li>One of my favorite eye creams.</li>
            <li>Felt great on eyes but didn&#x27;t do much in the end</li>
            <li>Just love the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Well once you have the perfect skin care, you can not go back.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>I Love this Eye Lifting Cream.</li>
            <li>i feel like my eyes look much better when i use it.</li>
            <li>However, for me, I feel like I look more rested.</li>
            <li>I use it daily for the best results.</li>
            <li>:)&lt;br</li>
            <li>Rich and creamy.  </li>
            <li>The only thing I would change is the tube which you have to squeeze fairly well to get the gel out.</li>
            <li>This is a wonderful eye cream that helps with tired eyes and fine lines.</li>
            <li>I will say it does help when you first start having problems with eyes not looking as lifted as useful.</li>
            <li>Upper eye lid is okay</li>
            <li>/&gt;I was so  happy to see Amazon venders had the products because not that long ago the only place  </li>
            <li>Exactly what it says it does.</li>
            <li>Be sure to push down on the top and not squeeze or the top will come off and you will have wasted the product.</li>
            <li>If you have had problems for a long time, I would not see it being able to help that much.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s amazing how little you need to use for both eyes.</li>
            <li>I use the Vital C Hydrating Cleanser first and it leaves your skin so soft and clean.</li>
            <li>and I have seen a very noticeable difference in my skin.  </li>
            <li>i expected more from this product</li>
            <li>It is very soothing and hasn&#x27;t irritated my skin.</li>
            <li>This really does do wonders for your eyes..</li>
            <li>Really tightens and lifts.</li>
            <li>I have used other eye products from Image, but this is my favorite over all the rest - and I have tried nearly everything on the market.</li>
            <li>I was surprised at how fast it arrived.</li>
            <li>Reduces dark circles, puffiness and fine lines.</li>
            <li>I only wish it came in a bigger size, because I go through it rather quick.</li>
            <li>Gives me a wide awake look so great when I am tired.</li>
            <li>but you can&#x27;t buy directly from the website  unless you are a certified dermatologists, plastic surgeons, licensed aestheticians  but visiting the site</li>
            <li>This one does work somewhat and is not a waste of money.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have dark circles or anything yet, so I use it as a preventative and mostly because my eye area felt dry.</li>
            <li>Just a small amount is needed as it glides over  your skin easily.  </li>
            <li>not least I use the Image Vital C Hydrating Repair Cream  not only on my face but the neck too.</li>
            <li>It soaks into the delicate skin around the eyes quickly.  </li>
            <li>Great but is too expensive for such a small bottle.  </li>
            <li>I would not put it around or near the bottom part of the eyes because if you have bags or loose skin it will appear drawn because of the tighten affect.</li>
    </ol>

    <ol>
            <li> I love the product...but the new packaging is awful and wastes it.  I&#x27;ve stopped buying because of the packaging.  Nothing to do with with product itself.</li>
            <li> Best eye cream I&#x27;ve ever tried!</li>
            <li> I only wish it came in a bigger size, because I go through it rather quick. I like how moisturizing it goes on, and it&#x27;s not greasy at all. One of my favorite eye creams. The eye cream came in 2 days. I was surprised at how fast it arrived.</li>
            <li> Felt great on eyes but didn&#x27;t do much in the end</li>
            <li> I thought it was to help with dark circles under the eye, but it  made areas of white sections instead of a uniform look.  I quit using it.</li>
            <li> I have been using IMAGE products, per my aesthetician, for the last three years and I have seen a very noticeable difference in my skin.  I use the Vital C Hydrating Cleanser first and it leaves your skin so soft and clean. Has a nice scent too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then I apply the Ormedic Balancing Anti-oxidant Serum. Just a small amount is needed as it glides over  your skin easily.  It might feel like it will dry with a sticky touch but that disappears. I like it because I feel it tightens my skin. I  also put it on my neck. I would not put it around or near the bottom part of the eyes because if you have bags or loose skin it will appear drawn because of the tighten affect.Upper eye lid is okay, I&#x27;ve done it without any problems ,just apply very small  amount brush upward .Also great for  crows feet. . I have seen my pores disappear and my skin take on a clearer softer appearance. Just love the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Last but not least I use the Image Vital C Hydrating Repair Cream  not only on my face but the neck too. Good moisturizer and seriously if you continue to  use the products daily  I think you will like  the results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was so  happy to see Amazon venders had the products because not that long ago the only place  I could get them was at a salon. The price  is the same at both places but you can&#x27;t buy directly from the website  unless you are a certified dermatologists, plastic surgeons, licensed aestheticians  but visiting the site will give you information about all the products and maybe Amazon sells some of them&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[...]</li>
            <li> i expected more from this product</li>
            <li> I love this eye gel! It&#x27;s the perfect consistency and hydrates my eyes. I don&#x27;t have dark circles or anything yet, so I use it as a preventative and mostly because my eye area felt dry. It is very soothing and hasn&#x27;t irritated my skin. As with the rest of the Ormedic line, I love the smell!</li>
            <li> Well once you have the perfect skin care, you can not go back. This is it for me.  I have difficult skin and my facialist turned me onto it.</li>
            <li> This is one of the best products I&#x27;ve tried - light, creamy and easily absorbed. I love it. The only thing I would change is the tube which you have to squeeze fairly well to get the gel out.</li>
            <li> I Love this Eye Lifting Cream. And Honestly If I skip even 2 days of this you can tell. This really does do wonders for your eyes..</li>
            <li> Wonderful can see improvement within 24 hrs.  Rich and creamy.  Feels wonderful.</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful eye cream that helps with tired eyes and fine lines. I use the Image Skincare products for all my facial needs. This eye cream works well with the face cream and serum.  There is no burning sensation or sticky feel after applying.  It soaks into the delicate skin around the eyes quickly.  I also use this for the lines around my lips.</li>
            <li> I like this eye gel but it doesn&#x27;t get rid of puffy eye lids.  Any suggestions. I&#x27;m still going to keep this on my to get list</li>
            <li> any image skin care product is going to be good, but the ormedic line is fantastic. i feel like my eyes look much better when i use it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it 2x daily for 4 weeks and have seen no improvement, either above or below my eyes.</li>
            <li> I bought this product for $40 odd dollars at the store. I will say it does help when you first start having problems with eyes not looking as lifted as useful. I use it two times a day when I can, and one at bedtime. Before this product, I did not belive eyelift creams worked. This one does work somewhat and is not a waste of money. If you have had problems for a long time, I would not see it being able to help that much. However, for me, I feel like I look more rested. Be sure to push down on the top and not squeeze or the top will come off and you will have wasted the product.</li>
            <li> Great but is too expensive for such a small bottle.  Took at least 3 months to show improvement in my skin.</li>
            <li> This is the best. Helps my overall eye look. Reduces dark circles, puffiness and fine lines. Gives me a wide awake look so great when I am tired. I use it daily for the best results. I have used other eye products from Image, but this is my favorite over all the rest - and I have tried nearly everything on the market.</li>
            <li> Exactly what it says it does. Im happy I will by more  :)&lt;br /&gt;  Lifts up your eyes, like an eye lift.</li>
            <li> Great product. Really tightens and lifts. Feels great going on. I have been using it at night along with the balancing bio peptide cream</li>
            <li> I feel like I give my eyelids a drink of water every time I apply this gel. It&#x27;s amazing how little you need to use for both eyes.</li>
            <li> This product works and I am so happy I got it</li>
    </ol>
