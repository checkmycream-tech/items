            <li>Totally worth it.</li>
            <li>Well now honey, you will have your own red brush.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s soft and brushes my hair really easily</li>
            <li>good brush comes apart a little</li>
            <li>I bought this brush because my last one broke at the handle after many years.</li>
            <li>I personally ordered more brushes as soon as I tested this one out.  </li>
            <li>So I had to hot glue</li>
            <li>Pretty color</li>
            <li>He just woke me up to ask where the red brush was, it&#x27;s his favorite.</li>
            <li>I would absolutely recommend this brush!  </li>
            <li>Easy to clean and dry.</li>
            <li>the handle broke pretty fast.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s an easy fix if you have some liquid nails or something similar.  </li>
            <li>Decent paddle brush!</li>
            <li>I received this product with only light useage.  </li>
            <li>It de-tangles my hair and is gentle, too.</li>
            <li>I really hope to never be without one&lt;br</li>
            <li>This really makes my hair lay well and look shiny.</li>
            <li>So it&#x27;s very sturdy.</li>
            <li>Not a whole lot more I can say.</li>
            <li>I tried \\&quot;vent brushes\\&quot; which had kind of worked for me in the past</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t live without this!</li>
            <li>Now brushing my hair takes less than 5 minutes :)</li>
            <li>Even though this happened, it is a decent brush for the price.</li>
            <li>I super glued it back on and have been using it for about a month now.  </li>
            <li>and that is with just normal use.</li>
            <li>Love my half brush!</li>
            <li>and it still looks new.</li>
            <li>Not what I wanted to happen with a new brush.</li>
            <li>It looks more red in person than pink.</li>
            <li>It works fine, but just a little turned off by the quality.  </li>
            <li>This brush did what it said it would until my 10 year old dropped it while brushing her hair.</li>
            <li>but, I was surprised that it happened so soon after purchase.  </li>
            <li>I guess I&#x27;ll be careful not to drop it due to other reviews, but I&#x27;m very glad I made the snap decision to buy this brush.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not really sure how to review a hairbrush, but I have long hair and it does a lot better than my old brush.</li>
            <li>Exactly what is to be expected of a brush.</li>
            <li>children, especially my son, uses this product with no complaint.</li>
            <li>This replacement is the same brand brush but feels much sturdier and there is no paint that will chip off over time like my last one.</li>
            <li>My hair is thick and very long and these brushes are the only kind that work for me.</li>
            <li>handle came a little loose, but easy to fix and now</li>
            <li>I love this brush for my long thick hair.</li>
            <li>Lol how crazy is that!</li>

            <li> Lol how crazy is that!</li>
            <li> She is about 4 feet tall, and the less than 4 foot drop from her hand onto the bathroom floor was enough to completely snap off the handle.</li>
            <li> It could have had a rough time in transit, but still not ok to have just fallen off during the first use.</li>
            <li> Also, the red dye that they use in the plastic will run if left on a wet counter.  </li>
            <li> I have been looking for a brush to tame my very wild &amp; very long mixed heritage hair.  </li>
            <li> Very durable I&#x27;ve dropped it a billion times and I&#x27;ve even slapped my husband on the bum with it really hard...</li>
            <li> I purchased two, one for using while hair is wet and the other for dry.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The brush is wide and sturdy.</li>
            <li> But the con with this brush is the handle fell off after it got wet.</li>
            <li> This paddle brush does the job with minimal pulling of the hair.</li>
            <li> Very wide, especially if one has thick long hair.</li>
            <li> I had to request a return due to the brush being damaged.</li>
            <li> The handle, which I am assuming is glued on, fell off in less than a week of receiving.</li>
            <li> Now I have a half brush guys..</li>
            <li> I have thick long layered hair (rests at my bottom)</li>
            <li> Both brushes had a bristle missing.</li>
            <li> One spindle is missing.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had it for a few months now.</li>
            <li> Broke after a few times brushing my hair</li>
            <li> but I sat down to brush my hair, dropped the brush on the sofa and it BROKE!!</li>
            <li> It manages to reach all the way to the scalp and unknot the hair with very little effort or breakage.  </li>
            <li> not even 5 mins after I open it it&#x27;s broken!</li>
            <li> Not sure if water and shampoo will damage it</li>
            <li> the brush is made with a hard gel texture.</li>
            <li> It is now my go-to for smoothing and detangling my rather thick hair.</li>
            <li> I searched for \\&quot;thick hair brushes\\&quot; and was unsatisfied with the results.  </li>
            <li> If you have thick and knotty hair</li>
            <li> My hair is thick and I haven&#x27;t noticed any of the bristles falling out.</li>
            <li> I have thick wavy hair and this brush tames my mane painlessly.</li>
            <li> when I received my brush it was broken, I had to try to glue the &amp;#34;head&amp;#34; of the brush to the handle&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> rate it 5 stars if I didn&#x27;t receive a broken item</li>
            <li> back of mine came scratched to crap, but it works...</li>
            <li> This brush hasn&#x27;t broken yet, and it works.</li>
            <li> But I think it&#x27;s unfair to expect that from a brush.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s handle failed and the brush head fell to the floor.  </li>
            <li> very, very disappointed with the product.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> The brush is not made very good. The handle, which I am assuming is glued on, fell off in less than a week of receiving. and that is with just normal use. Definitely would not buy again.</li>
            <li> I bought this brush because my last one broke at the handle after many years. This replacement is the same brand brush but feels much sturdier and there is no paint that will chip off over time like my last one. This brush detangles hair without snagging and is the best brush I have ever had.</li>
            <li> Great brush, great price. Very sturdy, fine quality  I would definitely recommend. I will be using this brush for many years.</li>
            <li> I had to request a return due to the brush being damaged. Both brushes had a bristle missing. I am assuming that is the way the manufacture made it. The brush is great.</li>
            <li> Paint is peeling already. One spindle is missing. I bought my daughter a similar brush with another brand name and she uses it a lot and it still looks new. Next time I&#x27;ll try that brand.</li>
            <li> This brush is perfect for me and the price was great!&lt;br /&gt;The brush is wide and sturdy. The bristles are sturdy and softt, not like metal bristles. and Is perfect for my thick locks.</li>
            <li> I loved this brush until it broke within the first week of use at the handle. Luckily, super glue can fix my problem! I have thick long layered hair (rests at my bottom) and this brush is my savior! Now brushing my hair takes less than 5 minutes :)</li>
            <li> when I received my brush it was broken, I had to try to glue the &amp;#34;head&amp;#34; of the brush to the handle&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;would rate it 5 stars if I didn&#x27;t receive a broken item</li>
            <li> You can use it in the shower with out it breaking! gets rid of tangles easily and quickly! love it!</li>
            <li> the handle came apart from the brush only a couple of weeks afer I received this product with only light useage.  it looks like the glue used to adhere these two parts together did not do hob.  very, very disappointed with the product.</li>
            <li> Loved this product fresh out of the wrapping but I sat down to brush my hair, dropped the brush on the sofa and it BROKE!! Now I have a half brush guys..I just got it and not even 5 mins after I open it it&#x27;s broken! Lol how crazy is that! Cheap. I think I&#x27;ll just glue it back together..we&#x27;ll see if that works. Love my half brush!</li>
            <li> I use this brush on straightened hair. It de-tangles my hair and is gentle, too. I do not have to worry about it tearing my hair out.</li>
            <li> Love this brush! My hair is thick and very long and these brushes are the only kind that work for me.</li>
            <li> I like the price of the brush, the quality for the price - it seems like it will last for a number of years....the only drawback is that it smells like chemicals and I am hoping that the odor will subside soon.  Not sure if water and shampoo will damage it so I haven&#x27;t &#x27;washed&#x27; the brush.</li>
            <li> This brush did what it said it would until my 10 year old dropped it while brushing her hair. She is about 4 feet tall, and the less than 4 foot drop from her hand onto the bathroom floor was enough to completely snap off the handle. The brush is no longer usable.</li>
            <li> new favorite brush, absolutely!! It is now my go-to for smoothing and detangling my rather thick hair. I guess I&#x27;ll be careful not to drop it due to other reviews, but I&#x27;m very glad I made the snap decision to buy this brush.</li>
            <li> This is the perfect brush for long hair and wigs. This brush doesn&#x27;t frizz up hairs or make them staticky. Nice quality. Totally worth it.</li>
            <li> I recently replaced my hair brush and tried this one.  I have been letting my hair grow out and it is great at get tangle out with less tugging and tearing of my hair.</li>
            <li> Very lovely and a nice brush, works great.  The red color is very nice and it brushes your hair very well.</li>
            <li> it was what i expected and more! :)</li>
            <li> haven&#x27;t used it yet, but it looks great and its just as the picture</li>
            <li> Good except the handle broke pretty fast.</li>
            <li> Durable, love the strength of the bristles.&lt;br /&gt;The handle came a little loose, but easy to fix and now perfect.&lt;br /&gt;I wish it could make my hair longer. But I think it&#x27;s unfair to expect that from a brush.</li>
            <li> Stocking stuffer for my daughters, they love it.</li>
            <li> I love this brush it&#x27;s soft and brushes my hair really easily that&#x27;s why i gave it all the stars and i would recommend this brush to everyone! so perfect for a great price!</li>
            <li> I have been looking for a brush to tame my very wild &amp; very long mixed heritage hair.  I searched for \\&quot;thick hair brushes\\&quot; and was unsatisfied with the results.  I tried \\&quot;vent brushes\\&quot; which had kind of worked for me in the past but I still wasn&#x27;t happy.  I ordered this brush on a whim and boy was I in for a treat.If you have thick and knotty hair this is the brush for you.  It manages to reach all the way to the scalp and unknot the hair with very little effort or breakage.  Even seems to have the added benefit of a scalp massage with is awesome!  I personally ordered more brushes as soon as I tested this one out.  I really hope to never be without one&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update:&lt;br /&gt;The handle on these brushes has come off on 3 out of 5 of my brushes.  It&#x27;s an easy fix if you have some liquid nails or something similar.  Also, the red dye that they use in the plastic will run if left on a wet counter.  The dye doesn&#x27;t stain if you wipe it up before it dries.  Still my favorite brush</li>
            <li> Well made brush. It&#x27;s really big, though. I am pleased with the item</li>
            <li> Loved the brush until the handle fell off within a week. I think I can glue it back on. My hair isn&#x27;t even all that tangled!</li>
            <li> This brush is a good size and weight in my hand but, after the second use, the glue that held the brush together with it&#x27;s handle failed and the brush head fell to the floor.  It was easily fixable with some more superglue but, I was surprised that it happened so soon after purchase.  Even though this happened, it is a decent brush for the price.</li>
            <li> But the con with this brush is the handle fell off after it got wet. So I had to hot glue the handle back on. Not what I wanted to happen with a new brush. But I love it any way.</li>
            <li> This really makes my hair lay well and look shiny.</li>
            <li> Brush itself functions well as a brush.&lt;br /&gt;The back of mine came scratched to crap, but it works...I would find another seller.</li>
            <li> I love it. I doesn&#x27;t pull nor scratch my scalp while blow drying.  Easy to clean and dry. Pretty color</li>
            <li> Exactly what is to be expected of a brush. The color coating feels very velvety and although it doesn&#x27;t add to functionality, it is very pleasant to feel when brushing ones hair. Very wide, especially if one has thick long hair.</li>
            <li> Good and light to use</li>
            <li> I love this brush for my long thick hair. I am ordering another for my husband, he keeps stealing mine. He has tons of hair brushes of his own, even made just for men hair brushes.  He just woke me up to ask where the red brush was, it&#x27;s his favorite. Well now honey, you will have your own red brush.</li>
            <li> Love this brush. Very durable I&#x27;ve dropped it a billion times and I&#x27;ve even slapped my husband on the bum with it really hard... So it&#x27;s very sturdy. I&#x27;ve had it for a few months now. My hair is thick and I haven&#x27;t noticed any of the bristles falling out. It never builds up any product residue. If I get hair tangled in it all I do is pull it out. It doesn&#x27;t get stuck in the brush.</li>
            <li> This brush hasn&#x27;t broken yet, and it works. I&#x27;m not really sure how to review a hairbrush, but I have long hair and it does a lot better than my old brush.</li>
            <li> Broke after a few times brushing my hair</li>
            <li> I have thick wavy hair and this brush tames my mane painlessly. I love the high quality design.</li>
            <li> I love this brush to use while blow drying my hair. I purchased two, one for using while hair is wet and the other for dry. (African-American hair)</li>
            <li> Smooth, glides well, does not rip off hair.&lt;br /&gt;My children, especially my son, uses this product with no complaint.</li>
            <li> My daughter loves this brush.  She is 12 with curly-ish hair.  It does a great job.  The four stars is because it is not a sturdy brush at the handle.</li>
            <li> Decent paddle brush! Not a whole lot more I can say.</li>
            <li> I would absolutely recommend this brush!  It&#x27;s the best brush I&#x27;ve ever had.  I&#x27;ve had it for about a month now and it still has all the bristles.  I can&#x27;t live without this! Mine had a smell when I received it, and it still does, but I don&#x27;t care because it&#x27;s so awesome!!!</li>
            <li> good brush comes apart a little</li>
            <li> Better brush than I could buy at the store...the price is awesome and the brush brushes nicely.  I will buy another one in the future!</li>
            <li> This paddle brush does the job with minimal pulling of the hair.</li>
            <li> The handle broke off after one use.  I super glued it back on and have been using it for about a month now.  It works fine, but just a little turned off by the quality.  It could have had a rough time in transit, but still not ok to have just fallen off during the first use.</li>
            <li> This came with the handle off...but I still use it as is.</li>
            <li> the brush is made with a hard gel texture. easy to grip. I love this brush! It looks more red in person than pink.</li>
