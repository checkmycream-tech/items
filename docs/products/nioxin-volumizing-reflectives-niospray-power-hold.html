            <li>I chose this hairspray because I started using Nioxin Shampoo for hair loss, and loved it.  </li>
            <li>Works great, not sticky and brushes out nicely.  </li>
            <li>I find it keeps the hair I have in good condition and makes it look fuller.  </li>
            <li>everything was packaged good and everything was there.</li>
            <li>this spray works great and you get a really strong hold without sticky residue.  </li>
            <li>Great hairspray for fine hair</li>
            <li>super great</li>
            <li>, combs out well, gives hair a better texture and beauty parlor shop shine.  </li>
            <li>I love Nioxin products.  </li>
            <li>I love Nioxin products.</li>
            <li>LOVE, LOVE, LOVE Nioxin Power Hold...</li>
            <li>I love the hairspray--just not from here.</li>
            <li>Delivery was very quick as promised.</li>
            <li>One bottle works fine.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t use this daily, but when I do, it works great.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t use this daily, but when I do, it works great.</li>
            <li>This is the most effective of the 3 different sprays offered, for me.  </li>
            <li>This hairspray is very strong, so after trying it, I found that I need to spray much less to get a good hold in my hair.  </li>
            <li>I am a tried and true Nioxin customer.  </li>
            <li>I have used Nioxin products for many years due to thinning hair and I feel they are the best topical product there is for women.  </li>
            <li>I adore Nixion products, best shampoo and conditioner out there, hair stays clean feeling longer, a little goes a long way, love it.</li>
            <li>Thanks Nioxin!!</li>
            <li>I appreciated how quickly my order arrived and was exactly what I wanted at the right price.</li>
            <li>It is AMAZING for styling thin, fine hair.</li>
            <li>It even held up in the high humidity of South Carolina summers or the hot, windy beaches of Hawaii.  </li>
            <li>It seems to work much like the Power Hold</li>
            <li>This product really prevents that from happening.</li>
            <li>It is great for thin hair.</li>
            <li>Been using this brand for over 10 years and really like it.  </li>
            <li>Only drawback is the nozzle plugs up pretty easily and has to be washed regularly.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used several other brands for thinning hair on the market that aren&#x27;t as effective.</li>
            <li>The holding power is not as strong and the scent is much different -- I have to question if this is Nioxin &amp;#34;Power Hold&amp;#34; or a different formula ??</li>
            <li>and I don&#x27;t like the new formula because it makes my hair sticky.</li>
            <li>I live in the far Northwestern part of our country, where we get blowing snow, rain, freezing rain, etc.</li>
            <li>Since it is on the expensive side, using less spray makes it more cost effective.</li>
            <li>It is not stiff and flattening.</li>
            <li>I use this daily, and although I can buy it locally, the texture creme that I buy is no loonger available locally.  </li>
            <li>Some people speculate, although I&#x27;m not accusing, that some online services may sell their old or expired products.  </li>
            <li>I have naturally curly hair.</li>
            <li>, this is the ONLY hairspray that works in every condition, without becoming limp or tacky.  </li>
            <li>I blow dry it straight</li>
            <li>No other spray I have ever used compares  to it.&lt;br</li>
            <li>My hair stays the same all day long...and it washes out completely without leaving a film on my hair.  </li>
            <li>I originally hesitated to buy this product b/c I thought it was expensive for a hairspray but all the reviews I read were positive plus hairspray  </li>
            <li>This is the only hairspray I have ever found that held my baby fine, thin hair in it&#x27;s style all day and didn&#x27;t feel like helmet hair.  </li>
    </ol>

            <li> lasts me a long time.</li>
            <li> And the last one, when you press the stem down, it sprays for a second or two then deflates, as if it runs out of pressure.</li>
            <li> we love it, but it is very expensive.  </li>
            <li> I understand Nioxin is recommended by doctors for cancer patients who have lost their hair due to chemotherapy.</li>

            <li> It is a little drying if you overuse it</li>
            <li> but if you just use a little at the end of your styling it works well.</li>
            <li> Couldn&#x27;t figure out what is wasn&#x27;t as firm.  </li>

            <li> but when you want to comb it out it does not turn hard and pull your hair out.  </li>
            <li> My wife uses this all the time and it is frequently hard to find in the brick and mortar stores.</li>
            <li> I use it at least twice a week.</li>

            <li> I use this daily, and although I can buy it locally, the texture creme that I buy is no loonger available locally.  So I get the spray when I order the gel.</li>
            <li> Best high-humidity hairspray ever!</li>
            <li> I received a sample of this product from my beauty stylist.  My hair was thinning.  This spray holds my hair super great but when you want to comb it out it does not turn hard and pull your hair out.  Not one hair comes out on my hair pick.  Wonderful product.  I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Great hairspray for fine hair</li>
            <li> I ordered 3 bottles.  One bottle works fine.  One bottle when you spray it, it leaks out of the stem and liquid runs down your hand. And the last one, when you press the stem down, it sprays for a second or two then deflates, as if it runs out of pressure. You have to wait for it to sort of reload. I never had problems with Nioxin before buying it from Harmon&#x27;s.  Some people speculate, although I&#x27;m not accusing, that some online services may sell their old or expired products.  I won&#x27;t buy anything else here.</li>
            <li> I have been using NIOXIN, Power Hold, for over ten years.  No other spray I have ever used compares  to it.&lt;br /&gt;It holds well, combs out well, gives hair a better texture and beauty parlor shop shine.  I was lost when I thought it was  to be discontinued  several years ago.  Thank Heaven it hasn&#x27;t been!</li>
            <li> My wife uses this all the time and it is frequently hard to find in the brick and mortar stores. The price was so so but it still beats having to drive around and hunt for it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for years, but I can&#x27;t find it locally. Nioxin changed the formula and I don&#x27;t like the new formula because it makes my hair sticky.</li>
            <li> It seems to work much like the Power Hold but what actually shipped is labeled &amp;#34;Extra Control&amp;#34;.  I read that Power Hold has been discontinued so this should work.</li>
            <li> This hairspray works great. I have naturally curly hair. I blow dry it straight but if it is raining or humid outside it just frizzes up. This product really prevents that from happening. Even when I wake up in the morning my hair needs very little styling.I originally hesitated to buy this product b/c I thought it was expensive for a hairspray but all the reviews I read were positive plus hairspray  lasts me a long time. I am very happy with this purchase!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use this daily, but when I do, it works great.  I love Nioxin products.  I don&#x27;t use anything else.</li>
            <li> I chose this hairspray because I started using Nioxin Shampoo for hair loss, and loved it.  This hairspray is very strong, so after trying it, I found that I need to spray much less to get a good hold in my hair.  Works great, not sticky and brushes out nicely.  Since it is on the expensive side, using less spray makes it more cost effective.</li>
            <li> My granddaughter calls this &amp;#34;the glue hairspray&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> This Nioxin Volumizing Reflectives Niospray Power Hold keeps my hair in place. I don&#x27;t use this daily, but when I do, it works great. I love Nioxin products. I don&#x27;t use anything else.</li>
            <li> LOVE, LOVE, LOVE Nioxin Power Hold...HATE they discontinued this spray. It is AMAZING for styling thin, fine hair.</li>
            <li> This is the only hairspray I have ever found that held my baby fine, thin hair in it&#x27;s style all day and didn&#x27;t feel like helmet hair.  It even held up in the high humidity of South Carolina summers or the hot, windy beaches of Hawaii.  The biggest surprise was when I was working so hard that my hair actually started dripping from sweat, but when it dried the style was still in place!  By the end of the day my hair doesn&#x27;t even feel like it has been sprayed, but the hair is still like it started the day.  Thanks Nioxin!!</li>
            <li> I adore Nixion products, best shampoo and conditioner out there, hair stays clean feeling longer, a little goes a long way, love it.</li>
            <li> I am a tried and true Nioxin customer.  I appreciated how quickly my order arrived and was exactly what I wanted at the right price.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t sent what I ordered-I received Extra Hold -Not Power Hold.  Couldn&#x27;t figure out what is wasn&#x27;t as firm.  That was one can.  Then the next can of hair spray won&#x27;t spray.  I love the hairspray--just not from here.</li>
            <li> I like this product for the days I feel that I need that bit of extra hold. It is a little drying if you overuse it but if you just use a little at the end of your styling it works well.</li>
            <li> Our household has used this type of hairspray for years &#x3D; we love it, but it is very expensive.  So when we saw the bargain price for it on Amazon, we immediately ordered 2 cans.  However, when we received the product, it is much different than any of the Nioxin Power Hold we have ever had.  The holding power is not as strong and the scent is much different -- I have to question if this is Nioxin &amp;#34;Power Hold&amp;#34; or a different formula ??</li>
            <li> I have used Nioxin products for many years due to thinning hair and I feel they are the best topical product there is for women.  I&#x27;ve used several other brands for thinning hair on the market that aren&#x27;t as effective. I understand Nioxin is recommended by doctors for cancer patients who have lost their hair due to chemotherapy.</li>
            <li> I use this every day.  It is great for thin hair. It is not stiff and flattening. I also use shampoo and conditioner.</li>
            <li> This is the most effective of the 3 different sprays offered, for me.  For anyone with thinning hair, the spray gives the hair the appearance of being thicker .  Used the product for 15 years.  Wouldn&#x27;t use anyting else.  Delivery was very quick as promised.</li>
            <li> I had a difficult time finding the 8.8 oz cans of Nioxin hair spray.  Been using this brand for over 10 years and really like it.  Not sure if they are not going to produce this anymore, or what.</li>
            <li> this spray works great and you get a really strong hold without sticky residue.  Only drawback is the nozzle plugs up pretty easily and has to be washed regularly.</li>
            <li> I live in the far Northwestern part of our country, where we get blowing snow, rain, freezing rain, etc., this is the ONLY hairspray that works in every condition, without becoming limp or tacky.  My hair stays the same all day long...and it washes out completely without leaving a film on my hair.  I&#x27;ll never use another hairspray again... (and I&#x27;ve tried them ALL)!  Since I have trouble finding it in stores/shops, I buy it on line from Amazon.</li>
            <li> I find it keeps the hair I have in good condition and makes it look fuller.  I use it at least twice a week.</li>
            <li> I will order again.  It came within the few days that  they said it would and is a very good product. everything was packaged good and everything was there.</li>
