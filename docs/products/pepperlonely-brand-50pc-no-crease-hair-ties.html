            <li>These still work great for ponytails and buns!!!!</li>
            <li>Awesome product.  </li>
            <li>Literally every color is in this bag, and perfect for throwing my hair up in a ponytail for work outs without tearing my hair out.</li>
            <li>Great colors.</li>
            <li>Work very nicely.</li>
            <li>T_T.&lt;br /&gt;it&#x27;s in good quality</li>
            <li>Good selection of colors.</li>
            <li>in all, it&#x27;s way cheaper and a more variety of colors than spending around $2 a piece at any discount store!</li>
            <li>love them!  </li>
            <li>Love them!</li>
            <li>I have that kind of hair that I can put it up in a hairband and</li>
            <li>Fast shipping and great seller!!!!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li>Nice and stretchy, no tugging, lots of colors.</li>
            <li>I assumed I would get one of each color as pictured, and it was more of a &amp;#34;grab bag&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li>What more can you ask for.</li>
            <li>I love these hair ties because they don&#x27;t break or crease your hair.</li>
            <li>got this gigantic bag of ties and have given them out to so many daughters &amp; friends...and still plenty for me.</li>
            <li>two minutes later I&#x27;ll have what seems to be a permanent crease LOL.</li>
            <li>The ties are great colors, but do not last.  </li>
            <li>Love the vibrant colors!</li>
            <li>I know my friends and family will love them as much as I do</li>
            <li>The colors were not bad but not as shown so i returned them.</li>
            <li>I really like these hair ties!!</li>
            <li>Price is right.</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t complain since it&#x27;s a huge bag covering the whole rainbow, but if these weren&#x27;t dirt cheap they definitely would not be worth it.</li>
            <li>The first time i received 44 out of 50.</li>
            <li>They seem to be the same quality as ones that are way more money</li>
            <li>I can wear the hairbands all day long and not have a crease at the end of the day I love it with my hair</li>
            <li>and I really like it.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I have other bands of much better quality.  </li>
            <li>Just know that the picture does not necessarily mean you will get every color.</li>
            <li>When I received them they are so small they can&#x27;t even fit on my head!</li>
            <li>Very cute, but not great quality.</li>
            <li>They completely stretch out of shape after one day.  </li>
            <li>My order came fast, but I only received 48 (not complaining because I don&#x27;t need 50, but if you buy 50, you expect 50).</li>
            <li>There were no black or white ties at all in the bag and very few of the light colors that are pictured.  </li>
            <li>I have thick, heavy hair ... holds it nicely.</li>

            <li> There were three of the lime green color and none of the dark green at all.  </li>
            <li> My initial search was for headbands and was disappointed by the size.  </li>
            <li> Too big of a difference to order again, very disappointed.</li>
            <li> [I know it&#x27;s in random</li>
            <li> Completely unhappy with these.</li>
            <li> but oh boy i had 4 fluorescent yellows, 3 fluorescent greens, and a bunch of ugly colors and nothing like the rainbow shown in the picture.</li>

            <li> Ordered the 50 pack and only received 47.</li>
            <li> I got one of these through at birch box. And now I am giving them as Christmas presents for par a gift baskets. I know my friends and family will love them as much as I do I can wear the hairbands all day long and not have a crease at the end of the day I love it with my hair I have that kind of hair that I can put it up in a hairband and two minutes later I&#x27;ll have what seems to be a permanent crease LOL.</li>
            <li> My daughter loves them!</li>
            <li> I really like these hair ties!! My initial search was for headbands and was disappointed by the size.  These still work great for ponytails and buns!!!!</li>
            <li> I ordered these because it stated that these were head bands. When I received them they are so small they can&#x27;t even fit on my head! I will be returning these for a refund</li>
            <li> I ordered this item twice. The first time i received 44 out of 50. The colors were not bad but not as shown so i returned them. The second set i ordered  had 46 out of 50 but oh boy i had 4 fluorescent yellows, 3 fluorescent greens, and a bunch of ugly colors and nothing like the rainbow shown in the picture. I am returning this set also.</li>
            <li> The quality is as expected but I ordered a pack of 50 that only contained 36. Too big of a difference to order again, very disappointed.</li>
            <li> the colors are not the same as the ones that are shown</li>
            <li> The ties are great colors, but do not last.  They completely stretch out of shape after one day.  I have other bands of much better quality.  They are made of the thinnest fabric I have seen yet.  Completely unhappy with these.</li>
            <li> Awesome product.  Fast shipping and great seller!!!!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> Product works as advertised, does not leave creases in hair and stays in, however, the pictured product does not match what I received.  I assumed I would get one of each color as pictured, and it was more of a &amp;#34;grab bag&amp;#34;.  There were no black or white ties at all in the bag and very few of the light colors that are pictured.  There were three of the lime green color and none of the dark green at all.  Just know that the picture does not necessarily mean you will get every color.</li>
            <li> Work very nicely. I have thick, heavy hair ... holds it nicely.</li>
            <li> Great colors. No damage. Price is right. What more can you ask for.</li>
            <li> I do expect receiving 50 of different colors...[I know it&#x27;s in random but I still expect that...well....]&lt;br /&gt;unfortunately some of the colors are the same and I get 6 of the same yellow one T_T.&lt;br /&gt;it&#x27;s in good quality and I really like it.&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend if the seller can provide a full-color option...for some people with obsession like me...would definitely buy it.</li>
            <li> I love these hair ties because they don&#x27;t break or crease your hair. My order came fast, but I only received 48 (not complaining because I don&#x27;t need 50, but if you buy 50, you expect 50). Other than that, this is an insane deal and they are only knotted, not heat-sealed, which just means it&#x27;s better quality.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, it&#x27;s way cheaper and a more variety of colors than spending around $2 a piece at any discount store!</li>
            <li> Love the vibrant colors!</li>
            <li> Literally every color is in this bag, and perfect for throwing my hair up in a ponytail for work outs without tearing my hair out.</li>
            <li> Bought these after receiving something similar in my Birch Box. Very cute, but not great quality. Can&#x27;t complain since it&#x27;s a huge bag covering the whole rainbow, but if these weren&#x27;t dirt cheap they definitely would not be worth it. They do help spice up an outfit but they do not prevent creases.</li>
            <li> Good selection of colors. They seem to be the same quality as ones that are way more money and I did receive 50.</li>
            <li> got this gigantic bag of ties and have given them out to so many daughters &amp; friends...and still plenty for me.</li>
            <li> love them!  Nice and stretchy, no tugging, lots of colors. Love them!</li>
