    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I love this moisturizer! Light and effective.  Delivery was quick!</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t find this in any of my local stores anymore.  Garnier now has a heavier weight lotion that is greasy.  This is the best lotion I have ever used!!!!  It is non-greasy, light, and wonderfully moisturizes my combination skin.  The scent is clean.  I feel great when I use this lotion.  I am so afraid that Garnier has stopped manufacturing this and the only place I could find it is on Amazon. Also like their Rescue face wash and Rescue Refreshing Gel-Cream with Grape Water Extract.  None are greasy, all moisturize well, and all smell amazingly clean.  LOVE THIS STUFF!!!</li>
            <li> I finally found a moisturizer that worked for me and they do not sell it in the store. Amazon had it and I am so glad..I bought two..It is the best.</li>
            <li> I noticed my skin became softer and more radiant!</li>
            <li> I was so excited to find this moisturizer online. I have been unable to get it in the store(s) for a year! They carry this but its either higher SPF, or a heavier version. This is lightweight and works great.</li>
            <li> Best lotion I have used in a long time. Discovered it two years ago, and haven&#x27;t stopped. I am not someone who wears make-up daily. I have combination skin, and most lotions either leave it too oily or dont moisturize enough. This leaves me feeling fresh and hydrated and is light enough to forget about it soon after.</li>
            <li> This is a nice lightweight facial moisturizer.  I like that it has spf 15 and I use it during the day all over and on my hands as well.  Not greasy at all.  Can&#x27;t beat the price either!</li>
            <li> i was upset to find out that garnier had discontinued this product , was happy to find it online till I can find a replacement-&lt;br /&gt;product arrived as promised, great price</li>
            <li> Love this. Disappointed it has been discontinued</li>
            <li> My favorite moisture lotion. Love the light weight feel and the fragrance. I also like knowing it has a little Spf included as well.</li>

            <li> I love this lotion and was so excited to find on line as I couldn&#x27;t find locally any longer. Thanks</li>
            <li> I order this lotion on a regular basis. I can&#x27;t get it in the store anymore, but I use it daily and consider it to be one of the better, affordable moisturizers on the market.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t find this product any where and was able to find it on amazon.  I am so happy.  I ordered two so I will have an extra bottle for the future. I received my package on time and I am pleased.</li>
            <li> Great item, great price and great seller.</li>
            <li> I have combination skin and live in Wisconsin so my skin is in need of moisture all year round. This works for me, it is lightweight and has no perfumes, as some do. I like that it is quick to absorb into my skin. If I could change one thing it would be the ability to get the last amounts out of the bottom.</li>
            <li> Love this product.  Came as promised.</li>
            <li> Love this product.    Concerned they are not making it anymore.</li>
            <li> This is the only face cream I use! I love this brand! It isn&#x27;t greasy</li>
            <li> I HAVE BEEN USING IT FOR A COUPLE OF YEARS AND CAN NO LONGER FIND IT IN MY LOCAL STORES.</li>
            <li> I hate most moisturizers that have sunscreen in them. They all smell like sunscreen except this one. This is the best smelling moisturizer I could find, and I tried a lot of different brands before settling on this one.</li>
            <li> I use it everyday!  I love it!  I is light and makes your face feel good!  It gives a brightness.</li>
            <li> I am a 42 year old female who has extremely dry skin all year round.  I live in the suburbs of Philadelphia, and my skin gets so dry at the start of the Fall Season that it actually peels and cracks!  I have searched for a low maintenance solution to this problem my entire life (this has a been a problem for me since I was 12 years old...) but never found anything that worked.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then, I found this product.  It is fabulous.  The bottle contains a pump at the top which you use to pump out the lotion.  I typically use 3 pumps for my face and another pump for my neck.  The lotion is white when it comes out but goes on clear when you apply it.  Within about 5 minutes, it completely absorbs into your skin.  Thus, allowing for you to put on makeup if desired.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product is considered to be their \\&quot;day lotion\\&quot; meaning that it&#x27;s light enough to wear during the day and under makeup. They have another product which is their \\&quot;cream\\&quot; which considered to be heavier and more intended for nighttime use - [[ASIN:B003RF82UK Garnier Moisture Rescue Refreshing Gel-Cream, Grape Water Extract, Vitamin E,  1.70-Fluid Ounce]].  However, I have found that this lotion works so well that I don&#x27;t need anything else!  I use this during the day before applying my makeup and at night before going to bed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After applying this before going to bed, when I wake up in the morning, my skin is actually glowing - I am not exagerating!  It is so healthy looking, I actually look younger!  And, my skin feels great - no more cracking, peeling or dryness!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note:  I use this in conjunction with the Olay Daily Cleaning wipes - [[ASIN:B004CQXZ5U Olay Sensitive 4-In-1 Daily Facial Cloths, 33 Count (Pack of 2)]].  This has also had a huge impact on preventing dryness on my skin.  If you have dry skin, I would suggest that you use these products together for maximum benefit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And, at this great price, it&#x27;s worth 10 times as much...love it!</li>
            <li> Extremely quick shipping (even though it didn&#x27;t qualify for amazon prime, I got it in three days).  It&#x27;s cheaper than buying a moisturizer at the drug store, and the product itself is extremely lightweight.  It smells fresh, and of course - has UV protection (which is the main reason I bought it)</li>
            <li> I have oily and now sensitve skin.  This product is good for me for the winter months when I need a little more than the Garnier Gel Moisture.</li>
            <li> Use this product daily. Love it. Moisturizes very good and longlasting. Light cream, non-oily. Recommend it to any woman who wants protection even in artificial light.</li>
            <li> very satisfied was delivered in prompt manner and fulfilled all my expectation . Thank you again.</li>
            <li> I have been using this item for the past 3-4 yrs and does not dry my skin.  It is a great product.</li>
            <li> I love this product because it is very light and refreshing.  It leaves face feeling very soft.  I would purchase it again.</li>
