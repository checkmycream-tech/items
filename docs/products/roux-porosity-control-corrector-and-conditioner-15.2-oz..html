            <li>I came across the product on youtube because the person said it could help bring moisture into your hair and make it soft and healthy.</li>
            <li>Bought the whole system and interested to see how it works all together!</li>
            <li>Made my 4c curls really pop!</li>
            <li>I have been a stylist for many years, and this is one product that I can&#x27;t get enough of.  </li>
            <li>and I bought it at the shop the first time.  </li>
            <li>Got it much cheaper here!</li>
            <li>At first I used it as a conditioner and rinsed it out, but I remember one of the reviews saying they used it as a leave in</li>
            <li>it curls and looks just great after using a small amount!</li>
            <li>This product instantly made my hair softer and insanely easy to manage.</li>
            <li>and I certainly recommend using it as a leave in because you get to keep all of the benefits of this product in your hair.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve always had beautiful long and super thick hair.</li>
            <li>so, my hair can be dull and this product surprisingly made it lustrous.</li>
            <li>This has really been a journey for me.</li>
            <li>It really softens and detangles.</li>
            <li>I probably won&#x27;t use the conditioner as my main conditioner for too much longer because once your hair is restored you dont&#x27; need to use as much</li>
            <li>I have tried so many products in hopes that my hair will respond the way I&#x27;ve seen products work for other people but to no avail.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS PRODUCT.</li>
            <li>Rare product to find in Southern California,</li>
            <li>don&#x27;t know if I care for the Mendex treatment, I will use it a few more times and monitor how my hair feels with it verses without it.  </li>
            <li>I guess it doesn&#x27;t work well with my highly porous natural hair.</li>
            <li>I am AA with 4 a/b type hair and I have been on natural hair journey since July of this year.  </li>
            <li>Oh, and my breakage is nearly completely gone.</li>
            <li>It is well known that black people tend to have very porous hair and therefore need to use certain products to restore or correct the porosity level so that hair will grow and respond properly to products.  </li>
            <li>I noticed a slight difference after first use and have noticed my hair improving each week since purchasing and using it.  </li>
            <li>So after doing the porosity test (place a few strands of freshly washed hair to room temperature water, let it sit for 2-3 mins and check to see if it has floated or sunk to the bottom) and finding out that I have high porosity hair one of the products suggested to restore balance is this product along with two other products.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been natural for 3 years and my major issues have been extremely dry hair and breakage.</li>
            <li>After shampooing and rinsing I put the conditioner on for 30 secs as recommended(more like a minute or 2 because it takes a little while to cover whole head)</li>

            <li> Made my 4c curls really pop! Bought the whole system and interested to see how it works all together!</li>
            <li> added 1 tsb to deep conditioner with heat and my hair was smoother. haven&#x27;t used before a relaxer yet since im stretching 6 months but in about two months i will.</li>
            <li> I have been a stylist for many years, and this is one product that I can&#x27;t get enough of.  Any product after some time needs to be switched, and then started back up again.  I have noticed that this is hardly the case with Porosity Control.  Don&#x27;t be fooled by the thinness of the conditioner- it&#x27;s the best I have ever used- and doesn&#x27;t leave a residue.  Awesome product- leaves your hair silky every time.</li>
            <li> Blessings to the people who created this great product. I&#x27;m AA and I&#x27;ve always had beautiful long and super thick hair. I&#x27;ve been natural for 3 years and my major issues have been extremely dry hair and breakage. This has really been a journey for me. I finally found a solution to my hair problems by using Roux Porosity Corrector 233. I recommend this to anyone suffering from dry hair.</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful conditioner. It really softens and detangles. I highly recommend this product. Fantastic.</li>
            <li> Rare product to find in Southern California, but you had it in STOCK. Also, you sent it to me in a timely manner! Most EXCELLENT Service!!!</li>
            <li> I have been using this conditioner for 3-4 years in conjunction with the Roux Porosity control shampoo.&lt;br /&gt;I have a lot of hair but it&#x27;s super-fine and colored.  These two products give me body with softness,&lt;br /&gt;no frizzies.  They seem to smooth the hair shaft leaving a nice shine as well.  The conditioner is very&lt;br /&gt;light weight but does the job better than thick, heavy conditioners I have tried in the past.</li>
            <li> I use this product to protect my hair from everything I want to do, pre-relaxer, pre-color, post neutralizer and pH restorer. It is really great.</li>
            <li> For problematic porous hairs or for humid weather is excellent</li>
            <li> It made my hair more crispy... I guess it doesn&#x27;t work well with my highly porous natural hair.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this product to anyone.  My hair feels great. My hair dresser recommended this product and I bought it at the shop the first time.  Got it much cheaper here!</li>
            <li> I am AA with 4 a/b type hair and I have been on natural hair journey since July of this year.  I have tried so many products in hopes that my hair will respond the way I&#x27;ve seen products work for other people but to no avail.  I then read up on reasons why hair may not hold moisture or be dull etc. on blackhairscience.com and one of the reasons given was the porosity of hair.  It is well known that black people tend to have very porous hair and therefore need to use certain products to restore or correct the porosity level so that hair will grow and respond properly to products.  So after doing the porosity test (place a few strands of freshly washed hair to room temperature water, let it sit for 2-3 mins and check to see if it has floated or sunk to the bottom) and finding out that I have high porosity hair one of the products suggested to restore balance is this product along with two other products.  So I bought this product, along with the shampoo, mendex treatment and the leave in spray (yellow bottle).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t know if I care for the Mendex treatment, I will use it a few more times and monitor how my hair feels with it verses without it.  The shampoo is okay, I haven&#x27;t really used it as much as I don&#x27;t shampoo my hair that often however the conditioner is great!  I noticed a slight difference after first use and have noticed my hair improving each week since purchasing and using it.  I notice that my hair holds moisture better than before and it&#x27;s not as dull as before. I did a porosity test my last wash and a few of my hairs floated!!! I also love the leave in spray as it has a really nice smell and does add a very nice sheen to my hair.  I will continue to use these products as I&#x27;m seeing good results with them.  I probably won&#x27;t use the conditioner as my main conditioner for too much longer because once your hair is restored you dont&#x27; need to use as much so I will probably continue use for another month and then after that I will just add a tbsp to my deep conditioning treatment.  As for the leave in I will continue to use this product and will make it a staple product for my hair.  I&#x27;ll do another update in another month or so about the Mendex treatment but the conditioner and leave in gets 5 stars from me!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**10/22 Update**&lt;br /&gt;For the past 2 weeks I&#x27;ve been using the shampoo and conditioner together and I&#x27;ve found the results to be much better than using the conditioner alone.  After shampooing and rinsing I put the conditioner on for 30 secs as recommended(more like a minute or 2 because it takes a little while to cover whole head) and then I rinse out and deep condition with a moisturing conditioner (Suave Coconut or Herbal Essence Hello Hydration)mixed with coconut or olive oil and leave on for 30 mins under my heating cap.  My hair has been softer and shinier and I just did a strand test again this morning and as opposed to a few weeks ago when just a few of the strands I put from different sections in my hair floated this time \\&quot;ALL\\&quot; of my hairs FLOATED!!I am so pleased and happy that I have found this product!!  I strongly recommend buying both the shampoo and the conditioner and using them togther I believe you&#x27;ll find the results much better than using the conditioner alone!o my deep conditioning treatment.  As for the leave in I will continue to use this product and will make it a staple product for my hair.  I&#x27;ll do another update in another month or so about the Mendex treatment but the conditioner and leave in gets 5 stars from me!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**10/22 Update**&lt;br /&gt;For the past 2 weeks I&#x27;ve been using the shampoo and conditioner together and I&#x27;ve found the results to be much better than using the conditioner alone.

I strongly recommend buying both the shampoo and the conditioner and using them togther I believe you&#x27;ll find the results much better than using the conditioner alone!</li>
            <li> I have tightly coiled African American hair. Roux porosity Control Corrector and Conditioner makes it feel soft, healthy and it curls and looks just great after using a small amount! I use it as a leave in conditioner. My hair is effortless. I will be purchasing it again.</li>
            <li> Works great for 3 different heads of AA hair here.  Chemical and natural,  2 thick and 1 fine haired.  Leaves hair feeling more smooth, shiny and easy to detangle.  Have tried after conditioning and mixed in with conditioner, worked well both ways.</li>
            <li> I have been using it a few years. It helps me decrease breakage.</li>
            <li> I have colored dreadlocks that I bleached. The bleach totally stripped my hair; this porosity control product was recommened to me by Yonni Thompson (yonnired) world renowed loctician. This product has done WONDERD for my dreadlocks! Loveee it</li>
            <li> I saw a difference in my hair the first time I used it! My hair was breaking off like crazy and was dry even when I would moisturize it. I came across the product on youtube because the person said it could help bring moisture into your hair and make it soft and healthy. This product instantly made my hair softer and insanely easy to manage. I also noticed it made it stronger and shinier. I am African American so, my hair can be dull and this product surprisingly made it lustrous. I am so happy I ran across this. It is officially my holy grail leave in conditioner, I have only used a little so far and already want to buy another one and possibly try the shampoo. At first I used it as a conditioner and rinsed it out, but I remember one of the reviews saying they used it as a leave in and I certainly recommend using it as a leave in because you get to keep all of the benefits of this product in your hair. Oh, and my breakage is nearly completely gone. My hair looks and feels healthier, this product made a difference for me instantly, so if you are having the problems I was having, like dryness and breakage...I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS PRODUCT.</li>
