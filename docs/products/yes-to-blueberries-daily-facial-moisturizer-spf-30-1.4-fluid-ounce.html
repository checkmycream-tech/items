            <li>It smells clean but not fragranced.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s good if you wear it under makeup, but the lotion will leave your skin looking white if you wear it bare-faced.&lt;br</li>

            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m sorry to give this review, as I actually love the yes to line, but you shouldn&#x27;t buy this product because you won&#x27;t be able to use it if people look at your face during your daily routine.</li>

            <li>this product really made me blue!  </li>
            <li>I used the product for the first time and was astonished when it looked white on my skin for several minutes.  </li>
            <li>Many spf products are very heavy and leave a white mask and this product does not.</li>
            <li>As a \\&quot;daily moisturizer,\\&quot; this product is completely useless.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only used it once so far, maybe I&#x27;ll update as I keep using.</li>
            <li>I applied my makeup as normal, but the moisturizer did not absorb at all and looked very strange under my makeup.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know if I liked how it felt, it felt kinda thick and heavy and didn&#x27;t spread too well.</li>

            <li> I will be going back to my previous daily facial moisturizer with SPF - Simple brand.</li>
            <li> The ingredients list on here is not complete.</li>
            <li> It really is either a thick whitish-blueish layer.</li>
            <li> Once rubbed in it makes a good base for makeup, with or without primer.</li>

            <li> I have to put moisturizer on afterward to compensate for the dry feeling this creates.</li>
            <li> But you just have to blend it in a little and it doesn&#x27;t look too obvious after a while.</li>
            <li> this time under my foundation and had several coworkers tell me how pale I looked.</li>
            <li> not greasy, a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> other Yes</li>
            <li> Okay, so people have complained that it&#x27;s thick and leaves a whitish gunk behind...</li>
            <li> I wan&#x27;t to like the products but have tried many and am often disappointed.</li>
            <li> While it has a good spf, it does no good if you CANT get it on your face :(.</li>
            <li> I use products like this rather sparingly, and I couldn&#x27;t even spread it thin enough to venture out into public.</li>
            <li> Small white residue that fades after a few minutes.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s thick and chalky white like zinc is.  </li>
            <li> Thick and WHITE film!!!</li>
            <li> Very heavy and made my skin a strange color.  </li>
            <li> What a let down.  </li>
            <li> And it doesn&#x27;t matter how much or little you use nor does emulsifying work.</li>
            <li> it is thick but it works well if you apply it carefully.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it because I don&#x27;t want to waste it</li>
            <li> Throughout the day, it felt like a mask and wearing it under my foundation was bad, my makeup slid right off.</li>
            <li> This moisturizer is to heavy and looks like toothpaste on your skin!  </li>
            <li> It feels very heavy too.  </li>
            <li> at least you get 45-75 spf.</li>
            <li> This stuff is thick and chalky, it does not spread at all and looks like chalk on your face.  </li>
            <li> This product laid on thick and did not spread well..</li>
            <li> This moisturizer is really, really thick.</li>
            <li> It goes on thick and you do have to rub it in to get it to absorb.</li>
            <li> But on a serious note, I use this and the nighttime lotion every night.</li>
            <li> The cream is of such a weird consistency that it is almost impossible to apply.</li>
            <li> otherwise, it&#x27;s really not a great product.</li>
            <li> Wrong.</li>
            <li> Possibly the worst moisturizer I&#x27;ve ever used.  </li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re unhappy with that, you have to rinse it</li>
            <li> that&#x27;s a step up from my neutrogena :(</li>
            <li> but this was a horrible exception.  </li>
            <li> This one was horrible.  </li>
            <li> For me, this product was terrible!  </li>
            <li> Terrible moisturizer.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I have been very happy with other Yes To products, but this was a horrible exception.  I tried to use it as a moisturizer, but it left a pasty bluish film all over my skin--I tried diluting it with water and another moisturizer, but to no avail. I applied my makeup as normal, but the moisturizer did not absorb at all and looked very strange under my makeup.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As a sunscreen, I am sure that this does its job well.  As a \\&quot;daily moisturizer,\\&quot; this product is completely useless.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only use I will have for this product is for Halloween.  The pasty bluish pallor will be perfect for a zombie or vampire costume.</li>
            <li> The cream is of such a weird consistency that it is almost impossible to apply. It remains on the skin as white patches and it takes a lot of effort to remove them. You end up scrubbing your face. Although once you make it  sink in it feels totally ok</li>
            <li> Okay, so people have complained that it&#x27;s thick and leaves a whitish gunk behind... it is thick but it works well if you apply it carefully. Too much- and you&#x27;ll look like a clown! But on a serious note, I use this and the nighttime lotion every night.</li>
            <li> I really enjoy this moisturizer for the fact that it:&lt;br /&gt;1. Gently moisturizes my sensitive/oily skin without causing any irritations&lt;br /&gt;2. Smells so refreshing&lt;br /&gt;3. Is a cruelty-free product&lt;br /&gt;4. Has SPF 30&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;1. It&#x27;s good if you wear it under makeup, but the lotion will leave your skin looking white if you wear it bare-faced.&lt;br /&gt;2. I didn&#x27;t notice a difference as far as wrinkles or age signs in my skin.</li>
            <li> great price for natural face lotion.  Small white residue that fades after a few minutes.  SPF30!  Use daily in the summer</li>
            <li> The ingredients list on here is not complete. Many of the online product listings do not have the current formulation which has CHANGED.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is the CURRENT ingredients list:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Active ingredients: Zinc Oxide (11.0%), Titanium Dioxide (6.2%)&lt;br /&gt;Inactive ingredients: Water, Vaccinium Cyanococcus (Blueberry) Fruit Juice, Ethylhexyl Palmitate, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Juice*, Hydrogenated Methyl Abietate, Glyceryl Stearate Citrate, Glycerin, Magnesium Aluminum Silicate, Aluminum Hydroxide, Onopordum Acanthium Flower/Leaf/Stem Extract, Cetearyl Alcohol, Phenethyl Alcohol, Alcohol, Sodium Magnesium Silicate, Glyceryl Caprylate, Xanthan Gum, Hydrated Silica, Triethoxycaprylylsilane, Limonene, Tocopherol, Fragrance, Linalool, Glycine Soja (Soybean) Oil, Citral, Geraniol, Citronellol.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Looks like it&#x27;s silicone-free right? Wrong. Triethoxycaprylylsilane is just another fancy name for a plain old silicone agent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sorry, Yes To, you&#x27;re going back to the store.</li>
            <li> yes i love this product and hope they never stop making it. great sun protection. not greasy, a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> this product really made me blue!  As a retired skin care specialist I was looking forward to a really good day cream.  What a let down.  This stuff is thick and chalky, it does not spread at all and looks like chalk on your face.  I do not recommend it.  While it has a good spf, it does no good if you CANT get it on your face :(.</li>
            <li> I wear this every day and love the way it blends in easily. Many spf products are very heavy and leave a white mask and this product does not. Applying this spf moisturizer has become part of my daily &amp;#34;warding off&amp;#34; the years routine.</li>
            <li> It does leave that white-ish sheen on the skin after application. But you just have to blend it in a little and it doesn&#x27;t look too obvious after a while. I am pretty happy with it as it has been very hard to find a mineral based facial sunscreen.</li>
            <li> This moisturizer is to heavy and looks like toothpaste on your skin!  I used the product for the first time and was astonished when it looked white on my skin for several minutes.  It feels very heavy too.  I used it a second time....this time under my foundation and had several coworkers tell me how pale I looked.</li>
            <li> Possibly the worst moisturizer I&#x27;ve ever used.  This should be kept along side with the sun screen products because that&#x27;s just what this is. It&#x27;s thick and chalky white like zinc is.  It leaves a gross film on your hands imagine what it&#x27;s doing to your face? And it doesn&#x27;t matter how much or little you use nor does emulsifying work.</li>
            <li> It leaves your face with a blue tint.</li>
            <li> Yeaaahhh this thing made me feel like I was turning into a ghost. It paints your face a bit. I don&#x27;t know if I liked how it felt, it felt kinda thick and heavy and didn&#x27;t spread too well. It smells spicy. I&#x27;ve only used it once so far, maybe I&#x27;ll update as I keep using. Also, it arrived with a closer expiration date than I&#x27;d like, it&#x27;s about 6 months.</li>
            <li> Love the natural ingredients; just not pleased with the way it lays on top of my face.  Doesn&#x27;t blend in well.</li>
            <li> This one was horrible.  The SPF and lotion separated and would not spread on my face.  They need to go back to the drawing&lt;br /&gt;Board on thus one</li>
            <li> note: I&#x27;ve found the whole Yes To brand very hit or miss. I wan&#x27;t to like the products but have tried many and am often disappointed. This is basically the same review I wrote for the grapefruit moisturizer with spf 15. Same goes for the blueberries except more so &gt;&gt;&gt; It&#x27;s pasty and doesn&#x27;t seem moisturizing at all. It feels like one of those heavy-duty oil-free sports sunbolcks for a day at the beach... except with those at least you get 45-75 spf. I&#x27;ve been using it because I don&#x27;t want to waste it and it&#x27;s dryness is kind of a plus for the recent heatwave here in NY, but when the temperature goes back below 90 again, I&#x27;ll need a real moisturizer</li>
            <li> Thick and WHITE film!!! Can&#x27;t comment further cause I returned it!!!</li>
            <li> For me, this product was terrible!  Very heavy and made my skin a strange color.  Throughout the day, it felt like a mask and wearing it under my foundation was bad, my makeup slid right off. As icing on the cake, the pump mechanism broke after one day of use and for the rest of the week I had to remove the pump and coax the lotion out by banging it on my hand.  I think it was the universe telling me not to use this product.&lt;br /&gt;Back on the prowl for a great moisturizer for my 40-something skin.</li>
            <li> This product laid on thick and did not spread well..and it was kinda bluish/purplish. I washed it off immediately and I am taking it back to Ulta. My neutrogena (back up SPF moisturizer) lays on and glides better than the Y2B SPF... Hopefully I can find another moisturizer with Spf that&#x27;s a step up from my neutrogena :(</li>
            <li> This moisturizer is really, really thick. I use products like this rather sparingly, and I couldn&#x27;t even spread it thin enough to venture out into public. It reminded me of those sunblock commercials where the kids are going around with a white streak of sunscreen across their noses. Now, this definitely smells much better than sunscreen, but it&#x27;s the same consistency as in those commercials. The only difference is that you can&#x27;t get your skin to absorb it at all like you can with sunscreen. It really is either a thick whitish-blueish layer. If you&#x27;re unhappy with that, you have to rinse it off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this for daily use. Perhaps it would be suited to daily use if your daily tasks included lounging on the beach...otherwise, it&#x27;s really not a great product. It might be wonderful for your skin, and it smells delicious, but I can&#x27;t attest to my skin&#x27;s reaction to it because I was unwilling to wear it outside.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m sorry to give this review, as I actually love the yes to line, but you shouldn&#x27;t buy this product because you won&#x27;t be able to use it if people look at your face during your daily routine. You will look like the ghost of a smurf with your white-blue face.</li>
            <li> Terrible moisturizer. It&#x27;s like an anti-moisturizer. I have to put moisturizer on afterward to compensate for the dry feeling this creates. I will be going back to my previous daily facial moisturizer with SPF - Simple brand.</li>
            <li> I bought this product because I was looking for a daily moisturizer without chemical sunscreens. This one fit the bill and didn&#x27;t have alot of other stuff in it. It smells clean but not fragranced. It goes on thick and you do have to rub it in to get it to absorb. Once rubbed in it makes a good base for makeup, with or without primer. I find the mineral sunscreens last longer than they claim and feel like I am still getting some protection by the end of they day as long as I am not sweating or swimming.</li>
