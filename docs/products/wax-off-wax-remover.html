    <ol>
            <li>Excellent product</li>
            <li>This is perfect if waxing at home</li>
            <li>I bought this product and love it!!!</li>
            <li>Great wax product.</li>
            <li>Works great at removing wax</li>
            <li>it has a pleasant smell</li>
            <li>and you need to clean off the wax residue !!!</li>
            <li>It DOES NOT remove sticky wax residue easily!!</li>
            <li>It does smell good and has a pleasant lotion feel, but it is would be more cost effective to just use baby oil.</li>
            <li>Had to resort to olive oil (which worked magically and washes off with water!)</li>
            <li>I love this product!</li>
            <li>I do my own waxing at home</li>
            <li>Amazon has the absolute best price for this product as well.</li>
            <li>I had to use olive oil, which I saw on internet to use, and it worked much better.</li>
            <li>Azulene Oil Aftercare By Parissa is much better.</li>
            <li>And oil- olive, baby, etc- should work just as well, if not WAY better and be cheaper (or lying around your house already).</li>
            <li>The product is ok, and it does work, but so does vegetable  or mineral oil for a fraction of the cost.</li>
            <li>works ok, have to wear gloves and rinse well after use</li>
            <li>use all GiGi products and love them</li>
            <li>Smells pretty good too.</li>
            <li>Works as expected and smells great!</li>
            <li>Wax off does a good job of removing wax, but leaves your hands feeling really greasy.</li>
            <li>It smells good, is cool and refreshing on contact, and removes wax very well.</li>
            <li>it is so easy to use with the instruction book and the wax</li>
            <li>The wax really comes off and the smell is really nice.</li>
            <li>I got wax off when i bought my wax warmer and this helps remove and wax left after you are done waxing and works great</li>
            <li>the once I am not using and have one bottle in the drower where the rest of my waxing things are and it fit</li>
            <li>You won&#x27;t have to rub your face off to clean the wax off with Wax off.</li>
            <li>Had a not so pleasant waxing experience and had a lot of extra wax on my skin/hair.</li>
            <li>Luckily (I thought to myself)</li>
            <li>It works perfect to remove those little spots of wax that stick to your skin after or during the waxing, I feel a soft scent of coconut</li>
            <li>This product is well worth the money.</li>
            <li>WELL WORTH THE MONEY.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s worth it to go ahead and buy this item to remove the wax residue.  </li>
            <li>I would recommend this to anyone that waxes at home or other wise.</li>
            <li>And it went right off and gave the room a smell of coconut, which is not the smell of the baby oil.</li>
            <li>This wipes it right off.  </li>
            <li>First time user.</li>
            <li>The first time you wax and try to get the leftovers off, its a nightmare.</li>
            <li>I bought this immediately after waxing the first time.</li>
            <li>I first discovered this stuff because my salon uses it, and have been using it for years.</li>
            <li>Any standard body oil works better.</li>
            <li>This product really works!</li>
            <li>and it takes so much to get the wax off your body...</li>
            <li>I also find that after waxing, the lotion is very soothing to the skin.</li>
            <li>This product didn&#x27;t work for me - it doesn&#x27;t really remove anything.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Loved other Gigi products, but this didn&#x27;t remove the extra I missed.</li>
            <li>I am used to using azulene oil which is by far superior to any brand-name wax remover on the market..don&#x27;t waste your money on Gigi Wax Off!!</li>
            <li>Products arrived on time and was brand new as promised.</li>
            <li>and I can&#x27;t live without this lotion.</li>
            <li>Smells yummy and for the most past gets the job done.</li>
            <li>This happened to me when the wax would not pull off and formed clumps in my sensitive area.  </li>
            <li>although it loosens hard-wax, it won&#x27;t remove it completely.  </li>
            <li>This product dissolves hair, but may irritate sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I purchased a soft wax (also from Gigi), and lo and behold, still DOESN&#x27;T work.</li>
            <li>It immediately takes it off and makes your skin feel soft.</li>
            <li>since hard-wax didn&#x27;t come off completely with the lotion, it left this shiny mark that would not come off unless you scraped it.  </li>
            <li>Smells nice, but so useless.</li>
            <li>I own a small studio and wax men and women everyday.</li>
            <li>The BB OIl moisturizer is less expensive but doesn&#x27;t smell as good as the coconut scented Gigi.</li>

            <li> The BB OIl moisturizer is less expensive but doesn&#x27;t smell as good as the coconut scented Gigi.</li>
            <li> first I thought it was because I used Gigi hard wax</li>
            <li> I was very hesitant in getting this because of the negative reviews.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t remove the residual wax, was a complete waste.</li>
            <li> The &#x27;lotion&#x27;is creamy green and the carpet become soft.</li>
            <li> beats the heck out of pulling the wax or scraping it off the skin highly reccomend if you are using a hard wax</li>
            <li> It sort of dissolves the wax, which made removal even more messy, but the wax is still sticky and difficult to remove.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I tried a million other things and only one other item worked as well as this product.  </li>
            <li> Maybe, I am strange, but I do not like the feel of oil on my skin, so I avoid the other \\&quot;oil\\&quot; wax remover products.</li>
            <li> Be careful if you want to just try this out.</li>
            <li> Just a little goes a long ways.</li>
            <li> I actually gave this product a few tries, but it was too messy and not worth the effort.</li>
            <li> I could use half the bottle and the wax still wouldn&#x27;t come off all the way.</li>
            <li> you have to remove excess lotion with towel (NOT tissue) because the lotion turns really creamy and won&#x27;t wash off if you try to wash it out with water -- it reminded me of cold cream.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I felt this lotion was a waste of money.</li>
            <li> This is a waste of money.  </li>
            <li> No kind of wax I&#x27;ve ever used, Gigi or otherwise, has ever been remotely affected by this product.</li>
            <li> but this one was really a waste of my money.</li>
            <li> /&gt;- although it&#x27;s 16oz, I used up half of the bottle trying to remove small patches of hard-wax in my pubic region.</li>
            <li> helps disolve little wax bits that happen when using a hard wax.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to just rinse the Wax Off off your hands with just water.</li>
            <li> it does slighly loosens hard-wax to the point where you can pull it off slowly or use tweezers to yank it</li>
            <li> As a result when you pull-it off slowly the wax is still stuck to your skin -- painful.&lt;br</li>
            <li> This is thick as a cream...</li>
            <li> You have to use a lot and rub it in very hard to get it off.</li>
            <li> I attemped to do a sphinx wax on my chacha using Gigi&#x27;s Brazilian Hard Wax -- FYI hard wax turns hard when you leave it on... which is extremely painful in your pubic region when it does not come off.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately I didn&#x27;t try it until after the 30 day return period.</li>
            <li> Fail.</li>
            <li> You are crazy not to get it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;ll just make you frustrated.</li>
            <li> but this one product is horrible :(</li>
            <li> I hated waxing before I bought this product</li>
            <li> I was very disappointed with this product.</li>

            <li> I would give Gigi Wax remover zero stars if I could...It DOES NOT remove sticky wax residue easily!! I am used to using azulene oil which is by far superior to any brand-name wax remover on the market..don&#x27;t waste your money on Gigi Wax Off!!</li>
            <li> It did not work at all for me. First time user. Loved other Gigi products, but this didn&#x27;t remove the extra I missed. I had to use olive oil, which I saw on internet to use, and it worked much better. Save your money.</li>
            <li> Great wax product. I always reorder it.</li>
            <li> Wax off does a good job of removing wax, but leaves your hands feeling really greasy. It&#x27;s hard to just rinse the Wax Off off your hands with just water. It requires some abrasive soap, but it gets the wax off so I guess that&#x27;s what counts!</li>
            <li> I attemped to do a sphinx wax on my chacha using Gigi&#x27;s Brazilian Hard Wax -- FYI hard wax turns hard when you leave it on... which is extremely painful in your pubic region when it does not come off.  This happened to me when the wax would not pull off and formed clumps in my sensitive area.  Overall:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PROS:&lt;br /&gt;- it does slighly loosens hard-wax to the point where you can pull it off slowly or use tweezers to yank it off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- it has a pleasant smell&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS:&lt;br /&gt;- although it loosens hard-wax, it won&#x27;t remove it completely.  As a result when you pull-it off slowly the wax is still stuck to your skin -- painful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- since hard-wax didn&#x27;t come off completely with the lotion, it left this shiny mark that would not come off unless you scraped it.  This happened everytime I used it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- you have to remove excess lotion with towel (NOT tissue) because the lotion turns really creamy and won&#x27;t wash off if you try to wash it out with water -- it reminded me of cold cream.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- although it&#x27;s 16oz, I used up half of the bottle trying to remove small patches of hard-wax in my pubic region.</li>
            <li> I felt this lotion was a waste of money. You have to use a lot and rub it in very hard to get it off. The wax rolls up and eventually comes off. Even then, you can feel the residue still there. Azulene Oil Aftercare By Parissa is much better.</li>
            <li> The wax really comes off and the smell is really nice. What else to expect?</li>
            <li> Did not work at all. Didn&#x27;t remove the residual wax, was a complete waste. Unfortunately I didn&#x27;t try it until after the 30 day return period.</li>
            <li> Had a not so pleasant waxing experience and had a lot of extra wax on my skin/hair. Luckily (I thought to myself) I bought the wax remover! Except it didn&#x27;t actually remove any of the wax. Had to resort to olive oil (which worked magically and washes off with water!) to get the wax off. And oil- olive, baby, etc- should work just as well, if not WAY better and be cheaper (or lying around your house already).</li>
            <li> This is a waste of money.  It does smell good and has a pleasant lotion feel, but it is would be more cost effective to just use baby oil.</li>
            <li> This is thick as a cream... and it takes so much to get the wax off your body... If you use any oil or lotion it will take same effort and time. So no value addition by this product.</li>
            <li> This product dissolves hair, but may irritate sensitive skin. Please use with caution as the stated instructions suggest.</li>
            <li> I was very hesitant in getting this because of the negative reviews. I did not try it on my body yet, however, I did try it on the carpet because I had some sticky wax on it from a couple of days. I put some of it with some baby oil on a sponge and scrubbed the floor. And it went right off and gave the room a smell of coconut, which is not the smell of the baby oil. The &#x27;lotion&#x27;is creamy green and the carpet become soft.</li>
            <li> I bought this product and love it!!! it is so easy to use with the instruction book and the wax does not leave my skin irritated.</li>
            <li> Works great at removing wax</li>
            <li> I hated waxing before I bought this product because getting the residual wax off was such a pain.  This wipes it right off.  You have to get this is you wax anything!</li>
            <li> I love this product! Smells yummy and for the most past gets the job done. Products arrived on time and was brand new as promised. Thank you for your honesty!</li>
            <li> I got wax off when i bought my wax warmer and this helps remove and wax left after you are done waxing and works great I would recommend this to anyone that waxes at home or other wise.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know how this thing works for others, but for me this just does not work. I applied the lotion to an area which has residual wax and attempted to wipe it off with paper towel and it did nothing. I have attempted this several times but it does not work for me. I regularly wax and I am quite a pro at it now. I have always used Gigi products (wax, wax warmer, muslin strips n spatulas) but this one product is horrible :(</li>
            <li> It works perfect to remove those little spots of wax that stick to your skin after or during the waxing, I feel a soft scent of coconut and I like it.&lt;br /&gt;I received 4 bottles of 4oz each instead of one big bottle of 16oz wich I like because I can store the once I am not using and have one bottle in the drower where the rest of my waxing things are and it fit perfect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recomend it a 100%</li>
            <li> The product is ok, and it does work, but so does vegetable  or mineral oil for a fraction of the cost.</li>
            <li> Smells nice, but so useless. I could use half the bottle and the wax still wouldn&#x27;t come off all the way. It sort of dissolves the wax, which made removal even more messy, but the wax is still sticky and difficult to remove.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At first I thought it was because I used Gigi hard wax so this remover doesn&#x27;t work. I purchased a soft wax (also from Gigi), and lo and behold, still DOESN&#x27;T work. Fail. I actually gave this product a few tries, but it was too messy and not worth the effort.</li>
            <li> This product is well worth the money. The first time you wax and try to get the leftovers off, its a nightmare. Nothing seems to get it off. I bought this immediately after waxing the first time. WELL WORTH THE MONEY. You are crazy not to get it. It immediately takes it off and makes your skin feel soft. Smells pretty good too. Definitely recommend this for anyone who waxes at home.</li>
            <li> I first discovered this stuff because my salon uses it, and have been using it for years. It smells good, is cool and refreshing on contact, and removes wax very well.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for years now. I do my own waxing at home and I can&#x27;t live without this lotion. Maybe, I am strange, but I do not like the feel of oil on my skin, so I avoid the other \\&quot;oil\\&quot; wax remover products. I have never had an issue with it not doing what it&#x27;s supposed to do. I also find that after waxing, the lotion is very soothing to the skin. Amazon has the absolute best price for this product as well.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s worth it to go ahead and buy this item to remove the wax residue.  I tried a million other things and only one other item worked as well as this product.  It was an item called BB Oil Moisturizer http://www.amazon.com/BB-Moisturizer-Hair-Lotion-Pack/dp/B000KOM40K.  The BB OIl moisturizer is less expensive but doesn&#x27;t smell as good as the coconut scented Gigi.</li>
            <li> No kind of wax I&#x27;ve ever used, Gigi or otherwise, has ever been remotely affected by this product. It&#x27;ll just make you frustrated. It just ruined the clothes I had to put on my sticky wax-laden body to go to the store and buy baby oil for $2.</li>
            <li> works ok, have to wear gloves and rinse well after use</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe I&#x27;ve waxed for years and never used this product before. You won&#x27;t have to rub your face off to clean the wax off with Wax off. Just a little goes a long ways. Excellent product</li>
            <li> I was very disappointed with this product. It does not remove any wax at all. Any standard body oil works better. I would not recommend this product. Be careful if you want to just try this out. You have to pay for return shipping costs.</li>
            <li> I own a small studio and wax men and women everyday. This product didn&#x27;t work for me - it doesn&#x27;t really remove anything.&lt;br /&gt;I use all GiGi products and love them but this one was really a waste of my money.</li>
            <li> This is perfect if waxing at home and you need to clean off the wax residue !!! Gets if off while conditioning the skin as well !!!</li>
            <li> The instruments needed.</li>
            <li> helps disolve little wax bits that happen when using a hard wax. beats the heck out of pulling the wax or scraping it off the skin highly reccomend if you are using a hard wax</li>
            <li> This product really works!</li>
            <li> Works as expected and smells great!</li>
