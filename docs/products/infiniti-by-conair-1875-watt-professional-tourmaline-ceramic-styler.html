            <li>because I think it looks great.    </li>
            <li>and this one is really great.</li>
            <li>The fact that the hair dryer is an all in one is great.</li>
            <li>This is a great feature as well.    </li>
            <li>The straightening attachment with the rotating head is a great idea</li>
            <li>but that looks like it would work great, too.</li>
            <li>I tried the straightening attachment five times (even read the booklet on how to use the dryer) and my results were not that great.  </li>
            <li>I can straighten for longer periods of time with no fatigue, so it&#x27;s great for doing things</li>
            <li>straightening attachment is great.  </li>

            <li>I love this product it is awesome.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so excited!!!  </li>
            <li>Good dryer.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Conclusion:  Good quality hair dryer.  </li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s a good one.</li>
            <li>good:  </li>
            <li>Good value in my opinion though,</li>
            <li>However, the medium setting was perfect for a light blow out.  </li>
            <li>The concentrator is a good addition too...</li>
            <li>but its good to know i have it in case</li>
            <li>The handle is comfortable and the balance is excellent.  </li>
            <li>- The Sure-shot attachment is good to use with a roller brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t run into any exceptional problems here.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t run into any exceptional problems here.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Arrived quickly, with a Bed, Bath and Beyond price sticker for $34.99!!!</li>
            <li>The straightening attachment was very interesting,</li>
            <li>- Ideally, it would have the ability to fold which would make it easier to fit into your suitcase.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Very easy to use and does a good job drying and straightening hair.</li>
            <li>For those of you who are first trying this, it may take time figuring out what works best for you.  </li>
            <li>I love that about this CONAIR dryer!</li>
            <li>blowout effect that most of us are looking for!</li>
            <li>I am enjoying the saved time in the bathroom!  </li>
            <li>The first time she used it, she wasn&#x27;t too impressed.</li>
            <li>To say I&#x27;m pleased is an understatment!    </li>
            <li>My first impressions of this hairdryer are excellent.  </li>
            <li>My curls never looked better!</li>
            <li>I love this product!  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a great, manageable size and easy to use compared to my full-size dryer/diffuser.</li>
            <li>I think the Infiniti would probably be ideal for a woman with thinner hair who can blow-dry it fairly quickly and doesn&#x27;t want to deal with an iron.</li>
            <li>and I thought it would be great for a smooth blowout.  </li>
            <li>The diffuser attachment feels nice on the scalp.  </li>
            <li>Some sort of bag or case would be nice to store the attachments.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This product is nothing more than a glorified hair dryer, and not even a good one...</li>
            <li>It has a nice weight.  </li>
            <li>I liked it.  </li>
            <li>Honestly, I don&#x27;t know whether it makes my style stay one nanosecond longer than it would have</li>
            <li>the rubber tips on the diffuser massage my head nicely.  </li>
            <li>The diffuser is a nice touch for the days when you don&#x27;t want to go through the hassle of hair straightening.</li>
            <li>i want to curl my locks with concentrated warm air...    </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never been terribly adept at styling my own hair.</li>
            <li>I am going to go from someone who put their hair in a ponytail and forgot about it to someone who makes it look nice every day.  </li>
            <li>But I&#x27;m really quite impressed with it!&lt;br</li>
            <li>Nice curved handle to hold.  </li>
            <li>THRILLED WITH THIS PRODUCT.</li>
            <li>So, I&#x27;d like to add to that opinion with my own experiences.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Works great on my rediculously full head of hair.</li>
            <li>I am a devoted Conair customer for many years and don&#x27;t understand how an amazing, one of a kind, miraculous hair styling tool like this could not have caught on.  </li>
            <li>My hair breaks very, very easily, and I&#x27;m wondering if using the straightening attachment might worsen that.</li>
            <li>I am liking this gadget more and more each day!</li>
            <li>But to my surprise, my hair looked, well, pretty darn good afterward!</li>
            <li>The dryer seemed to be a nice product, but I bought it mostly for the diffuser attachment, which was defective.  </li>
            <li>The plates on this Infiniti version are better, smoothing out the hair follicle nicely and quicker.</li>
            <li>Love, love, love this!  </li>
            <li>only giving it 4 stars because i think i wuld&#x27;ve loved it to have more settings for better heat control, but otherwise it is perfect!</li>
            <li>in all, for the weekend warrior or occasional blow-dryer consumer, this is a great value and a great buy.</li>
            <li>It has good power and dries hair quickly  </li>
            <li>I happily received my order really quick and was excited to start using the product.</li>
            <li>Was looking for a hairdryer with a short barrel and be able to use it with the voluminizer/diffuser attached ~ this one was close to perfect!!!!</li>
            <li>My daughter and I love it.  </li>
            <li>It is great because my hair is straight and not frizzy and it didn&#x27;t take any longer than just drying it.</li>
            <li>So when I used this blow dryer  to blow out my roots, it just lightly blows it out from, kinky to coily!</li>
            <li>Although this dryer does an okay job, by comparison, well there just is no comparison.  </li>
            <li>I also like that it has a diffuser attachment for when I wear my hair curly, which is most of the time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I blew it off, not realizing it was the dryer giving me the static.  </li>
            <li>just more static.  </li>
            <li>never had static in my hair in my 49 years on this earth.  </li>
            <li>I just did an internet search and many sources say that ion-producing hair dryers ELIMINATE static.  </li>
            <li>(so much so that I can put mousse and hairspray in it and get a great wave/curl).  </li>
            <li>but it feels more like &#x27;low/medium&#x27; to me</li>
            <li>The Infiniti hair designer pro by conair is a hairdryer/styler combo with a number of interesting attachments.</li>
            <li>no, but noticeably better.  </li>
            <li>and I got even better results.  </li>
            <li>This was probably a fluke since most people have reviewed this item favorably and not mentioned a problem fitting the attachments.  </li>
            <li>and I wasn&#x27;t sure why.  </li>
            <li>My fingers were at the top of the on/off heat buttons</li>
            <li>I use the straightner the most.</li>
            <li>so I love to use a diffuser...to keep them looking like that...</li>
            <li>I am totally in love with it.</li>
            <li>It is modern-looking and stylish.  </li>
            <li>so for me this is \\&quot;short\\&quot; :)</li>
            <li>so at this point I&#x27;ve had many years of practice for dealing with that sort of thing.</li>
            <li>My guess is people will eventually find a better place to store it.     </li>
            <li>Love this item.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had it for more than 3 years now.</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t sure the straightening attachment would work for me --</li>
            <li>I absolutely love the volumizer attachment (I think people refer to it as a diffuser).  </li>
            <li>So, thank you, thank you, and thank you for having this product available!  </li>
            <li>so I don&#x27;t overheat my hair and cause more damage.  </li>
            <li>I will say, I am in love with these kinds of diffusers,</li>
            <li>This is perfect and lives in my gym bag making occasional visits to my suitcase.  </li>
            <li>Most people are buying this hairdryer for the straightening attachment</li>
            <li>In addition, the attachment did not straighten any better than using a brush and hair dryer.  </li>
            <li>Shame on me for not checking prices, but it discouraging that this type of activity takes place with a company as reputable as this.</li>
            <li>Still enjoying it.  </li>
            <li>SATISFIED.</li>
            <li>I love this dryer because it helps me with both styles.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The hairdryer also includes three heat settings and two speed settings and a cool shot button all of which are easy to use and placed in a good location on the handle.    </li>
            <li>Fast delivery also!!!!  </li>
            <li>I was very excited about this product, since it would cut out a step in the process of drying and straightening my hair.</li>
            <li>She said it makes her hair nice and curly when using the diffuser, but doesn&#x27;t think it is anything special.      </li>
            <li>It took a little bit to get used to it and figure out what worked best for me as far as handling it, but once I got it, I loved it!!!  </li>
            <li>Even the best irons by themselves take way too long for me to straighten.  </li>
            <li>Nice quality, solid appliance  Attractive and stylish</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t need a straightener, but the diffuser and concentrator are good tools to style my hair, and I like that the dryer doesn&#x27;t get too hot</li>
            <li>With this hair dryer and the tools to style the hair, I am able to get ready fast and my hair looks shinny and looks great!</li>
            <li>I was hopeful that the Conair 224 with straightener attachment would be easy to use and work well for me so that I could straighten my hair more often.      </li>
            <li>It adds fullness, but it is easy to overdo and to end up with much more than wanted.  </li>
            <li>I gave the button a quick press two or three times wondering where the &#x27;cool&#x27; was, before it occurred to &#x27;bright bulb&#x27; (me) to keep my finger on the pulse - so to speak.    </li>
            <li>The straightening attachment is pretty cool, but your hair will need to be shoulder length or longer for it to be very effective.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t use diffusers so I didn&#x27;t get to try that out and those attachments, but overall a very good dryer</li>
            <li>Using this hair dryer leaves my hair more shiny and smooth than anything else I&#x27;ve tried.  </li>
            <li>and I love the cool blast button, it makes the heat more manageable.</li>
            <li>However, I found the Infiniti to smooth my hair a bit better compared to the Revlon dryer.  </li>
            <li>The accessories are nice although I rarely use them.</li>
            <li>They make the greatest hair dryers and flat irons because their products are created with the most useful and state of the art features in mind.  </li>
            <li>I recommended the previous Conair Infiniti, and I&#x27;m happy to report the new version is an improvement on an already excellent design.</li>
            <li>it would give me waves...not true!</li>
            <li>I am excited to try out the diffuser attachment :)</li>
            <li>This dryer looks SO cool!  </li>
            <li>I did not find the straightening attachment easy to use.  </li>
            <li>so maneuvering is much easy with this one...</li>
            <li>She liked the feel of the Infiniti as it was light and felt powerful (even when she dropped in on the floor and it kept running).</li>
            <li>It is easy to use as well.</li>
            <li>- The cord tangles easily</li>
            <li>- The hair dryer does not have any anti-slip surface, and easily slide off</li>
            <li>Nice flip out cover on the back mesh that covers the air intake, for easy cleaning  Good manual with lots of tips on using the dryer and attachments    </li>
            <li>After 3 passes over, I had a beautiful blow out that didn&#x27;t revert as soon as I left the section.  </li>
            <li>I have lots of fine wavy hair.</li>
            <li>These worked fine.    </li>
            <li>/&gt;This isn&#x27;t a cheap hairdryer, to be sure, but it&#x27;s a great one stop item for a man and a woman to share, each able to get just the right style using the various attachments.</li>
            <li>Using it as a regular hairdryer, it is great - it had a lot of power and dries my hair very quickly if I&#x27;m in a rush.    </li>
            <li>So overall I would say that it is more than fairly and good hair dryer because it dries quickly, leaving my hair feeling light, SOFT and SMOOTH and the after smell is of the product not the burning effect!</li>
            <li>The diffuser attachment is huge - 5\\&quot; across by 4\\&quot; tall, including the spikes.      </li>
            <li>This is a HUGE plus for me.  </li>
            <li>I know, this isn&#x27;t a huge issue, and I&#x27;m not even taking a star off for it.</li>
            <li>I was happy that this one has the extra attachments and adjustable heat settings.   </li>
            <li>There is no product like it available anymore.  </li>
            <li>Fast, effective straightener.  </li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t fit onto the end of the dryer nozzle.  </li>
            <li>But there are times in which attention becomes important.  </li>
            <li>Same great product, trusted brand.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s important to grab the ends of the hair and keep them taut as the dryer is pulled through.</li>
            <li>Overall this is a great product and recommended.</li>
            <li>and I really enjoy that our hair dries abut 25% than with</li>
            <li>The concentrator for getting the frizz out of my ends, the straightener for great overall coverage and uniform smooth/shine, and the diffuser for...well, diffusing.</li>
            <li>Today it started to sound as if one piece inside the dryer had detached itself and the motor was grinding</li>
            <li>This dryer absolutely lives up to the hype!!!  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a great product, not noisy like others, works very well, not heavy, easy to use.  </li>
            <li>It is wonderfully wavy and long, not needing too much attention.</li>
            <li>It is super easy to straighten your hair and saves on the frying of a straighting iron.</li>
            <li>The Infiniti was the best blow dryer I had ever had, that dried my hair quickly, with a minimum of damage and a maximum of smoothness.</li>
            <li>I was excited about this product as I straighten my hair, and any way to make it easier is of interest.    </li>
            <li>You had to hold it and pull the hair through, and I did not find that this significantly straightened my hair at all.    </li>
            <li>This is a great product that could use a couple of minor improvements.    </li>
            <li>It is important to read it to get the full use of this product.     </li>
            <li>And when I first received it, it seemed rather overwhelming, with all of the pieces and a good-sized manual.</li>
            <li>I was excited about an attachment that could decrease the ironing time.  </li>
            <li>user friendly.  </li>
            <li>It really straightening nicely without any hassle and was a great way for her to get everything as she wanted without depending on other tools.&lt;br</li>
            <li>After I pressed the buttons, I tugged on the attachment gently to make sure it was on securely.  </li>
            <li>That&#x27;s right ladies, a 1!  </li>
            <li>The reviews are right!  </li>
            <li>The drying action is fast and the designed attachments really do a nice job at straightening the hair!</li>
            <li>me, I wasn&#x27;t interested as much in the straightening, but wanted something that would allow me to nicely style my, admittedly, thinning hair without making it look over managed.  </li>
            <li>The one i have is really not that great..</li>
            <li>Okay, so it does not bone straight-blow-out your hair, but it does protect your hair fiber from over exposure to the high heat!</li>
            <li>appearance  Versatile - comes with straightener, diffuser and concentrator attachments  Two fan speed settings and 3 heat settings + a cool button to set your style  </li>
            <li>The cool shot button:  </li>
            <li>if I did not use the \\&quot;cool shot\\&quot; button.  </li>
            <li>What I do know is that you have to keep the button depressed for the \\&quot;cool shot\\&quot; to work.  </li>
            <li>&quot; The cool blast of air after drying helps, too.</li>
            <li>The concentrator is to be used to \\&quot;set\\&quot; the style with cool air.</li>
            <li>The diffuser performs well, and the soft rubbery tips are kind to the scalp.  </li>
            <li>dryer itself is fairly compact, though the pieces (especially the diffuser) take up a lot of room in my cabinet.</li>
            <li>The Cool Blast button is a plus, and I always appreciate a dryer with that function.</li>
            <li>I also cannot state that this product does not work very well, as there were just too many variables to throw of the results.  </li>
            <li>Revlon RV544 1875 Watt Tourmaline Ionic Lightweight Dryer, Silver/Black]]which is a 1875 watt, same as the Infiti, which I have loved for two years.  </li>
            <li>Well be returning immediately for a full refund.</li>
            <li>and has nice soft rubbery fingers.  </li>
            <li>Cool</li>
            <li>cool cool.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Review:  Not bad, not bad at all.  </li>
            <li>It works fairly well, but I&#x27;m not 100% convinced that it works better than just using a vented hairbrush while blow-drying, although my hair is less frizzy.  </li>
            <li>I am always very busy and would not have time to do multi-part, drawn out hair care routines so for times I had to run out the door, did not want to wait for my hair to air-dry and wanted it straight, this does seem like a good solution.ing process for anyone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I am always very busy and would not have time to do multi-part, drawn out hair care routines so for times I had to run out the door, did not want to wait for my hair to air-dry and wanted it straight, this does seem like a good solution.</li>
            <li>To make it even better, after going over my whole head on medium, I went back over each section on high and got beautiful shine</li>
            <li>/&gt;First, let me say that the heat on this dryer gets hot very quickly.  </li>
            <li>It also does help to do a quick touch up with a straightening iron.  </li>
            <li>However, it was definitely more time-consuming than a regular blow-dry, and possibly more time-consuming than both blow-drying and using a straightening iron.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Sometimes I get results that are ok, but mainly just take some of the curl out of my locks</li>
            <li>I feel like super gluing the switch in the on position.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t really have the patience to take the time to use the straightening attachment every day, so it&#x27;s handy to be able to use it as a regular hairdryer, too.    </li>
            <li>And very fast!</li>
            <li>Also, the cool shot is great for a little bit of fluffing out before doing micro</li>
            <li>I bought the last version of this hair dryer when it first came out and loved it.</li>
            <li>My hair is dry, it is not frizzy and the good instructions make this klutz feel that - in</li>
            <li>But it does get hot!</li>
            <li>Originally, when I bought my first one, it was with alot of skepticism but all I had to do was use it to be devoted.</li>
            <li>Overall: Best suited to very long, wavy or curly hair.    </li>
            <li>This hair dryer, however, has helped me keep my fine somewhat wavy, somewhat curly hair as straight as I want it.</li>
            <li>, so no dryer will replace a dryer + flat iron, but this does a pretty good job.</li>
            <li>It does so much that I have never gotten around to reading the booklet or to watching the free \\&quot;how to use\\&quot; DVD which (is not mentioned anywhere but) is included.</li>
            <li>The hair dryer certainly is heavier than most and the various attachment need really the right technique in order to get them to be effective.  </li>
            <li>Nice, solid build quality</li>
            <li>I find that a brush with my normal dryer (or my hot air brush dryer) works better on my hair and is easier.  </li>
            <li>I do think that if my hair was longer (mine is chin-length), it would be useful.  </li>
            <li>The unit is nicely compact and feels very solid.  </li>
            <li>It comes with multiple speeds, has a hot, warm, and cool setting, and comes with 3 attachments including a diffuser and a straightener.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s rare to find this in stores.</li>
            <li>Now, she has had minimal use of the flat iron because of the excellent results from this machine.    </li>
            <li>I quickly got exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li>The straightening attachment is unique and very sturdy.  </li>
            <li>Overall, the Conair Infiniti 224 is a good, high quality hair dryer, but the straightening attachment just did not work well on my hair.  </li>
            <li>time - she could be positively dexterous!</li>
            <li>Since my hair has been getting wavier as I get older, I was hoping the straightening attachment on this hairdryer would help to smooth out my hair.  </li>
            <li>A little bulky for travel but has good motor and dries quickly.</li>
            <li>This is a really nice product for someone who wants to invest a little more money rather then getting and replacing cheaper hair dryers over and over again.</li>
            <li>If you use this hair dryer use high speed but on warm temp!- that gets your hair dry in no time!  </li>
            <li>Hot hot hot!</li>
            <li>(Her other stuff slips off more easily).</li>
            <li>Definitely get a great device for low cost!</li>
            <li>She actually liked the results enough to make her want to keep her very curly hair straighter longer.</li>
            <li>The Infiniti 1875 Watt Professional Hair dryer is a very quick and effective way to dry your hair.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d say if you have never used a high wattage hair dryer (like many of the people who are reviewing this product) I would skip this hair dryer and get the Revlon because it is much cheaper, works very well, has a longer nose, and you don&#x27;t get an attachment that does nothing but drive the price up.</li>
            <li>My husband doesn&#x27;t like this as well as his old 1875 watt dryer as he said the air flow is not as strong or as hot, even at the highest settings.      </li>
            <li>I should start by saying that I have very unusual hair.</li>
            <li>I have very straight hair</li>
            <li>(I purchased the Revlon dryer after discovering it was put to a scientific controlled test by Good Housekeeping against the several hundred dollar T3 professional dryer and the Revlon performed the same to better depending on the category).  </li>
            <li>Works as well as can be expected as a blow dryer, very fast and effective at straightening and untangling hair.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It would help if the power &amp; speed switch were in a different location or better design because when you grip the handle you find yourself unintentionally adjusting things.</li>
            <li>I lost my first one and had to get another...</li>
            <li>This thing gets really, really hot, and when used as directed, tangles and knots my hair and leaves it frizzed out.  </li>
            <li>NOT BONE STRAIGHT!</li>
            <li>I think us with 4 hair type was really expecting that!</li>
            <li>/&gt;All-in-all, this nifty gadget saves lots of time straightening my long hair and for that alone, it may make it worth the investment for many people.  </li>
            <li>This comb wont break (very sturdy!)</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m grateful to Conair for inventing such a \\&quot;one of a kind\\&quot; much needed product and happy that it can be found for such a bargain price on Amazon!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not use to and unnerved me at first because I was trying to avoid frying my hair.  </li>
            <li>At first it took a bit of figuring out.</li>
            <li>I totally fell in love with this lil gadget....</li>
            <li>this one is even better..as it has all those features and more ..with double the Power.    </li>
            <li>(I cut it recently for Locks of Love)</li>
            <li>It also seems fairly powerful (I really like the two speeds and three temps, too).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>even many regular straightening irons don&#x27;t work well on my hair.</li>
            <li>so I will review this part of the blow dryer first.  </li>
            <li>As I run the straightening attachment through my hair, it gets caught up at the very end and literally rips my hair out or rips my hair ends to shreads!</li>
            <li>It works in a similar way to a ceramic paddle brush, which makes it generally better for my hair.  </li>
            <li>Reliable, consistent heat.</li>
            <li>I watched the video CD first.</li>
            <li>She has a higher end unit but like using this one.</li>
            <li>Finally, after struggling with my special \\&quot;fix\\&quot; too many times, I decided to get this new, fully intact upgrade.  </li>
            <li>so while it could be useful for many my wife has limited use.&lt;br /</li>
            <li>Using the diffuser and concentrator certainly did the trick, so much better than the simple 2 speed travel hair dryer that I kept trying to use that</li>
            <li>More like smooth, with a little wave at the bottom.  </li>
            <li>I started to think that I should buy another one as a backup (just to be safe as I have had a flat iron damaged in a suitcase while travelling).  </li>
            <li>The straightening attachment is the main attraction here, it is adjustable for different textures and it dries your hair very straight and very smooth.  </li>
            <li>I was very interested to see how the new, improved version would work.    </li>
            <li>She was positive about the dryer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;Other positive features-&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have lots of long, curly/wavy (but mostly curly) hair.  </li>
            <li>It straightened my hair beautifully, left it smooth and without static, and it even got the areas of the back of my head that tend to stay waved/kinked.  </li>
            <li>but this purchase worked out well and is pretty much just what I wanted.</li>
            <li>When stretched my hair reaches armpit length and is healthy.  </li>
            <li>I was really interested to see if this dryer did in fact cause it to go straight.</li>
            <li>&quot; Pushing me aside for privacy, she proceeded to &#x60;willingly&#x27; straighten her very curly hair -</li>
            <li>She does not always spend a lot of time on her hair, leaving it to air dry for the most part.  </li>
            <li>Most of the time I let my hair air dry</li>
            <li>Reliable, solid performance for a low-cost, easily replaceable unit.</li>
            <li>I think this might just take some getting used to since this version also changed the switch to upgrade from \\&quot;off, low, high\\&quot; and a cool button to \\&quot;off, low, high\\&quot; and \\&quot;low, warm, hot\\&quot; heat settings and a cool button.</li>
            <li>I have had a problem with inadvertently turning off the dryer because of the way my fingers wrap around the handle to get to certain areas of my hair.     </li>
            <li>I have large hands, so the handle diameter doesn&#x27;t bother me.  </li>
            <li>I did not have super high expectations for the attachment and did not expect it to be able to completely straighten my hair as well as my pricey flat iron</li>
            <li>I just can&#x27;t believe in an age where we live in constant need of more steel, that this thing isn&#x27;t capable of melting steel.</li>
            <li>Fine as a dryer, but with the attachments, my wife felt that it is too big and heavy.&lt;br /&gt;2.  </li>
            <li>we are sisters but have different hair textures, I have fine wavy medium length</li>
            <li>In the future I will continue to test out this product, and will hopefully do so in more of a \\&quot;test study\\&quot; manor, with keeping track of all variables that might affect the results and doing several tests with the *same* variables in place, to try and see if there were specific causes to my not getting consistent good results.</li>
            <li>I had never used one before and it is just amazing what a little gadget can do.</li>
            <li>pros:  great as a regular hairdryer, pretty good as a straightener, small enough to fit in small bathroom drawers, lots of power  cons:  </li>
            <li>This dryer doesn&#x27;t get my hair as straight as my old Vidal Sassoon (similar to the Vidal Sassoon VS783 - can&#x27;t remember the model number right now), and it isn&#x27;t as easy to wield either, since I have to keep changing the position of the comb.</li>
            <li>Basically, I stopped using Hairdryers to blowdry my hair when I was about 12, as it would end up as a big huge afro-like thing.  </li>
            <li>It isn&#x27;t a huge difference but is noticeably different.    </li>
            <li>However, it&#x27;s a multi-functional dryer that really does get the job done.  </li>
            <li>so it&#x27;s important to have your hair brushed out before you begin.  </li>
            <li>The rep on the phone told me if I used the diffuser on already straight hair</li>
            <li>it flies straight up or to my face.  </li>
            <li>Straight out of the box, it looks like something you SHOULD be using in 2008 (through 2015).    </li>
            <li>That was very helpful.  </li>
            <li>Diffusers with full-size hair dryers are VERY cumbersome in size</li>
            <li>Eventually, I located it here at Amazon at a much reduced price.  </li>
            <li>Let me start at the very beginning</li>
            <li>stick straight.  </li>
            <li>(Think light switch in a middle position.)</li>
            <li>I have been really looking out to buy a hair dryer for a while now...</li>
            <li>really well...</li>
            <li>i dont reallly use it that much though...</li>
            <li>The 1875 Watts is what makes my whole hair drying much faster</li>
            <li>My hair comes out very shiny.    </li>
            <li>However, when I asked my boyfriend if he noticed a difference in my hair, he did not think it was much of a difference at all, vs when I just brush it out</li>
            <li>I have to admit that my hair is already straight.</li>
            <li>/&gt;This dryer may seem pricey, but the attachments and the quality really make up for it.</li>
            <li>This one really does what it says, though.  </li>
            <li>I progress through the grip settings and my hair is relatively straight for days.  </li>
            <li>SHIPPER WAS FAST AND EFFICIENT.  </li>
            <li>Very lightweight.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not doing much effect but requires a lot of work.</li>
            <li>For a while, it did work a lot faster in getting my hair straight.</li>
            <li>I have very curly hair that I like to wear both straight and curly.  </li>
            <li>attachments stay on very well and this dryer lasts for years.  </li>
            <li>I have fairly straight/wavy hair, but my daughter has thick, curly hair.  </li>
            <li>It does a good job of drying, and it is lightweight, which is good, considering how tired the arm gets when using a heavy dryer.  </li>
            <li>I started noticing short flyaways on top of my head that had not previously been there.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;In general, it did seem to work relatively quickly, it did get the hair relatively straight</li>
            <li>/&gt;In general, it did seem to work relatively quickly, it did get the hair relatively straight</li>
            <li>The straightening attachment is bigger and the teeth are longer than the original version.  </li>
            <li>and it looked like I had done a light flat iron.  </li>
            <li>You need to take care with it just as with any other hair roasting device :).</li>
            <li>You need to take care with it just as with any other hair roasting device :).</li>
            <li>This dryer solves this problem better than any other dryer I have tried.  </li>
            <li>Helps makes my hair so smooth that I often don&#x27;t need a flat iron.</li>
            <li>What an amazing little dryer!</li>
            <li>I mean it gets pretty warm, just not as hot, so it takes a little longer to dry, but again, that could be a good thing</li>
            <li>I used it for the first time this morning (with the straightener attachment), and was pleasantly surprised.  </li>
            <li>It has a natural wave, so I was interested in the straightening</li>
            <li>Honestly, I&#x27;m kind of ambivalent towards cosmetic attachments usually, but I&#x27;ve found a usage for each of the three included in the set.</li>
            <li>the ionic feature works for me to cut down on static  </li>
            <li>I bought this blow dryer because I was hoping to cut down on my hair straightening time, but also to get better results than what I was getting.  </li>
            <li>I now wish I had ordered the older model.....</li>
            <li>i had an older model of this and thought perhaps it had been improved.</li>
            <li>I always find that the more expensive ionic hair dryers work better then</li>
            <li>- The Diffuser attachment is mainly for people with curly hair than my wife&#x27;s -</li>
            <li>My short hair dries quickly.</li>
            <li>I use medium heat and many dryers only offer low and high.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s true, the newer version of the Infinit is slightly heavier than the old one, but to be honest, if you&#x27;re used to doing just about anything to get your hair to look decent, the minimal weight gain isn&#x27;t much of a deterrent.    </li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this hairdryer</li>
            <li>For the price of this hair dryer, I was expecting something a little more substantial.  </li>
            <li>The concept of the dryer/straightener is great, but it&#x27;s actually difficult to use.  </li>
            <li>- While it is a great hair dryer it is a bit on the expensive side.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never been able to juggle a dryer and round brush, so</li>
            <li>(Note that I do get an increase in volume from drying my hair outward from the roots using my normal hair dryer and my fingers, as I probably would if the Conair 224 were used in normal dryer mode.)  </li>
            <li>Worth the extra dollars.</li>
            <li>It usually looks good only on the day I go to the salon.</li>
            <li>Whether using the attachments is worth the time and effort involved will depend on one&#x27;s personal needs and preferences.</li>
            <li>I normally like my hair mid-back or longer</li>
            <li>Very loud when it is on the high setting.  </li>
            <li>although it took some time to learn how to use and finally dry the hair while pulling though, I all ready have straight hair so this only made is more silky , I got the flat ironed look that makes hair appear very shiny once I learned how to use it.</li>
            <li>I can say that the other attachment, that lets you \\&quot;mess up\\&quot; your hair while drying to make it curlier, does a good job on my hair, though my hair can do this mostly on its own, so again, I am left with questionable results.    </li>
            <li>I was skeptical that they had changed too much and ruined the previous model, but I was pleasantly surprised that I liked the new version even better!  </li>
            <li>My hair is super thin and very FLAT, and when I use this attachment, it takes the frizz away, making it look smooth, and it actually creates a little more volume to the top of my head.  </li>
            <li>I finally took all the accessories off and used it as a regular hair dryer, in which case it worked fine.</li>
            <li>I thought of her initially, for the straightening and overall styling attachments, but also knew that I had long been trying to find an effective hairdryer for myself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It is the first blow dryer I have ever used that does not leave that burning after smell in my hair, whether the heat setting is on high or low!</li>
            <li>and I was waiting for it to die to buy a new Hair dryer.</li>
            <li>I live this hair dryer.  </li>
            <li>It seems to be a fine dryer, but just average.</li>
            <li>This particular product, the Infiniti ProfessionaL Nano Silver Tournaline Ceramic Styler is like nothing else on the market.  </li>
            <li>But, something happened the second time and within a relatively short amount of time she had fabulous hair.</li>
            <li>This particular dryer piqued my curiosity based both on the solid construction and the overwhelmingly positive reviews.</li>
            <li>I was very excited to try this new Conair Infiniti 224 since I do like to straighten my hair from time to time, which I usually do using my normal hair dryer and a styling brush and my hands.  </li>
            <li>The diffuser with the rubber fingers is extremely hard to find, so imagine the excitement when I only had to go a couple of months of looking blah to feeling more pretty when I found this blow dryer on Amazon!  </li>
            <li>The instructions were very clear and if there is any confusion, the illustrations will take care of that.    </li>
            <li>Air flow is strong ...and the hot and cold settings are really easy to switch between.</li>
            <li>Might be ok on very long hair as you can pull long hair in front of you, but shoulder length hair</li>
            <li>Quite happy with this - hair dryers are such a personal choice that it&#x27;s hard to buy one online</li>
            <li>Before I bought this,  I already previously owned one &amp; only wanted to fine this same one again to buy because I&#x27;ve never had a hair dryer as good as this one to dry &amp; straighten hair at same time</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been hooked on these since I first got the red one 5 years ago.  </li>
            <li>I would recommend it for blowing out kids&#x27; hair since it is not harsh on the hair!</li>
            <li>Her hair is longer (slightly below shoulder length) and fine.</li>
            <li>This Conair hairdryer surprised me!  </li>
            <li>Several years ago, I purchased the first generation of the Conair Infiniti with the hope that the ceramic plates would ease the frizz factor with a minimum of effort.    </li>
            <li>The back intake has a fine screen covering, so I don&#x27;t have to worry about my long hair getting sucked in (again).      </li>
            <li>Not flat iron, poker straight, but normal hair with body.  </li>
            <li>Cool was cool and hot was heated enough to do the trick without burning your ears or your scalp if you kept it in one place a little too long.  </li>
            <li>My hair is not thick, I just have a lot of it, and thus why I wanted something that could handle my hair AND be gentle enough to use for a blow out.  </li>
            <li>Heavy duty cord is nice and long.  </li>
            <li>With my first use, I got better results (than just a regular blow dryer and flat iron) in less time.  </li>
            <li>The only problem I have with it is that the on/off switch is so large that my hand will shut it off when I use the straightening attachment.</li>
            <li>and I find that I actually am straightening my hair far more often because it takes so little time.  </li>
            <li>Also, the accessories get really hot and are hard to switch out until they cool</li>
            <li>With my second use I was inspired to give it a little more patience (glide drier/comb more slowly through my hair)</li>
            <li>She only used the &#x60;comb accessory&#x27; but it was strong enough and stayed on the dryer much more firmly than other attachments.</li>
            <li>I have naturally coarse, frizzy and very curly hair and have been buying Conair hair dryers since I was 16 years old and lived in N.J.</li>
            <li>A plus for those early mornings.  </li>
            <li>I bought the Conair Professional Hair Designer Pro Nano Silver 3/11/12 because it has two of the straightening plates.  </li>
            <li>The description, package and manual for this product really focus on the straightening capabilities, since that is the big feature for this product.  </li>
            <li>I am completely re-doing this review.  </li>
            <li>So I&#x27;m guessing this dryer is doing nothing as far as emitting ions.  </li>
            <li>and I heard the &#x27;click&#x27; that the instructions speak of (and which I should have obviously waited for), the gentle tug had no effect.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 53 years old and continue to turn to Conair for all of my hair needs.  </li>
            <li>Ladies with natural hair, detangle before you use the straightening attachment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li>Again, straight is a relative term.</li>
            <li>The weight was the only real issue for me.</li>
            <li>The weight was the only real issue for me.</li>
            <li>I have soft hair and the grippers on this machine caught and tangled my hair, not to mention it pulled some of it out.</li>
            <li>My advice, if you have short hair and skip the straightening attachment, this is a great dryer that is comparable to the expensive professional dryers I often use (my cousin is a hair dresser</li>
            <li>With the attachment expect much breakage and the same results as a brush and dryer.  </li>
            <li>Luckily, since I started with small sections as soon as I felt that grip, I gently worked my hair out and started again.  </li>
            <li>It helps to dry from the top rather than from the scalp out as it keeps down the \\&quot;fly-aways.\\</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, I would probably only use this dryer for straightening if there weren&#x27;t other easier methods available.</li>
            <li>I wish I could rate it higher than 3 to 3 ½ stars, but it just did not live up to my expectations for this mid-range appliance with straightening capabilities.  </li>
            <li>Since my hair is very fine, I just dry it a little and then while it is still damp, I go straight to using the straightening comb attached to the hairdryer and after only a couple of passes for each section, my hair is straight and dry and</li>
            <li>Part of this may be that I have hair down to the upper quadrant of my back, which many people would call \\&quot;long\\&quot;.</li>
            <li>Seriously thinking about returning this even though I threw away the box (thought I would love it) or breaking the spring so that my hair glides through like it is suppose to.</li>
            <li>I ordered this product as a replacement for an older dryer, same model.  </li>
            <li>Although the downside is that you might tend to move it more slowly and overdry the hair if you&#x27;re not careful.    </li>
            <li>There is a little, illustrated booklet that takes you step by step through the attachments and also tells you how to use the dryer to obtain certain styles, and for certain hair types.  </li>
            <li>The low heat setting is not very hot, and both settings must be used in order to get the drying job done quickly.  </li>
            <li>However, my hair did dry faster with the diffuser, much faster than with my old hair dryer.    </li>
            <li>Someone with a bob cut might be able to dry their hair in a few minutes and not notice the dryer&#x27;s weight at all, even with non-strong arms.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>If you use the straightener attachment, be careful because it will get hot.      </li>
            <li>That second one has a \\&quot;mist spray\\&quot; to help hydrate and straighten your hair easier (like a normal household iron).    </li>
            <li>It felt a little heavy at first (1 pound without attachments) but the weight is concentrated in the handle and it is easy to maneuver.  </li>
            <li>It cuts the time to dry my hair to about a third of the time and leaves my highly difficult, curly hair smooth, straight and frizz free.  </li>
            <li>I would NOT recommend unless you have fine thin straight hair.</li>
            <li>, I asked my mother to sit in and straightened her very fine thin hair.</li>
            <li>The only drawback is that this dryer is a bit on the heavy side, but luckily it doesn&#x27;t take too long to dry my hair, so this hasn&#x27;t been a huge drawback for</li>
            <li>This item was listed as new, yet when it arrived, I noticed the box had been obviously re-taped.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Although, I do like the new larger section for air flow between the 2 comb straighteners.</li>
            <li>However, after using this product, i found my hair to be neither dry nor straight.</li>
            <li>When I blow dry my hair, time cannot be much of a factor because I do it so inefficiently.  </li>
            <li>This does not blow dry hair very well at all.</li>
            <li>The instruction booklet, which is written in both Spanish and English, contains some very helpfully information on how to fully use this product.</li>
            <li>An instruction booklet that is larger and that has bigger type would be much easier to use.  </li>
            <li>I have found that I go through several of the \\&quot;cheap\\&quot; dryers, and having one of higher quality is probably going to save me money in the long run.</li>
            <li>while there are some small areas for improvement - I would still rate the Infiniti Professional Hair Dryer 4 full stars.</li>
            <li>It also dried my hair quickly.  </li>
            <li>they say hot, they do mean hot.</li>
            <li>they say hot, they do mean hot.</li>
            <li>Long story short, I&#x27;m actually used to more discrete buttons (as I&#x27;m a geek), and instead, with this thing, thereare just two tabs that slide up and down to adjust.</li>
            <li>Long, high quality cord  </li>
            <li>I would not buy this again, and I would not recommend it for someone wanting just a general purpose hair dryer.</li>
            <li>Straightening attachment does not work as well as I expected on my naturally slightly wavy hair with fine to medium texture.  </li>
            <li>I went back to my old hair dryer after two days.</li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am an African-American woman with relatively dense natural 3C+4A hair.  </li>
            <li>It even got my roots to lay flat and that was something I could never do with my old hair dryer and comb attachment!  </li>
            <li>So far, this only happened once (in 2 weeks)</li>
            <li>My hair is naturally curly when short and wavy when longer.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t even use the straightening attachment, and my hair was soft and definitely not frizzy!  </li>
            <li>White, Natural, Curly whirly wavy</li>
            <li>Not sure if I could go down to a ceramic-only dryer and get relief from the static, or if I must get completely away from the ceramic.  </li>
            <li>Very powerful for such a small hair dryer.</li>
            <li>As of this point, I can only give this product a 3 out of 5 stars, as not only did it not impress me as much as I thought it might, but with such strange and wide variety of results, I cannot claim that it will give consistent results to anyone (all of the time).    </li>
            <li>, sometimes I have gotten my hair fairly straight and it lasts a while, and other times it just does not work at all.  </li>
            <li>I always had to use a flat iron because I could never blow dry my hair straight with a brush and dryer like they do in the salons.</li>
            <li>and it looked like I did something to it, without being too dramatic and over the top.    </li>
            <li>The results were flatter than I might have achieved normally, but not so flat that it would replace a flat iron or pomade with comb for the truly straightened appearence.</li>
            <li>Funny little shape that I like.  </li>
            <li>Using the easy-to-follow directions, I make a couple of layers of my partially air-dried hair and dry the bottom section first.</li>
            <li>Diffusers never helped, it was easier to Air Dry my hair (and usually pulled back into a ponytail to help keep the top of my hair as flat as possible *</li>
            <li>Sometimes I&#x27;ll go on to use hot rollers to give a little bounce to my hair, but it isn&#x27;t necessary.      </li>
            <li>Initially I was excited about this until I used it for the first time and my hair was sucked into the back of the dryer at least three times every time I blow dried.  </li>
            <li>I have very long, naturally curly</li>
            <li>The packaging claims that the Hair Designer Pro will dry, straighten and shine in one step by using the triple action straightening attachment.  </li>
            <li>I was very excited to get this product because I use a flat iron on my hair everyday and I am destroying my hair with it.</li>
            <li>Not so heavy so that your wrist aches after doing only half your hair, and not so light that you feel as if you have a substandard product.    </li>
            <li>Like I said, it&#x27;s a funny little shaped thing!</li>
            <li>This blow dryer is large and heavy for a travel size.  </li>
            <li>Over the past few years I have experimented more with Flat Iron Straighteners, and I have 2 of these products, a regular Conair flat-iron, and the more expensive (seen on TV and HSN)</li>
            <li>Unfortunately it will take a few months for the hair to regrow to a length where it won&#x27;t be sticking straight up on the top of my head.  </li>

            <li> This is a great feature as well.    </li>
            <li> The straightening attachment with the rotating head is a great idea</li>
            <li> but that looks like it would work great, too.</li>
            <li> I tried the straightening attachment five times (even read the booklet on how to use the dryer) and my results were not that great.  </li>

            <li> Good dryer.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Conclusion:  Good quality hair dryer.  </li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s a good one.</li>
            <li> good:  </li>
            <li> Good value in my opinion though,</li>
            <li> However, the medium setting was perfect for a light blow out.  </li>
            <li> The concentrator is a good addition too...</li>
            <li> but its good to know i have it in case</li>
            <li> The handle is comfortable and the balance is excellent.  </li>
            <li> - The Sure-shot attachment is good to use with a roller brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t run into any exceptional problems here.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t run into any exceptional problems here.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Arrived quickly, with a Bed, Bath and Beyond price sticker for $34.99!!!</li>
            <li> The straightening attachment was very interesting,</li>
            <li> - Ideally, it would have the ability to fold which would make it easier to fit into your suitcase.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Very easy to use and does a good job drying and straightening hair.</li>
            <li> For those of you who are first trying this, it may take time figuring out what works best for you.  </li>
            <li> I love that about this CONAIR dryer!</li>
            <li> blowout effect that most of us are looking for!</li>
            <li> I am enjoying the saved time in the bathroom!  </li>
            <li> The first time she used it, she wasn&#x27;t too impressed.</li>
            <li> To say I&#x27;m pleased is an understatment!    </li>
            <li> My first impressions of this hairdryer are excellent.  </li>
            <li> My curls never looked better!</li>
            <li> I love this product!  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great, manageable size and easy to use compared to my full-size dryer/diffuser.</li>
            <li> I think the Infiniti would probably be ideal for a woman with thinner hair who can blow-dry it fairly quickly and doesn&#x27;t want to deal with an iron.</li>
            <li> and I thought it would be great for a smooth blowout.  </li>
            <li> The diffuser attachment feels nice on the scalp.  </li>
            <li> Some sort of bag or case would be nice to store the attachments.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This product is nothing more than a glorified hair dryer, and not even a good one...</li>
            <li> It has a nice weight.  </li>
            <li> I liked it.  </li>
            <li> Honestly, I don&#x27;t know whether it makes my style stay one nanosecond longer than it would have</li>
            <li> the rubber tips on the diffuser massage my head nicely.  </li>
            <li> The diffuser is a nice touch for the days when you don&#x27;t want to go through the hassle of hair straightening.</li>
            <li> i want to curl my locks with concentrated warm air...    </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never been terribly adept at styling my own hair.</li>
            <li> I am going to go from someone who put their hair in a ponytail and forgot about it to someone who makes it look nice every day.  </li>
            <li> But I&#x27;m really quite impressed with it!&lt;br</li>
            <li> Nice curved handle to hold.  </li>
            <li> THRILLED WITH THIS PRODUCT.</li>
            <li> So, I&#x27;d like to add to that opinion with my own experiences.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Works great on my rediculously full head of hair.</li>
            <li> I am a devoted Conair customer for many years and don&#x27;t understand how an amazing, one of a kind, miraculous hair styling tool like this could not have caught on.  </li>
            <li> My hair breaks very, very easily, and I&#x27;m wondering if using the straightening attachment might worsen that.</li>
            <li> I am liking this gadget more and more each day!</li>
            <li> But to my surprise, my hair looked, well, pretty darn good afterward!</li>
            <li> The dryer seemed to be a nice product, but I bought it mostly for the diffuser attachment, which was defective.  </li>
            <li> The plates on this Infiniti version are better, smoothing out the hair follicle nicely and quicker.</li>
            <li> Love, love, love this!  </li>
            <li> only giving it 4 stars because i think i wuld&#x27;ve loved it to have more settings for better heat control, but otherwise it is perfect!</li>
            <li> in all, for the weekend warrior or occasional blow-dryer consumer, this is a great value and a great buy.</li>
            <li> It has good power and dries hair quickly  </li>
            <li> I happily received my order really quick and was excited to start using the product.</li>
            <li> Was looking for a hairdryer with a short barrel and be able to use it with the voluminizer/diffuser attached ~ this one was close to perfect!!!!</li>
            <li> My daughter and I love it.  </li>
            <li> It is great because my hair is straight and not frizzy and it didn&#x27;t take any longer than just drying it.</li>
            <li> So when I used this blow dryer  to blow out my roots, it just lightly blows it out from, kinky to coily!</li>
            <li> Although this dryer does an okay job, by comparison, well there just is no comparison.  </li>
            <li> I also like that it has a diffuser attachment for when I wear my hair curly, which is most of the time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I blew it off, not realizing it was the dryer giving me the static.  </li>
            <li> just more static.  </li>
            <li> never had static in my hair in my 49 years on this earth.  </li>
            <li> I just did an internet search and many sources say that ion-producing hair dryers ELIMINATE static.  </li>
            <li> (so much so that I can put mousse and hairspray in it and get a great wave/curl).  </li>
            <li> but it feels more like &#x27;low/medium&#x27; to me</li>
            <li> The Infiniti hair designer pro by conair is a hairdryer/styler combo with a number of interesting attachments.</li>
            <li> no, but noticeably better.  </li>
            <li> and I got even better results.  </li>
            <li> This was probably a fluke since most people have reviewed this item favorably and not mentioned a problem fitting the attachments.  </li>
            <li> and I wasn&#x27;t sure why.  </li>
            <li> My fingers were at the top of the on/off heat buttons</li>
            <li> I use the straightner the most.</li>
            <li> so I love to use a diffuser...to keep them looking like that...</li>
            <li> I am totally in love with it.</li>
            <li> It is modern-looking and stylish.  </li>
            <li> so for me this is \\&quot;short\\&quot; :)</li>
            <li> so at this point I&#x27;ve had many years of practice for dealing with that sort of thing.</li>
            <li> My guess is people will eventually find a better place to store it.     </li>
            <li> Love this item.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had it for more than 3 years now.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure the straightening attachment would work for me --</li>
            <li> I absolutely love the volumizer attachment (I think people refer to it as a diffuser).  </li>
            <li> So, thank you, thank you, and thank you for having this product available!  </li>
            <li> so I don&#x27;t overheat my hair and cause more damage.  </li>
            <li> I will say, I am in love with these kinds of diffusers,</li>
            <li> This is perfect and lives in my gym bag making occasional visits to my suitcase.  </li>
            <li> Most people are buying this hairdryer for the straightening attachment</li>
            <li> In addition, the attachment did not straighten any better than using a brush and hair dryer.  </li>
            <li> Shame on me for not checking prices, but it discouraging that this type of activity takes place with a company as reputable as this.</li>
            <li> Still enjoying it.  </li>
            <li> SATISFIED.</li>
            <li> I love this dryer because it helps me with both styles.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The hairdryer also includes three heat settings and two speed settings and a cool shot button all of which are easy to use and placed in a good location on the handle.    </li>
            <li> Fast delivery also!!!!  </li>
            <li> I was very excited about this product, since it would cut out a step in the process of drying and straightening my hair.</li>
            <li> She said it makes her hair nice and curly when using the diffuser, but doesn&#x27;t think it is anything special.      </li>
            <li> It took a little bit to get used to it and figure out what worked best for me as far as handling it, but once I got it, I loved it!!!  </li>
            <li> Even the best irons by themselves take way too long for me to straighten.  </li>
            <li> Nice quality, solid appliance  Attractive and stylish</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t need a straightener, but the diffuser and concentrator are good tools to style my hair, and I like that the dryer doesn&#x27;t get too hot</li>
            <li> With this hair dryer and the tools to style the hair, I am able to get ready fast and my hair looks shinny and looks great!</li>
            <li> I was hopeful that the Conair 224 with straightener attachment would be easy to use and work well for me so that I could straighten my hair more often.      </li>
            <li> It adds fullness, but it is easy to overdo and to end up with much more than wanted.  </li>
            <li> I gave the button a quick press two or three times wondering where the &#x27;cool&#x27; was, before it occurred to &#x27;bright bulb&#x27; (me) to keep my finger on the pulse - so to speak.    </li>
            <li> The straightening attachment is pretty cool, but your hair will need to be shoulder length or longer for it to be very effective.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use diffusers so I didn&#x27;t get to try that out and those attachments, but overall a very good dryer</li>
            <li> Using this hair dryer leaves my hair more shiny and smooth than anything else I&#x27;ve tried.  </li>
            <li> and I love the cool blast button, it makes the heat more manageable.</li>
            <li> However, I found the Infiniti to smooth my hair a bit better compared to the Revlon dryer.  </li>
            <li> The accessories are nice although I rarely use them.</li>
            <li> They make the greatest hair dryers and flat irons because their products are created with the most useful and state of the art features in mind.  </li>
            <li> I recommended the previous Conair Infiniti, and I&#x27;m happy to report the new version is an improvement on an already excellent design.</li>
            <li> it would give me waves...not true!</li>
            <li> I am excited to try out the diffuser attachment :)</li>
            <li> This dryer looks SO cool!  </li>
            <li> I did not find the straightening attachment easy to use.  </li>
            <li> so maneuvering is much easy with this one...</li>
            <li> She liked the feel of the Infiniti as it was light and felt powerful (even when she dropped in on the floor and it kept running).</li>
            <li> It is easy to use as well.</li>
            <li> - The cord tangles easily</li>
            <li> - The hair dryer does not have any anti-slip surface, and easily slide off</li>
            <li> Nice flip out cover on the back mesh that covers the air intake, for easy cleaning  Good manual with lots of tips on using the dryer and attachments    </li>
            <li> After 3 passes over, I had a beautiful blow out that didn&#x27;t revert as soon as I left the section.  </li>
            <li> I have lots of fine wavy hair.</li>
            <li> These worked fine.    </li>
            <li> /&gt;This isn&#x27;t a cheap hairdryer, to be sure, but it&#x27;s a great one stop item for a man and a woman to share, each able to get just the right style using the various attachments.</li>
            <li> Using it as a regular hairdryer, it is great - it had a lot of power and dries my hair very quickly if I&#x27;m in a rush.    </li>
            <li> So overall I would say that it is more than fairly and good hair dryer because it dries quickly, leaving my hair feeling light, SOFT and SMOOTH and the after smell is of the product not the burning effect!</li>
            <li> The diffuser attachment is huge - 5\\&quot; across by 4\\&quot; tall, including the spikes.      </li>
            <li> This is a HUGE plus for me.  </li>
            <li> I know, this isn&#x27;t a huge issue, and I&#x27;m not even taking a star off for it.</li>
            <li> I was happy that this one has the extra attachments and adjustable heat settings.   </li>
            <li> There is no product like it available anymore.  </li>
            <li> Fast, effective straightener.  </li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t fit onto the end of the dryer nozzle.  </li>
            <li> But there are times in which attention becomes important.  </li>
            <li> Same great product, trusted brand.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s important to grab the ends of the hair and keep them taut as the dryer is pulled through.</li>
            <li> Overall this is a great product and recommended.</li>
            <li> and I really enjoy that our hair dries abut 25% than with</li>
            <li> The concentrator for getting the frizz out of my ends, the straightener for great overall coverage and uniform smooth/shine, and the diffuser for...well, diffusing.</li>
            <li> Today it started to sound as if one piece inside the dryer had detached itself and the motor was grinding</li>
            <li> This dryer absolutely lives up to the hype!!!  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great product, not noisy like others, works very well, not heavy, easy to use.  </li>
            <li> It is wonderfully wavy and long, not needing too much attention.</li>
            <li> It is super easy to straighten your hair and saves on the frying of a straighting iron.</li>
            <li> The Infiniti was the best blow dryer I had ever had, that dried my hair quickly, with a minimum of damage and a maximum of smoothness.</li>
            <li> I was excited about this product as I straighten my hair, and any way to make it easier is of interest.    </li>
            <li> You had to hold it and pull the hair through, and I did not find that this significantly straightened my hair at all.    </li>
            <li> This is a great product that could use a couple of minor improvements.    </li>
            <li> It is important to read it to get the full use of this product.     </li>
            <li> And when I first received it, it seemed rather overwhelming, with all of the pieces and a good-sized manual.</li>
            <li> I was excited about an attachment that could decrease the ironing time.  </li>
            <li> user friendly.  </li>
            <li> It really straightening nicely without any hassle and was a great way for her to get everything as she wanted without depending on other tools.&lt;br</li>
            <li> After I pressed the buttons, I tugged on the attachment gently to make sure it was on securely.  </li>
            <li> That&#x27;s right ladies, a 1!  </li>
            <li> The reviews are right!  </li>
            <li> The drying action is fast and the designed attachments really do a nice job at straightening the hair!</li>
            <li> me, I wasn&#x27;t interested as much in the straightening, but wanted something that would allow me to nicely style my, admittedly, thinning hair without making it look over managed.  </li>
            <li> The one i have is really not that great..</li>
            <li> Okay, so it does not bone straight-blow-out your hair, but it does protect your hair fiber from over exposure to the high heat!</li>
            <li> appearance  Versatile - comes with straightener, diffuser and concentrator attachments  Two fan speed settings and 3 heat settings + a cool button to set your style  </li>
            <li> The cool shot button:  </li>
            <li> if I did not use the \\&quot;cool shot\\&quot; button.  </li>
            <li> What I do know is that you have to keep the button depressed for the \\&quot;cool shot\\&quot; to work.  </li>
            <li> &quot; The cool blast of air after drying helps, too.</li>
            <li> The concentrator is to be used to \\&quot;set\\&quot; the style with cool air.</li>
            <li> The diffuser performs well, and the soft rubbery tips are kind to the scalp.  </li>
            <li> dryer itself is fairly compact, though the pieces (especially the diffuser) take up a lot of room in my cabinet.</li>
            <li> The Cool Blast button is a plus, and I always appreciate a dryer with that function.</li>
            <li> I also cannot state that this product does not work very well, as there were just too many variables to throw of the results.  </li>
            <li> Revlon RV544 1875 Watt Tourmaline Ionic Lightweight Dryer, Silver/Black]]which is a 1875 watt, same as the Infiti, which I have loved for two years.  </li>
            <li> Well be returning immediately for a full refund.</li>
            <li> and has nice soft rubbery fingers.  </li>
            <li> Cool</li>
            <li> cool cool.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Review:  Not bad, not bad at all.  </li>
            <li> It works fairly well, but I&#x27;m not 100% convinced that it works better than just using a vented hairbrush while blow-drying, although my hair is less frizzy.  </li>
            <li> I am always very busy and would not have time to do multi-part, drawn out hair care routines so for times I had to run out the door, did not want to wait for my hair to air-dry and wanted it straight, this does seem like a good solution.ing process for anyone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I am always very busy and would not have time to do multi-part, drawn out hair care routines so for times I had to run out the door, did not want to wait for my hair to air-dry and wanted it straight, this does seem like a good solution.</li>
            <li> To make it even better, after going over my whole head on medium, I went back over each section on high and got beautiful shine</li>
            <li> /&gt;First, let me say that the heat on this dryer gets hot very quickly.  </li>
            <li> It also does help to do a quick touch up with a straightening iron.  </li>
            <li> However, it was definitely more time-consuming than a regular blow-dry, and possibly more time-consuming than both blow-drying and using a straightening iron.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Sometimes I get results that are ok, but mainly just take some of the curl out of my locks</li>
            <li> I feel like super gluing the switch in the on position.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really have the patience to take the time to use the straightening attachment every day, so it&#x27;s handy to be able to use it as a regular hairdryer, too.    </li>
            <li> And very fast!</li>
            <li> Also, the cool shot is great for a little bit of fluffing out before doing micro</li>
            <li> I bought the last version of this hair dryer when it first came out and loved it.</li>
            <li> My hair is dry, it is not frizzy and the good instructions make this klutz feel that - in</li>
            <li> But it does get hot!</li>
            <li> Originally, when I bought my first one, it was with alot of skepticism but all I had to do was use it to be devoted.</li>
            <li> Overall: Best suited to very long, wavy or curly hair.    </li>
            <li> This hair dryer, however, has helped me keep my fine somewhat wavy, somewhat curly hair as straight as I want it.</li>
            <li> , so no dryer will replace a dryer + flat iron, but this does a pretty good job.</li>
            <li> It does so much that I have never gotten around to reading the booklet or to watching the free \\&quot;how to use\\&quot; DVD which (is not mentioned anywhere but) is included.</li>
            <li> The hair dryer certainly is heavier than most and the various attachment need really the right technique in order to get them to be effective.  </li>
            <li> Nice, solid build quality</li>
            <li> I find that a brush with my normal dryer (or my hot air brush dryer) works better on my hair and is easier.  </li>
            <li> I do think that if my hair was longer (mine is chin-length), it would be useful.  </li>
            <li> The unit is nicely compact and feels very solid.  </li>
            <li> It comes with multiple speeds, has a hot, warm, and cool setting, and comes with 3 attachments including a diffuser and a straightener.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s rare to find this in stores.</li>
            <li> Now, she has had minimal use of the flat iron because of the excellent results from this machine.    </li>
            <li> I quickly got exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li> The straightening attachment is unique and very sturdy.  </li>
            <li> Overall, the Conair Infiniti 224 is a good, high quality hair dryer, but the straightening attachment just did not work well on my hair.  </li>
            <li> time - she could be positively dexterous!</li>
            <li> Since my hair has been getting wavier as I get older, I was hoping the straightening attachment on this hairdryer would help to smooth out my hair.  </li>
            <li> A little bulky for travel but has good motor and dries quickly.</li>
            <li> This is a really nice product for someone who wants to invest a little more money rather then getting and replacing cheaper hair dryers over and over again.</li>
            <li> If you use this hair dryer use high speed but on warm temp!- that gets your hair dry in no time!  </li>
            <li> Hot hot hot!</li>
            <li> (Her other stuff slips off more easily).</li>
            <li> Definitely get a great device for low cost!</li>
            <li> She actually liked the results enough to make her want to keep her very curly hair straighter longer.</li>
            <li> The Infiniti 1875 Watt Professional Hair dryer is a very quick and effective way to dry your hair.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d say if you have never used a high wattage hair dryer (like many of the people who are reviewing this product) I would skip this hair dryer and get the Revlon because it is much cheaper, works very well, has a longer nose, and you don&#x27;t get an attachment that does nothing but drive the price up.</li>
            <li> My husband doesn&#x27;t like this as well as his old 1875 watt dryer as he said the air flow is not as strong or as hot, even at the highest settings.      </li>
            <li> I should start by saying that I have very unusual hair.</li>
            <li> I have very straight hair</li>
            <li> (I purchased the Revlon dryer after discovering it was put to a scientific controlled test by Good Housekeeping against the several hundred dollar T3 professional dryer and the Revlon performed the same to better depending on the category).  </li>
            <li> Works as well as can be expected as a blow dryer, very fast and effective at straightening and untangling hair.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It would help if the power &amp; speed switch were in a different location or better design because when you grip the handle you find yourself unintentionally adjusting things.</li>
            <li> I lost my first one and had to get another...</li>
            <li> This thing gets really, really hot, and when used as directed, tangles and knots my hair and leaves it frizzed out.  </li>
            <li> NOT BONE STRAIGHT!</li>
            <li> I think us with 4 hair type was really expecting that!</li>
            <li> /&gt;All-in-all, this nifty gadget saves lots of time straightening my long hair and for that alone, it may make it worth the investment for many people.  </li>
            <li> This comb wont break (very sturdy!)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m grateful to Conair for inventing such a \\&quot;one of a kind\\&quot; much needed product and happy that it can be found for such a bargain price on Amazon!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not use to and unnerved me at first because I was trying to avoid frying my hair.  </li>
            <li> At first it took a bit of figuring out.</li>
            <li> I totally fell in love with this lil gadget....</li>
            <li> this one is even better..as it has all those features and more ..with double the Power.    </li>
            <li> (I cut it recently for Locks of Love)</li>
            <li> It also seems fairly powerful (I really like the two speeds and three temps, too).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> even many regular straightening irons don&#x27;t work well on my hair.</li>
            <li> so I will review this part of the blow dryer first.  </li>
            <li> As I run the straightening attachment through my hair, it gets caught up at the very end and literally rips my hair out or rips my hair ends to shreads!</li>
            <li> It works in a similar way to a ceramic paddle brush, which makes it generally better for my hair.  </li>
            <li> Reliable, consistent heat.</li>
            <li> I watched the video CD first.</li>
            <li> She has a higher end unit but like using this one.</li>
            <li> Finally, after struggling with my special \\&quot;fix\\&quot; too many times, I decided to get this new, fully intact upgrade.  </li>
            <li> so while it could be useful for many my wife has limited use.&lt;br /</li>
            <li> Using the diffuser and concentrator certainly did the trick, so much better than the simple 2 speed travel hair dryer that I kept trying to use that</li>
            <li> More like smooth, with a little wave at the bottom.  </li>
            <li> I started to think that I should buy another one as a backup (just to be safe as I have had a flat iron damaged in a suitcase while travelling).  </li>
            <li> The straightening attachment is the main attraction here, it is adjustable for different textures and it dries your hair very straight and very smooth.  </li>
            <li> I was very interested to see how the new, improved version would work.    </li>
            <li> She was positive about the dryer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;Other positive features-&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have lots of long, curly/wavy (but mostly curly) hair.  </li>
            <li> It straightened my hair beautifully, left it smooth and without static, and it even got the areas of the back of my head that tend to stay waved/kinked.  </li>
            <li> but this purchase worked out well and is pretty much just what I wanted.</li>
            <li> When stretched my hair reaches armpit length and is healthy.  </li>
            <li> I was really interested to see if this dryer did in fact cause it to go straight.</li>
            <li> &quot; Pushing me aside for privacy, she proceeded to &#x60;willingly&#x27; straighten her very curly hair -</li>
            <li> She does not always spend a lot of time on her hair, leaving it to air dry for the most part.  </li>
            <li> Most of the time I let my hair air dry</li>
            <li> Reliable, solid performance for a low-cost, easily replaceable unit.</li>
            <li> I think this might just take some getting used to since this version also changed the switch to upgrade from \\&quot;off, low, high\\&quot; and a cool button to \\&quot;off, low, high\\&quot; and \\&quot;low, warm, hot\\&quot; heat settings and a cool button.</li>
            <li> I have had a problem with inadvertently turning off the dryer because of the way my fingers wrap around the handle to get to certain areas of my hair.     </li>
            <li> I have large hands, so the handle diameter doesn&#x27;t bother me.  </li>
            <li> I did not have super high expectations for the attachment and did not expect it to be able to completely straighten my hair as well as my pricey flat iron</li>
            <li> I just can&#x27;t believe in an age where we live in constant need of more steel, that this thing isn&#x27;t capable of melting steel.</li>
            <li> Fine as a dryer, but with the attachments, my wife felt that it is too big and heavy.&lt;br /&gt;2.  </li>
            <li> we are sisters but have different hair textures, I have fine wavy medium length</li>
            <li> In the future I will continue to test out this product, and will hopefully do so in more of a \\&quot;test study\\&quot; manor, with keeping track of all variables that might affect the results and doing several tests with the *same* variables in place, to try and see if there were specific causes to my not getting consistent good results.</li>
            <li> I had never used one before and it is just amazing what a little gadget can do.</li>
            <li> pros:  great as a regular hairdryer, pretty good as a straightener, small enough to fit in small bathroom drawers, lots of power  cons:  </li>
            <li> This dryer doesn&#x27;t get my hair as straight as my old Vidal Sassoon (similar to the Vidal Sassoon VS783 - can&#x27;t remember the model number right now), and it isn&#x27;t as easy to wield either, since I have to keep changing the position of the comb.</li>
            <li> Basically, I stopped using Hairdryers to blowdry my hair when I was about 12, as it would end up as a big huge afro-like thing.  </li>
            <li> It isn&#x27;t a huge difference but is noticeably different.    </li>
            <li> However, it&#x27;s a multi-functional dryer that really does get the job done.  </li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s important to have your hair brushed out before you begin.  </li>
            <li> The rep on the phone told me if I used the diffuser on already straight hair</li>
            <li> it flies straight up or to my face.  </li>
            <li> Straight out of the box, it looks like something you SHOULD be using in 2008 (through 2015).    </li>
            <li> That was very helpful.  </li>
            <li> Diffusers with full-size hair dryers are VERY cumbersome in size</li>
            <li> Eventually, I located it here at Amazon at a much reduced price.  </li>
            <li> Let me start at the very beginning</li>
            <li> stick straight.  </li>
            <li> (Think light switch in a middle position.)</li>
            <li> I have been really looking out to buy a hair dryer for a while now...</li>
            <li> really well...</li>
            <li> i dont reallly use it that much though...</li>
            <li> The 1875 Watts is what makes my whole hair drying much faster</li>
            <li> My hair comes out very shiny.    </li>
            <li> However, when I asked my boyfriend if he noticed a difference in my hair, he did not think it was much of a difference at all, vs when I just brush it out</li>
            <li> I have to admit that my hair is already straight.</li>
            <li> /&gt;This dryer may seem pricey, but the attachments and the quality really make up for it.</li>
            <li> This one really does what it says, though.  </li>
            <li> I progress through the grip settings and my hair is relatively straight for days.  </li>
            <li> SHIPPER WAS FAST AND EFFICIENT.  </li>
            <li> Very lightweight.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not doing much effect but requires a lot of work.</li>
            <li> For a while, it did work a lot faster in getting my hair straight.</li>
            <li> I have very curly hair that I like to wear both straight and curly.  </li>
            <li> attachments stay on very well and this dryer lasts for years.  </li>
            <li> I have fairly straight/wavy hair, but my daughter has thick, curly hair.  </li>
            <li> It does a good job of drying, and it is lightweight, which is good, considering how tired the arm gets when using a heavy dryer.  </li>
            <li> I started noticing short flyaways on top of my head that had not previously been there.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;In general, it did seem to work relatively quickly, it did get the hair relatively straight</li>
            <li> /&gt;In general, it did seem to work relatively quickly, it did get the hair relatively straight</li>
            <li> The straightening attachment is bigger and the teeth are longer than the original version.  </li>
            <li> and it looked like I had done a light flat iron.  </li>
            <li> You need to take care with it just as with any other hair roasting device :).</li>
            <li> You need to take care with it just as with any other hair roasting device :).</li>
            <li> This dryer solves this problem better than any other dryer I have tried.  </li>
            <li> Helps makes my hair so smooth that I often don&#x27;t need a flat iron.</li>
            <li> What an amazing little dryer!</li>
            <li> I mean it gets pretty warm, just not as hot, so it takes a little longer to dry, but again, that could be a good thing</li>
            <li> I used it for the first time this morning (with the straightener attachment), and was pleasantly surprised.  </li>
            <li> It has a natural wave, so I was interested in the straightening</li>
            <li> Honestly, I&#x27;m kind of ambivalent towards cosmetic attachments usually, but I&#x27;ve found a usage for each of the three included in the set.</li>
            <li> the ionic feature works for me to cut down on static  </li>
            <li> I bought this blow dryer because I was hoping to cut down on my hair straightening time, but also to get better results than what I was getting.  </li>
            <li> I now wish I had ordered the older model.....</li>
            <li> i had an older model of this and thought perhaps it had been improved.</li>
            <li> I always find that the more expensive ionic hair dryers work better then</li>
            <li> - The Diffuser attachment is mainly for people with curly hair than my wife&#x27;s -</li>
            <li> My short hair dries quickly.</li>
            <li> I use medium heat and many dryers only offer low and high.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s true, the newer version of the Infinit is slightly heavier than the old one, but to be honest, if you&#x27;re used to doing just about anything to get your hair to look decent, the minimal weight gain isn&#x27;t much of a deterrent.    </li>
            <li> I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this hairdryer</li>
            <li> For the price of this hair dryer, I was expecting something a little more substantial.  </li>
            <li> The concept of the dryer/straightener is great, but it&#x27;s actually difficult to use.  </li>
            <li> - While it is a great hair dryer it is a bit on the expensive side.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never been able to juggle a dryer and round brush, so</li>
            <li> (Note that I do get an increase in volume from drying my hair outward from the roots using my normal hair dryer and my fingers, as I probably would if the Conair 224 were used in normal dryer mode.)  </li>
            <li> Worth the extra dollars.</li>
            <li> It usually looks good only on the day I go to the salon.</li>
            <li> Whether using the attachments is worth the time and effort involved will depend on one&#x27;s personal needs and preferences.</li>
            <li> I normally like my hair mid-back or longer</li>
            <li> Very loud when it is on the high setting.  </li>
            <li> although it took some time to learn how to use and finally dry the hair while pulling though, I all ready have straight hair so this only made is more silky , I got the flat ironed look that makes hair appear very shiny once I learned how to use it.</li>
            <li> I can say that the other attachment, that lets you \\&quot;mess up\\&quot; your hair while drying to make it curlier, does a good job on my hair, though my hair can do this mostly on its own, so again, I am left with questionable results.    </li>
            <li> I was skeptical that they had changed too much and ruined the previous model, but I was pleasantly surprised that I liked the new version even better!  </li>
            <li> My hair is super thin and very FLAT, and when I use this attachment, it takes the frizz away, making it look smooth, and it actually creates a little more volume to the top of my head.  </li>
            <li> I finally took all the accessories off and used it as a regular hair dryer, in which case it worked fine.</li>
            <li> I thought of her initially, for the straightening and overall styling attachments, but also knew that I had long been trying to find an effective hairdryer for myself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It is the first blow dryer I have ever used that does not leave that burning after smell in my hair, whether the heat setting is on high or low!</li>
            <li> and I was waiting for it to die to buy a new Hair dryer.</li>
            <li> I live this hair dryer.  </li>
            <li> It seems to be a fine dryer, but just average.</li>
            <li> This particular product, the Infiniti ProfessionaL Nano Silver Tournaline Ceramic Styler is like nothing else on the market.  </li>
            <li> But, something happened the second time and within a relatively short amount of time she had fabulous hair.</li>
            <li> This particular dryer piqued my curiosity based both on the solid construction and the overwhelmingly positive reviews.</li>
            <li> I was very excited to try this new Conair Infiniti 224 since I do like to straighten my hair from time to time, which I usually do using my normal hair dryer and a styling brush and my hands.  </li>
            <li> The diffuser with the rubber fingers is extremely hard to find, so imagine the excitement when I only had to go a couple of months of looking blah to feeling more pretty when I found this blow dryer on Amazon!  </li>
            <li> The instructions were very clear and if there is any confusion, the illustrations will take care of that.    </li>
            <li> Air flow is strong ...and the hot and cold settings are really easy to switch between.</li>
            <li> Might be ok on very long hair as you can pull long hair in front of you, but shoulder length hair</li>
            <li> Quite happy with this - hair dryers are such a personal choice that it&#x27;s hard to buy one online</li>
            <li> Before I bought this,  I already previously owned one &amp; only wanted to fine this same one again to buy because I&#x27;ve never had a hair dryer as good as this one to dry &amp; straighten hair at same time</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been hooked on these since I first got the red one 5 years ago.  </li>
            <li> I would recommend it for blowing out kids&#x27; hair since it is not harsh on the hair!</li>
            <li> Her hair is longer (slightly below shoulder length) and fine.</li>
            <li> This Conair hairdryer surprised me!  </li>
            <li> Several years ago, I purchased the first generation of the Conair Infiniti with the hope that the ceramic plates would ease the frizz factor with a minimum of effort.    </li>
            <li> The back intake has a fine screen covering, so I don&#x27;t have to worry about my long hair getting sucked in (again).      </li>
            <li> Not flat iron, poker straight, but normal hair with body.  </li>
            <li> Cool was cool and hot was heated enough to do the trick without burning your ears or your scalp if you kept it in one place a little too long.  </li>
            <li> My hair is not thick, I just have a lot of it, and thus why I wanted something that could handle my hair AND be gentle enough to use for a blow out.  </li>
            <li> Heavy duty cord is nice and long.  </li>
            <li> With my first use, I got better results (than just a regular blow dryer and flat iron) in less time.  </li>
            <li> The only problem I have with it is that the on/off switch is so large that my hand will shut it off when I use the straightening attachment.</li>
            <li> and I find that I actually am straightening my hair far more often because it takes so little time.  </li>
            <li> Also, the accessories get really hot and are hard to switch out until they cool</li>
            <li> With my second use I was inspired to give it a little more patience (glide drier/comb more slowly through my hair)</li>
            <li> She only used the &#x60;comb accessory&#x27; but it was strong enough and stayed on the dryer much more firmly than other attachments.</li>
            <li> I have naturally coarse, frizzy and very curly hair and have been buying Conair hair dryers since I was 16 years old and lived in N.J.</li>
            <li> A plus for those early mornings.  </li>
            <li> I bought the Conair Professional Hair Designer Pro Nano Silver 3/11/12 because it has two of the straightening plates.  </li>
            <li> The description, package and manual for this product really focus on the straightening capabilities, since that is the big feature for this product.  </li>
            <li> I am completely re-doing this review.  </li>
            <li> So I&#x27;m guessing this dryer is doing nothing as far as emitting ions.  </li>
            <li> and I heard the &#x27;click&#x27; that the instructions speak of (and which I should have obviously waited for), the gentle tug had no effect.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 53 years old and continue to turn to Conair for all of my hair needs.  </li>
            <li> Ladies with natural hair, detangle before you use the straightening attachment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li> Again, straight is a relative term.</li>
            <li> The weight was the only real issue for me.</li>
            <li> The weight was the only real issue for me.</li>
            <li> I have soft hair and the grippers on this machine caught and tangled my hair, not to mention it pulled some of it out.</li>
            <li> My advice, if you have short hair and skip the straightening attachment, this is a great dryer that is comparable to the expensive professional dryers I often use (my cousin is a hair dresser</li>
            <li> With the attachment expect much breakage and the same results as a brush and dryer.  </li>
            <li> Luckily, since I started with small sections as soon as I felt that grip, I gently worked my hair out and started again.  </li>
            <li> It helps to dry from the top rather than from the scalp out as it keeps down the \\&quot;fly-aways.\\</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, I would probably only use this dryer for straightening if there weren&#x27;t other easier methods available.</li>
            <li> I wish I could rate it higher than 3 to 3 ½ stars, but it just did not live up to my expectations for this mid-range appliance with straightening capabilities.  </li>
            <li> Since my hair is very fine, I just dry it a little and then while it is still damp, I go straight to using the straightening comb attached to the hairdryer and after only a couple of passes for each section, my hair is straight and dry and</li>
            <li> Part of this may be that I have hair down to the upper quadrant of my back, which many people would call \\&quot;long\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> Seriously thinking about returning this even though I threw away the box (thought I would love it) or breaking the spring so that my hair glides through like it is suppose to.</li>
            <li> I ordered this product as a replacement for an older dryer, same model.  </li>
            <li> Although the downside is that you might tend to move it more slowly and overdry the hair if you&#x27;re not careful.    </li>
            <li> There is a little, illustrated booklet that takes you step by step through the attachments and also tells you how to use the dryer to obtain certain styles, and for certain hair types.  </li>
            <li> The low heat setting is not very hot, and both settings must be used in order to get the drying job done quickly.  </li>
            <li> However, my hair did dry faster with the diffuser, much faster than with my old hair dryer.    </li>
            <li> Someone with a bob cut might be able to dry their hair in a few minutes and not notice the dryer&#x27;s weight at all, even with non-strong arms.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> If you use the straightener attachment, be careful because it will get hot.      </li>
            <li> That second one has a \\&quot;mist spray\\&quot; to help hydrate and straighten your hair easier (like a normal household iron).    </li>
            <li> It felt a little heavy at first (1 pound without attachments) but the weight is concentrated in the handle and it is easy to maneuver.  </li>
            <li> It cuts the time to dry my hair to about a third of the time and leaves my highly difficult, curly hair smooth, straight and frizz free.  </li>
            <li> I would NOT recommend unless you have fine thin straight hair.</li>
            <li> , I asked my mother to sit in and straightened her very fine thin hair.</li>
            <li> The only drawback is that this dryer is a bit on the heavy side, but luckily it doesn&#x27;t take too long to dry my hair, so this hasn&#x27;t been a huge drawback for</li>
            <li> This item was listed as new, yet when it arrived, I noticed the box had been obviously re-taped.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Although, I do like the new larger section for air flow between the 2 comb straighteners.</li>
            <li> However, after using this product, i found my hair to be neither dry nor straight.</li>
            <li> When I blow dry my hair, time cannot be much of a factor because I do it so inefficiently.  </li>
            <li> This does not blow dry hair very well at all.</li>
            <li> The instruction booklet, which is written in both Spanish and English, contains some very helpfully information on how to fully use this product.</li>
            <li> An instruction booklet that is larger and that has bigger type would be much easier to use.  </li>
            <li> I have found that I go through several of the \\&quot;cheap\\&quot; dryers, and having one of higher quality is probably going to save me money in the long run.</li>
            <li> while there are some small areas for improvement - I would still rate the Infiniti Professional Hair Dryer 4 full stars.</li>
            <li> It also dried my hair quickly.  </li>
            <li> they say hot, they do mean hot.</li>
            <li> they say hot, they do mean hot.</li>
            <li> Long story short, I&#x27;m actually used to more discrete buttons (as I&#x27;m a geek), and instead, with this thing, thereare just two tabs that slide up and down to adjust.</li>
            <li> Long, high quality cord  </li>
            <li> I would not buy this again, and I would not recommend it for someone wanting just a general purpose hair dryer.</li>
            <li> Straightening attachment does not work as well as I expected on my naturally slightly wavy hair with fine to medium texture.  </li>
            <li> I went back to my old hair dryer after two days.</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am an African-American woman with relatively dense natural 3C+4A hair.  </li>
            <li> It even got my roots to lay flat and that was something I could never do with my old hair dryer and comb attachment!  </li>
            <li> So far, this only happened once (in 2 weeks)</li>
            <li> My hair is naturally curly when short and wavy when longer.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t even use the straightening attachment, and my hair was soft and definitely not frizzy!  </li>
            <li> White, Natural, Curly whirly wavy</li>
            <li> Not sure if I could go down to a ceramic-only dryer and get relief from the static, or if I must get completely away from the ceramic.  </li>
            <li> Very powerful for such a small hair dryer.</li>
            <li> As of this point, I can only give this product a 3 out of 5 stars, as not only did it not impress me as much as I thought it might, but with such strange and wide variety of results, I cannot claim that it will give consistent results to anyone (all of the time).    </li>
            <li> , sometimes I have gotten my hair fairly straight and it lasts a while, and other times it just does not work at all.  </li>
            <li> I always had to use a flat iron because I could never blow dry my hair straight with a brush and dryer like they do in the salons.</li>
            <li> and it looked like I did something to it, without being too dramatic and over the top.    </li>
            <li> The results were flatter than I might have achieved normally, but not so flat that it would replace a flat iron or pomade with comb for the truly straightened appearence.</li>
            <li> Funny little shape that I like.  </li>
            <li> Using the easy-to-follow directions, I make a couple of layers of my partially air-dried hair and dry the bottom section first.</li>
            <li> Diffusers never helped, it was easier to Air Dry my hair (and usually pulled back into a ponytail to help keep the top of my hair as flat as possible *</li>
            <li> Sometimes I&#x27;ll go on to use hot rollers to give a little bounce to my hair, but it isn&#x27;t necessary.      </li>
            <li> Initially I was excited about this until I used it for the first time and my hair was sucked into the back of the dryer at least three times every time I blow dried.  </li>
            <li> I have very long, naturally curly</li>
            <li> The packaging claims that the Hair Designer Pro will dry, straighten and shine in one step by using the triple action straightening attachment.  </li>
            <li> I was very excited to get this product because I use a flat iron on my hair everyday and I am destroying my hair with it.</li>
            <li> Not so heavy so that your wrist aches after doing only half your hair, and not so light that you feel as if you have a substandard product.    </li>
            <li> Like I said, it&#x27;s a funny little shaped thing!</li>
            <li> This blow dryer is large and heavy for a travel size.  </li>
            <li> Over the past few years I have experimented more with Flat Iron Straighteners, and I have 2 of these products, a regular Conair flat-iron, and the more expensive (seen on TV and HSN)</li>
            <li> Unfortunately it will take a few months for the hair to regrow to a length where it won&#x27;t be sticking straight up on the top of my head.  </li>
            <li> My hair is about shoulder length (longest strands are about 12-14\\&quot;) and the dryer and attachment seemed to be so large and bulky that it was not easy to get the dryer and my hair oriented, even with the rotatable attachment.  </li>
            <li> I have very big, thick curly/wavy hair and in warm weather I usually let it curl and air dry.  </li>
            <li> It is small enough if I need to take it on holiday, but dries my thick, very wavy hair quickly.  </li>
            <li> The process took less time than normal and she didn&#x27;t feel like she needed excessive conditioner as it wasn&#x27;t&#x27; too hot.</li>
            <li> yes its little to begin with for me especially because my older dryers have been much bigger...</li>
            <li> When it broke, I bypassed the plain ceramic dryers and went straight for the tourmaline ceramic.  </li>
            <li> I had an old fashioned dryer prior that did dry out my hair and also took forever to dry.  </li>
            <li> I typically blow dry my hair straight with a hairdryer and a brush and straighten with a hair iron (currently a Solia branded iron).  </li>
            <li> If you continue to use the straightening attachment after you think your hair is dry for just a couple of minutes, you&#x27;ll get a much smoother, less frizzy result.  </li>
            <li> After using this dryer with the attached straightening comb, my hair is as straight as with a flat iron, with less frizzies and lots of shine!  </li>
            <li> My only complaint is that it does not get as hot as my last one,</li>
            <li> Coupled with the straightening attachment, I can confirm like other reviewers that this thing has the power and distribution to reach the roots near the scalp.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> She was using a flat iron daily before we started using this dryer.  </li>
            <li> I just figure since the thing is so small compared to most blow-dryers, it wouldn&#x27;t be hard to fabricate a hard-plastic storage/keepcase for it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2.</li>
            <li> Cons: Bulky and heavy to use, does not style well on shoulder length hair nor hair that is already straight and takes too long to use the straightener.    </li>
            <li> However, if you have long hair beware of the short nose that causes hair to be sucked through the back intake.  </li>
            <li> This dried my hair quickly with little frizz.  </li>
            <li> that are tooooo long ~ or ~ my arms are toooo short and can&#x27;t use &#x27;em!!!!  </li>
            <li> I still had to use a flat iron.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Awkward to handle&lt;br /&gt;Doesn&#x27;t replace a flat iron (as advertised)</li>
            <li> The cord is extra long and quite helpful.     </li>
            <li> i&#x27;d just rather use a flat iron.</li>
            <li> but it does take some getting use to when you are used to a flat</li>
            <li> So I wanted to eliminate the flat iron by using this product and it isn&#x27;t up to my expectations.  </li>
            <li> The switch is too big (about 2 inches long) and moves too freely.&lt;br</li>
            <li> First: my hair is thick and shoulderlength.</li>
            <li> It took so long to dry my hair; individual sections that I grabbed my regular blow dryer.  </li>
            <li> The results were the same as if I had let my hair air dry.</li>
            <li> The straightening attachment on this unit is easier to use than I expected, but I might not be taking enough time to use it properly because my hair does not come out</li>
            <li> They are right, it is a little heavy</li>
            <li> I found that it is easiest if you dry your hair normally until it is just a little damp and then put on the straightening attachment.</li>
            <li> I have lots of naturally curly hair (not very coarse, but not fine by any stretch).  </li>
            <li> : Dries hair very fast, eliminates frizz, gives hair a little shine with a little body.    </li>
            <li> attachments are fairly big and clunky to store, straightening took more time than I expected, slightly awkward to use on short to medium length hair (chin length)</li>
            <li> I gave up on flat irons a long time ago because it just took too long.  </li>
            <li> I am very careful in general when I use devices like this because, having hair that is sometimes to my mid-back or longer, I have probably hit every problem known to woman that can happen with long hair.</li>
            <li> The dryer is very bulky and hard to handle.  </li>
            <li> I assume this is so because the price is much reduced and the item is to hard to find to begin with.</li>
            <li> relatively* straight, or at least \\&quot;straighter\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> I know, it&#x27;s not confusing once you read the user manual, and it&#x27;s really difficult to explain why I consider them difficult to use without making myself sound like too much of a simpleton.</li>
            <li> It took a long time to style my hair and no matter how I tried, could not get it to go under on the ends as the video demonstrated.     </li>
            <li> The pictures in the manual show women with rather long hair.  </li>
            <li> Kept it too long.  </li>
            <li> It may look scary on the outside, but I was surprised how gentle it was to use.  </li>
            <li> I have long bushy hair bit</li>
            <li> Yes, over a blow dryer, but you know how it is using one thing for soooo long, and nothing else seems to work</li>
            <li> I have a lot of hair and it takes me a long time to style it.</li>
            <li> they are way to big and not very</li>
            <li> If I were rating it as just a regular hair dryer and not a styler / straightener, I would give it 4 or 4 ½ stars (but then the price should be much less, if it were a regular hair dryer).</li>
            <li> I think the Conair 224 may workgreat for straightening long or very long hair.    </li>
            <li> The hairdryer with the straightening comb attached, straightens my long hair in about half the time it takes me with a flat iron and believe me - a flat iron takes FOREVER with long hair.  </li>
            <li> It is the quickest way to dry and straighten my hair.  </li>
            <li> Using this unit with the diffuser is easier because I can dry my hair with one hand.  </li>
            <li> Be that as it may, with hair at this length it takes a while to dry.</li>
            <li> Seems to dry my hair faster.  </li>
            <li> I do have to remember which end is which when I dry my hair, though.  </li>
            <li> My arms actually get tired from doing the straightening motions, the weight of the dryer has no effect really.</li>
            <li> I am a natural Red-Head, my hair is very thick, mostly coarse as well, and naturally curly (can be just slightly wavy to curly to spiral/corkscrew curls).  </li>
            <li> This is actually faster than when using a conventional hair dryer with a brush.     </li>
            <li> I tried it and found it catch my hair and pulled out single strands at a time - ouch.</li>
            <li> I blow it dry, but the minute I put down the dryer and grab a wooden or static-free brush to comb it.....</li>
            <li> With shorter hair there may not be enough room to grab hair and work the dryer down the length of the section.</li>
            <li> but I noticed on the first use that I had HORRIBLE static in my hair that just makes it plaster to my head and face.  </li>
            <li> and she has very long, very thick, very curly hair.  </li>
            <li> There are two other attachments, a diffuser used to dry hair without blowing out the curls and a concentrator for styling, which are also included and can be used after the straightening attachment.</li>
            <li> , I have static so bad, my hair is not even considered styled.  </li>
            <li> Keep in mind that it uses a wide gapped comb motion</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s heavy and your hair gets caught in the 2nd ceramic straightener.  </li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t imagine anyone thinking this is any harder.  </li>
            <li> Because it is not really for that \\&quot;bone straight\\&quot; -Dominican</li>
            <li> AND I&#x27;m not very patient either.  </li>
            <li> Overall, I do like the unit, but I want to mention a few things.     </li>
            <li> Seems you have to be careful with your grip on the handle.</li>
            <li> So I would curious how she would find this.  </li>
            <li> never really let my hair sit where it looked</li>
            <li> The problem is that the booklet is roughly three by six inches.</li>
            <li> No intense heat and a brush/dryer in one.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t tend to brush my hair, so the amount of hair trapped in the straightener was similar to what I would have found in my brush after blow</li>
            <li> sorry I thought I could use an economical dryer.</li>
            <li> Again, I can&#x27;t say the weather does not influence my results (if it is hot and humid, or one day has less wind than another), and as I have not blown dry my hair for almost 20 years, I can&#x27;t comment a whole lot on that aspect, other than my hair does not seem to get as bad as I remember it to get, but it has been 18 years...    </li>
            <li> my hair is very hard to handle and gets very frizzy but with this, i can just straighten it in half the time.  </li>
            <li> Reading the reviews for this hair dryer, I was a little worried that it wouldn&#x27;t do anything for my hair since I saw very few reviews from people with natural hair.  </li>
            <li> However, I decided to order it anyway because I was in desperate need of a new dryer (my last one was from the mid 90s and overheated all the time).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Very little air when it is on the low setting.  </li>
            <li> It is also much less harsh for the hair than using a regular blow dryer, and then straightening iron afterwards.</li>
            <li> Like the other reviewers, I have to say it does have some weight to it.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t imagine straightening my hair any other way.  </li>
            <li> 20 minutes in my hair (and I can be doing other things in that 20 minutes)</li>
            <li> The diffuser is a joke - it is too small to properly diffuse the air.  </li>
            <li> Other comments:  </li>
            <li> Not interested in comments suggesting I buy dryer sheets to run over my hair.  </li>
            <li> In other words, don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s the ceramic or the tourmaline ceramic</li>
            <li> it was too heavy to use on my long hair.</li>
            <li> and it did so without tangles or other issues.</li>
            <li> and it did so without tangles or other issues.</li>
            <li> I have not used any of the other pieces as I do not need them.  </li>
            <li> I even went to the manufacturer&#x27;s website trying to find the model I had, but it was so old (had it for nearly 20 years!), and I was afraid they stopped making the rubber ones.  </li>
            <li> I am very disappointed because I really liked the concept of having one extra hand to help with styling instead of doing the brush/hairdryer combo.    </li>
            <li> This is one of very few units that was compact enough.  </li>
            <li> because it&#x27;s held up for several years so far and wasn&#x27;t too expensive</li>
            <li> /scrunch dry my hair in just a few minutes.</li>
            <li> It is a small size booklet with type that seems smaller than average.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s difficult to get the angles right, and it&#x27;s quite heavy.  </li>
            <li> The other diffusers are plastic and hard and hurt my head (I bought several blow dryers during those two months, trying to find a replacement).  </li>
            <li> but this helped to fluff it up a little</li>
            <li> I have VERY thick hair that has a natural wave</li>
            <li> I put the attachment at, it was just hard to get my hair to go through it properly.</li>
            <li> hair is very curly (think Mel B [Scary Spice from the Spice Girls]</li>
            <li> I pored through hundreds of pages, reviews, and video demonstrations of various blow-dryers, but in the end the feature set I sought after wasn&#x27;t extremely complex.</li>
            <li> Seems to be constructed quite well - a tad heavy but not unusually so.  </li>
            <li> I literally had to press down on the plates with a finger to release my hair to prevent it from being ripped out.  </li>
            <li> It might be that length of time that is wearing down my arm.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, your degree of affection for the Infiniti will probably boil down to what you&#x27;d rather spend time doing -- blow-drying or straightening.</li>
            <li> Also, my hair usually takes FOREVER to dry.  </li>
            <li> This drys my hair in less time than I&#x27;m accustomed to, and I like anything that cuts down the time on my morning routine.</li>
            <li> Usually, when I dry my hair without straightening it, I get a frizzy mess.  </li>
            <li> I bought two previously</li>
            <li> I have relaxed black hair</li>
            <li> and I always use the tension control setting (1) because it has a lot less tension than what is recommended for my hair which would be (4).  </li>
            <li> It takes me less than 15 minutes</li>
            <li> I have curly wavy hair, and I typically use a hairdryer to blow</li>
            <li> I have no use for the concentrator attachment (typically used for brush drying)</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s less \\&quot;ouch\\&quot; dragging it through your hair than the previous Infiniti; I chalk that up to the two comb feature.    </li>
            <li> half a dozen of the other.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I use my right hand to hold the dryer and my left hand to hold the hair down at the base of the straightening attachment.  </li>
            <li> I have long, thick, wavy hair that has always been a challenge to style without taking a ton of products and a ton of time.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it two times and both times the plates held tightly onto my hair and ripped it out as I pulled away.  </li>
            <li> manual and the instructional DVD will tell you to put the tension setting on a 4 for African-American textured hair and tight curls (the tightest it can be).  </li>
            <li> I used that one for years even though I had dropped it and broke the little plastic piece that held the straightening attachment on and had to ghetto-rig the attachment on there with hair ties.  </li>
            <li> This thing is a little pricey.  </li>
            <li> Also, the connectors that attach the accessories are a little squirrely at times.  </li>
            <li> I can imagine that someone not familiar with hair dryers might run into a problem with the power on this device and its intake, but that is a learning process for anyone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m also a little concerned about the effect that using that amount of tension might have on my hair after awhile.</li>
            <li> This model it&#x27;s not worth the money!</li>
            <li> As a man-sumer with very little in the way of knowledge on blow-dryers and which brands to shop for, my experience with finding this particular model was a difficult one.</li>
            <li> The straightening attachment is a little heavy.  </li>
            <li> A little heavy, but not too.  </li>
            <li> Also, it is a fairly heavy little thing.</li>
            <li> Even when I grab haphazard glumps of hair, it comes out straight, with a flip at the bottom if I want it.</li>
            <li> its heavy but seems sturdy.</li>
            <li> so I could stop the static.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well, everyday since purchasing this thing</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s heavy at all.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had it and have used it religiously everyday for over two years.  </li>
            <li> The Infiniti 224 is slightly heavy, and using the attachments takes practice.  </li>
            <li> I did find the Infinity to be relatively heavy to use and maneuver.  </li>
            <li> After a few uses is noticeable but may be an issue for others.</li>
            <li> Also, the booklet could easily be misplaced because of its size.     </li>
            <li> I used it a few times-</li>
            <li> Any doubt if there&#x27;s one I will have trouble ...</li>
            <li> This blow dryer lacks power and was a waste of money and time.</li>
            <li> and I had inadvertently pushed down (just a small amount) on the on/off/speed button which caused it to turn off.</li>
            <li> My hair is thick, past my shoulders and wavy to curly but NOT super tight ringlets.  </li>
            <li> Small and lightweight.  </li>
            <li> No static -</li>
            <li> The appliance seemed to work okay for straightening the sides of my hair (with a lot of coaxing) but was especially difficult to use at the back of my head and some of the waves were difficult to comb out.  </li>
            <li> It is awkward to put up near my head.  </li>
            <li> I was really skeptical since I tried another product that was similar to this product.  </li>
            <li> and that&#x27;s all that is usually needed to get the job done.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure how well this would work on shorter hair.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure any dryer could get my hair to be pencil-straight.</li>
            <li> MaxiGlide product (with small portable traveller iron).  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for a dual voltage hairdryer that is both small for travel but also had a diffuser.  </li>
            <li> It is recommmended you use small sections, and I did...</li>
            <li> About 1 year later it started to make weird noises and after a couple of weeks it stopped working altogether.</li>
            <li> small for attachments</li>
            <li> I have a GHD flat iron, which is a very tough act to follow for any styling.  </li>
            <li> but everyone knows how hard it is to find a small hairdrier with a disfuser.  </li>
            <li> Admittedly, I&#x27;m not good with a round brush/blow dryer</li>
            <li> It is heavy, bulky, very difficult to reach the back of your head with.</li>
            <li> HOWEVER, my VS Dryer&#x27;s combs always break, and it&#x27;s hard to find replacement parts, so I bought this one.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s been hard to find.  </li>
            <li> Do not learn the hard way as I did:  4 ripped out my hair.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s always hard to judge for someone if a given hair dryer is going to seem \\&quot;heavy\\&quot; or \\&quot;light\\&quot; to them.</li>
            <li> Hard to use on my thick hair.  </li>
            <li> hair is very thick and very fragile with sort of a messy, haphazard wave.</li>
            <li> Now, I&#x27;m straightening my hair at least twice a week and that would have never happened without this gizmo.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in my late 30s</li>
            <li> Also, the packaging makes it a bit awkward to put everything back in it after you use the Hair Designer Pro and close up the box.</li>
            <li> Confusing buttons?</li>
            <li> (after air drying) is 12-14 minutes for my shoulder-length, medium thick hair.</li>
            <li> hair is relatively thick</li>
            <li> did not find the attachment very difficult to use, though the back of my head was hard to get -- it seemed like no matter</li>
            <li> There is a knack to doing this, as you must insert the lower comb at a particular angle into the base of the hair section.  </li>
            <li> - this has been a problem in the past, and my thin hair doesn&#x27;t respond well to overheating.</li>
            <li> Seriously, about 5 minutes into the process</li>
            <li> Seems expensive for basically a hair dryer with a few attachments.&lt;br /&gt;3.  </li>
            <li> The power switch is in an awful place, right where your hand holds the dryer.</li>
            <li> I was also disappointed that the attachments between the two hair dryers are not compatible even though this is within the same line.  </li>
            <li> Still, I&#x27;m skeptical about the hassle of ordering another one and risking it not fitting again...</li>
            <li> I have very thick, wavy, color-treated hair, and this dryer is the product I have been waiting for.  </li>
            <li> The tension control spring on this \\&quot;upgraded\\&quot; unit is unnecessarily tighter.  </li>
            <li> I also found the dryer a bit heavy and somewaht awkward to manipulate through my hair.  </li>
            <li> my arms got tired.</li>
            <li> With the straightening attachment my hair was broken and ripped out no matter what tension setting</li>
            <li> I changed attachments to blow dry my hair with the nozzle and was completely disappointed.  </li>
            <li> I am so disappointed:( because I  was really depending on this!</li>
            <li> It tangles like crazy and it is almost impossible to straighten with a flat iron.</li>
            <li> I gave it 4 out of 5 just because the straightening attachment is supposed to be a plus, and I found it to be useless.  </li>
            <li> But a bit difficult to handle and a bit on the expensive side.</li>
            <li> It was difficult to guide my hair through the comb attachment.  </li>
            <li> So my sister comes to visit and when I ask her to help me review the Conair Infiniti, she gives me a weird look and says, \\&quot;Why did you get this?\\&quot; followed by,</li>
            <li> I am not sure if over time, it will loosen up a bit on the ends, but I am too afraid to find out!</li>
            <li> Awkward to handle.  </li>
            <li> One note on attaching and removing the attachments: the booklet warns not to remove without depressing the buttons on the sides.  </li>
            <li> Colder weather is problematic because air drying takes forever and makes me cold.</li>
            <li> well, in the sense that it stinks.</li>
            <li> I returned it after one disappointing use.</li>
            <li> I found using this product very difficult.</li>
            <li> bad:  </li>
            <li> I would have to shut the dryer off and pull my hair out which resulted in painful hair pulling and breakage.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use crap like that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The attachments are held in with latches, which I appreciate as I hate dealing with attachments falling into the sink or getting stuck in my hair.</li>
            <li> Nearly impossible to find!  </li>
            <li> But it is not that bad!</li>
            <li> /&gt;This is just horrible.  </li>
            <li> ANNOYING!</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Was looking for a hairdryer with a short barrel and be able to use it with the voluminizer/diffuser attached ~ this one was close to perfect!!!! I bought two previously that are tooooo long ~ or ~ my arms are toooo short and can&#x27;t use &#x27;em!!!!  Would have preferred smaller/thinner fingers but this works ok!!!! I Love the rubber tips!!!  Fast delivery also!!!!  Thanx  Sheila</li>
            <li> loved it! my hair is very hard to handle and gets very frizzy but with this, i can just straighten it in half the time.  Im only giving it 4 stars because i think i wuld&#x27;ve loved it to have more settings for better heat control, but otherwise it is perfect!</li>
            <li> We have been using this unit every day since we got it.  My daughter and I love it.  Like the other reviewers, I have to say it does have some weight to it. However, it&#x27;s a multi-functional dryer that really does get the job done.  I have fairly straight/wavy hair, but my daughter has thick, curly hair.  She was using a flat iron daily before we started using this dryer.  Now, she has had minimal use of the flat iron because of the excellent results from this machine.    Keep in mind that it uses a wide gapped comb motion so it&#x27;s important to have your hair brushed out before you begin.  The drying action is fast and the designed attachments really do a nice job at straightening the hair! We are happy with the results and recommend this product.</li>
            <li> This dried my hair quickly with little frizz.  I would definitely recommend it for those who have a problem with frizzy hair.  I like that the dryer has three heat settings.  I use medium heat and many dryers only offer low and high.  It also dried my hair quickly.  A plus for those early mornings.  I did not find the straightening attachment easy to use.  Maybe my hair is too short (chin length).  I still had to use a flat iron.  I don&#x27;t imagine any hair dryer that would change that.  A great choice for those who travel a lot.  Small and lightweight.  The straightening attachment is a little heavy.  You may want to leave that at home.  I gave it 4 out of 5 just because the straightening attachment is supposed to be a plus, and I found it to be useless.  Good dryer.</li>
            <li> its heavy but seems sturdy. Saves time for my wife. she looksperfect after using it everymorning before she goes to work.</li>
            <li> I have lots of fine wavy hair. It tangles like crazy and it is almost impossible to straighten with a flat iron. I am not about to spend 2 hours styling my hair. I bought the last version of this hair dryer when it first came out and loved it. I was happy that this one has the extra attachments and adjustable heat settings.   The only problem I have with it is that the on/off switch is so large that my hand will shut it off when I use the straightening attachment. Not a big deal, I have had to change the way I grip the handle.     I found that it is easiest if you dry your hair normally until it is just a little damp and then put on the straightening attachment. It is great because my hair is straight and not frizzy and it didn&#x27;t take any longer than just drying it.</li>
            <li> I happily received my order really quick and was excited to start using the product. The concept of the dryer/straightener is great, but it&#x27;s actually difficult to use.  It&#x27;s heavy and your hair gets caught in the 2nd ceramic straightener.  I now wish I had ordered the older model.....</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had Conair Infiniti Tourmaline Hair Designer (Wine) UPC: 074108079572, Item model number: 208R2P for years.  I have relaxed black hair and I always use the tension control setting (1) because it has a lot less tension than what is recommended for my hair which would be (4).  I bought the Conair Professional Hair Designer Pro Nano Silver 3/11/12 because it has two of the straightening plates.  I&#x27;ve used it two times and both times the plates held tightly onto my hair and ripped it out as I pulled away.  Keep in mind I still have the tension control set at (1).  The tension control spring on this \\&quot;upgraded\\&quot; unit is unnecessarily tighter.  I literally had to press down on the plates with a finger to release my hair to prevent it from being ripped out.  The diffuser attachment feels nice on the scalp.  The motor is quieter than its predecessor.  It would help if the power &amp; speed switch were in a different location or better design because when you grip the handle you find yourself unintentionally adjusting things. I was also disappointed that the attachments between the two hair dryers are not compatible even though this is within the same line.  I went back to using my Conair Infiniti Tourmaline Hair Designer.  Seriously thinking about returning this even though I threw away the box (thought I would love it) or breaking the spring so that my hair glides through like it is suppose to.</li>
            <li> There is no product like it available anymore.  I lost my first one and had to get another...I looked everywhere and couldn&#x27;t find anything even close in the stores.  Found it on Amazon, thank goodness!  It is the quickest way to dry and straighten my hair.  It is also much less harsh for the hair than using a regular blow dryer, and then straightening iron afterwards.</li>
            <li> This thing gets really, really hot, and when used as directed, tangles and knots my hair and leaves it frizzed out.  I went back to my old hair dryer after two days.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used the blow dryer function, my wife used the blow dryer and straightener functions.  This review is based on our combined experience with this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The goods:&lt;br /&gt;1.  Nice, solid build quality&lt;br /&gt;2.  Works as well as can be expected as a blow dryer, very fast and effective at straightening and untangling hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bad:&lt;br /&gt;1.  Awkward to handle.  Fine as a dryer, but with the attachments, my wife felt that it is too big and heavy.&lt;br /&gt;2.  Seems expensive for basically a hair dryer with a few attachments.&lt;br /&gt;3.  Some sort of bag or case would be nice to store the attachments.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Conclusion:  Good quality hair dryer.  Fast, effective straightener.  But a bit difficult to handle and a bit on the expensive side.</li>
            <li> A little bulky for travel but has good motor and dries quickly. Diffuser was reason I bought this dryer and it&#x27;s a good one.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been hooked on these since I first got the red one 5 years ago.  I used that one for years even though I had dropped it and broke the little plastic piece that held the straightening attachment on and had to ghetto-rig the attachment on there with hair ties.  Finally, after struggling with my special \\&quot;fix\\&quot; too many times, I decided to get this new, fully intact upgrade.  I was skeptical that they had changed too much and ruined the previous model, but I was pleasantly surprised that I liked the new version even better!  The straightening attachment is bigger and the teeth are longer than the original version.  For those of you who are first trying this, it may take time figuring out what works best for you.  I have lots of long, curly/wavy (but mostly curly) hair.  I start with the sections of hair by my face and then flip my hair over to do the rest.  I use my right hand to hold the dryer and my left hand to hold the hair down at the base of the straightening attachment.  I&#x27;ve never been able to juggle a dryer and round brush, so I can&#x27;t imagine anyone thinking this is any harder.  If you continue to use the straightening attachment after you think your hair is dry for just a couple of minutes, you&#x27;ll get a much smoother, less frizzy result.  It also does help to do a quick touch up with a straightening iron.  Even the best irons by themselves take way too long for me to straighten.  I can&#x27;t imagine straightening my hair any other way.  It takes me less than 15 minutes and I have yet to notice any damage to my hair.    The only con I have for this dryer is with the way I hold it because I&#x27;ve found myself accidentally sliding the power switch off.  I think this might just take some getting used to since this version also changed the switch to upgrade from \\&quot;off, low, high\\&quot; and a cool button to \\&quot;off, low, high\\&quot; and \\&quot;low, warm, hot\\&quot; heat settings and a cool button.</li>
            <li> Are you a contortionist? You will need to be to use this product. It is heavy, bulky, very difficult to reach the back of your head with. Might be ok on very long hair as you can pull long hair in front of you, but shoulder length hair...forget it! It took a long time to style my hair and no matter how I tried, could not get it to go under on the ends as the video demonstrated.     There were no instructions on how to use the diffuser and as I never used one before, I had to call CONAIR. The rep on the phone told me if I used the diffuser on already straight hair (yes, my hair is already straight but not smooth unless set with rollers) it would give me waves...not true! The results were the same as if I had let my hair air dry. However, my hair did dry faster with the diffuser, much faster than with my old hair dryer.    The straightener took the frizz out but there was no style as I could not get the ends to turn under (I looked like a scarecrow). I will be going back to my heated rollers....20 minutes in my hair (and I can be doing other things in that 20 minutes) and I have great looking hair.    Pros: Dries hair very fast, eliminates frizz, gives hair a little shine with a little body.    Cons: Bulky and heavy to use, does not style well on shoulder length hair nor hair that is already straight and takes too long to use the straightener.    Overall: Best suited to very long, wavy or curly hair.    Tip: Best price I&#x27;ve seen is at the store &#x27;Tuesday Morning&#x27;....$19.99.</li>
            <li> For the price of this hair dryer, I was expecting something a little more substantial.  This is about the size of a travel hair dryer, and sounds like one too.  Very loud when it is on the high setting.  Very little air when it is on the low setting.  The diffuser is a joke - it is too small to properly diffuse the air.  I have not used the straightening tool, so maybe that is where this hair dryer shines.  I would not buy this again, and I would not recommend it for someone wanting just a general purpose hair dryer.</li>
            <li> Okay, so it does not bone straight-blow-out your hair, but it does protect your hair fiber from over exposure to the high heat! Plus the heat is not the type that has that burning smell after your hair has been blown out! I have type 4C hair and my hair is relaxed. So when I used this blow dryer  to blow out my roots, it just lightly blows it out from, kinky to coily! NOT BONE STRAIGHT! I think us with 4 hair type was really expecting that! But it is not that bad! It is the first blow dryer I have ever used that does not leave that burning after smell in my hair, whether the heat setting is on high or low! I love that about this CONAIR dryer! I think the advertisers should have made a difference between the 4A, 4B, and 4C hair types. Because it is not really for that \\&quot;bone straight\\&quot; -Dominican blowout effect that most of us are looking for! I would recommend it for blowing out kids&#x27; hair since it is not harsh on the hair! But with every hair tool you have to protect your hair cuticles and and hair fiber with some form of heat protection, regardless a blow dryer, over head dryer and irons! So overall I would say that it is more than fairly and good hair dryer because it dries quickly, leaving my hair feeling light, SOFT and SMOOTH and the after smell is of the product not the burning effect! But it does get hot! If you use this hair dryer use high speed but on warm temp!- that gets your hair dry in no time!  Hope this helps!</li>
            <li> I have a GHD flat iron, which is a very tough act to follow for any styling.  Although this dryer does an okay job, by comparison, well there just is no comparison.  It does a good job of drying, and it is lightweight, which is good, considering how tired the arm gets when using a heavy dryer.  Overall, I prefer it for drying over styling.</li>
            <li> I have very long, naturally curly hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The good:  The hairdryer with the straightening comb attached, straightens my long hair in about half the time it takes me with a flat iron and believe me - a flat iron takes FOREVER with long hair.  After using this dryer with the attached straightening comb, my hair is as straight as with a flat iron, with less frizzies and lots of shine!  I gave up on flat irons a long time ago because it just took too long.  Now, I&#x27;m straightening my hair at least twice a week and that would have never happened without this gizmo.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bad:  This thing is a little pricey.  Also, the connectors that attach the accessories are a little squirrely at times.  Sometimes, I&#x27;ll go to straighten and the comb will just become detached and I&#x27;ll have to fool with it to get the accessory to lock back onto the hairdryer.  Also, the accessories get really hot and are hard to switch out until they cool off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All-in-all, this nifty gadget saves lots of time straightening my long hair and for that alone, it may make it worth the investment for many people.  I am enjoying the saved time in the bathroom!  I actually will bother with straightening because it doesn&#x27;t take hours, just minutes!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE:  I have now owned this product for several weeks and I find that I actually am straightening my hair far more often because it takes so little time.  Since my hair is very fine, I just dry it a little and then while it is still damp, I go straight to using the straightening comb attached to the hairdryer and after only a couple of passes for each section, my hair is straight and dry and no frizz!  I am liking this gadget more and more each day!</li>
            <li> I was excited about this product as I straighten my hair, and any way to make it easier is of interest.    I found using this product very difficult. You had to hold it and pull the hair through, and I did not find that this significantly straightened my hair at all.    I finally took all the accessories off and used it as a regular hair dryer, in which case it worked fine.</li>
            <li> I have shoulder length wavy hair. I was very excited about this product, since it would cut out a step in the process of drying and straightening my hair. However, after using this product, i found my hair to be neither dry nor straight. I even tried it again, using it on the highest setting, which is recommended for very coarse hair, which i do not have, and that did not work either. So I read through the instructions a second time, then used it again. Still no results. This product is nothing more than a glorified hair dryer, and not even a good one...</li>
            <li> This dryer doesn&#x27;t get my hair as straight as my old Vidal Sassoon (similar to the Vidal Sassoon VS783 - can&#x27;t remember the model number right now), and it isn&#x27;t as easy to wield either, since I have to keep changing the position of the comb. HOWEVER, my VS Dryer&#x27;s combs always break, and it&#x27;s hard to find replacement parts, so I bought this one. This comb wont break (very sturdy!) plus it holds your hair taut for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair is very curly (think Mel B [Scary Spice from the Spice Girls] circa 1997), so no dryer will replace a dryer + flat iron, but this does a pretty good job. I&#x27;m still getting used to it, and it does get easier to use over time. I also like that it has a diffuser attachment for when I wear my hair curly, which is most of the time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PRO:&lt;br /&gt;Very sturdy (dryer and parts)&lt;br /&gt;Many attachments for different uses&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS:&lt;br /&gt;Awkward to handle&lt;br /&gt;Doesn&#x27;t replace a flat iron (as advertised)</li>
            <li> I was very excited to try this new Conair Infiniti 224 since I do like to straighten my hair from time to time, which I usually do using my normal hair dryer and a styling brush and my hands.  The description, package and manual for this product really focus on the straightening capabilities, since that is the big feature for this product.  I was hopeful that the Conair 224 with straightener attachment would be easy to use and work well for me so that I could straighten my hair more often.      What I like about this product:  Nice quality, solid appliance  Attractive and stylish appearance  Versatile - comes with straightener, diffuser and concentrator attachments  Two fan speed settings and 3 heat settings + a cool button to set your style  No tangles from the comb  No static - the ionic feature works for me to cut down on static  It has good power and dries hair quickly  Attachments can be rotated 360 degrees (clicks in at 1/8 turn points)  Adjustable tension on the Straightener attachment comb (although I did not need it)  Long, high quality cord  Nice flip out cover on the back mesh that covers the air intake, for easy cleaning  Good manual with lots of tips on using the dryer and attachments    Other comments:  Straightening attachment does not work as well as I expected on my naturally slightly wavy hair with fine to medium texture.  It was difficult to guide my hair through the comb attachment.  My hair is about shoulder length (longest strands are about 12-14\\&quot;) and the dryer and attachment seemed to be so large and bulky that it was not easy to get the dryer and my hair oriented, even with the rotatable attachment.  The appliance seemed to work okay for straightening the sides of my hair (with a lot of coaxing) but was especially difficult to use at the back of my head and some of the waves were difficult to comb out.  I find that a brush with my normal dryer (or my hot air brush dryer) works better on my hair and is easier.  I think the Conair 224 may workgreat for straightening long or very long hair.    The dryer is very bulky and hard to handle.  It is awkward to put up near my head.  It also takes up a lot of space to store.  Although the weight makes the styler feel solid, it is really quite heavy and gets tiring to use.  The diffuser attachment is huge - 5\\&quot; across by 4\\&quot; tall, including the spikes.      I did not have any problems with inadvertently switching air flow and heat settings, even though the buttons are on the handle.    I did not perceive any increase in volume from drying my hair outward from the roots when using the Straightener as directed, as implied by the manual.  (Note that I do get an increase in volume from drying my hair outward from the roots using my normal hair dryer and my fingers, as I probably would if the Conair 224 were used in normal dryer mode.)  I also did not perceive any improvement in the shine of my hair.  The last 3\\&quot; or so of my hair seemed frizzed out (but not static-y) after using the dryer.    Overall, the Conair Infiniti 224 is a good, high quality hair dryer, but the straightening attachment just did not work well on my hair.  I wish I could rate it higher than 3 to 3 ½ stars, but it just did not live up to my expectations for this mid-range appliance with straightening capabilities.  If I were rating it as just a regular hair dryer and not a styler / straightener, I would give it 4 or 4 ½ stars (but then the price should be much less, if it were a regular hair dryer).</li>
            <li> I am completely re-doing this review.  I was initially wowed by the the less-than-one-minute drying time....but I noticed on the first use that I had HORRIBLE static in my hair that just makes it plaster to my head and face.  I blew it off, not realizing it was the dryer giving me the static.  I would end up wetting my hands and trying to rub on my hair so I could stop the static.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well, everyday since purchasing this thing, I have static so bad, my hair is not even considered styled.  I blow it dry, but the minute I put down the dryer and grab a wooden or static-free brush to comb it.....it flies straight up or to my face.  From that moment on, it never stops.  I cannot put any of my wooden brushes in my hair.  Not my plastic combs either.  I try to brush with my fingers.....just more static.  I sleep on my hair, then get up in the morning and brush my hair....ZOOM!  Flies to my face and sticks there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I never had static in my hair in my 49 years on this earth.  I have changed nothing except for buying this dryer.  Not interested in comments suggesting I buy dryer sheets to run over my hair.  I don&#x27;t use crap like that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This dryer will have to be replaced.  I had an old fashioned dryer prior that did dry out my hair and also took forever to dry.  When it broke, I bypassed the plain ceramic dryers and went straight for the tourmaline ceramic.  Not sure if I could go down to a ceramic-only dryer and get relief from the static, or if I must get completely away from the ceramic.  In other words, don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s the ceramic or the tourmaline ceramic that is giving me 24/7-stuck-to-my-head-and-face static.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is just horrible.  I just did an internet search and many sources say that ion-producing hair dryers ELIMINATE static.  So I&#x27;m guessing this dryer is doing nothing as far as emitting ions.  I believe it claims that it does....can&#x27;t see that page while I&#x27;m writing this review.</li>
            <li> Like my title said, I am amazed by this dryer.  I have VERY thick hair that has a natural wave (so much so that I can put mousse and hairspray in it and get a great wave/curl).  I was really skeptical since I tried another product that was similar to this product.  I used it for the first time this morning (with the straightener attachment), and was pleasantly surprised.  It straightened my hair beautifully, left it smooth and without static, and it even got the areas of the back of my head that tend to stay waved/kinked.  It took a little bit to get used to it and figure out what worked best for me as far as handling it, but once I got it, I loved it!!!  I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s heavy at all.  I am excited to try out the diffuser attachment :)</li>
            <li> To say that I am not an expert at using blow dryers would be a gross understatement.  When I blow dry my hair, time cannot be much of a factor because I do it so inefficiently.  So read this review knowing that a (self) acknowledged klutz had it in her hands.    Can I say?  This dryer looks SO cool!  Straight out of the box, it looks like something you SHOULD be using in 2008 (through 2015).    It has a nice weight.  Not so heavy so that your wrist aches after doing only half your hair, and not so light that you feel as if you have a substandard product.    The heat settings:  Cool was cool and hot was heated enough to do the trick without burning your ears or your scalp if you kept it in one place a little too long.  This is a HUGE plus for me.  Although the downside is that you might tend to move it more slowly and overdry the hair if you&#x27;re not careful.    Air flow:  I liked it.  It has &#x27;low/high&#x27; settings but it feels more like &#x27;low/medium&#x27; to me and that&#x27;s all that is usually needed to get the job done.  You know - it doesn&#x27;t feel as if the air flow is trying to rip the hair from your head.    There is a little, illustrated booklet that takes you step by step through the attachments and also tells you how to use the dryer to obtain certain styles, and for certain hair types.  That was very helpful.  The instructions were very clear and if there is any confusion, the illustrations will take care of that.    One note on attaching and removing the attachments: the booklet warns not to remove without depressing the buttons on the sides.  After I pressed the buttons, I tugged on the attachment gently to make sure it was on securely.  It wasn&#x27;t.  It came off - and my buttons were not depressed!  However, once I continued turning the attachment (with the buttons not depressed) and I heard the &#x27;click&#x27; that the instructions speak of (and which I should have obviously waited for), the gentle tug had no effect.  Very nice.    The cool shot button:  This is supposed to \\&quot;seal in your style\\&quot; when you are done styling each section of hair.  Honestly, I don&#x27;t know whether it makes my style stay one nanosecond longer than it would have if I did not use the \\&quot;cool shot\\&quot; button.  What I do know is that you have to keep the button depressed for the \\&quot;cool shot\\&quot; to work.  I gave the button a quick press two or three times wondering where the &#x27;cool&#x27; was, before it occurred to &#x27;bright bulb&#x27; (me) to keep my finger on the pulse - so to speak.    All that said, the dryer - for me - did what it was supposed to.  My hair is dry, it is not frizzy and the good instructions make this klutz feel that - in time - she could be positively dexterous!</li>
            <li> The Infiniti hair designer pro by conair is a hairdryer/styler combo with a number of interesting attachments. First: my hair is thick and shoulderlength. It has a natural wave, so I was interested in the straightening options.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After reading the manual and setting my hair to the proper setting, I attempted to flatten my hair. The results were flatter than I might have achieved normally, but not so flat that it would replace a flat iron or pomade with comb for the truly straightened appearence. It was sort of an in-between look. I also found the dryer a bit heavy and somewaht awkward to manipulate through my hair.  The pictures in the manual show women with rather long hair.  My hair is shorter than that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For a different persepctive, I asked my mother to sit in and straightened her very fine thin hair. Her hair is longer (slightly below shoulder length) and fine. Her hair was straighter afterward, but wispy. She was positive about the dryer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I would probably only use this dryer for straightening if there weren&#x27;t other easier methods available.</li>
            <li> I have lots of naturally curly hair (not very coarse, but not fine by any stretch).  I bought this blow dryer because I was hoping to cut down on my hair straightening time, but also to get better results than what I was getting.  Admittedly, I&#x27;m not good with a round brush/blow dryer AND I&#x27;m not very patient either.  With my first use, I got better results (than just a regular blow dryer and flat iron) in less time.  Was it a miracle?....no, but noticeably better.  With my second use I was inspired to give it a little more patience (glide drier/comb more slowly through my hair) and I got even better results.  Using this hair dryer leaves my hair more shiny and smooth than anything else I&#x27;ve tried.  Worth the extra dollars.</li>
            <li> Hard to use on my thick hair.  Kept it too long.  Will donate it this year.  Maybe it will work for some one else.</li>
            <li> This was for my wife - &amp;#34;It works for what she needs, but it&#x27;s nothing great.&amp;#34;  Good value in my opinion though, because it&#x27;s held up for several years so far and wasn&#x27;t too expensive</li>
            <li> I chose this item for its size and the fact that it included a diffuser.  Diffusers with full-size hair dryers are VERY cumbersome in size and I specifically wanted a smaller unit with a finger diffuser.  Nearly impossible to find!  This is one of very few units that was compact enough.  I haven&#x27;t tried the straightener - that&#x27;s not why I bought this dryer - although it looks to be well-made also.      It&#x27;s a great, manageable size and easy to use compared to my full-size dryer/diffuser. Seems to be constructed quite well - a tad heavy but not unusually so.  Switches don&#x27;t get in the way of holding and maneuvering the dryer.  Heavy duty cord is nice and long.  Again, everything looks to be well-made.      Quite happy with this - hair dryers are such a personal choice that it&#x27;s hard to buy one online but this purchase worked out well and is pretty much just what I wanted.</li>
            <li> The dryer seemed to be a nice product, but I bought it mostly for the diffuser attachment, which was defective.  It didn&#x27;t fit onto the end of the dryer nozzle.  This was probably a fluke since most people have reviewed this item favorably and not mentioned a problem fitting the attachments.  Still, I&#x27;m skeptical about the hassle of ordering another one and risking it not fitting again...</li>
            <li> I have naturally coarse, frizzy and very curly hair and have been buying Conair hair dryers since I was 16 years old and lived in N.J. I&#x27;m 53 years old and continue to turn to Conair for all of my hair needs.  They make the greatest hair dryers and flat irons because their products are created with the most useful and state of the art features in mind.  This particular product, the Infiniti ProfessionaL Nano Silver Tournaline Ceramic Styler is like nothing else on the market.  Originally, when I bought my first one, it was with alot of skepticism but all I had to do was use it to be devoted. It does so much that I have never gotten around to reading the booklet or to watching the free \\&quot;how to use\\&quot; DVD which (is not mentioned anywhere but) is included. The styling attachment is a miracle.  It cuts the time to dry my hair to about a third of the time and leaves my highly difficult, curly hair smooth, straight and frizz free.  I have since started having keratin hair treatment and it works especially nice in combination with having these treatments, too. There is nothing else like this on the market.  I&#x27;ve had it and have used it religiously everyday for over two years.  I started to think that I should buy another one as a backup (just to be safe as I have had a flat iron damaged in a suitcase while travelling).  When I stared to look for another, I couldn&#x27;t find any sign of it in the stores.  I finally went online to look and it&#x27;s been hard to find.  Eventually, I located it here at Amazon at a much reduced price.  I am a devoted Conair customer for many years and don&#x27;t understand how an amazing, one of a kind, miraculous hair styling tool like this could not have caught on.  I assume this is so because the price is much reduced and the item is to hard to find to begin with. I&#x27;m grateful to Conair for inventing such a \\&quot;one of a kind\\&quot; much needed product and happy that it can be found for such a bargain price on Amazon!</li>
            <li> This Conair hairdryer surprised me!  Let me start at the very beginning so you can understand why...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am an African-American woman with relatively dense natural 3C+4A hair.  When stretched my hair reaches armpit length and is healthy.  My hair is not thick, I just have a lot of it, and thus why I wanted something that could handle my hair AND be gentle enough to use for a blow out.  Reading the reviews for this hair dryer, I was a little worried that it wouldn&#x27;t do anything for my hair since I saw very few reviews from people with natural hair.  However, I decided to order it anyway because I was in desperate need of a new dryer (my last one was from the mid 90s and overheated all the time).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First, let me say that the heat on this dryer gets hot very quickly.  That&#x27;s something I&#x27;m not use to and unnerved me at first because I was trying to avoid frying my hair.  However, the medium setting was perfect for a light blow out.  I sectioned my hair in to 12 parts, washed and conditioned with Queen Helene&#x27;s Royal Curl conditioner and shampoo.  I used Silk Elements Megasilk heat protectant and Roots of Nature Curl Reviving Spray on each section. Ladies with natural hair, detangle before you use the straightening attachment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The manual and the instructional DVD will tell you to put the tension setting on a 4 for African-American textured hair and tight curls (the tightest it can be).  Do not learn the hard way as I did:  4 ripped out my hair.  Luckily, since I started with small sections as soon as I felt that grip, I gently worked my hair out and started again.  This time on a 1.  That&#x27;s right ladies, a 1!  After 3 passes over, I had a beautiful blow out that didn&#x27;t revert as soon as I left the section.  To make it even better, after going over my whole head on medium, I went back over each section on high and got beautiful shine and it looked like I had done a light flat iron.  I may try this again on a 2 to see what happens, but my results were wonderful!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So any women looking for a nice hair dryer to do blow outs, this one is great!  It even got my roots to lay flat and that was something I could never do with my old hair dryer and comb attachment!  Don&#x27;t sleep on this.  It may look scary on the outside, but I was surprised how gentle it was to use.  Also, the cool shot is great for a little bit of fluffing out before doing micro twists.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great purchase!  Thank you Amazon and Conair.</li>
            <li> I have smallish hands, and I don&#x27;t have a problem with the weight of this unit, with or without any of the attachments. It seems to be well made. The cord is extra long and quite helpful.     I have curly wavy hair, and I typically use a hairdryer to blow/scrunch dry my hair in just a few minutes. Using this unit with the diffuser is easier because I can dry my hair with one hand.  Plus- the rubber tips on the diffuser massage my head nicely.  :o)    Prior to receiving this unit, I had never straightened my hair before.    The straightening attachment on this unit is easier to use than I expected, but I might not be taking enough time to use it properly because my hair does not come out stick straight.  More like smooth, with a little wave at the bottom.  No matter - because I think it looks great.    I have no use for the concentrator attachment (typically used for brush drying) so I have not tested it.     Overall, I do like the unit, but I want to mention a few things.     If you use the straightener attachment, be careful because it will get hot.      I could never tell the difference between ceramic and regular ion/non-ion  hairdryers.  They both seems to work the same for me.     Lastly - one time when I was using it it stopped working for a brief moment and I wasn&#x27;t sure why.  Seems you have to be careful with your grip on the handle. My fingers were at the top of the on/off heat buttons and I had inadvertently pushed down (just a small amount) on the on/off/speed button which caused it to turn off. (Think light switch in a middle position.) So far, this only happened once (in 2 weeks) so I can&#x27;t yet say if I feel that it&#x27;s a design flaw.</li>
            <li> i had an older model of this and thought perhaps it had been improved. it was too heavy to use on my long hair. my arms got tired. i&#x27;d just rather use a flat iron. on the upside, my daughter has curly hair and when she wears it curly, she likes the diffuser part of it. it works though, just too clunky.</li>
            <li> I got this a couple of days before visiting my fiance, knowing that we would both get a chance to try it out.  I thought of her initially, for the straightening and overall styling attachments, but also knew that I had long been trying to find an effective hairdryer for myself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First her. She does not always spend a lot of time on her hair, leaving it to air dry for the most part.  It is wonderfully wavy and long, not needing too much attention. But there are times in which attention becomes important.  So I would curious how she would find this.  At first it took a bit of figuring out. The hair dryer certainly is heavier than most and the various attachment need really the right technique in order to get them to be effective.  The first time she used it, she wasn&#x27;t too impressed. But, something happened the second time and within a relatively short amount of time she had fabulous hair. It really straightening nicely without any hassle and was a great way for her to get everything as she wanted without depending on other tools.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For me, I wasn&#x27;t interested as much in the straightening, but wanted something that would allow me to nicely style my, admittedly, thinning hair without making it look over managed.  Using the diffuser and concentrator certainly did the trick, so much better than the simple 2 speed travel hair dryer that I kept trying to use that never really let my hair sit where it looked best.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This isn&#x27;t a cheap hairdryer, to be sure, but it&#x27;s a great one stop item for a man and a woman to share, each able to get just the right style using the various attachments.</li>
            <li> This is a really nice product for someone who wants to invest a little more money rather then getting and replacing cheaper hair dryers over and over again. I always find that the more expensive ionic hair dryers work better then the $30 dollar versions you can find now and this one is really great. The shape is shorter and heavier than I&#x27;m used to but really, no big deal. Most of the time I let my hair air dry but this helped to fluff it up a little and it looked like I did something to it, without being too dramatic and over the top.    The straightening attachment was very interesting, although it took some time to learn how to use and finally dry the hair while pulling though, I all ready have straight hair so this only made is more silky , I got the flat ironed look that makes hair appear very shiny once I learned how to use it. I don&#x27;t use diffusers so I didn&#x27;t get to try that out and those attachments, but overall a very good dryer and I love the cool blast button, it makes the heat more manageable.</li>
            <li> I have long, thick, wavy hair that has always been a challenge to style without taking a ton of products and a ton of time. Several years ago, I purchased the first generation of the Conair Infiniti with the hope that the ceramic plates would ease the frizz factor with a minimum of effort.    The Infiniti was the best blow dryer I had ever had, that dried my hair quickly, with a minimum of damage and a maximum of smoothness. I was very interested to see how the new, improved version would work.    To say I&#x27;m pleased is an understatment!    It&#x27;s true, the newer version of the Infinit is slightly heavier than the old one, but to be honest, if you&#x27;re used to doing just about anything to get your hair to look decent, the minimal weight gain isn&#x27;t much of a deterrent.    The plates on this Infiniti version are better, smoothing out the hair follicle nicely and quicker. There&#x27;s less \\&quot;ouch\\&quot; dragging it through your hair than the previous Infiniti; I chalk that up to the two comb feature.    The diffuser is a nice touch for the days when you don&#x27;t want to go through the hassle of hair straightening. I don&#x27;t use a concentrator myself, so that&#x27;s not an issue for me.    I recommended the previous Conair Infiniti, and I&#x27;m happy to report the new version is an improvement on an already excellent design. I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> This is a great hair dryer!!! I have not used the concentrator atachment so I cant give a review on that part. The fact that the hair dryer is an all in one is great. The difuser works well in putting the curly wave in my hair. I use the straightner the most. I always had to use a flat iron because I could never blow dry my hair straight with a brush and dryer like they do in the salons. This atachment is a perfect solution for uncordinated ladies like myself. It is super easy to straighten your hair and saves on the frying of a straighting iron.</li>
            <li> I ordered this product as a replacement for an older dryer, same model.  Same great product, trusted brand.  Definitely get a great device for low cost!</li>
            <li> I have been really looking out to buy a hair dryer for a while now...The one i have is really not that great..and I was waiting for it to die to buy a new Hair dryer. The moment I saw this on Vine...I jumped to the opportunity...I totally fell in love with this lil gadget....yes its little to begin with for me especially because my older dryers have been much bigger...so maneuvering is much easy with this one...Also for the size it packs quite a punch with the power....Air flow is strong ...and the hot and cold settings are really easy to switch between. My locks are wavy...so I love to use a diffuser...to keep them looking like that...I always had a problem with my earlier dryer to hold the diffuser underneath my hair..since this one is quite compact...there is no struggle...also i like to use the comb that comes with it when i want to keep my hair straighter...ITs combs thru really well...I always comb my hair while drying it...with this one...I dont need to pick up a comb at all...The concentrator is a good addition too...i dont reallly use it that much though...but its good to know i have it in case i want to curl my locks with concentrated warm air...    The 1875 Watts is what makes my whole hair drying much faster i guess...I owned a Phillips Hair dryer around 8 yrs back with similar feartures...I think ..this one is even better..as it has all those features and more ..with double the Power.    My only recommendation for this one wud be...to make it dual voltage....I know its just a dryer...But i carry mine everywhere...and dont always stay in Hotels...especially when i am Visiting family in Europe and Asia.    Nonetheless...I think this is the best of amazon gifts i have this year.    I am totally in love with it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never been terribly adept at styling my own hair. It usually looks good only on the day I go to the salon. The next day, it&#x27;s back to its temperamental self.     This hair dryer, however, has helped me keep my fine somewhat wavy, somewhat curly hair as straight as I want it. Using the easy-to-follow directions, I make a couple of layers of my partially air-dried hair and dry the bottom section first. Even when I grab haphazard glumps of hair, it comes out straight, with a flip at the bottom if I want it. It helps to dry from the top rather than from the scalp out as it keeps down the \\&quot;fly-aways.\\&quot; The cool blast of air after drying helps, too. My hair comes out very shiny.    Sometimes I&#x27;ll go on to use hot rollers to give a little bounce to my hair, but it isn&#x27;t necessary.      Total drying time (after air drying) is 12-14 minutes for my shoulder-length, medium thick hair. This is actually faster than when using a conventional hair dryer with a brush.     I have had a problem with inadvertently turning off the dryer because of the way my fingers wrap around the handle to get to certain areas of my hair.     I&#x27;m not sure how well this would work on shorter hair. It&#x27;s important to grab the ends of the hair and keep them taut as the dryer is pulled through. With shorter hair there may not be enough room to grab hair and work the dryer down the length of the section. It doesn&#x27;t work on bangs if that&#x27;s any indication.     A couple of nice-to-haves are dual voltages for international travel and a retractable cord.     The concentrator is to be used to \\&quot;set\\&quot; the style with cool air. Also included is a diffuser, but the straightener is what has sold me.</li>
            <li> Since my hair has been getting wavier as I get older, I was hoping the straightening attachment on this hairdryer would help to smooth out my hair.  It works fairly well, but I&#x27;m not 100% convinced that it works better than just using a vented hairbrush while blow-drying, although my hair is less frizzy.  I do think that if my hair was longer (mine is chin-length), it would be useful.  I don&#x27;t really have the patience to take the time to use the straightening attachment every day, so it&#x27;s handy to be able to use it as a regular hairdryer, too.    Using it as a regular hairdryer, it is great - it had a lot of power and dries my hair very quickly if I&#x27;m in a rush.    pros:  great as a regular hairdryer, pretty good as a straightener, small enough to fit in small bathroom drawers, lots of power  cons:  attachments are fairly big and clunky to store, straightening took more time than I expected, slightly awkward to use on short to medium length hair (chin length)</li>
            <li> The Infiniti 224 is slightly heavy, and using the attachments takes practice.  It is modern-looking and stylish.  I use the straightening attachment - not to straighten - but to add body.  There is a knack to doing this, as you must insert the lower comb at a particular angle into the base of the hair section.  It adds fullness, but it is easy to overdo and to end up with much more than wanted.  The diffuser performs well, and the soft rubbery tips are kind to the scalp.  I haven&#x27;t tried the concentrator yet,as I haven&#x27;t needed to.  The low heat setting is not very hot, and both settings must be used in order to get the drying job done quickly.  This appliance, as a hairdryer alone, works well.  Whether using the attachments is worth the time and effort involved will depend on one&#x27;s personal needs and preferences.</li>
            <li> We all have different levels of arm strength. It&#x27;s always hard to judge for someone if a given hair dryer is going to seem \\&quot;heavy\\&quot; or \\&quot;light\\&quot; to them. I don&#x27;t bench press weights, but I do basic yoga which involves some positions with hand and arm strength. I did find the Infinity to be relatively heavy to use and maneuver.  Part of this may be that I have hair down to the upper quadrant of my back, which many people would call \\&quot;long\\&quot;. I normally like my hair mid-back or longer (I cut it recently for Locks of Love) so for me this is \\&quot;short\\&quot; :) Be that as it may, with hair at this length it takes a while to dry. It might be that length of time that is wearing down my arm. Someone with a bob cut might be able to dry their hair in a few minutes and not notice the dryer&#x27;s weight at all, even with non-strong arms.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The key promotional point on this dryer is that it straightens hair. My hair is naturally curly when short and wavy when longer. I was really interested to see if this dryer did in fact cause it to go straight. Again, straight is a relative term. I&#x27;m not sure any dryer could get my hair to be pencil-straight. I did find the attachment to get the hair to become *relatively* straight, or at least \\&quot;straighter\\&quot;. However, when I asked my boyfriend if he noticed a difference in my hair, he did not think it was much of a difference at all, vs when I just brush it out straight.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair is relatively thick but I didn&#x27;t have any problems with hair being sucked into vents or tangled in the attachments. I am very careful in general when I use devices like this because, having hair that is sometimes to my mid-back or longer, I have probably hit every problem known to woman that can happen with long hair. I&#x27;m in my late 30s so at this point I&#x27;ve had many years of practice for dealing with that sort of thing. I can imagine that someone not familiar with hair dryers might run into a problem with the power on this device and its intake, but that is a learning process for anyone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When they say hot, they do mean hot. The device is trying to roast your hair into submission. You need to take care with it just as with any other hair roasting device :). I didn&#x27;t run into any exceptional problems here.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In general, it did seem to work relatively quickly, it did get the hair relatively straight and it did so without tangles or other issues. The weight was the only real issue for me. I am always very busy and would not have time to do multi-part, drawn out hair care routines so for times I had to run out the door, did not want to wait for my hair to air-dry and wanted it straight, this does seem like a good solution.ing process for anyone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When they say hot, they do mean hot.

            <li> So my sister comes to visit and when I ask her to help me review the Conair Infiniti, she gives me a weird look and says, \\&quot;Why did you get this?\\&quot; followed by, \\&quot;I don&#x27;t just straighten my hair for anybody, ya know!\\&quot; Pushing me aside for privacy, she proceeded to &#x60;willingly&#x27; straighten her very curly hair - it took about an hour. Here is what we established. She liked the feel of the Infiniti as it was light and felt powerful (even when she dropped in on the floor and it kept running). She only used the &#x60;comb accessory&#x27; but it was strong enough and stayed on the dryer much more firmly than other attachments. (Her other stuff slips off more easily). The process took less time than normal and she didn&#x27;t feel like she needed excessive conditioner as it wasn&#x27;t&#x27; too hot. She did remark that the cord could have been a bit longer. She actually liked the results enough to make her want to keep her very curly hair straighter longer. Then she asked me, \\&quot;So, do I need to come over here every time I want to straighten my hair?\\&quot; I need to ask Amazon Vine about that.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great product, not noisy like others, works very well, not heavy, easy to use.  The accessories are still an addition.</li>
            <li> This dryer absolutely lives up to the hype!!!  I have very thick, wavy, color-treated hair, and this dryer is the product I have been waiting for.  Usually, when I dry my hair without straightening it, I get a frizzy mess.  Not so with the Infiniti 224.  I didn&#x27;t even use the straightening attachment, and my hair was soft and definitely not frizzy!  I&#x27;m so excited!!!  Also, my hair usually takes FOREVER to dry.  Not anymore!!!  Seriously, about 5 minutes into the process and I was done.  I am going to go from someone who put their hair in a ponytail and forgot about it to someone who makes it look nice every day.  The best part--it&#x27;s super-easy.  Two thumbs up!</li>
            <li> This is a great product that could use a couple of minor improvements.    The packaging claims that the Hair Designer Pro will dry, straighten and shine in one step by using the triple action straightening attachment.  It did this and this is one of the best features on the Hair Designer Pro. The rotating head allows this attachment to be turned in a 360-degree angle. This is a great feature as well.    There are two other attachments, a diffuser used to dry hair without blowing out the curls and a concentrator for styling, which are also included and can be used after the straightening attachment. These worked fine.    The hairdryer also includes three heat settings and two speed settings and a cool shot button all of which are easy to use and placed in a good location on the handle.    The straightening attachment with the rotating head is a great idea and  is the best thing about this product.    My only concern was that the Hair Designer Pro is a bit bulky. After a few uses is noticeable but may be an issue for others. My guess is that in order to fully use the attachments it needed to be the size that it is. Also, the packaging makes it a bit awkward to put everything back in it after you use the Hair Designer Pro and close up the box. My guess is people will eventually find a better place to store it.     The instruction booklet, which is written in both Spanish and English, contains some very helpfully information on how to fully use this product. It also has helpful pictures. It is easy to use as well. It is important to read it to get the full use of this product.     The problem is that the booklet is roughly three by six inches. It is a small size booklet with type that seems smaller than average. An instruction booklet that is larger and that has bigger type would be much easier to use.  Also, the booklet could easily be misplaced because of its size.     Overall this is a great product and recommended.</li>
            <li> Love this item. Very easy to use and does a good job drying and straightening hair. I would recommend this item to others. It has 3 different attachments. i have only used the comb attachment for straightening hair.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a bit heavy, but it works very well. I have long bushy hair bit this drier does its job in only about 10 minutes. I&#x27;ve had it for more than 3 years now.</li>
            <li> When I first saw this dryer, I was pretty skeptical of the straightening attachment. And when I first received it, it seemed rather overwhelming, with all of the pieces and a good-sized manual. But I&#x27;m really quite impressed with it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The dryer itself is fairly compact, though the pieces (especially the diffuser) take up a lot of room in my cabinet. It also seems fairly powerful (I really like the two speeds and three temps, too).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair is very thick and very fragile with sort of a messy, haphazard wave. I wasn&#x27;t sure the straightening attachment would work for me -- even many regular straightening irons don&#x27;t work well on my hair. But to my surprise, my hair looked, well, pretty darn good afterward! (I did touch up the ends with my straightening iron, because I&#x27;m in dire need of a trim and they still looked a bit fuzzy.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did not find the attachment very difficult to use, though the back of my head was hard to get -- it seemed like no matter which angle I put the attachment at, it was just hard to get my hair to go through it properly. However, it was definitely more time-consuming than a regular blow-dry, and possibly more time-consuming than both blow-drying and using a straightening iron.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m also a little concerned about the effect that using that amount of tension might have on my hair after awhile. My hair breaks very, very easily, and I&#x27;m wondering if using the straightening attachment might worsen that. Of course, using an iron on it probably doesn&#x27;t help, either, so I&#x27;m guessing it&#x27;s six of one, half a dozen of the other.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, your degree of affection for the Infiniti will probably boil down to what you&#x27;d rather spend time doing -- blow-drying or straightening. I think the Infiniti would probably be ideal for a woman with thinner hair who can blow-dry it fairly quickly and doesn&#x27;t want to deal with an iron.</li>
            <li> What an amazing little dryer! I have to admit that my hair is already straight. I don&#x27;t need a straightener, but the diffuser and concentrator are good tools to style my hair, and I like that the dryer doesn&#x27;t get too hot - this has been a problem in the past, and my thin hair doesn&#x27;t respond well to overheating. The Cool Blast button is a plus, and I always appreciate a dryer with that function. This one works great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The best part? This drys my hair in less time than I&#x27;m accustomed to, and I like anything that cuts down the time on my morning routine. The only drawback is that this dryer is a bit on the heavy side, but luckily it doesn&#x27;t take too long to dry my hair, so this hasn&#x27;t been a huge drawback for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This dryer may seem pricey, but the attachments and the quality really make up for it. I have found that I go through several of the \\&quot;cheap\\&quot; dryers, and having one of higher quality is probably going to save me money in the long run.</li>
            <li> My first impressions of this hairdryer are excellent.  The unit is nicely compact and feels very solid.  It felt a little heavy at first (1 pound without attachments) but the weight is concentrated in the handle and it is easy to maneuver.  The handle is comfortable and the balance is excellent.  The attachments are held in with latches, which I appreciate as I hate dealing with attachments falling into the sink or getting stuck in my hair. The back intake has a fine screen covering, so I don&#x27;t have to worry about my long hair getting sucked in (again).      The straightening attachment is unique and very sturdy.  It is adjustable for different hair types.  I am only using the diffuser as my current hair style doesn&#x27;t require straightening. I also had a friend try it and she said that she doesn&#x27;t like it as well as her Bed Head dryer.  She said it makes her hair nice and curly when using the diffuser, but doesn&#x27;t think it is anything special.      My husband doesn&#x27;t like this as well as his old 1875 watt dryer as he said the air flow is not as strong or as hot, even at the highest settings.      I wish I could reduce this to 3 1/2 stars.  It seems to be a fine dryer, but just average.</li>
            <li> I should start by saying that I have very unusual hair. I am a natural Red-Head, my hair is very thick, mostly coarse as well, and naturally curly (can be just slightly wavy to curly to spiral/corkscrew curls).  It also tends to be frizzy, and each individual hair likes to separate from the others if I run my hands through it or the wind gets to it at all...    Basically, I stopped using Hairdryers to blowdry my hair when I was about 12, as it would end up as a big huge afro-like thing.  Diffusers never helped, it was easier to Air Dry my hair (and usually pulled back into a ponytail to help keep the top of my hair as flat as possible *before* any styling done to it.    Over the past few years I have experimented more with Flat Iron Straighteners, and I have 2 of these products, a regular Conair flat-iron, and the more expensive (seen on TV and HSN) MaxiGlide product (with small portable traveller iron).  That second one has a \\&quot;mist spray\\&quot; to help hydrate and straighten your hair easier (like a normal household iron).    Both of these products are much different than the straightening feature on this Conair Infiniti Styler.  I do not know if it is my hair-type, the weather conditions when I use it, or what, but I constantly get different results with use.    Sometimes I get results that are ok, but mainly just take some of the curl out of my locks, sometimes I have gotten my hair fairly straight and it lasts a while, and other times it just does not work at all.  Again, I can&#x27;t say the weather does not influence my results (if it is hot and humid, or one day has less wind than another), and as I have not blown dry my hair for almost 20 years, I can&#x27;t comment a whole lot on that aspect, other than my hair does not seem to get as bad as I remember it to get, but it has been 18 years...    I can say that the other attachment, that lets you \\&quot;mess up\\&quot; your hair while drying to make it curlier, does a good job on my hair, though my hair can do this mostly on its own, so again, I am left with questionable results.    As of this point, I can only give this product a 3 out of 5 stars, as not only did it not impress me as much as I thought it might, but with such strange and wide variety of results, I cannot claim that it will give consistent results to anyone (all of the time).    I also cannot state that this product does not work very well, as there were just too many variables to throw of the results.  In the future I will continue to test out this product, and will hopefully do so in more of a \\&quot;test study\\&quot; manor, with keeping track of all variables that might affect the results and doing several tests with the *same* variables in place, to try and see if there were specific causes to my not getting consistent good results.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love the volumizer attachment (I think people refer to it as a diffuser).  I am not a hair person or know all the terminology related to hair care products and what not, but I had a blow dryer with the \\&quot;diffuser\\&quot; attachment that I used as a straightener/volumizer, and about died when my friend&#x27;s dog chewed the rubber fingers off.  My hair is super thin and very FLAT, and when I use this attachment, it takes the frizz away, making it look smooth, and it actually creates a little more volume to the top of my head.  It also feels great against the scalp, like I&#x27;m getting a massage!  I have not used any of the other pieces as I do not need them.  The diffuser with the rubber fingers is extremely hard to find, so imagine the excitement when I only had to go a couple of months of looking blah to feeling more pretty when I found this blow dryer on Amazon!  I even went to the manufacturer&#x27;s website trying to find the model I had, but it was so old (had it for nearly 20 years!), and I was afraid they stopped making the rubber ones.  The other diffusers are plastic and hard and hurt my head (I bought several blow dryers during those two months, trying to find a replacement).  So, thank you, thank you, and thank you for having this product available!  I thought I was never going to look and feel the same about myself.  Yes, over a blow dryer, but you know how it is using one thing for soooo long, and nothing else seems to work/feel the same way, and you think things will never be the same again!?  My only complaint is that it does not get as hot as my last one, I mean it gets pretty warm, just not as hot, so it takes a little longer to dry, but again, that could be a good thing so I don&#x27;t overheat my hair and cause more damage.  I will say, I am in love with these kinds of diffusers, so again, thank you!</li>
            <li> Great diffuser! I had never used one before and it is just amazing what a little gadget can do. My curls never looked better!</li>
            <li> This works great and it is awesome for straightening my hair I love this product it is awesome.  Would buy again.</li>
            <li> This product is excellent.  It comes with multiple speeds, has a hot, warm, and cool setting, and comes with 3 attachments including a diffuser and a straightener.  The straightener eliminates frizz on the spot.  I highly recommend this hairdryer</li>
            <li> I live this hair dryer.  It&#x27;s rare to find this in stores.</li>
            <li> They are right, it is a little heavy but everyone knows how hard it is to find a small hairdrier with a disfuser.  This is perfect and lives in my gym bag making occasional visits to my suitcase.  Recommended.</li>
            <li> This does not blow dry hair very well at all. I have soft hair and the grippers on this machine caught and tangled my hair, not to mention it pulled some of it out. I would not recommend this product. I returned it for refund.</li>
            <li> I have very big, thick curly/wavy hair and in warm weather I usually let it curl and air dry.  Colder weather is problematic because air drying takes forever and makes me cold. This dryer solves this problem better than any other dryer I have tried.  My hair is too short for the straightener but that looks like it would work great, too. I use the concentrator around the edges to get some shape and the diffuser to control the volume.</li>
            <li> The Infiniti 1875 Watt Professional Hair dryer is a very quick and effective way to dry your hair. While there is areas for improvement my wife and I really enjoy that our hair dries abut 25% than with a standard hair dryer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other positive features-&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  The included attachments work well&lt;br /&gt;  - The Straightener attachment works well but it does take some getting use to when you are used to a flat iron.&lt;br /&gt;  - The Diffuser attachment is mainly for people with curly hair than my wife&#x27;s - so while it could be useful for many my wife has limited use.&lt;br /&gt;  - The Sure-shot attachment is good to use with a roller brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Areas for improvement (the reason for 4 stars)&lt;br /&gt;  - The cord tangles easily&lt;br /&gt;  - The hair dryer does not have any anti-slip surface, and easily slide off a countertop.&lt;br /&gt;  - While it is a great hair dryer it is a bit on the expensive side.&lt;br /&gt;  - Ideally, it would have the ability to fold which would make it easier to fit into your suitcase.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Final verdict - while there are some small areas for improvement - I would still rate the Infiniti Professional Hair Dryer 4 full stars. A recommended buy.</li>
            <li> Most people are buying this hairdryer for the straightening attachment so I will review this part of the blow dryer first.  My hair is thick, past my shoulders and wavy to curly but NOT super tight ringlets.  I typically blow dry my hair straight with a hairdryer and a brush and straighten with a hair iron (currently a Solia branded iron).  I was excited about an attachment that could decrease the ironing time.  I did not have super high expectations for the attachment and did not expect it to be able to completely straighten my hair as well as my pricey flat iron so I figured I would still use a combination but it would be quicker to iron after using the dryer&#x27;s straightening attachment.      I tried the straightening attachment five times (even read the booklet on how to use the dryer) and my results were not that great.  With the straightening attachment my hair was broken and ripped out no matter what tension setting I put the attachment on.  By the time I was done with the attachment there was hair EVERYWHERE on my clothing and on the bathroom floor.  I started noticing short flyaways on top of my head that had not previously been there.  Unfortunately it will take a few months for the hair to regrow to a length where it won&#x27;t be sticking straight up on the top of my head.  In addition, the attachment did not straighten any better than using a brush and hair dryer.  I am very disappointed because I really liked the concept of having one extra hand to help with styling instead of doing the brush/hairdryer combo.    As for the dryer, the nose is extremely short and it almost looks like a travel dryer.  Initially I was excited about this until I used it for the first time and my hair was sucked into the back of the dryer at least three times every time I blow dried.  I would have to shut the dryer off and pull my hair out which resulted in painful hair pulling and breakage.  However, I currently use a long-nosed twenty dollar [[ASIN:B000FS05VG Revlon RV544 1875 Watt Tourmaline Ionic Lightweight Dryer, Silver/Black]]which is a 1875 watt, same as the Infiti, which I have loved for two years.  (I purchased the Revlon dryer after discovering it was put to a scientific controlled test by Good Housekeeping against the several hundred dollar T3 professional dryer and the Revlon performed the same to better depending on the category).  However, I found the Infiniti to smooth my hair a bit better compared to the Revlon dryer.  It isn&#x27;t a huge difference but is noticeably different.    My advice, if you have short hair and skip the straightening attachment, this is a great dryer that is comparable to the expensive professional dryers I often use (my cousin is a hair dresser and I always borrow her stuff).  However, if you have long hair beware of the short nose that causes hair to be sucked through the back intake.  Also, do not expect the straightening attachment to give you the results a hair iron does.  With the attachment expect much breakage and the same results as a brush and dryer.  I&#x27;d say if you have never used a high wattage hair dryer (like many of the people who are reviewing this product) I would skip this hair dryer and get the Revlon because it is much cheaper, works very well, has a longer nose, and you don&#x27;t get an attachment that does nothing but drive the price up.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for a dual voltage hairdryer that is both small for travel but also had a diffuser.  It has taken me forever to find the perfect dryer.  It was wonderful how the description and picture included the style of diffuser.  I quickly got exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li> I bought this as a christmas present for my wife and she absolutly loves it. Best thing Thats ever been made.</li>
            <li> You question &amp;#34;faster drying time&amp;#34; when you read descriptions by the brand name folks.  This one really does what it says, though.  Seems to dry my hair faster.  Funny little shape that I like.  Shorter barrel.  Nice curved handle to hold.  I have large hands, so the handle diameter doesn&#x27;t bother me.  A little heavy, but not too.  I do have to remember which end is which when I dry my hair, though.  Seems like the blowing end should be the intake end by the way it&#x27;s shaped.  Like I said, it&#x27;s a funny little shaped thing!</li>
            <li> Purchased this item from Amazon for $69.99. Arrived quickly, with a Bed, Bath and Beyond price sticker for $34.99!!! Shame on me for not checking prices, but it discouraging that this type of activity takes place with a company as reputable as this. Well be returning immediately for a full refund. Boo!</li>
            <li> I was very excited to get this product because I use a flat iron on my hair everyday and I am destroying my hair with it. So I wanted to eliminate the flat iron by using this product and it isn&#x27;t up to my expectations.  As I run the straightening attachment through my hair, it gets caught up at the very end and literally rips my hair out or rips my hair ends to shreads! I am not sure if over time, it will loosen up a bit on the ends, but I am too afraid to find out! I am so disappointed:( because I  was really depending on this!</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t need all of the attachments but I do use the diffuser and it works well. My short hair dries quickly.</li>
            <li> I love this product!  I have a lot of hair and it takes me a long time to style it. With this hair dryer and the tools to style the hair, I am able to get ready fast and my hair looks shinny and looks great!</li>
            <li> FYI: White, Natural, Curly whirly wavy hair.&lt;br /&gt;Time owned: 1 year&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Review:  Not bad, not bad at all.  I have had dozens of blow dryers over the years and this has been one of my favourites.  It is small enough if I need to take it on holiday, but dries my thick, very wavy hair quickly.  The diffuser CLIPS on (thank God, all these attachments clip on. There is no sliding.) and has nice soft rubbery fingers.  3 speeds/3 heat settings...no obvious hair damage.  The concentrator works like it should.  The straightening attachment is pretty cool, but your hair will need to be shoulder length or longer for it to be very effective.  It works in a similar way to a ceramic paddle brush, which makes it generally better for my hair.  No intense heat and a brush/dryer in one. I progress through the grip settings and my hair is relatively straight for days.  Not flat iron, poker straight, but normal hair with body.  There have read a couple of comments saying the straightener pulls out hair, but I haven&#x27;t found this to be the case.  I don&#x27;t tend to brush my hair, so the amount of hair trapped in the straightener was similar to what I would have found in my brush after blow drying.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**update** I bought another one for our vacation home! Still enjoying it.  Also, guests that have stayed at my house and borrowed it have bought two.</li>
            <li> This item was listed as new, yet when it arrived, I noticed the box had been obviously re-taped.  I do not appreciate that!</li>
            <li> STILL USING THIS PRODUCT.  THRILLED WITH THIS PRODUCT. SHIPPER WAS FAST AND EFFICIENT.  NO COMPLAINTS AT ALL. SATISFIED. WOULD USE AGAIN</li>
            <li> As a man-sumer with very little in the way of knowledge on blow-dryers and which brands to shop for, my experience with finding this particular model was a difficult one. I pored through hundreds of pages, reviews, and video demonstrations of various blow-dryers, but in the end the feature set I sought after wasn&#x27;t extremely complex. This particular dryer piqued my curiosity based both on the solid construction and the overwhelmingly positive reviews. So, I&#x27;d like to add to that opinion with my own experiences.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PROS:&lt;br /&gt;1. Very lightweight. My arms actually get tired from doing the straightening motions, the weight of the dryer has no effect really. I can straighten for longer periods of time with no fatigue, so it&#x27;s great for doing things quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. Reliable, consistent heat. Coupled with the straightening attachment, I can confirm like other reviewers that this thing has the power and distribution to reach the roots near the scalp.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3. Variety of attachments. Honestly, I&#x27;m kind of ambivalent towards cosmetic attachments usually, but I&#x27;ve found a usage for each of the three included in the set. The concentrator for getting the frizz out of my ends, the straightener for great overall coverage and uniform smooth/shine, and the diffuser for...well, diffusing. I don&#x27;t use the diffuser quite as often as the others though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. Doesn&#x27;t come with a carry/keepcase. I know, this isn&#x27;t a huge issue, and I&#x27;m not even taking a star off for it. I just figure since the thing is so small compared to most blow-dryers, it wouldn&#x27;t be hard to fabricate a hard-plastic storage/keepcase for it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. Confusing buttons? I know, it&#x27;s not confusing once you read the user manual, and it&#x27;s really difficult to explain why I consider them difficult to use without making myself sound like too much of a simpleton. Long story short, I&#x27;m actually used to more discrete buttons (as I&#x27;m a geek), and instead, with this thing, thereare just two tabs that slide up and down to adjust. From what I&#x27;ve figured out, it appears that whatever word they uncover when you move them, that is the function it controls. You&#x27;ll see...if you buy it. Again, not a star reduction, just a personal gripe.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3. Can&#x27;t melt steel. I just can&#x27;t believe in an age where we live in constant need of more steel, that this thing isn&#x27;t capable of melting steel. For that, I deduct a quarter-point.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, for the weekend warrior or occasional blow-dryer consumer, this is a great value and a great buy. Reliable, solid performance for a low-cost, easily replaceable unit.</li>
            <li> Love, love, love this!  It dries &amp; straightens my hair great!  Before I bought this,  I already previously owned one &amp; only wanted to fine this same one again to buy because I&#x27;ve never had a hair dryer as good as this one to dry &amp; straighten hair at same time</li>
            <li> Hot hot hot! Cool cool cool. Works great on my rediculously full head of hair. The accessories are nice although I rarely use them.</li>
            <li> I have wavey hair, and thought I could use this to help straighten my hair. Not so. I tried it and found it catch my hair and pulled out single strands at a time - ouch. I watched the video CD first. It is recommmended you use small sections, and I did... it wasn&#x27;t for me, but the store allowed me to return it. It may work for you. Think of the automatic roller brush (as seen on TV), it works for some people, and they like it.</li>
            <li> Very powerful for such a small hair dryer. When I took it on vacation it worked wonderfully.</li>
            <li> This hair dryer blows! well, in the sense that it stinks. It is the wimpiest hair dryer I have ever used. My hair was so frizzy and the straightening attachment snagged the ends of my hair. I returned it after one disappointing use. I would NOT recommend unless you have fine thin straight hair. Also, it is a fairly heavy little thing. I am going back to premium hair dryers... sorry I thought I could use an economical dryer.</li>
            <li> we are sisters but have different hair textures, I have fine wavy medium length and she has very long, very thick, very curly hair.  This dryer works for both of us.  The straightening attachment is the main attraction here, it is adjustable for different textures and it dries your hair very straight and very smooth.  And very fast!</li>
            <li> Bought this for the wife and she likes it.  She has a higher end unit but like using this one.</li>
            <li> This is the best hair drier I&#x27;ve ever owed. Helps makes my hair so smooth that I often don&#x27;t need a flat iron.</li>
            <li> The power switch is in an awful place, right where your hand holds the dryer.When I am using the dryer,I keep turning it off with my tumb. The switch is too big (about 2 inches long) and moves too freely.&lt;br /&gt;VERY ANNOYING! I feel like super gluing the switch in the on position.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Although, I do like the new larger section for air flow between the 2 comb straighteners. It drys your hair faster,that is if you can keep it on.</li>
            <li> I used it a few times- they are way to big and not very user friendly.  It&#x27;s difficult to get the angles right, and it&#x27;s quite heavy.  I have very straight hair and I thought it would be great for a smooth blowout.  It&#x27;s not doing much effect but requires a lot of work.</li>
            <li> This was a request from my wife, upt to the date I have no comments or complaints about it, so seems to be working porpoerly. Any doubt if there&#x27;s one I will have trouble ...</li>
            <li> The reviews are right!  No matter what I did the straightner attachment ripped hair out of my head.  I followed the directions to the letter and went from 1 to 4 and every setting ripped hair out of my head.  This blow dryer is large and heavy for a travel size.  I changed attachments to blow dry my hair with the nozzle and was completely disappointed.  It took so long to dry my hair; individual sections that I grabbed my regular blow dryer.  This blow dryer lacks power and was a waste of money and time.</li>
            <li> I initially had the fucsia model but decided to buy this one because it was supposed to be an upgrade with the ceramic and the double straightener attachment. For a while, it did work a lot faster in getting my hair straight. About 1 year later it started to make weird noises and after a couple of weeks it stopped working altogether. I noticed it was on sale on Amazon so I decided to buy it again. Yet here I am, about 1 year later facing the same issue. The dryer started making the same noises, like a hedge trimmer motor, about 4 weeks ago. Today it started to sound as if one piece inside the dryer had detached itself and the motor was grinding it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I decided I will buy the fucsia model again, considering it lasted me 3 years and my sister still has it. This model it&#x27;s not worth the money!</li>
            <li> bulky&lt;br /&gt;stiff&lt;br /&gt;hard to handle&lt;br /&gt;too small for attachments&lt;br /&gt;disappointed&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;lost receipt reason I did not return back to company.</li>
            <li> I have very curly hair that I like to wear both straight and curly.  I love this dryer because it helps me with both styles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The straightening attachment is great.  It straightens my hair much easier than using a round brush.  One I get done drying with this, using a straightener is a breeze.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The attachments stay on very well and this dryer lasts for years.  I bought a second one for my gym bag because I can&#x27;t use another dryer now that I am spoiled with this one.</li>
