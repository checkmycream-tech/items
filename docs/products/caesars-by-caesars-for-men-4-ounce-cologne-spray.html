            <li> great scent and long lasting, will buy again!</li>
            <li> Great manly aroma. Packaged well and delivered in good time. Excellent quality for the purchase price.</li>
            <li> The Caesars Man was a gift for my husband. It is a very nice smell and it came very quickly in package well.</li>
            <li> Bought this many years ago when in Vegas at Caesars.  Loved it, and paid around $50 for it at the time.  I like this for two reasons, 1) I like the scent and 2) it lasts on me (Not many colognes do)  The price is right, also.</li>
            <li> I have worn Caesar&#x27;s Man for some 25 years. It is a distinctive scent without being over powering. A clean and unique cologne.</li>
            <li> I came across this amazing after shave when it was only available at Caesar&#x27;s Palace in Reno and Las Vegas.  My wife and I would take a week-end off and drive from Sacramento to Reno for her to play the slots and for me to buy another bottle of Caesar&#x27;s Man.  She usually lost a little money while I gained more respect for my face after shaving.</li>
            <li> Nice cologne, last longer. The interesting part is that unlike other colognes that are expensive , it&#x27;s cheaper and affordable.</li>
            <li> This is a Great product. It&#x27;s not expensive and the scent last long. Highly recommend it for any man!! It&#x27;s worth every penny!!</li>
            <li> I came across this at the hottest Sunday night hotspot in Miami Beach and this cologne rocks!!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Reasonably priced and scent moderately strong and last longer just like Versace Dreamer. Alpha males ,you need this in your arsenal!! HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.</li>
            <li> Very good price for this favorite  cologne.</li>
            <li> Been using Caesars Cologne for a few years now.........it is a GREAT product for a GREAT price!! I highly recommend it for any age group.</li>
            <li> a classic , at a classic price</li>
            <li> Use it all the time but it is cheaper if you have a Burlington Coat store close by.</li>
            <li> Guys, this stuff works extremely well.  Women love it.  My wife and I save it for those special occasions when she uses Caesars for Women and I use the kind for men.  Found it to be a terrific turn-on.  When you get a hint of its aroma in the air, you know it is going to be an &amp;#34;active&amp;#34; evening.</li>
            <li> Think Vintage Drakkar Noir, which is much better than the more recent formulation.  This is good stuff</li>
            <li> My husband gets complements  everywhere  we go! !! He loves it!!!!!</li>
            <li> My husband likes this cologne and it was a great bargain compared to where we bought before.</li>
