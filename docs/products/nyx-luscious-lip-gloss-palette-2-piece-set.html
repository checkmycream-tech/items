            <li>I bought these as a gift the colors seemed nice and vibrant,but I wouldn&#x27;t know how pigmented they are since I didn&#x27;t use them on myself.</li>
            <li>I love that they have a very pleasant and barely noticeable scent.</li>
            <li>Wish there were more colors!&lt;br /&gt;Debb</li>
            <li>and I love it.</li>
            <li>but, it was more like sparkly lipstick than lip gloss.</li>
            <li>and I feel they look better on me.  </li>
            <li>I love NYX products.  </li>
            <li>:)</li>
            <li>The colors are intense but when applied, blend very nicely.  </li>
            <li>These are pretty good lip gloss.  </li>
            <li>The red&#x27;s and oranges are nice and bright.  </li>
            <li>how this works just fine for me.</li>
            <li>The red palette is great for evening or dressing.  </li>
            <li>( I am far too fair )</li>
            <li>The colors aren&#x27;t as vivid as I would like but they are pretty good.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Quality is super for the price.</li>
            <li>The shipment arrived quickly and was well packaged.</li>
            <li>the colors are kind of sheer, I don&#x27;t know..</li>
            <li>Worth every penny</li>
            <li>Very Nice Gloss palette, especially the red one!&lt;br /&gt;Colors blend with your natural lip color so reds look really nice without being too flashy!&lt;br /&gt;Holds</li>
            <li>I bought both palettes, the pink is good if you want a natural look, the colors are light.  </li>
            <li>Love it , just use different lipgloss brush</li>
            <li>Pretty colors.  </li>
            <li>You are basically getting ten different colors for  8 bucks so its pretty good quality for the price.</li>
            <li>I saw this product at Nordstroms and loved it so much I had to track down another online!</li>
            <li>I would not recommend this, it&#x27;s clumps up and doesn&#x27;t have much color to it</li>
            <li>For the small price, they are more than adequate.</li>
            <li>They are highly pigmented.  </li>
            <li>The neutral pallet is a little sheer on my lips but the red one is gorgeous</li>
            <li>and I really like the different tones of red.</li>
            <li>Pretty colors came fast packaging wasn&#x27;t broken</li>

            <li> For the small price, they are more than adequate. I just got used to longer lasting lip color.&lt;br /&gt;They&#x27;re great to throw in your purse, though, and I really like the different tones of red.</li>

            <li> Good quality, wonderful aroma.&lt;br /&gt;Will buy again for my friends.</li>
            <li> I would not recommend this, it&#x27;s clumps up and doesn&#x27;t have much color to it</li>
            <li> moderately pigmented. I love that they have a very pleasant and barely noticeable scent.</li>
            <li> the colors are kind of sheer, I don&#x27;t know.. It&#x27;s not what I was looking for</li>
            <li> The neutral pallet is a little sheer on my lips but the red one is gorgeous and I love it. You are basically getting ten different colors for  8 bucks so its pretty good quality for the price. Also, they smell really nice!</li>

            <li> it was very good and shiny ,,I love it .</li>
            <li> Very good colors and wonderful price! I will definitely recommend it</li>
            <li> Love it , just use different lipgloss brush</li>
            <li> Love it!!!!! 1 for me and one for my mommy!</li>
            <li> This was a great lip color but, it was more like sparkly lipstick than lip gloss.</li>
            <li> This is great, will take some getting used to, how ever any how this works just fine for me. Delivered quickly, great product, great seller, recommended.</li>
            <li> Good variety.  Pretty colors.  Convenient.</li>
            <li> The reds are excellent. The other palette, I never used. Worth every penny</li>
            <li> These are pretty good lip gloss.  I prefer the red colors as I am African American and I feel they look better on me.  They are highly pigmented.  My only real complaint is the case is a little hard to open.  I usually just close it without snapping it shut so that I don&#x27;t have to fiddle with it.  I would definitely order the red palette again.  The shipment arrived quickly and was well packaged.</li>
            <li> I bought both palettes, the pink is good if you want a natural look, the colors are light.  The red palette is great for evening or dressing.  The red&#x27;s and oranges are nice and bright.  The colors are a bit deeper than a regular gloss.  I also bought for my sisters, during Christmas, and they luv as well.</li>
            <li> Very nice!  The colors are intense but when applied, blend very nicely.  I won&#x27;t use the reds  ( I am far too fair ) but I can give as a gift!  I love NYX products.  :)</li>
