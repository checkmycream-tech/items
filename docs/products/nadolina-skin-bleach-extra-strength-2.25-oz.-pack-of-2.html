            <li>I love it!</li>
            <li>so u have to experiment with all this kind of stuff.</li>
            <li>When I use it on my face my face has a nice even tone and glows.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had to learn all this info on my own</li>
            <li>but I love that it leaves my skin smooth and my makeup goes on real nice.</li>
            <li>It is by far the best lightening cream on the market</li>

            <li>ok w/e</li>
            <li>i got this at rite aide and it&#x27;s better than the ones id get at the beauty supply store</li>
            <li>So you are still getting sun exposure on the top layers of the spots you are trying to rid yourself of.&lt;br /&gt;Most</li>
            <li>Also, it DOES NOT MIX WITH MANY ACNE PRODUCT INGREDIENTS.</li>
            <li>But, this has done the best job for me after trying several products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It was even banned in Europe at a point because the product isn&#x27;t safe.</li>
            <li>Ok here&#x27;s the deal.</li>
            <li>Be sure to wear sunscreen</li>
            <li>They faded away to the point where my BB cream covered everything nicely, evenly and smooth:))</li>
            <li>I love this stuff.</li>
            <li>this one deffinetly needs more time.</li>
            <li>Best Bleaching cream I have ever used results seen in only two weeks.</li>
            <li>I am so pleased that they&#x27;ve begun to fade.</li>
            <li>Great product, works very well.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>BUT this product causes me MORE acne</li>
            <li>so you dont have to walk around with tons of bumps on your body like I have to :)</li>
            <li>With more time, I hope it becomes even lighter.  </li>
            <li>This product does a good job at a much lower cost.  </li>
            <li>if im allergic to the ingredients or if its because its too strong.</li>
            <li>Very happy; there is a noticeable difference in the dark spots on my face.</li>
            <li>There is a light smell for me is very mild</li>
            <li>Piona worked better for me with quick results within days.</li>
            <li>This is the best thing to remove dark spots!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a huge ripoff.</li>
            <li>Use a q-tip or a lip liner brush to apply precisely.</li>
            <li>(packaged in an air and light stable bottle (read:pump, opaque bottle...</li>
            <li>So far so good.</li>
            <li>So far; so good.</li>
            <li>Some people who think their patches aren&#x27;t fading is because they are accidentally lightening the skin around it and therefore can&#x27;t see any significant contrast between fading brown spots and fading surrounding skin.&lt;br</li>
            <li>ps this product can be harmful if you do not know how to use it, so be aware of the product and its ingredients , if you wear this cream often be sure to wear sunscreen when you are out in the sun.</li>
            <li>It is a cream with a mild pleasant odor, use it with caution for your skin especially at night, protect yourself from the sun and follow the instructions.</li>
            <li>The rest of my body however has no bad reaction to it.</li>
            <li>This cream is pretty strong (3% Hydroquinone) and you caan see results within 2 to 3 weeks of continuous use.</li>
            <li>She says it works great for dark spots</li>
            <li>and once I started using it correctly with the right sunscreen.... lo and behold...</li>
            <li>Its soooo good for the dark spots</li>
            <li>Works fast, Gets rid of spots quickly</li>
            <li>Fades my (post menopause) age splotches (much bigger than &amp;#34;spots&amp;#34;) better than any non-prescription product I&#x27;ve tried (and I&#x27;ve tried plenty).</li>
            <li>You have to be consistent</li>
            <li>I have used Nadinola Extra Strength for many years for areas of hyperpigmentation.</li>
            <li>It has great short term effects but long term</li>
            <li>I used Nadinola for the first time in 2010.</li>
            <li>but I was willing to do anything to not show my acne spots  </li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t been able to wear short sleeves/</li>
            <li>I have to say I did the test the first day on my elbows like it says.</li>
            <li>I saw a difference the first week using Nadolina Skin Bleach</li>
            <li>It really works!  </li>
            <li>I am not as consistent in using this cream as id like to be.</li>
            <li>But I also bought much better quality razors for shaving, so the skin would not get damaged.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Took 3 months to remove all the darkness from the neck, but I used it only once a day after showering.</li>
            <li>Pretty sure you&#x27;ll see faster results if you were to use it twice daily.</li>
            <li>I had to come back and add a bit more info.</li>
            <li>It fades marks, acne scars and other hyperpigmentation marks effectively.</li>
            <li>Its good to actually test it because I just noticed I have tons of tiny bumps all over the areas I used this product.</li>
            <li>its really good for dark marks and hyperpigmetation from old cars and acne.</li>
            <li>Much easier and practical.</li>
            <li>I really like this product, have been using it for about a year.  </li>
            <li>so it works really well on the eyes.</li>
            <li>once on weekdays at night I really dont go out with this cream even with sunscreen</li>
            <li>this product really works.</li>
            <li>i am very dark-skinned and he seen improvement in those areas that are darker than the rest of my body.</li>
            <li>It works amazingly fast</li>
            <li>I have to admit it really works...</li>
            <li>I love this have been using it for years...stopped working as I aged bit teamed up with my Jojoba Oil</li>
            <li>This stuff really works.</li>
            <li>Really lightens skin</li>
            <li>Again the product works very well</li>
            <li>It is the real stuff.</li>
            <li>Works very well to dimish scar discoloration.</li>
            <li>Finally something that really works !!!</li>
            <li>: apply this cream on to your clean face twice a day - but only apply it to the areas of your hyper pigmentation!</li>
            <li>your gonna find over the counter, and the only true skin bleaching agent.</li>
            <li>decided to go ahead and start using it again to see if it&#x27;ll work on my older spots.</li>
            <li>but the main problem was that it irritated the skin around my eyes.</li>
            <li>and then pat on a little bb cream or very light foundation where needed.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>lol ill just stick to buying it from the store</li>
            <li>(Significant fading and not very noticeable hyper pigmentation</li>
            <li>When I was 9 I came to new york</li>
            <li>Very fast shipping and works well on discoloration if you use it daily.</li>
            <li>I used this cream consistently (twice a day) and around the last week of March</li>
            <li>Most of the time people dont bother to do this, I usually skip doing this also.</li>
            <li>I have used this cream for more than 2wks now and am yet to see my black knuckles fade away,I was highly expecting a quicker effect because it says extra strength.</li>
            <li>available for just HALF this price over at Walmart.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I use clear zinc, then I choose mineral makeup with zinc for added protection.</li>
            <li>I bought it to clear some acne spots on my face.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think any product makes it disappoear completely.</li>
            <li>Because vitamin C is not stable so don&#x27;t waste your money on a jar or tube that will expose product to light and air daily.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I had some discoloration near the bridge of my nose and using it every night, the discoloration has faded to almost nothing.</li>
            <li>If your body is beautifully marked, then this is your cup of tea.</li>
            <li>I notice that a couple people developed an irritation from it based on the reviews.</li>
            <li>are fading slowly, would work better if I used it twice a day</li>
            <li>this is prolly the only discoloration cream that ive seen decent results from.</li>
            <li>So I was born in d Dominican republic as you guys know its very sunny over there all year long.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m usually not hypo allergenic, so I&#x27;m surprised that I had such an itchy rash, reaction.</li>
            <li>than ruining your make up by slathering a new application of sunscreen over your face several times daily&lt;br /&gt;For</li>
            <li>I stopped using it, but recently started using it on a new spot from a pimple that went away.</li>
            <li>They became very itchy and dry.</li>
            <li>It took me about three months to see full results , but the downfall about this product is once you stop using it your dark spots come back within days.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m African American and have hyper-pigmentation issues and this has really helped.</li>
            <li>my skin was back to it&#x27;s natural color.</li>
            <li>then I bought sun screen spf90 for the day time and my skin its back to soft.</li>
            <li>I think they should be completely gone within the next month</li>
            <li>On the back of most products it usually says to test a small spot on your body first to see if you have an allergic reaction to it.</li>
            <li>After a few days I developed a rash, even though I had tried a test patch first.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t emphasize that enough- skin that has been bleached will soak up new skin issues like a sponge - only zinc oxide</li>
            <li>(read sun damage) , or formed by hormonal changes during pregnancy (which usually goes away afrer pregnancy, so I wouldn&#x27;t use a chemical product for it... ) or permanent dark blotches that are caused by natural hormonal changes or, in my case, I believe it was caused by long term use of a medication that made my skin slightly more sun sensitive.&lt;br /&gt;These dark spots are much more difficult to fade than scars, as they form deeper in the layers of skin and are EASILY made darker by anytime spent in the sun.</li>
            <li>i use a thin film on the spots and apply extra sunscreen to make sure re-darkiening doesn&#x27;t occur</li>
            <li>but my skin was really burned so dark</li>
            <li>This stuff ONLY COST $5.75 at any dollar store (Dollar General, Family Dollar, etc).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It has a pretty heavy fragrance, though.</li>
            <li>The scars covered about 3/4 of my arms and since I&#x27;m black they were really embarrassing for me</li>
            <li>it was very dark compared to my whole body</li>

            <li> It fades marks, acne scars and other hyperpigmentation marks effectively.</li>
            <li> Its good to actually test it because I just noticed I have tons of tiny bumps all over the areas I used this product.</li>
            <li> its really good for dark marks and hyperpigmetation from old cars and acne.</li>
            <li> Much easier and practical.</li>
            <li> I really like this product, have been using it for about a year.  </li>
            <li> so it works really well on the eyes.</li>
            <li> once on weekdays at night I really dont go out with this cream even with sunscreen</li>
            <li> this product really works.</li>
            <li> i am very dark-skinned and he seen improvement in those areas that are darker than the rest of my body.</li>
            <li> It works amazingly fast</li>
            <li> I have to admit it really works...</li>
            <li> I love this have been using it for years...stopped working as I aged bit teamed up with my Jojoba Oil</li>
            <li> This stuff really works.</li>
            <li> Really lightens skin</li>
            <li> Again the product works very well</li>
            <li> It is the real stuff.</li>
            <li> Works very well to dimish scar discoloration.</li>
            <li> Finally something that really works !!!</li>
            <li> : apply this cream on to your clean face twice a day - but only apply it to the areas of your hyper pigmentation!</li>
            <li> your gonna find over the counter, and the only true skin bleaching agent.</li>
            <li> decided to go ahead and start using it again to see if it&#x27;ll work on my older spots.</li>
            <li> but the main problem was that it irritated the skin around my eyes.</li>
            <li> and then pat on a little bb cream or very light foundation where needed.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> lol ill just stick to buying it from the store</li>
            <li> (Significant fading and not very noticeable hyper pigmentation</li>
            <li> When I was 9 I came to new york</li>
            <li> Very fast shipping and works well on discoloration if you use it daily.</li>
            <li> I used this cream consistently (twice a day) and around the last week of March</li>
            <li> Most of the time people dont bother to do this, I usually skip doing this also.</li>
            <li> I have used this cream for more than 2wks now and am yet to see my black knuckles fade away,I was highly expecting a quicker effect because it says extra strength.</li>
            <li> available for just HALF this price over at Walmart.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I use clear zinc, then I choose mineral makeup with zinc for added protection.</li>
            <li> I bought it to clear some acne spots on my face.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think any product makes it disappoear completely.</li>
            <li> Because vitamin C is not stable so don&#x27;t waste your money on a jar or tube that will expose product to light and air daily.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I had some discoloration near the bridge of my nose and using it every night, the discoloration has faded to almost nothing.</li>
            <li> If your body is beautifully marked, then this is your cup of tea.</li>
            <li> I notice that a couple people developed an irritation from it based on the reviews.</li>
            <li> are fading slowly, would work better if I used it twice a day</li>
            <li> this is prolly the only discoloration cream that ive seen decent results from.</li>
            <li> So I was born in d Dominican republic as you guys know its very sunny over there all year long.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m usually not hypo allergenic, so I&#x27;m surprised that I had such an itchy rash, reaction.</li>
            <li> than ruining your make up by slathering a new application of sunscreen over your face several times daily&lt;br /&gt;For</li>
            <li> I stopped using it, but recently started using it on a new spot from a pimple that went away.</li>
            <li> They became very itchy and dry.</li>
            <li> It took me about three months to see full results , but the downfall about this product is once you stop using it your dark spots come back within days.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m African American and have hyper-pigmentation issues and this has really helped.</li>
            <li> my skin was back to it&#x27;s natural color.</li>
            <li> then I bought sun screen spf90 for the day time and my skin its back to soft.</li>
            <li> I think they should be completely gone within the next month</li>
            <li> On the back of most products it usually says to test a small spot on your body first to see if you have an allergic reaction to it.</li>
            <li> After a few days I developed a rash, even though I had tried a test patch first.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t emphasize that enough- skin that has been bleached will soak up new skin issues like a sponge - only zinc oxide</li>
            <li> (read sun damage) , or formed by hormonal changes during pregnancy (which usually goes away afrer pregnancy, so I wouldn&#x27;t use a chemical product for it... ) or permanent dark blotches that are caused by natural hormonal changes or, in my case, I believe it was caused by long term use of a medication that made my skin slightly more sun sensitive.&lt;br /&gt;These dark spots are much more difficult to fade than scars, as they form deeper in the layers of skin and are EASILY made darker by anytime spent in the sun.</li>
            <li> i use a thin film on the spots and apply extra sunscreen to make sure re-darkiening doesn&#x27;t occur</li>
            <li> but my skin was really burned so dark</li>
            <li> This stuff ONLY COST $5.75 at any dollar store (Dollar General, Family Dollar, etc).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It has a pretty heavy fragrance, though.</li>
            <li> The scars covered about 3/4 of my arms and since I&#x27;m black they were really embarrassing for me</li>
            <li> it was very dark compared to my whole body</li>
            <li> At least for my skin, the product only seems to work for new scars as it has done nothing for my old ones.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;So: apply only to dark areas, use only for 3-4 month intervals, ALWAYS WEAR AND REAPPLY physical sunblockers...</li>
            <li> With lots of red inflamed spots and old acne scars:( I have super sensitive skin</li>
            <li> Helped clear away my dark marks!</li>
            <li> and here is the key (for some reason no one, not even medical professionals mentioned this when I tried a prescribed form of hydroquinone--the active bleaching</li>
            <li> Im not sure if its because this is the extra strength one or if my skin is just too sensitive.</li>
            <li> so i was careful only to put it where i need it.</li>
            <li> those who complain it takes too long....</li>
            <li> It takes just as long as the prescription creams.</li>
            <li> I hope someone else benefits from my way too long quest to find this all out.</li>
            <li> Its not too heavy or harmful to the sensitive areas</li>
            <li> bottle lasts a long time.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t just use a thin layer and don&#x27;t take it off right away if you don&#x27;t have a sensitivity to it.</li>
            <li> All the other over-the-counter products only have 2% hydroquinone, this has 3%.  </li>
            <li> She looks so much better and younger and she has battled for years with really bad sun spots.</li>
            <li> Also a week after using this my skin got so dry and itchy where I was wearing it</li>
            <li> have found two products I like:&lt;br /&gt;Neutragena liquid sheer natural SPF 50 that comes in a small bottle and spreads easier due to its consistency and&lt;br /&gt;A</li>
            <li> $5 small plastic jar of clear zinc suntan lotion SPF 50  at both Walgreens and CVS...</li>
            <li> Use only on the dark patches.</li>
            <li> I get dark spots after a cut (hyper-pigmentation), and this product definitely helps with fading them.  </li>
            <li> the difference is that zinc oxide (which blocks both UVA and UVB rays does so by reflecting sun rays from the surface of your skin, while chemical sunscreens actually absorb sunlight and break it down.</li>
            <li> im black and wanted to fade discoloration from acne, razor bumps etc on my face and after only a week</li>
            <li> Hello I am a black male with a chocolate complexion.</li>
            <li> The Black marks was caused from Acme, that was located on my back &amp; chest.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons&lt;br /&gt;It can leave your skin a little red but doesn&#x27;t hurt.</li>
            <li> However, it can be found for about half the price on other sites such as W@lM@rt</li>
            <li> DEFINITE BUY HANDS DOWN!</li>
            <li> Maybe I got a bad batch, but then again maybe a didn&#x27;t.&lt;br /&gt;The RDL Papaya Soap Whitening Soap does a better job.</li>
            <li> in terms of results is still too early to talk about it, so I finish review after using it for at least two weeks.</li>
            <li> Please be careful using this product.</li>
            <li> the fading is minimal</li>
            <li> The item is as expected</li>
            <li> Also those others brands really left my skin raw.</li>
            <li> I mainly use it at night because it is VERY thick and EXTREMELY oily.</li>
            <li> I will tell you that a little bit goes a long way.</li>
            <li> a lot of small red itchy bumps have appeared, I used on elbows and knees as we&#x27;ll</li>
            <li> Also people have said its due to the mineral oil thats in it</li>
            <li> If using it on the face be very careful.</li>
            <li> If you do research, you can see that hydroquinone (the active ingredient in this product) can cause Vitiligo/ permanent loss of melanin.</li>
            <li> A little disappointed, but willing to finish the entire jar before making my final judgement.</li>
            <li> The dark patches on your face that can be &amp;#34;sun spots&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> I had dark spots on my stomach</li>
            <li> I have dark spots on my face and dark circles under my eyes.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve also noticed a reduction in my dark circles.</li>
            <li> The dark circles have been fading</li>
            <li> My pimple spot which was so dark and could cover it faded 90%</li>
            <li> I apply it to dark spots on my face with a q-tip.</li>
            <li> I also have dark circles under my eyes.</li>
            <li> It works but is slow acting</li>
            <li> It causes black discoloration.</li>
            <li> I have white skin and crazy adult acne</li>
            <li> One jar applying twice a day lasts about month and a half.  </li>
            <li> And within a week I observed the fading of the black marks.</li>
            <li> It says to use twice a day which is what I do and after a week I can see a slight difference on my bikini area and stomach which is where I am applying the cream.</li>
            <li> Only use it at night afraid it will over do it in sun as my moisturizer only has SPF15&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Blemishes</li>
            <li> Hydroquinone should not be used year round and can darken spots after extended use.</li>
            <li> Over time, I&#x27;d pop pimples on my face and get small dark spots as a result.</li>
            <li> I actually made my melasma worse by using this product incorrectly years ago.</li>
            <li> Next - if you are leaving the house - apply zinc sunscreen IF YOU DONT YOUR MELASMA WILL GET WORSE.</li>
            <li> but it has dried out my skin a lot and</li>
            <li> - been using for about 3 months twise everyday.</li>
            <li> I use it everyday after my showers.</li>
            <li> I kid you not, within days, I noticed a few spots getting lighter.</li>
            <li> I would not recommend using it under make up because after a few hours your make up feels &amp;#34;cakey&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> **. Waste of money.</li>
            <li> When I apply it to my skin it just feels so heavy and oily on my face, even with the pea size amount I used.</li>
            <li> people hate natural zinc oxide products because they are hard to rub in that clown face white takes a long while to absorb.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Perhaps, I was dumb to think it&#x27;d be a long term skin remedy.</li>
            <li> i could not return the item :\</li>
            <li> Im not sure</li>
            <li> Just remember that a small amount will work well.</li>
            <li> This cream must be used in small amounts.</li>
            <li> (Some people even experience darkening of hyper pigmentation from common chemical sunscreens)</li>
            <li> At least About 3 Months Or So</li>
            <li> I used it for 2 weeks with negative results.</li>
            <li> I applied it in a thick layer like a mask and waited an hour.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately did not really work for me! :|</li>
            <li> I was desperate, going to my friends party the next day and being the only ugly one...</li>
            <li> Just use it twice a day and at the very least once every day until you get the results you want.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It is a very thick, dense cream</li>
            <li> also had bad dark eye circles now</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a clunk of heavy pasty mess that smells horrible.</li>
            <li> I burned myself  badly on my leg 4-5 years ago and the scar is slowly fading away.  </li>
            <li> It worked well but was expensive plus the shipping.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve ordered expensive products that did not help.</li>
            <li> Have horrible dark pigmentation.</li>
            <li> My scars were almost gone in less than a month &amp; the scars were horrible.</li>
            <li> I was afraid it will irritate my skin.</li>
            <li> im afraid it will burn on the sun.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve used a lot of brand name creams that did nothing and were very expensive.</li>
            <li> Depending On How Bad</li>
            <li> I used to use it like every so often and got frustrated because I saw no difference.</li>
            <li> This crap of a cream made my face darker.</li>
            <li> im my worst critic</li>
            <li> After 1 hr my horrible acne spots were almost GONE!</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t work for me at all,i used it 1 time and gave me a horrible rash,also causes break outs</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Excellent product...Great results!  Love it!</li>
            <li> Fades my (post menopause) age splotches (much bigger than &amp;#34;spots&amp;#34;) better than any non-prescription product I&#x27;ve tried (and I&#x27;ve tried plenty).</li>
            <li> This product is excellent. Follow the directions and I promise you will be pleased with the results.</li>
            <li> Purchased several jars and used for 3 months. Didn&#x27;t notice the slightest difference with lightening blemishes and it was used as directed.</li>
            <li> works for me well. this is prolly the only discoloration cream that ive seen decent results from. im black and wanted to fade discoloration from acne, razor bumps etc on my face and after only a week my parents kept complimenting on how my face looks. i was like yea ok w/e cuz im my worst critic but i guess it does work some. i didnt wanna look like vybz kartel so i was careful only to put it where i need it. it didnt irritate my skin. everyone is diff so u have to experiment with all this kind of stuff. trial and error. i got this at rite aide and it&#x27;s better than the ones id get at the beauty supply store</li>
            <li> Works for me...I burned myself  badly on my leg 4-5 years ago and the scar is slowly fading away.  You have to be consistent it is also good&lt;br /&gt;to even my skin tone on my face.  When I use it on my face my face has a nice even tone and glows.  Great product!</li>
            <li> I have used Nadinola Extra Strength for many years for areas of hyperpigmentation. It is by far the best lightening cream on the market It is the only one that is 3%. I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> You see results within two weeks .meaning the spots may reduce but not disappeared</li>
            <li> This works great on my skin, it removes all the marks and gives me an even tone.</li>
            <li> I have melasma.... The dark patches on your face that can be &amp;#34;sun spots&amp;#34; (read sun damage) , or formed by hormonal changes during pregnancy (which usually goes away afrer pregnancy, so I wouldn&#x27;t use a chemical product for it... ) or permanent dark blotches that are caused by natural hormonal changes or, in my case, I believe it was caused by long term use of a medication that made my skin slightly more sun sensitive.&lt;br /&gt;These dark spots are much more difficult to fade than scars, as they form deeper in the layers of skin and are EASILY made darker by anytime spent in the sun. They can also be made darker with the use of bleaching creams, which ironically cause sun sensitivity. You MUST wear sunscreen.... and here is the key (for some reason no one, not even medical professionals mentioned this when I tried a prescribed form of hydroquinone--the active bleaching ingredient)&lt;br /&gt;The sunscreen MUST have zinc oxide, a physical sun blocker not chemical sunscreens. (Some people even experience darkening of hyper pigmentation from common chemical sunscreens) the difference is that zinc oxide (which blocks both UVA and UVB rays does so by reflecting sun rays from the surface of your skin, while chemical sunscreens actually absorb sunlight and break it down. So you are still getting sun exposure on the top layers of the spots you are trying to rid yourself of.&lt;br /&gt;Most people hate natural zinc oxide products because they are hard to rub in that clown face white takes a long while to absorb.&lt;br /&gt;I have found two products I like:&lt;br /&gt;Neutragena liquid sheer natural SPF 50 that comes in a small bottle and spreads easier due to its consistency and&lt;br /&gt;A $5 small plastic jar of clear zinc suntan lotion SPF 50  at both Walgreens and CVS... Under generic store labels that I think are the same product or might as well be. I reapply touch ups (often) over my darkest spot areas using a sunscreen stick that I keep in my bag and then pat on a little bb cream or very light foundation where needed. Much easier and practical. than ruining your make up by slathering a new application of sunscreen over your face several times daily&lt;br /&gt;For those who complain it takes too long.... It takes just as long as the prescription creams. Skin bleachers are gradual and you must be patient. And yes, the hyper pigmentation will return no matter what product you use when you discontinue. Drs recvimnend using hydroquinone products for 3-4 months at a time, then switching to another skin lightened like Kojic Acid with sunscreen for maintenance or continued fading for 2-3 months. Hydroquinone should not be used year round and can darken spots after extended use. Also, it DOES NOT MIX WITH MANY ACNE PRODUCT INGREDIENTS. Do you research and if you see ANY obvious darkening especially of the blue blackish variety STOP immediately.&lt;br /&gt;Also, hydroquinone bleaches all skin indiscriminately. Use only on the dark patches. Use a q-tip or a lip liner brush to apply precisely. Some people who think their patches aren&#x27;t fading is because they are accidentally lightening the skin around it and therefore can&#x27;t see any significant contrast between fading brown spots and fading surrounding skin.&lt;br /&gt;So: apply only to dark areas, use only for 3-4 month intervals, ALWAYS WEAR AND REAPPLY physical sunblockers... And this stuff WILL WORK PROPERLY AND you should be very happy with the results. (Significant fading and not very noticeable hyper pigmentation I don&#x27;t think any product makes it disappoear completely. But, this has done the best job for me after trying several products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Adding AHAs *OR* retinols and vitamin c serum or cream (packaged in an air and light stable bottle (read:pump, opaque bottle... Because vitamin C is not stable so don&#x27;t waste your money on a jar or tube that will expose product to light and air daily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had to learn all this info on my own and once I started using it correctly with the right sunscreen.... lo and behold... It actually WORKS.&lt;br /&gt;So I hope someone else benefits from my way too long quest to find this all out. It should be printed on all skin bleaching products. But it isn&#x27;t.... So hope this helps. It&#x27;s helped me tremendously.&lt;br /&gt;Good luck!</li>
            <li> Please be careful using this product. It has great short term effects but long term it isn&#x27;t good. I used Nadinola for the first time in 2010. I had dark spots on my stomach and I used the cream to eliminate it. It worked well. Over time, I&#x27;d pop pimples on my face and get small dark spots as a result. I&#x27;d use this to take the spots off effectively and it was great for that. Several years later, I find that pigmentation is severly gone from my hands. It&#x27;s like I&#x27;m developing Vitiligo without any genetic predisposition. If you do research, you can see that hydroquinone (the active ingredient in this product) can cause Vitiligo/ permanent loss of melanin. It was even banned in Europe at a point because the product isn&#x27;t safe. Perhaps, I was dumb to think it&#x27;d be a long term skin remedy. Or maybe I used my hands to apply the product and it seeped into my skin that way. Despite washing my hands, I probably should&#x27;ve worn gloves for applications. Maybe it&#x27;s a product you&#x27;re to use once and never again. Not sure what the problem is exactly but I just don&#x27;t want people to make the same mistake I did. If you&#x27;re an African American and spots can show on your skin, please don&#x27;t try this product. It isn&#x27;t worth the risk!!!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Nadinola for years. It took me about three months to see full results , but the downfall about this product is once you stop using it your dark spots come back within days.  You would have to constantly use Nadinola to keep your results. IT IS NOT PERMANENT!!!.</li>
            <li> Helps tone your skin also Moisture  as well</li>
            <li> I like this cream for evening out darker spots on your skin.</li>
            <li> Ok here&#x27;s the deal. This product has 3% Hydroquione - that&#x27;s the highest your gonna find over the counter, and the only true skin bleaching agent. I&#x27;ve been using this product for about three weeks now and my upper lip melasma is about 60% improved. Those are good results- but you have to know what your doing. I actually made my melasma worse by using this product incorrectly years ago. So here&#x27;s what you do: apply this cream on to your clean face twice a day - but only apply it to the areas of your hyper pigmentation! Otherwise you lighten the areas around the marks as well so your skin never blends evenly. Next - if you are leaving the house - apply zinc sunscreen IF YOU DONT YOUR MELASMA WILL GET WORSE. I can&#x27;t emphasize that enough- skin that has been bleached will soak up new skin issues like a sponge - only zinc oxide will prevent that. After about a month on this product, to remove the remaining melasma, use a 1x per week chemical peel with Kojic acid. The kojic acid is a melasma inhibitor, and the peel removes what the cream couldn&#x27;t lift. You will get your desired results with this regime, but be prepared to use sunscreen the rest of your life. I use clear zinc, then I choose mineral makeup with zinc for added protection. Good luck.</li>
            <li> I could give 0 stars if possible. Do  not use. It causes black discoloration. The spots on which this cream was applied became darker. Used it over the weekend and only 4 applications in total without Sun exposure at all. Have horrible dark pigmentation.</li>
            <li> I really like this product, have been using it for about a year.  All the other over-the-counter products only have 2% hydroquinone, this has 3%.  I used to order Eldopaque (4% hydroquinone) from a Mexican pharmacy.  It worked well but was expensive plus the shipping.  This product does a good job at a much lower cost.  Be sure to wear sunscreen</li>
            <li> Nadinola is a must have for all those experiencing hyperpigmentation. It fades marks, acne scars and other hyperpigmentation marks effectively. You should folow this application with a good sunscreen.</li>
            <li> Let me tell you how this works. I have white skin and crazy adult acne I can&#x27;t get rid of. I was desperate, going to my friends party the next day and being the only ugly one... With lots of red inflamed spots and old acne scars:( I have super sensitive skin but I was willing to do anything to not show my acne spots  like it was my only achievement .I bought this cream from Walmart. I applied it in a thick layer like a mask and waited an hour. I was afraid it will irritate my skin. But no worries it has a moisturizer in it , too. After 1 hr my horrible acne spots were almost GONE! They faded away to the point where my BB cream covered everything nicely, evenly and smooth:)) I am so happy , it does work for emergencies, too. Don&#x27;t just use a thin layer and don&#x27;t take it off right away if you don&#x27;t have a sensitivity to it. It works and I will keep using it!</li>
            <li> the fading is minimal but I love that it leaves my skin smooth and my makeup goes on real nice.</li>
            <li> I have dark spots on my face and dark circles under my eyes. I&#x27;ve ordered expensive products that did not help. I saw this in Walmart and decided to pick it up. Its soooo good for the dark spots and I&#x27;ve also noticed a reduction in my dark circles. Its not too heavy or harmful to the sensitive areas so it works really well on the eyes. And the best part is, you an see a change in your face within the week you begin to use it. I love this stuff. (But as a side note, I&#x27;d just pick it up from Walmart if at all possible. Its only like $7 there)</li>
            <li> I purchased this product in January to use for my eczema scars on my arms. The scars covered about 3/4 of my arms and since I&#x27;m black they were really embarrassing for me and I never wore short sleeves before. I used this cream consistently (twice a day) and around the last week of March my skin was back to it&#x27;s natural color. I haven&#x27;t been able to wear short sleeves/go sleeveless in YEARS and I can&#x27;t believe I didn&#x27;t invest in this product sooner.</li>
            <li> Its same cream as walgreen sale but my review here might help or might not. So I was born in d Dominican republic as you guys know its very sunny over there all year long. When I was 9 I came to new york but my skin was really burned so dark so my skin cleared up here but leaving sun discoloration on my neck it was very dark compared to my whole body also had bad dark eye circles now im 22 decide to fix with nadinola cream been using it for two weeks around my eyes one pimple spot and my neck. The dark circles have been fading lets say about 40% which means it gets covered with make up now. My pimple spot which was so dark and could cover it faded 90% its unnoticible with make up. My neck which is the largest skin and darkest it faded maybe 20% this one deffinetly needs more time. I have to say I did the test the first day on my elbows like it says. Now I use twice on d weekends and once on weekdays at night I really dont go out with this cream even with sunscreen im afraid it will burn on the sun. Also a week after using this my skin got so dry and itchy where I was wearing it I used vaseline everything it didnt help then I bought sun screen spf90 for the day time and my skin its back to soft.</li>
            <li> It works but is slow acting</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for months now, NOT every day, but almost every day. I apply it to dark spots on my face with a q-tip. No noticeable difference. However, no adverse effects either. A little disappointed, but willing to finish the entire jar before making my final judgement.P</li>
            <li> Did not work for me by any means, ended up throwing this away after 3 months of no result. Piona worked better for me with quick results within days.</li>
            <li> Excellent! Works fast, Gets rid of spots quickly</li>
            <li> Very fast shipping and works well on discoloration if you use it daily.</li>
            <li> Best Bleaching cream I have ever used results seen in only two weeks.</li>
            <li> I saw a result within a week and am still working my face on it&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Perfect</li>
            <li> I saw a difference the first week using Nadolina Skin Bleach</li>
            <li> Very happy; there is a noticeable difference in the dark spots on my face. I am so pleased that they&#x27;ve begun to fade. I apply the product two times a day--in the morning and before bed.</li>
            <li> this product really works. i am very dark-skinned and he seen improvement in those areas that are darker than the rest of my body. its really good for dark marks and hyperpigmetation from old cars and acne. i use a thin film on the spots and apply extra sunscreen to make sure re-darkiening doesn&#x27;t occur</li>
            <li> After a few days I developed a rash, even though I had tried a test patch first. So, I guess I&#x27;m out $20. I&#x27;m usually not hypo allergenic, so I&#x27;m surprised that I had such an itchy rash, reaction.</li>
            <li> This skin lightening cr√®me is AFFORDABLE # 1.  But it works as well, and a bigger bonus  it moisturizes great.  A great additive to the drying affects of treatment cr√®me.  YES YES YES!  But don&#x27;t forget sunblock</li>
            <li> Great product, works very well.  Took about a week of daily application to show signs of working.  However, it can be found for about half the price on other sites such as W@lM@rt</li>
            <li> It works amazingly fast I used it on my underarms for 2 days 1x a day at night after I shower and it seems to be working but it has dried out my skin a lot and a lot of small red itchy bumps have appeared, I used on elbows and knees as we&#x27;ll but nothing there so it might be that it was too strong for my underarms use a lil bit to test first good product for a good price</li>
            <li> did not help whatsoever</li>
            <li> So far so good. Only use it at night afraid it will over do it in sun as my moisturizer only has SPF15&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Blemishes are fading slowly, would work better if I used it twice a day I&#x27;m sure</li>
            <li> This started to fade my acne scars within two weeks. I&#x27;m African American and have hyper-pigmentation issues and this has really helped.</li>
            <li> I get dark spots after a cut (hyper-pigmentation), and this product definitely helps with fading them.  It just takes time, so you need to apply every day and be patient with it.</li>
            <li> - been using for about 3 months twise everyday. does not work .</li>
            <li> It really works!  One jar applying twice a day lasts about month and a half.  I love it!</li>
            <li> My scars were almost gone in less than a month &amp; the scars were horrible. They covered my entire cheek on both sides of my face. I think they should be completely gone within the next month</li>
            <li> Good product. Works as stated. Like that product is in a glass jar. Would recommend.</li>
            <li> I love this product. Although i buy it from wal-mart for 5 dollars, i was hoping it was cheaper here on amazon but its 3 times the price lol ill just stick to buying it from the store....ps this product can be harmful if you do not know how to use it, so be aware of the product and its ingredients , if you wear this cream often be sure to wear sunscreen when you are out in the sun. The sun exposure mixed with the ingredients can cause irreversible skin diseases.</li>
            <li> Beware it stains sheets and possibly clothing.</li>
            <li> Helped clear away my dark marks! Excellent product.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product to help lighten my knees and elbows.. Unfortunately did not really work for me! :| I</li>
            <li> I am not as consistent in using this cream as id like to be. It works great and within the first use I woke up the next morning seeing my skin whiter and brighter. However I was using this to fade acne scars an I don&#x27;t see the scars fading rather I see my skin fading. So use it as a skin lightener and it will be great but for scars NOüëé</li>
            <li> Hello I am a black male with a chocolate complexion. I have had this product for about two weeks now. And within a week I observed the fading of the black marks. The Black marks was caused from Acme, that was located on my back &amp; chest.  There is a light smell for me is very mild I can wear this all day without getting irritated or anything. I&#x27;ve done my research on this product for over an hour using google &amp; YouTube etc. I was told by multiple sources that this product works. Well I&#x27;m here to tell you that it&#x27;s legit!  DEFINITE BUY HANDS DOWN!</li>
            <li> I have to admit it really works...if you use it constantly. The problem I have is I use it to fade acne scars BUT this product causes me MORE acne so it&#x27;s totally counterproductive!!! I have combination/oily skin and I break out a lot on my T-zone so this was not for me, HOWEVER my mom uses it every night and her skin has improved drastically! She looks so much better and younger and she has battled for years with really bad sun spots. This product is also incredibly inexpensive in drug stores and it has the highest percent of Hydroquinone available without a prescription.</li>
            <li> Finally something that really works !!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it for a couple months and saw no difference in my skin&#x27;s hyperpigmentation. I stopped using it, but recently started using it on a new spot from a pimple that went away. It actually faded! At least for my skin, the product only seems to work for new scars as it has done nothing for my old ones.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I decided to go ahead and start using it again to see if it&#x27;ll work on my older spots. I&#x27;ll provide an update in a month or so.</li>
            <li> available for just HALF this price over at Walmart.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;$5.18 for 1 Pack at Walmart&lt;br /&gt;$20.05 for 2 Pack on amazon.com&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Used it on my neck - I am a guy - and it worked well to lighten the skin. But I also bought much better quality razors for shaving, so the skin would not get damaged.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Took 3 months to remove all the darkness from the neck, but I used it only once a day after showering. Pretty sure you&#x27;ll see faster results if you were to use it twice daily.</li>
            <li> I love this have been using it for years...stopped working as I aged bit teamed up with my Jojoba Oil.....yeah!!!!!!</li>
            <li> This cream is pretty strong (3% Hydroquinone) and you caan see results within 2 to 3 weeks of continuous use. I use it everyday after my showers.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t work for me at all,i used it 1 time and gave me a horrible rash,also causes break outs&lt;br /&gt;and i could not return the item :\</li>
            <li> This stuff really works. I had some discoloration near the bridge of my nose and using it every night, the discoloration has faded to almost nothing. It actually helped even overall skintone on my face and lighten some freckles on my arms.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used a lot of brand name creams that did nothing and were very expensive. Also those others brands really left my skin raw. Yes this needs to be used often, but it also requires you to stop use for a while. The bottle instructs you to use it for about 3 months and then take a month off. I put it by my toothbrush to remind me  to put it on at night before bed. I put it on when I get up, before my shower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pro&lt;br /&gt;It works! Really lightens skin imperfections.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s about $5 a bottle on Walmart.&lt;br /&gt;A bottle lasts a long time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons&lt;br /&gt;It can leave your skin a little red but doesn&#x27;t hurt. This does show it is working.&lt;br /&gt;If you put on a lot it leaves a waxy residue.&lt;br /&gt;It can feel greasy, but I have issues with oily skin is could just be my skin&#x27;s reaction.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To me these cons were outweighed by the benefit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just do not buy from Amazon. It&#x27;s a huge ripoff.</li>
            <li> Ive been using this for a week now. You have to constantly use it or you wont get the benefits from it. I used to use it like every so often and got frustrated because I saw no difference. It says to use twice a day which is what I do and after a week I can see a slight difference on my bikini area and stomach which is where I am applying the cream. I also have dark circles under my eyes. I would not recommend it for the eye area. Once it starts to absorb it gets in your eyes a bit but the main problem was that it irritated the skin around my eyes. They became very itchy and dry. Im not sure if its because this is the extra strength one or if my skin is just too sensitive. I just thought Id give a heads up. The rest of my body however has no bad reaction to it. This is the highest amount of fade ingredients you can get with is 3% I would recommend this to anyone, it does work. Just use it twice a day and at the very least once every day until you get the results you want.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I had to come back and add a bit more info. On the back of most products it usually says to test a small spot on your body first to see if you have an allergic reaction to it. Most of the time people dont bother to do this, I usually skip doing this also. Its good to actually test it because I just noticed I have tons of tiny bumps all over the areas I used this product. Im not sure if im allergic to the ingredients or if its because its too strong. Also people have said its due to the mineral oil thats in it and it clogs pores. Either way just a heads up if you use it. The bumps I have have been here for over a day and doesnt look like its fading yet. If using it on the face be very careful. Again the product works very well but it might cause an allergic reaction for some people. Just keep that in mind so you dont have to walk around with tons of bumps on your body like I have to :)</li>
            <li> I started using this cream the day it was delivered. I kid you not, within days, I noticed a few spots getting lighter. I mainly use it at night because it is VERY thick and EXTREMELY oily. I would not recommend using it under make up because after a few hours your make up feels &amp;#34;cakey&amp;#34;. I see results and I have only been using it for a week. My husband is using it too, same thing, it cleared some spots and he only uses it at night.</li>
            <li> I Been Using This Product For A Week Now &amp; I Have Been Seeing Some Lighting But Its Going To Take Time For The To Work At least About 3 Months Or So Depending On How Bad The Scaring Is .</li>
            <li> This stuff stuff works like a charm!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s great for effective skin lightening! HOWEVER... This stuff ONLY COST $5.75 at any dollar store (Dollar General, Family Dollar, etc).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For Nadinola to be sold at almost $20 is HIGHWAY ROBBERY!!!!!</li>
            <li> Used it for a month and didn&#x27;t see a difference. Don&#x27;t waste your money. Buy Meladerm instead.</li>
            <li> I have sun spots on my face from working out in the sun, doctor recommend this product. She says it works great for dark spots</li>
            <li> I have used this cream for more than 2wks now and am yet to see my black knuckles fade away,I was highly expecting a quicker effect because it says extra strength. I do not recommend!</li>
            <li> Extra strength my A**. Waste of money. ZERO STARS! This crap of a cream made my face darker. I bought it to clear some acne spots on my face. I used it for 2 weeks with negative results. It&#x27;s a clunk of heavy pasty mess that smells horrible. When I apply it to my skin it just feels so heavy and oily on my face, even with the pea size amount I used. Maybe I got a bad batch, but then again maybe a didn&#x27;t.&lt;br /&gt;The RDL Papaya Soap Whitening Soap does a better job.</li>
            <li> I still have the spots. Ogie</li>
            <li> If your body is beautifully marked, then this is your cup of tea.</li>
            <li> While I have only been using this product a month or so, I can see a definite lightening of the &amp;#34;sun spot&amp;#34; on my face. With more time, I hope it becomes even lighter.  So far; so good.</li>
            <li> This is the best thing to remove dark spots! It is the real stuff. A trust worthy seller!!!</li>
            <li> Works very well to dimish scar discoloration.</li>
            <li> The item is as expected</li>
            <li> This product has been around for years! I will tell you that a little bit goes a long way. It is a very thick, dense cream but it truly works. I saw an overall change in my complexion after about two weeks of daily use. My skin was clearer and brighter! It has a pretty heavy fragrance, though. Just remember that a small amount will work well. I notice that a couple people developed an irritation from it based on the reviews. This cream must be used in small amounts. I only used it on my face,</li>
            <li> It is a cream with a mild pleasant odor, use it with caution for your skin especially at night, protect yourself from the sun and follow the instructions. in terms of results is still too early to talk about it, so I finish review after using it for at least two weeks.</li>
    </ol>
