            <li>This is excellent for the price.</li>
            <li>Came perfectly!</li>
            <li>Still great quality for the price.</li>
            <li>Love it!!</li>
            <li>The quality isn&#x27;t as good as it looks</li>
            <li>but my camera is good and it doesn&#x27;t look like thatðŸ˜•</li>
            <li>good qualities,  i love it!</li>
            <li>Good price and nice designed</li>
            <li>I love it!</li>
            <li>I hope this means that the product took note of others&#x27; and made it better.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s really cute</li>
            <li>Just that it&#x27;s cracked of so many falls it&#x27;s gotten.</li>
            <li>Cute for sure, but no protection at al .</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s still cute</li>
            <li>It is a great case, but if you&#x27;re anything like me and always drop your phone, it will start cracking (for me around the top area of the phone case, near the on/off button and the volume and ringer buttons), and it eventually broke some off.</li>
            <li>but now it&#x27;s fine.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a beautiful case, just kind of fragile when it comes to clumsy people.</li>
            <li>Got this case for daughter, although the case isn&#x27;t really good for hard core protection, it fit very snuggly and design is as displayed</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t look exactly like the picture</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s a very desent looking case.</li>
            <li>These cases offer zero protection, the price is good but not when you have to replace a broken phone.</li>

            <li> But leaves a strange smell on my hands</li>
            <li> It was not at all what I expected</li>
            <li> The art did not rub off on my fingers, as other reviews stated.</li>
            <li> However it finally showed up this past weekend</li>
            <li> Colors weren&#x27;t as sharp as the picture.</li>
            <li> Overall, it is a thin case, it can crack if dropped , but mine hasn&#x27;t done so .</li>
            <li> The color on it sucks, I tried adding a picture</li>
            <li> My phone case came in the mail and once I opened it , it was already broken</li>
            <li> Although shipping is slow!!</li>
            <li> The paint smelled really bad once I got it.</li>
