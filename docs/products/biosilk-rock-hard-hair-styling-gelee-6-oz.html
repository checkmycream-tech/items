            <li>It is a wonderful product.  </li>
            <li>THIS IS THE  BEST OF THE BEST  FOR HAIR GEL!!!!!!!  </li>
            <li>I think the automatic delivery system for a product like this will work out great for me.</li>
            <li>I have spiky hair and this product is great.  </li>
            <li>I was thrilled!</li>
            <li>Been using for years good price</li>
            <li>And hair still looks good day after.</li>
            <li>I have been using this product for quite a while now and am very pleased with it.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s perfect and such a great price compared to the stores.</li>
            <li>Ive tried several gels and this is the perfect one.</li>
            <li>I love this gel.  </li>
            <li>I had read about this gel on a curly/wavy hair website, though, and decided to try it out -- and I love it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I use about three pea-sized amounts for my shoulder-length hair, and make sure that I emulsify it in my hands before raking it through.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>If you want more info about the Curly Girl method, check out [[ASIN:076115678X Curly Girl: The Handbook]].</li>
            <li>Each day I add more of this, or put some Re-Coil on it, and wrap it up in a T-shirt to absorb the moisture.  </li>
            <li>Love this gel...don&#x27;t have to use a lot of the product.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>Love the product.  </li>
            <li>It holds so strong, yet rinses out so easily in the shower.  </li>
            <li>No greasy feeling &amp; easy to use.  </li>
            <li>My hair tends to be more &amp;#34;wirey&amp;#34; and need a good solid hold....</li>
            <li>/&gt;This is also Curly Girl friendly, for those who follow that method.  </li>
            <li>It wasn&#x27;t as strong holding as I need for my natural curly hair</li>
            <li>Great (stiff) stuff!</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s pretty pricey through my hairdresser so when I found this deal on Amazon</li>
            <li>love this product and can only find it online</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using the Biosilk gelee for some years and really like it as a hair setting gel when I shampoo my hair.</li>
            <li>i spray on this stuff, after i shake the bottle very well.  </li>
            <li>THANKS A MILLION  </li>
            <li>Was delivered on time at a reasonable cost.</li>
            <li>Once it&#x27;s dry, you can lightly \\&quot;scrunch out the crunch\\&quot; and your hair looks great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It keeps the frizz away in my naturally curly hair in all kinds of weather.  </li>
            <li>This definitely has been the case for me, and this gel really locks my waves in until</li>
            <li>I found this on the naturally curly website.  </li>
            <li>I have been using this product for nearly 4 years.</li>

            <li> I found this on the naturally curly website.  </li>
            <li> I have been using this product for nearly 4 years.</li>
            <li> i think, with long coils vs. fuzz, if I do this routine daily.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never been a big gel user since the few forays into gel are associated in my mind with the tacky, crunchy gel I used to use back when I was a teen in the 80&#x27;s, when Madonna-style, sky-high, crunchy hair was the norm.</li>
            <li> other key is to let the \\&quot;gel cast\\&quot; dry; you don&#x27;t want to touch your hair while it&#x27;s drying, but want to let it set so that it looks crunchy.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;After applying my curl cream products to wet hair, I use this gel to scrunch in my waves.  </li>
            <li> I am using the curlygirl protocol of washing with conditioner and then adding products to wet hair ev.</li>
            <li> I tip upside down, and then apply the gel by raking it and then scrunching.  </li>
            <li> It is getting hard to find.</li>
            <li> They barely have it in stock out there anymore :(</li>
            <li> Father inlaw loves this and it is so difficult to find</li>
            <li> Difficult to find in stores now, unfortunately.  </li>
            <li> I have used it in Caribbean heat and winter cold.  </li>
            <li> It is very difficult finding biosilk gel at store,&lt;br /&gt;it is a bit pricy for gel, but it keeps your hair shining all day.</li>

            <li> Father inlaw loves this and it is so difficult to find</li>
            <li> I love this gel.  It holds so strong, yet rinses out so easily in the shower.  It keeps the frizz away in my naturally curly hair in all kinds of weather.  I have used it in Caribbean heat and winter cold.  It is a wonderful product.  I wouldn&#x27;t wash my hair without a bottle of this in my vanity to style it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never been a big gel user since the few forays into gel are associated in my mind with the tacky, crunchy gel I used to use back when I was a teen in the 80&#x27;s, when Madonna-style, sky-high, crunchy hair was the norm. I had read about this gel on a curly/wavy hair website, though, and decided to try it out -- and I love it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I read on that website is that if you have wavy hair, you need a hard-hold gel to keep the waves in place or they will fall out.  This definitely has been the case for me, and this gel really locks my waves in until I re-wash it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After applying my curl cream products to wet hair, I use this gel to scrunch in my waves.  I tip upside down, and then apply the gel by raking it and then scrunching.  I use about three pea-sized amounts for my shoulder-length hair, and make sure that I emulsify it in my hands before raking it through.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The other key is to let the \\&quot;gel cast\\&quot; dry; you don&#x27;t want to touch your hair while it&#x27;s drying, but want to let it set so that it looks crunchy.  Once it&#x27;s dry, you can lightly \\&quot;scrunch out the crunch\\&quot; and your hair looks great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is also Curly Girl friendly, for those who follow that method.

            <li> This is my fav gel. It&#x27;s perfect and such a great price compared to the stores. They barely have it in stock out there anymore :(</li>
            <li> love this product and can only find it online</li>
            <li> Great (stiff) stuff! Difficult to find in stores now, unfortunately.  Thank you Pharmapacks!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the Biosilk gelee for some years and really like it as a hair setting gel when I shampoo my hair.</li>
            <li> I found this on the naturally curly website.  I am using the curlygirl protocol of washing with conditioner and then adding products to wet hair ev. day.  I mix this with a liquid, Paul Mitchell Sculpting Lotion, and keep it in a spray container in the shower.  Then after I \\&quot;wash\\&quot; hair i spray on this stuff, after i shake the bottle very well.  It provides a \\&quot;base\\&quot; for the curls for rest of the week.  Each day I add more of this, or put some Re-Coil on it, and wrap it up in a T-shirt to absorb the moisture.  My hair is type 3-B i think, with long coils vs. fuzz, if I do this routine daily.</li>
            <li> THIS IS THE  BEST OF THE BEST  FOR HAIR GEL!!!!!!!  DON&#x27;T LOSE IT!  THANKS A MILLION  LOST THIS IN THE STORES AND WHEN I FOUND IT THROUGH AMAZON I WAS IN HEAVEN...........&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;GREATEST EVER!</li>
            <li> Been using for years good price</li>
            <li> I have spiky hair and this product is great.  No greasy feeling &amp; easy to use.  I have used this  product for years and it is the only gel that I like.</li>
            <li> Love this gel...don&#x27;t have to use a lot of the product. And hair still looks good day after. Love it.</li>
            <li> Love the product.  My hair tends to be more &amp;#34;wirey&amp;#34; and need a good solid hold....this gel fits my purpose.  Was delivered on time at a reasonable cost.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for nearly 4 years. It is getting hard to find. Hope it doesnt get discontinued!</li>
