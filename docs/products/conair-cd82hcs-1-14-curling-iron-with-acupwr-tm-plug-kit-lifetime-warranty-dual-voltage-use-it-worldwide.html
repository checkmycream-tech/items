            <li>Came in protective packaging, great communication about shipping status.</li>
            <li>Worked great all throughout Europe.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great that it came with a plug adapter, too.  </li>
            <li>iron worked great.</li>
            <li>It comes with the plugs you will need - very handy.</li>
            <li>Nice iron!  </li>
            <li>Very satisfied.</li>
            <li>Very pleased.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s dual voltage and having the adapters is handy.</li>
            <li>I wish I would have read more of the reviews s before ordering this product.  </li>
            <li>Used this item in Italy, France and Spain - perfect loved it and used it everyday.</li>
            <li>so I hope to be able to use it whenever I travel out of the US.</li>
            <li>The quality is not as high as my nicer curling iron, but it worked great for its intended purpose.</li>
            <li>I left looking great most days, but the humidity and the many miles walked every day</li>
            <li>I thought everything was fine, packed the iron and adapters in my suitcase and flew to Greece for a 8 day vacation.  </li>
            <li>Worked for me while I was traveling - it didn&#x27;t heat up as much as I would&#x27;ve liked but it eventually got the job done.</li>
            <li>Neither of the adapters that came with the curling iron fit into the sockets at my resort.  </li>
            <li>The converter that came with iron fit the outlet, but plug kept falling out of converter which caused it to shut off.  </li>
            <li>Converter plug is a good idea, but it keeps falling out - not a tight fit.</li>
            <li>It did work better if I used the button on the right, adding heat.  </li>
            <li>The double voltage setting is very handy.</li>
            <li>The dial could have been placed in a better spot and who really needs 25 settings?</li>
            <li>I figured, given the higher voltage, that it would work fine overseas.</li>
            <li>It heated up quickly and made my hair look like I wanted it to look.</li>
            <li>- I got it for international travel - I&#x27;m sure it will be fine</li>
            <li>Also, this kind of dual-voltage Conair curling iron can actually be bought in stores.  </li>
            <li>I purchased a better converter which fixed the problem and</li>
            <li>Did not properly measure the barrel of my current curling iron, so this new one is too large, but it will be perfect for a friend who also travels to Europe.</li>
            <li>Does not get that hot.</li>
            <li>and this iron gets hot but does not burn my hair.</li>
            <li>It looks exactly like what I want</li>
            <li>I am very picky about curling irons but this one passes the test!</li>
            <li>It is always unusually difficult to find a curling iron for purchase overseas, so having your own is really nice.</li>
            <li>Easy to use, comes with a voltage package so you can use it internationally, which is why I bought it.</li>
            <li>When I got back to the USA, I got back on line and read some of the reviews for this produce, and Come to find out, I&#x27;m not the only one who experienced the loose fitting plug.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommended!</li>
            <li>With this product, the heating worked well, it heated up quickly and cooled down quickly as well.  </li>
            <li>I ordered this particular iron because it was advertised as coming with adapters for use in Europe.  </li>
            <li>However there are 25 heat settings on a dial very near to where your thumb rests while curling your hair.</li>
            <li>I used it once at home in the States and it did not get remotely hot enough there.</li>
            <li>Tried it for the first time today and it still did next to nothing for my hair.</li>
            <li>Hoping it had a two prong cord not an adaptor a little cheaply made but worked</li>
            <li>I have ruined an expensive curling iron in Europe before using an adapter, and it was nice not to have to worry about that.</li>
            <li>The first time I plugged the black adapter into the electric socket and the plugged my curling iron in, the plug would not stay into the adaptor.  </li>

            <li> I ordered this particular iron because it was advertised as coming with adapters for use in Europe.  When it came, the product #&#x27;s did not match, and the price was $12 over the price indicated on my prime account.  I contacted the seller and he reassured me that this iron would work in Europe even though the numbers were different.  He also agreed to credit me the $12.00 through my credit card. I thought everything was fine, packed the iron and adapters in my suitcase and flew to Greece for a 8 day vacation.  The first time I plugged the black adapter into the electric socket and the plugged my curling iron in, the plug would not stay into the adaptor.  It was so loose, I had to hold the plugs together with one hand and try to curl my hair with the other.  By the third day of our vacation, I got some duct tape from the hotel and taped the two plugs together.  This still only worked half the time, and I was very frustrated.  When I got back to the USA, I got back on line and read some of the reviews for this produce, and Come to find out, I&#x27;m not the only one who experienced the loose fitting plug.  I wish I would have read more of the reviews s before ordering this product.  Would I order from this company again?????? NOOOOOOOO!</li>
            <li> i purchased this for a trip to peru.  it got the job done - it was dual voltage.  however, the plug did not fit snugly into the accompanying plug kit - it kept pulling out.  also, you can tell an immediate difference in quality between this barrel and the more expensive ceramic ones..  i will keep this curling iron around for my next out-of-country trip, but other than that, i will never use it.</li>
            <li> Immediately sending back. It came with NO plug kit, which is the key reason I purchased. This curling iron costs $12.97 at Target, without plug kit ....</li>
            <li> Works great. It&#x27;s dual voltage and having the adapters is handy.</li>
            <li> I bought this before a recent trip to Spain.  In past trips, I have had frequent problems with getting the heating elements to work properly.  With this product, the heating worked well, it heated up quickly and cooled down quickly as well.  Very satisfied.</li>
            <li> Does not get that hot.</li>
            <li> wife is taking her curling iron to Italy,  Used it here at home worked great.  Wife is happy with unit</li>
            <li> [[VIDEOID:9556c2c4c0bc18529c74f5b42e806e74]]In the video I demonstrate curling my hair with this product.  This works in 110 as well as 220.  I took it to Norway and it worked great.  I use it every day in the states.  I have thick hair that has natural curl and this iron gets hot but does not burn my hair.</li>
            <li> Hoping it had a two prong cord not an adaptor a little cheaply made but worked</li>
            <li> Converter plug is a good idea, but it keeps falling out - not a tight fit.</li>
            <li> Worked great in Israel and Rome with and adapter.</li>
            <li> I should have listened to the other reviews. The plug does not stay in this adapter or any adapter for European outlets.</li>
            <li> Bought this to use in Europe and their 220 volt  system.......but it wouldn&#x27;t work.  Still had to use a converter!</li>
            <li> I am a user of an Instyler for nine years. at least. This, being 1 1/4 inch barrel, did a great job for me for 12 days in Italy!  It did work better if I used the button on the right, adding heat.  I have naturally curly hair, that is thick and frizzy.  I left looking great most days, but the humidity and the many miles walked every day did allow my hair to not look so great as the day wore on.  However, that is NOT the fault of the curling iron!  I was concerned when there was not a slot to switch from 120 to 240, but it worked great by just using a power adapter plug!</li>
            <li> Actually haven&#x27;t used it yet - I got it for international travel - I&#x27;m sure it will be fine</li>
            <li> Did not properly measure the barrel of my current curling iron, so this new one is too large, but it will be perfect for a friend who also travels to Europe. I have ordered the same product in a smaller barrel size for myself. Came in protective packaging, great communication about shipping status. Very pleased.</li>
            <li> Worked great all throughout Europe. The quality is not as high as my nicer curling iron, but it worked great for its intended purpose. I have ruined an expensive curling iron in Europe before using an adapter, and it was nice not to have to worry about that. I will definitely keep it in my travel kit for my next trip, or to use as a backup. It is always unusually difficult to find a curling iron for purchase overseas, so having your own is really nice. Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> Worked for me while I was traveling - it didn&#x27;t heat up as much as I would&#x27;ve liked but it eventually got the job done.</li>
            <li> Nice iron!  Very satisfied!</li>
            <li> This did not work.  I bought this to take to St. Lucia because the property at which I was staying had &amp;#34;UK&amp;#34; style outlets.  Neither of the adapters that came with the curling iron fit into the sockets at my resort.  What a disappointment.</li>
            <li> It did what it was supposed to do.  I just spent two weeks in Ireland with it, and no converter was needed.  It heated up quickly and made my hair look like I wanted it to look.</li>
            <li> Used this item in Italy, France and Spain - perfect loved it and used it everyday. Would recommend to anyone.</li>
            <li> The double voltage setting is very handy. However there are 25 heat settings on a dial very near to where your thumb rests while curling your hair. Often that results in the dial moving down and having to be reset. The dial could have been placed in a better spot and who really needs 25 settings? Also the clip on which the iron stands gave away in a relatively short period of time.</li>
            <li> We needed a dual voltage curling iron and this worked well on our trip to Ireland.  It comes with the plugs you will need - very handy.</li>
            <li> Turned to the highest setting, and with the turbo setting engaged, this curling iron doesn&#x27;t not get remotely hot enough to curl my thick hair. I bought it specifically because it was dual voltage and I travel overseas quite a bit. I used it once at home in the States and it did not get remotely hot enough there. I figured, given the higher voltage, that it would work fine overseas. Tried it for the first time today and it still did next to nothing for my hair.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used it yet, but I bought it for an international trip based on a recommendation.  It&#x27;s great that it came with a plug adapter, too.  I can&#x27;t wait to use it.</li>
            <li> I bought this to bring on a trip this summer since I wanted something dual-voltage.  It looks exactly like what I want so I hope to be able to use it whenever I travel out of the US.</li>
            <li> I am very picky about curling irons but this one passes the test! Easy to use, comes with a voltage package so you can use it internationally, which is why I bought it. You don&#x27;t have to worry about what type of plug they use in another country, because this &amp;#34;travel pack&amp;#34; includes all of them!</li>
            <li> Does it all automatically.  Used in UK and Czech Republic with no problems.</li>
            <li> the adapter provided is useless, the curling iron plug falls out , it has to be taped ..</li>
            <li> I like this because the curling part is shorter than others.</li>
            <li> This was a little larger than I expected.  Also, this kind of dual-voltage Conair curling iron can actually be bought in stores.  I have a smaller version that I didn&#x27;t realize is dual-voltage until I saw the same markings on it as this one.  Conair makes a convenient product.</li>
            <li> The converter that came with iron fit the outlet, but plug kept falling out of converter which caused it to shut off.  I purchased a better converter which fixed the problem and iron worked great.</li>
