    <ol>
            <li>But the \\&quot;Speed Cream\\&quot; works great!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s Fair!</li>
            <li>I then bought Phillips Norelco&#x27;s Body Groomer, which works great.  </li>
            <li>So I found a happy medium.  </li>
            <li>It works great.</li>
            <li>I would recommend you stick with the classics if you want a successful hair removal process.</li>
            <li>The instructions tell you to spread the cream in your hand and then spread it to the desired area, and wash your hands IMMEDIATELY after, and for good reason: The smell.</li>
            <li>for the price it&#x27;s good</li>
            <li>I tried this because it was a good deal.</li>
            <li>and I used about a fairly good amount.</li>
            <li>This stuff works great, does the job nicely, but you do need to leave it on longer than the instructions state...</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried even about 8 minutes, and it still wasn&#x27;t completely effective.  </li>
            <li>Just be sure to use a good blob of it and it will work</li>
            <li>Delivery is great, and the smell is not bad.</li>
            <li>Also, make sure to apply liberally.  </li>
            <li>but anyway it&#x27;s okay</li>
            <li>don&#x27;t leave it more than 3-6 minutes and take a shower immediately after using this product.</li>
            <li>The hair won&#x27;t just magically fall off or dissolve.</li>
            <li>I tried it and the odor is very mild compared to the women&#x27;s hair remover on the market.</li>
            <li>stopped using the Nair for a while, and I only used my body groomer, which was great for my chest, but for my nether region, it worked, but it was nerve-wracking to do because it&#x27;s a freaking razor</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a light hairy type .</li>
            <li>I bought it because it is for men and made by a pretty reputable company.  </li>
            <li>but I like to be clean from any hair on my body.</li>
            <li>It removes hair in such a nice way :)</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s true to its name--Speed Cream.</li>
            <li>I bought this as a skeptic, and am now writing this as a loyal customer.</li>
            <li>I recommend this hair remover for both men and women as it is mild in odor and mild on the skin too.</li>
            <li>Even with that said, it&#x27;s a great product, and I&#x27;ll definitely be buying more in the future.</li>
            <li>, then I just lather up some Nair for Men Speed Cream down there, and it works great.  </li>
            <li>, all I do is put the stuff on for 15 minutes, and I&#x27;m golden.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li>Follow the instructions to the T, and you&#x27;ll rinse all of that hair right off.    </li>
            <li>Use it EXACTLY as directed and it will take all the hair away.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never tried hair removal before so this was my first time.</li>
            <li>I use Nair Shower Power for most of my body and decided to give this a go when it was on sale in a local store.</li>
            <li>The first go-round</li>
            <li>I followed the directions exactly and the product didn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li>I feel the quantity of the cream in the can could be reusable probably more than 3 or even 4 times, but only if you expect to use it for 1 or maybe 2 body parts.</li>
            <li>Ships fast!</li>
            <li>well it will definitely take more than 3 minutes.</li>
            <li>You will need to gently pull a bit on the hair BUT don&#x27;t worry, it doesn&#x27;t hurt even a bit!</li>
            <li>will actually help more than pulling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I think it says 3-5 minutes, it needs 10+ to be done the first time.</li>
            <li>instead I feel I had to re-apply some cream to certain areas because of the thickness of my hair.</li>
            <li>I got some on my side and there&#x27;s a huge red blister like bump.</li>
            <li>Now I don&#x27;t shave my whole body all the time.  </li>
            <li>It removes hair fast and painlessly.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not that I used too much,</li>
            <li>didn&#x27;t have that much hair to remove</li>
            <li>Great, but did not last long enough.</li>
            <li>and I might have done something wrong, but from what I see so far, I won&#x27;t be surprised that this is the best it can do.</li>
            <li>It won&#x27;t reek so that others can smell it, but it&#x27;ll last a good few hours (or even a day) before it goes away.</li>
            <li>Since then, I have made sure to only put the Nair on my twig&#x27;n&#x27;berries and not get any near my back end.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It was as useful at hair removal as if I had left shampoo on my body for 10 minutes.</li>
            <li>it was only my first try</li>
            <li>After 12-15 minutes, it starts burning just slightly, but it never hurts, and I&#x27;m fine after I wash the Nair off.  </li>
            <li>A razor provides a much closer shave, this thing left a lot of stubble on me.</li>
            <li>It can be kind of irritating at times.</li>
            <li>If your hair is THICK expect to use more.</li>
            <li>It took me about 10 to remove completely everything but about 6 minutes for the hair to actually start to be removed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I even left it on for 15 minutes and it barely removed any chest hair.</li>
            <li>No burn (which I was definitely expecting past the 10 minute mark), no irritation, but most importantly no hair removal.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> The can was empty!</li>
            <li> Other than that, this 5.4 oz does the trick.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s for other parts of your body.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not worth it.</li>
            <li> *ahem* down</li>
            <li> that&#x27;s being used down there.  </li>
            <li> but down there with my body groomer</li>
            <li> , I cannot guarantee that it won&#x27;t burn you down there if you put it on, but it didn&#x27;t for me . . .</li>
            <li> The other reason that I gave this product three stars is that it will take small and not strong hair.</li>
            <li> Harsh on skin causing rash like bumps...</li>
            <li> I usually put it on for about 15 minutes.  </li>
            <li> I followed my usual routine of buzzing with an electric trimmer (no guard) and then applying the product.</li>
            <li> Not sure if it&#x27;s a chemical burn or not,</li>
            <li> at least not after 15 minutes.  </li>
            <li> If you try to take hair that is really thick not all or maybe nothing at all will come out.</li>
            <li> But you have to use it regularly and does not prevent regrowth which is too bad.  </li>
            <li> I got sick of having a hairy back.  </li>
            <li> Fifteen works without fail for me.  </li>
            <li> And the smell isn&#x27;t THAT bad when using it.</li>
            <li> This hurts really bad.</li>
            <li> I did that, and it was immediately painful.  </li>
            <li> I used this product and was disappointed.</li>
            <li> Even Stink would say that stinks!</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> This product works just as it claims. Use it EXACTLY as directed and it will take all the hair away. Tried the nair \\&quot;Body Cream\\&quot; did not work, sent it back. But the \\&quot;Speed Cream\\&quot; works great!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never tried hair removal before so this was my first time. I&#x27;m not a hairy guy but I like to be clean from any hair on my body. I used this product and was disappointed. A razor provides a much closer shave, this thing left a lot of stubble on me. Granted it was only my first try and I might have done something wrong, but from what I see so far, I won&#x27;t be surprised that this is the best it can do. It&#x27;s not worth it. Also, the smell it leaves on you after wards...I thought it would go away after a shower, but it stays with you!</li>
            <li> I have yet to try the regular Nair cream, but I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll have to, because this stuff works wonders! Follow the instructions to the T, and you&#x27;ll rinse all of that hair right off.    The only con I can think of is the smell. And the smell isn&#x27;t THAT bad when using it. It sort of smells like hair dye, and isn&#x27;t that unbearable. However, where the smell kills you is your hands. The instructions tell you to spread the cream in your hand and then spread it to the desired area, and wash your hands IMMEDIATELY after, and for good reason: The smell. It won&#x27;t reek so that others can smell it, but it&#x27;ll last a good few hours (or even a day) before it goes away. But, in hindsight, that probably could&#x27;ve been remedied with a pair of disposable gloves.    Even with that said, it&#x27;s a great product, and I&#x27;ll definitely be buying more in the future. I bought this as a skeptic, and am now writing this as a loyal customer.</li>
            <li> I got it &#x27;cuz I got sick of having a hairy back.  Doesn&#x27;t do diddly squat. And the STINK!! UGH! It could gag a maggot! Even Stink would say that stinks! It takes almost a week to get rid of the ...STINK! Wash all ya want....doesn&#x27;t help.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this stuff for years, and it&#x27;s always worked well for me.  I first started using it for my whole body, but I found that to be incredibly expensive.  I then bought Phillips Norelco&#x27;s Body Groomer, which works great.  Now I don&#x27;t shave my whole body all the time.  Only when I plan on competing in a bodybuilding competition.  Otherwise, I just shave my chest and *ahem* down there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I stopped using the Nair for a while, and I only used my body groomer, which was great for my chest, but for my nether region, it worked, but it was nerve-wracking to do because it&#x27;s a freaking razor that&#x27;s being used down there.  So I found a happy medium.  I shave everywhere but down there with my body groomer, then I just lather up some Nair for Men Speed Cream down there, and it works great.  But it doesn&#x27;t work in just 3 minutes.  Not even close.  I usually put it on for about 15 minutes.  Yes, 15.  I&#x27;ve tried even about 8 minutes, and it still wasn&#x27;t completely effective.  Fifteen works without fail for me.  Also, make sure to apply liberally.  Don&#x27;t skimp out on using this stuff.  Lather that junk.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, I cannot guarantee that it won&#x27;t burn you down there if you put it on, but it didn&#x27;t for me . . . at least not after 15 minutes.  After 12-15 minutes, it starts burning just slightly, but it never hurts, and I&#x27;m fine after I wash the Nair off.  That&#x27;s just my experience.  Also, DO NOT put this on your gooch.  I did that, and it was immediately painful.  Since then, I have made sure to only put the Nair on my twig&#x27;n&#x27;berries and not get any near my back end.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the end, all I do is put the stuff on for 15 minutes, and I&#x27;m golden.  It works great.</li>
            <li> for the price it&#x27;s good but it&#x27;s not working properly but anyway it&#x27;s okay I will try some different procuts next time.</li>
            <li> Great, but did not last long enough.</li>
            <li> I use Nair Shower Power for most of my body and decided to give this a go when it was on sale in a local store. I followed my usual routine of buzzing with an electric trimmer (no guard) and then applying the product. The first go-round I followed the directions exactly and the product didn&#x27;t work. The second time I left the product on for just over 10 minutes and still nothing happened. Literally nothing. No burn (which I was definitely expecting past the 10 minute mark), no irritation, but most importantly no hair removal. It was as useful at hair removal as if I had left shampoo on my body for 10 minutes. I would recommend you stick with the classics if you want a successful hair removal process.</li>
            <li> I bought it because it is for men and made by a pretty reputable company.  But you have to use it regularly and does not prevent regrowth which is too bad.  Anyway, I am giving No No a try to see how that works.</li>
            <li> Used for chest. It can be kind of irritating at times. I got some on my side and there&#x27;s a huge red blister like bump. Not sure if it&#x27;s a chemical burn or not, but it&#x27;s beem there for some time.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my boyfriend and he raved about it. I tried it and the odor is very mild compared to the women&#x27;s hair remover on the market. It&#x27;s true to its name--Speed Cream. It removes hair fast and painlessly. I will always order this from here. It&#x27;s worth it. I recommend this hair remover for both men and women as it is mild in odor and mild on the skin too. And it takes 3 minutes as it states. Thank you Nair for Men!!</li>
            <li> Its boss! It works! And the smell is not that. I dont know what people are complaining about.</li>
            <li> This stuff just DOES NOT WORK!!! I&#x27;ve always used the regular Nair For Men Body Cream which has always worked well for me. I tried this because it was a good deal. It didn&#x27;t work at all. I even left it on for 15 minutes and it barely removed any chest hair. It&#x27;s garbage!</li>
            <li> Couldn&#x27;t get this product out of the bottle. Either way, the effort got me laid!!! Give it a try brothers!!</li>
            <li> Harsh on skin causing rash like bumps...</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s Fair! Delivery is great, and the smell is not bad. However, the quantity of the cream may not be enough depending on how you want to use it. For example, I used it one time for back, chest and legs. And that&#x27;s it! The can was empty! It&#x27;s not that I used too much, instead I feel I had to re-apply some cream to certain areas because of the thickness of my hair. If your hair is THICK expect to use more. I feel the quantity of the cream in the can could be reusable probably more than 3 or even 4 times, but only if you expect to use it for 1 or maybe 2 body parts. Other than that, this 5.4 oz does the trick. It removes hair in such a nice way :)</li>
            <li> I bought this product to shave my face but this product is not meant for your face. It&#x27;s for other parts of your body. I you want to shave your personal area don&#x27;t leave it more than 3-6 minutes and take a shower immediately after using this product. The reason is that it will start to burn and eat your skin. This hurts really bad. The other reason that I gave this product three stars is that it will take small and not strong hair. If you try to take hair that is really thick not all or maybe nothing at all will come out. Hope this helps.</li>
            <li> Ships fast! Definitely will buy again when my bottle runs out&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Okay well it will definitely take more than 3 minutes. It took me about 10 to remove completely everything but about 6 minutes for the hair to actually start to be removed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*NOTE* The hair won&#x27;t just magically fall off or dissolve. You will need to gently pull a bit on the hair BUT don&#x27;t worry, it doesn&#x27;t hurt even a bit! (I&#x27;m saying this because some people said it wasn&#x27;t working for them) OR you can go into the shower and water will actually help more than pulling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t have that much hair to remove and I used about a fairly good amount. In comparison, probably the size of 10 marbles? Just be sure to use a good blob of it and it will work just fine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great product!</li>
            <li> I planned to shave my chest with this cream. I&#x27;m a light hairy type . I left it for about 3 min as instructed and still didn&#x27;t do any thing. Actually I had to throw it away</li>
            <li> ..This stuff works great, does the job nicely, but you do need to leave it on longer than the instructions state... I think it says 3-5 minutes, it needs 10+ to be done the first time.</li>
