            <li>I use it in my lotions and it even came in handy when i burned my hand making my lotion!</li>
            <li>I going order more soon again !!! :)</li>
            <li>I intend to try to dilute it with another oil (perhaps one that smells pleasant) and see if that helps with the smell and the bug attractant qualities.</li>
            <li>manageble.&lt;br /&gt;Seller has a really good product.  </li>
            <li>Good quality too.</li>
            <li>But it is good, or neutral.</li>
            <li>Good product.</li>
            <li>no smell, goes on clean and absorbs into my hair wonderfully.</li>

            <li>and I LOVE IT!  </li>
            <li>plus I purchased a papaya soap bar and the two together are amazing</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s kind of a grassy, nutty smell, maybe a bit like hay.</li>
            <li>The bottle itself kind of seeps around the opening,</li>
            <li>It is a wonderful product and works very well in recipes for moisturizing treatments.</li>
            <li>This oil is amazing for many uses.</li>
            <li>oil works some kind of magic for my hair.  </li>
            <li>I also heard that it&#x27;s good to clean out your system, but I know you can also make it into a salad dressing and use it in food.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d say that is a major and wonderful skin transformation!</li>
            <li>This oil is light, and could easily be used in a salad, but is also wonderful for the skin, very healing.  </li>
            <li>I love oils</li>
            <li>Great product with fast shipping.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m pleased with this product.</li>

            <li>I USE THIS PRODUCT IN THE MIDST OF MY HOMEMADE SHAMPOOS, AND I LOVE THE RESULTS IT GIVES MY PRODUCTS.</li>
            <li>I love this item.</li>
            <li>This is my favorite oil.  </li>
            <li>I buy a lot of oils from Dr Adorable and have been pleased with all.</li>
            <li>The packaging could&#x27;ve been better...</li>
            <li>II really love this product and have plans to order it again and again.  </li>
            <li>you will love the quality</li>
            <li>Lovely product: I would suggest you put that this is Hemp SEED oil on your label</li>
            <li>Feels great, doesn&#x27;t clog my pores and really hydrates my skin while keeping breakouts at bay.</li>
            <li>Love this oil.</li>
            <li>I love it,  </li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve tried many oils on my hair</li>
            <li>This just arrived today and I was very excited to use it.</li>
            <li>The oil is very hydrating and of good quality.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hemp</li>
            <li>This is a high quality oil for the skin and is full of all sorts of great vitamins and minerals and antioxidants.  </li>
            <li>found the ordering process easy and processional without issues.</li>
            <li>Very good for dry skin.</li>
            <li>and I can feel and see a huge difference</li>
            <li>and It was nutty and smooth on my skin.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s such a great flavor.</li>
            <li>It is amazing, I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li>Regardless, hemp seed makes a great oil, especially when you have oily acne-prone skin</li>
            <li>It has a nutty flavor that&#x27;s very distinct.</li>
            <li>I also know that sometimes certain oils can smell really offensive to some people while others find them pleasant.</li>
            <li>Great for dry skin, for eye lashes, to make them grow fuller, and for keeping the skin youthful and glowing.</li>
            <li>I loved the effect instantly, your hair immediatly feels frizz free.</li>
            <li>I then use a dime to quarter size amount (depending on how long I can let it soak in before bed) as a moisturizer at night, and my face looks and feels amazing in the mornings!</li>
            <li>Thanks Dr. Adorable.</li>
            <li>a quick warning about Hemp Seed oil--you need to refrigerate it, or else it will spoil after about a month.</li>
            <li>Mine seems fresh and does not smell like fish *whatsoever</li>
            <li>I use it on my face, arms and legs and my skin has improved better than with many other beauty products.</li>
            <li>I dot not agree with the pleasant nutty smelll, the smell is actually the only thing that bothers me about this oil and it does not go away very quickly.</li>
            <li>However, it also sinks into skin easily, it doesn&#x27;t just sit on top of your skin.</li>
            <li>It is also effective for dry chapped hands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Apparently the bugs really seemed to find it appealing because I soon found myself being chased around the yard by a swarm of knats.</li>
            <li>This is my first buying from this vendor/brand and I must say the product is truly everything it entails.</li>
            <li>If you have ever eaten hemp seeds (aka hemp hearts), this oil smells exactly like hemp seeds, and nothing else.</li>
            <li>my skin is starting to have a healthy glow I will order again.</li>
            <li>used it for the first time added much needed shine to my hair after not using anything for a couple of days</li>
            <li>I rarely have any pimples now since I&#x27;ve been using this, and since I have had continuous breakouts for nearly fifteen years, that&#x27;s saying something!</li>
            <li>Fast Delivery</li>
            <li>Very moisturizing</li>
            <li>PLASTIC is VERY toxic.</li>
            <li>I really enjoy using this as a facial moisturizer.</li>
            <li>The shipping speed was fast, and the bottle it arrived in seals well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>But this is the least of my worries since Ii can mix it with a drop of essentiel oil and I am good.</li>
            <li>I use it in a soap ,already , leave your skin soft , going to use it in lotions soon too !!</li>
            <li>and I was also pleased to find that it absorbed quickly and made my skin super soft and silky, BUT I began to detect a slightly unpleasant smell coming from my hands.</li>
            <li>I finally cut it with some EVOO in hopes I wouldn&#x27;t nearly gag when I used it, but it was still pretty pungent.</li>
            <li>Still waiting to see if it completely clears it up.</li>
            <li>Purchased to use in my natural hair read about its medicinal qualities.</li>
            <li>I use it for dipping bread now, after olive oil and balsamic got old.</li>
            <li>It is very moisturizing, with a consistency similar to olive oil.</li>
            <li>but I have been using it in my hair and it makes my hair really soft and also my hands</li>
            <li>I am 4a natural of two years in February 2013</li>
            <li>Sometimes if my face is dry during the winter, I use this as a day time moisturizer too, but I&#x27;m very oily and am not sure if I will be able to continue using it during the day come summer.</li>
            <li>The scent is natural and woodsy, not flowery and pretty, which can be good or bad depending on one&#x27;s taste.</li>
            <li>And when I rubbed it into my sore back, it helped better than the usual rubs you find in the drug store.</li>
            <li>I put a generous amount on my face and let it sit, run a washcloth under hot water, ring it out and lay it on my face for a few seconds and then gently exfoliate the oil off my face.</li>
            <li>I add few drops of lavender oil and apply for few minutes to the area, it has so many vitamins got skin!</li>
            <li>It caused my previously clear chin to become covered with red flaky areas and cystic pimples.</li>
            <li>U don&#x27;t need much if your face/skin is wet</li>
            <li>I do not know what it does, barely use it.</li>
            <li>Funny what the other reviews said about the different scent.  </li>
            <li>I think next time I&#x27;ll use a blend or look into adding essential oil to it because I&#x27;m sensitive to smells.</li>
            <li>Not to mention, it&#x27;s organic cold pressed and who doesn&#x27;t love that?!</li>
            <li>For those not familiar, the oil has a distinctive green color, and does have a very distinct plant/organic odor, like lawn/grass clippings.</li>
            <li>I chose not to give this a bad rating because I actually loved the way it made my skin feel.</li>

            <li> I use occasionally as a pre shampoo treatment, and other times as a frizz serum.  </li>
            <li> I have natural 4a type of hair.thanks to this oil, no more use of heat on my hair to get rid of the frizze after my wash.</li>

            <li> The smell is apparent, but not overwhelming or nauseating.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Purchased this product because we heard it is great for skin conditions.  Have used it now for over 3 weeks, had some improvement. Still waiting to see if it completely clears it up.</li>
            <li> It did the job.. I mean it&#x27;s all I use now.. I don&#x27;t use lotion on my face I just put this on when I get out the shower.. U don&#x27;t need much if your face/skin is wet</li>
            <li> used it for the first time added much needed shine to my hair after not using anything for a couple of days</li>
            <li> This just arrived today and I was very excited to use it. I opened it up and was not surprised at the somewhat earthy and nutty smell. I decided to put some on my hands and I was also pleased to find that it absorbed quickly and made my skin super soft and silky, BUT I began to detect a slightly unpleasant smell coming from my hands. The best I can describe it is fishy with a hint of egg yolk. I tried to ignore the smell as I was outside with my daughter and did not feel like going in to wash my hands. However, soon it was all I could smell and I could no longer ignore it. Apparently the bugs really seemed to find it appealing because I soon found myself being chased around the yard by a swarm of knats. Not only did I wash my hands, I also took a shower since I had touched my hair and could smell it even after the hand washing. I chose not to give this a bad rating because I actually loved the way it made my skin feel. I intend to try to dilute it with another oil (perhaps one that smells pleasant) and see if that helps with the smell and the bug attractant qualities. I also know that sometimes certain oils can smell really offensive to some people while others find them pleasant.</li>
            <li> This oil is light, and could easily be used in a salad, but is also wonderful for the skin, very healing.  And when I rubbed it into my sore back, it helped better than the usual rubs you find in the drug store.</li>
            <li> Fast Delivery and It was nutty and smooth on my skin. Very moisturizing and it transformed my skin within a week.&lt;br /&gt;I will re-purchase and continue to buy other oils from his line. I&#x27;m impressed. I love oils and I&#x27;ve found the place&lt;br /&gt;to buy them. Thanks Dr. Adorable.</li>
            <li> This oil is great for massage as it does the trick well, yet doesn&#x27;t stain any fabrics. The scent is natural and woodsy, not flowery and pretty, which can be good or bad depending on one&#x27;s taste.</li>
            <li> This makes my hair and skin feel amazing!!!&lt;br /&gt;Need more!!&amp;#60;3</li>
            <li> This is my first buying from this vendor/brand and I must say the product is truly everything it entails. Great product with fast shipping.</li>
            <li> One star because it is in a plastic bottle so it surely is not pure. PLASTIC is VERY toxic. What a joke.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pleased with this product. It can be used externally and internal. I&#x27;ll be ordering more. But I&#x27;ll be buying a much larger bottle this time</li>
            <li> This is for your skin and hair it will give your skin and hair the nutrient that thy need and keep it healthy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend it.</li>
            <li> I USE THIS PRODUCT IN THE MIDST OF MY HOMEMADE SHAMPOOS, AND I LOVE THE RESULTS IT GIVES MY PRODUCTS.</li>
            <li> Thank you for having quality Wicca products an items that is hard to find. I love this item.</li>
            <li> Winter is harsh, and this product keeps the moisture locked in for 3 days!!! I paired it with the avocado butter from Dr. Adorable and walah! magic!</li>
            <li> After almost a week there&#x27;s been no change in my eczema and I had a decent previous experience with cannabis oil. I&#x27;m going to keep trying and hopefully find some relief after five years of this disease!</li>
            <li> Purchased to use in my natural hair read about its medicinal qualities. Have not used yet so verdict is still out</li>
            <li> Its a little pricy for what you get. it came with the cap broken but it was still Ok.</li>
            <li> Got this for my dreadlocks - love it! no smell, goes on clean and absorbs into my hair wonderfully. I will be buying this again.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite oil.  Great for OCM (rates 0 on pore clogging scale)&lt;br /&gt;Fantastic for hair (loaded with ceramides)  I use occasionally as a pre shampoo treatment, and other times as a frizz serum.  Just 2 drops makes hair shiny and manageble.&lt;br /&gt;Seller has a really good product.  I buy a lot of oils from Dr Adorable and have been pleased with all.</li>
            <li> This Hemp seed oil is everything as advertised.  I use it on my face, arms and legs and my skin has improved better than with many other beauty products.</li>
            <li> attempted to use as a facial moisturized because it is supposed to be non-comodogenic.  It caused my previously clear chin to become covered with red flaky areas and cystic pimples.</li>
            <li> The packaging could&#x27;ve been better...not Dan of plasticky. However hemp oil is seems to to only hood for my acne prone skin. I add few drops of lavender oil and apply for few minutes to the area, it has so many vitamins got skin!</li>
            <li> I love this! I use it for dipping bread now, after olive oil and balsamic got old. It&#x27;s such a great flavor. Good quality too. The size was perfect for me to test it out and see if I liked it. It has a nutty flavor that&#x27;s very distinct.</li>
            <li> Great quality hemp seed oil.  Funny what the other reviews said about the different scent.  I grew up in the 60&#x27;s and &#x27;70&#x27;s and it smells like hemp - cannabis sativa.  This is a high quality oil for the skin and is full of all sorts of great vitamins and minerals and antioxidants.  Great for the skin.  II really love this product and have plans to order it again and again.  It will be added to my hand-milled soaps too.  Great for dry skin, for eye lashes, to make them grow fuller, and for keeping the skin youthful and glowing. Great for the hair also.  Wonderul product.  Dr Adorable certainly is aptly named!</li>
            <li> I was taking this for my skin health. I also heard that it&#x27;s good to clean out your system, but I know you can also make it into a salad dressing and use it in food.</li>
            <li> AAA+++ what is supposed to be</li>
            <li> This oil is very good</li>
            <li> you will love the quality</li>
            <li> This hemp seed oil is great! It is very moisturizing, with a consistency similar to olive oil. However, it also sinks into skin easily, it doesn&#x27;t just sit on top of your skin. I really enjoy using this as a facial moisturizer. It is also effective for dry chapped hands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There were a few comments here who said that their oil smelled like fish. I disagree. They may have just gotten a bad batch. Mine seems fresh and does not smell like fish *whatsoever*. If you have ever eaten hemp seeds (aka hemp hearts), this oil smells exactly like hemp seeds, and nothing else. Just hemp! It&#x27;s kind of a grassy, nutty smell, maybe a bit like hay. But it is good, or neutral. It is not a gross/bad smell at all. The smell is apparent, but not overwhelming or nauseating. I doubt anyone sitting next to you could smell it on you unless you drenched yourself in it. I dislike strongly-scented things but this hemp oil does not give me any problems and there is no reason to be scared off of buying it because some are saying it&#x27;s &amp;#34;smelly.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> Lovely product: I would suggest you put that this is Hemp SEED oil on your label [my product only states that it is Hemp Oil...]. For those not familiar, the oil has a distinctive green color, and does have a very distinct plant/organic odor, like lawn/grass clippings.</li>
            <li> great stuff hope it has no thc though because I do work for a living.</li>
            <li> Does not really have a smell but I have been using it in my hair and it makes my hair really soft and also my hands</li>
            <li> Everything I expected is what I got. This oil is amazing for many uses. I use it in my lotions and it even came in handy when i burned my hand making my lotion! It is amazing, I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> I used it before this is a reorder</li>
            <li> I use it in a soap ,already , leave your skin soft , going to use it in lotions soon too !! I going order more soon again !!! :)</li>
            <li> The product is great.  helps take away the itchyness of my psoriasis.  The bottle itself kind of seeps around the opening,</li>
            <li> I use this to wash my face when I wear makeup. Feels great, doesn&#x27;t clog my pores and really hydrates my skin while keeping breakouts at bay. Not to mention, it&#x27;s organic cold pressed and who doesn&#x27;t love that?!</li>
            <li> I use hemp seed oil in a body lotion that I make. It is a wonderful product and works very well in recipes for moisturizing treatments.</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing! Very good for dry skin.</li>
            <li> I use this as the final step of my beauty regimen after my makeup removing towlettes and cold cream steps. I put a generous amount on my face and let it sit, run a washcloth under hot water, ring it out and lay it on my face for a few seconds and then gently exfoliate the oil off my face. I then use a dime to quarter size amount (depending on how long I can let it soak in before bed) as a moisturizer at night, and my face looks and feels amazing in the mornings! Sometimes if my face is dry during the winter, I use this as a day time moisturizer too, but I&#x27;m very oily and am not sure if I will be able to continue using it during the day come summer. I rarely have any pimples now since I&#x27;ve been using this, and since I have had continuous breakouts for nearly fifteen years, that&#x27;s saying something! I&#x27;d say that is a major and wonderful skin transformation!</li>
            <li> This oil has a nutty like smell.  My skin feels silky after using this oil. I use on my face and body</li>
            <li> Organic. and smells wonderful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Arrived ontime. Good product. I would purchse again from Dr.Adorable.&lt;br /&gt;I found the ordering process easy and processional without issues.</li>
            <li> The oil is very hydrating and of good quality.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hemp Seed oil is very good for acne prone skin, which is why I ordered it. The shipping speed was fast, and the bottle it arrived in seals well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just a quick warning about Hemp Seed oil--you need to refrigerate it, or else it will spoil after about a month. This oil goes bad quickly without refrigeration.</li>
            <li> I do not know what it does, barely use it.</li>
            <li> Love this oil. Use it in a mixture of other oils to keep my skin moisturized during this dry winter months.</li>
            <li> I have psoriasis and I been using this product for three days and I can feel and see a huge difference plus I purchased a papaya soap bar and the two together are amazing my skin is starting to have a healthy glow I will order again.</li>
            <li> I dot not agree with the pleasant nutty smelll, the smell is actually the only thing that bothers me about this oil and it does not go away very quickly. But this is the least of my worries since Ii can mix it with a drop of essentiel oil and I am good. I purchased the oil when I  learned about ceramides for hair and  I wanted to try. I loved the effect instantly, your hair immediatly feels frizz free. I have natural 4a type of hair.thanks to this oil, no more use of heat on my hair to get rid of the frizze after my wash. I love it,  I recommend it and I will  continue to use this brand which is really of great quality.</li>
            <li> This oil never broke me out, but man oh man it stinks. I finally cut it with some EVOO in hopes I wouldn&#x27;t nearly gag when I used it, but it was still pretty pungent. Regardless, hemp seed makes a great oil, especially when you have oily acne-prone skin so I sucked it up and used it. I think next time I&#x27;ll use a blend or look into adding essential oil to it because I&#x27;m sensitive to smells. Otherwise, it&#x27;s great.</li>
            <li> I was so pissed with this company and I vowed never to order from them again.  However, I did finally receive my hemp seed oil and I LOVE IT!  Another reviewer said it smells fishy, but I disagree...I think it has a slight nutty/minty smell.  I&#x27;ve been mixing it in a variety of products that I&#x27;m testing out.  Next time I hope this company tells me that the shipment may take longer and I&#x27;ll put my patience panties on...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hemp is not the same as marijuana. It has little to no measurable THC and has no drug value.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This oil works some kind of magic for my hair.  I am 4a natural of two years in February 2013 and I&#x27;ve tried many oils on my hair and I think I&#x27;ve found it in hemp seed oil.  My hair isn&#x27;t fuzzy and it seems to retain moisture for a few days since I started using this oil.</li>
