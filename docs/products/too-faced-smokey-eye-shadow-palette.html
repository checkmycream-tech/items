            <li>, i love this one too!</li>
            <li>I was impressed how much these colors made my brown eyes pop!</li>
            <li>cloves, nice ash, smoking jacket, ect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>They are nice colors but just not for my eyes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not</li>
            <li>My favorite part of all of the palettes by Too Faced, including this one, is the three looks they suggest if you&#x27;re not in the mood to create your own - and the fact they guide you by pointing out which one you might not want to wear to work.</li>
            <li>but more power to you!).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>pleased with this at all because I wanted lighter colors.</li>
            <li>I love, love Too Faced products.  </li>
            <li>and I LOVE their pigmentation.  </li>
            <li>It makes for a sexy evening look.</li>
            <li>I love this eye palette.  </li>
            <li>The colors are wonderful, and you can achieve many different looks with this palette.  </li>
            <li>I love that they give inserts of how to apply this makeup.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so beyond pleased with this palette.</li>
            <li>(I used the top three day shadows).</li>
            <li>GLAD</li>
            <li>Love this makeup.</li>
            <li>more formal.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Really love this eye shadow palette.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve gotten so many compliments on my make-up now that I&#x27;m wearing Two Faced eye shadow.</li>
            <li>Love too faced products.</li>
            <li>Also, this product doesn&#x27;t come with a brush or any means to put it on, so you have to spend more money to buy a brush just so you can use it...</li>
            <li>First time I have tried the darker shades and I am very pleased.</li>
            <li>When I saw it here I bought it for myself since I loved it so much.</li>
            <li>I loved that the colors blend really well together.  </li>
            <li>The shadows go on so smoothly, blend perfectly and stay all day long!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also very complimentary of most skin tones and eye colors</li>
            <li>They glide on easily, look natural and have great staying power.</li>
            <li>This product is really easy to blend</li>
            <li>The shadows are easily blend-able and I like</li>
            <li>This set offers a great range of colors (each looks fantastic on skin).  </li>
            <li>This is for a bold look!</li>
            <li>how smooth they apply.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>She was really happy when she opened her present.</li>
            <li>that you can quickly, and easily transform for night.</li>
            <li>Have fun!</li>
            <li>If you are familiar with Too Faced products, you know this is a quality cosmetic.  </li>
            <li>Absolutely worth the price!</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t compare to Two Faced and their rich, colors.</li>
            <li>(I&#x27;m very fair with green eyes, and it even works for me).</li>
            <li>The pigments are vibrant and application is very smooth.  </li>
            <li>I think these are the most highly pigmented eye shadows I have ever used.  </li>
            <li>This pallet was exactly what I was looking for!</li>
            <li>I admit I can be a Too Faced fangirl, but they really have a fantastic product on their hands.</li>
            <li>I have green eyes and almost every color looks great on my eyes.</li>
            <li>stays on great and is not cheap!</li>
            <li>Have you ever fallen in love with a particular eyeshadow, be it single/trio/quad/palette in the store, excitedly come home to try said gem, only to find (after putting on far too many layers)</li>
            <li>Pretty colors, they should come with brushes</li>
            <li>This isn&#x27;t intended for first time users</li>
            <li>They blend wonderfully, and will last and last all day long looking fresh.  </li>
            <li>had compliments the first day I wore it,</li>
            <li>I love the tip cards that accompany the palette, which show you how to apply the different shades.  </li>
            <li>Pretty palette.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m blonde, blue eyed, and fair.  </li>
            <li>The Too Faced line offers nothing but very fun, high quality products.</li>
            <li>Even without much thought or effort, you can have whatever look you choose</li>
            <li>/&gt;I recieved a too faced shadow palette with much darker colors.</li>
            <li>Really like the colors and the instruction cards</li>
            <li>Really gives it that smokey eye look.</li>
            <li>IS thE REAL</li>
            <li>Highly recommend it!</li>
            <li>The shimmer is a soft, pretty shimmer,</li>
            <li>For sure these shadows would all be too dark for me, making my eye area look bruised and tired.&lt;br</li>
            <li>This particular palette is no exception.</li>
            <li>There are three looks: Day, Classic, and Fashion.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend Too Faced products, and this eye palette is no exception</li>
            <li>I normally wear the shadows in this palette for a night out.</li>
            <li>I had bought my first Too Faced Smokey Eye Shadow Palette, but I received a product that it&#x27;s different than the offered in the pictures</li>
            <li>The only thing that worries me is it running out because I use it too much!</li>
            <li>Up in Snow - a series of golden and dark browns to really give your daytime look that pop.</li>
            <li>Other than that it has great colors (if a little darker than I prefer) and is of a long lasting and decent quality.</li>
            <li>nothing too loud (you know, the loud sparkles?</li>
            <li>so I suggest to get the full ability of this palette you must watch a few videos to learn how to blend it</li>
            <li>Not the same old eye shadows.</li>
            <li>The colors are totally different (very darker colors) and the three looks (day,fashion,classic) are in a different position, also the cover has a different font.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>AND THIS PRODUCT IS APPROXIMATELY $36.00 RETAIL IN MOST STORES.  </li>
            <li>Colors a bit dark, but you don&#x27;t need much.</li>
            <li>I have the natural palette as well, and it has lasted a long time.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;The shades are very pigmented and the cards that suggest how to wear the look are extremely helpful!</li>
            <li>One of the shadows was broken and the powder was messy in the compact I received, but the other colors were great.</li>
            <li>For a Classic look, they give you White Lie, Nice Ash and Smokin Hot - a shimmery white base to set off an alluring stormy blue and an inky black for drama.</li>

            <li> Long lasting color.  </li>
            <li> Long wearing and long lasting.  </li>
            <li> And at last, for when you&#x27;re feeling haute, the Fashion look, featuring In a Flash, Smoking Jacket, and Smolder - a metallic silver to lighten the come hither-ness of Smoking Jacket&#x27;s tempting deep purple and Smolder&#x27;s fierce, faded dark blue.   </li>
            <li> When it showed up, the eye shadow had broken in the box and the black eye shadow was all over the inside of the box, and messed up most of the other colors as well.</li>
            <li> On a side note, I noticed there are other Too</li>
            <li> It came with black, dark green, dark blue, ect.</li>
            <li> But, all of the shades are dark, pigmented, and oh so wearable.</li>
            <li> This palette is what I pull out when I&#x27;m feeling naughty for the night</li>
            <li> I however got dark green, navy, dark brown, dark grey and black!  </li>
            <li> and it struck me as a bit odd -</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been through quite a few palettes, and have not once been hurt, or let down in any way.</li>
            <li> My sister bought this pallet from the Ulta store a few years ago.</li>
            <li> It gives you a lot of options for everyday and evenings out/special occasions.  </li>
            <li> And the tones were a little dull for the lighter colors.  </li>
            <li> I used to buy the expensive Christian Dior $65 color palatte.  </li>
            <li> I wear the Urban Decay Primer Base before adding any color to my eyes and the eye shadow will last all day, looking great!&lt;br /&gt;Overall</li>
            <li> Either that or very pale skin tone.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if these are knock offs or past products, but it&#x27;s a little weird.</li>
            <li> am absolutely very disappointed it&#x27;s the first time that this happened too me in Amazon.</li>
            <li> and I never step back from the mirror and find myself disappointed.   </li>
            <li> /&gt;Happily, once I worked up a little courage, I was wrong!</li>
            <li> sadly</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s a sad story.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> so I think it´s a fake one.</li>
            <li> and it does give you a very dramatic smokey eye.</li>
            <li> Suddle or flashy!</li>
            <li> You won&#x27;t be disappointed.  </li>

            <li> Have you ever fallen in love with a particular eyeshadow, be it single/trio/quad/palette in the store, excitedly come home to try said gem, only to find (after putting on far too many layers) there&#x27;s NO color on your lids?! Loads of product....sadly, no color.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yeah, me too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a sad story.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thankfully, you can change that to a happy story with ANY of the Too Faced shadows! I&#x27;ve been through quite a few palettes, and have not once been hurt, or let down in any way. This particular palette is no exception. I&#x27;m blonde, blue eyed, and fair.  I can wear all the Smokey Eye Palette colors well, and have found one after another of beautiful combinations! Even without much thought or effort, you can have whatever look you choose (there are even cards that teach different looks, for those whom may be somewhat make-up challenged). The shimmer is a soft, pretty shimmer, nothing too loud (you know, the loud sparkles? The ones that just shouldn&#x27;t be worn past a certain age...well, maybe if you&#x27;re into that sort of thing....It&#x27;s not for me...but more power to you!).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a versatile, beautiful palette.  Whether you&#x27;re just using one color, or any combination. Long wearing and long lasting.  Perfect daytime looks that you can quickly, and easily transform for night.</li>
            <li> Arrived on time, but . . .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I ordered this product expecting to receive the colors seen in the pictures: cloves, nice ash, smoking jacket, ect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recieved a too faced shadow palette with much darker colors. It came with black, dark green, dark blue, ect. They are nice colors but just not for my eyes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not pleased with this at all because I wanted lighter colors. I will be looking into trying to get the color palette that I wanted and was expecting to receive.</li>
            <li> I love, love Too Faced products.  I have the Naked eye and Romantic eye palettes and I LOVE their pigmentation.  The card inserts on how to create different looks is also a neat idea and helpful.  The Too Faced line offers nothing but very fun, high quality products. You won&#x27;t be disappointed.  I get compliments all the time on my eye make up.  Have fun!</li>
            <li> One of the shadows was broken and the powder was messy in the compact I received, but the other colors were great. They glide on easily, look natural and have great staying power.</li>
            <li> Pretty colors, they should come with brushes</li>
            <li> always perfect. stays on great and is not cheap!</li>
            <li> This product is really easy to blend and it does give you a very dramatic smokey eye. This isn&#x27;t intended for first time users so I suggest to get the full ability of this palette you must watch a few videos to learn how to blend it well if you aren&#x27;t a very experienced makeup user. Practice makes perfect and this is worth the buy. It makes for a sexy evening look.</li>
            <li> I love this eye palette.  The colors are wonderful, and you can achieve many different looks with this palette.  I love that they give inserts of how to apply this makeup.  I think these are the most highly pigmented eye shadows I have ever used.  They blend wonderfully, and will last and last all day long looking fresh.  I highly recommend Too Faced products, and this eye palette is no exception, i love this one too!</li>
            <li> This palette is what I pull out when I&#x27;m feeling naughty for the night and I want my looks to match my attitude!  I admit I can be a Too Faced fangirl, but they really have a fantastic product on their hands. I&#x27;m so beyond pleased with this palette. The colors are beautiful, the style cards they provide are so helpful and I never step back from the mirror and find myself disappointed.   My favorite part of all of the palettes by Too Faced, including this one, is the three looks they suggest if you&#x27;re not in the mood to create your own - and the fact they guide you by pointing out which one you might not want to wear to work. There are three looks: Day, Classic, and Fashion. In the Day look, you have Firefly, Cloves, and Up in Snow - a series of golden and dark browns to really give your daytime look that pop. For a Classic look, they give you White Lie, Nice Ash and Smokin Hot - a shimmery white base to set off an alluring stormy blue and an inky black for drama. And at last, for when you&#x27;re feeling haute, the Fashion look, featuring In a Flash, Smoking Jacket, and Smolder - a metallic silver to lighten the come hither-ness of Smoking Jacket&#x27;s tempting deep purple and Smolder&#x27;s fierce, faded dark blue.   There&#x27;s no way you&#x27;ll walk out of the house without causing a few accidents and turning heads fast enough to cause minor whiplash.  On a side note, I noticed there are other Too Faced Smokey Eye Shadow Palettes for sale on Amazon, and it struck me as a bit odd - the colors are all different. I don&#x27;t know if these are knock offs or past products, but it&#x27;s a little weird.</li>
            <li> Excellent color, beautiful pigmentation.  Long lasting color.  I&#x27;m a big fan of the Too Faced eye shadow palettes and this one is no exception!</li>
            <li> This pallet was exactly what I was looking for! The shadows go on so smoothly, blend perfectly and stay all day long!</li>
            <li> I love love love too faced makeup!!! This palette is gorgeous! I was impressed how much these colors made my brown eyes pop! Can&#x27;t wait to wear it on a night out!</li>
            <li> When I received my smokey eye palette I immediately thought, oh no!!! For sure these shadows would all be too dark for me, making my eye area look bruised and tired.&lt;br /&gt;Happily, once I worked up a little courage, I was wrong! And I could just kick myself for not trying it sooner.&lt;br /&gt;I had compliments the first day I wore it, (I used the top three day shadows). But, all of the shades are dark, pigmented, and oh so wearable. The shadows are easily blend-able and I like how smooth they apply.&lt;br /&gt;I always wear them over a primer, and have no wear time issues. For the price this is a must have in my eye arsenal.</li>
            <li> The colors were a lot darker than they appeared on the website... And the tones were a little dull for the lighter colors.  I think you need a darker skin tone to wear these colors.  Either that or very pale skin tone.</li>
            <li> Colors a bit dark, but you don&#x27;t need much. Good quality. Not the same old eye shadows. This is for a bold look!</li>
            <li> If you are familiar with Too Faced products, you know this is a quality cosmetic.  The shadow has longevity, and the colors are great.  I love the tip cards that accompany the palette, which show you how to apply the different shades.  I have the natural palette as well, and it has lasted a long time.  Absolutely worth the price!</li>
            <li> Love the product line!!</li>
            <li> Good product, it arrived as it was supposed. Really like the colors and the instruction cards are a plus.</li>
            <li> I had bought my first Too Faced Smokey Eye Shadow Palette, but I received a product that it&#x27;s different than the offered in the pictures and it has a Tester label on the cover, so I think it´s a fake one. The colors are totally different (very darker colors) and the three looks (day,fashion,classic) are in a different position, also the cover has a different font.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also I search for a Too Faced Smokey Eye Shadow Palette that looks like the one I received and I didn&#x27;t found it.&lt;br /&gt;I am absolutely very disappointed it&#x27;s the first time that this happened too me in Amazon.</li>
            <li> The colors shown here are shades of purple and nude.  I however got dark green, navy, dark brown, dark grey and black!  Not one shade of purple. I picked this palette solely for the purple, and didn&#x27;t even get one!</li>
            <li> THIS MAKEUP IS A WONDERFUL PRODUCT BY TOO FACED.  I SEARCHED RETAIL STORES IN SAN ANTONIO AND THIS PRODUCT IS APPROXIMATELY $36.00 RETAIL IN MOST STORES.  GLAD I TOOK THE TIME TO SEARCH AMAZON BECUASE THE PRICE WAS GREAT!</li>
            <li> Love this makeup. Really gives it that smokey eye look.</li>
            <li> My sister bought this pallet from the Ulta store a few years ago. When I saw it here I bought it for myself since I loved it so much. However, the company has changed the colors in it. It used to have a neutral day option which was just gorgeous and this pallet no longer has that option. Other than that it has great colors (if a little darker than I prefer) and is of a long lasting and decent quality.</li>
            <li> Stays on extra-long. Great colors for smokey eyes and teaches you how. Suddle or flashy! Compact too for travel. IS thE REAL TOO FACED SMOKEY EYE PALLETE. Not an intimidator!</li>
            <li> I normally wear the shadows in this palette for a night out. I feel like it makes me look more formal.&lt;br /&gt;The shades are very pigmented and the cards that suggest how to wear the look are extremely helpful! I wear the Urban Decay Primer Base before adding any color to my eyes and the eye shadow will last all day, looking great!&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I&#x27;m very satisfied with this purchase. The only thing that worries me is it running out because I use it too much!</li>
            <li> This set offers a great range of colors (each looks fantastic on skin).  The pigments are vibrant and application is very smooth.  I loved that the colors blend really well together.  Highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> First time I have tried the darker shades and I am very pleased.</li>
            <li> Really love this eye shadow palette.  It gives you a lot of options for everyday and evenings out/special occasions.  It&#x27;s also very complimentary of most skin tones and eye colors (I&#x27;m very fair with green eyes, and it even works for me).</li>
            <li> I used to buy the expensive Christian Dior $65 color palatte.  It doesn&#x27;t compare to Two Faced and their rich, colors. Gorgeous. I&#x27;ve gotten so many compliments on my make-up now that I&#x27;m wearing Two Faced eye shadow.</li>
            <li> Pretty palette. I have green eyes and almost every color looks great on my eyes. Love too faced products.</li>
            <li> Just wonderful, the colors are beautiful and creamy nice that last all day. You get three different smoky eye looks in this kit!</li>
            <li> When it showed up, the eye shadow had broken in the box and the black eye shadow was all over the inside of the box, and messed up most of the other colors as well. Also, this product doesn&#x27;t come with a brush or any means to put it on, so you have to spend more money to buy a brush just so you can use it...</li>
            <li> It was a Christmas Gift. On my niece Amazon wish list. She was really happy when she opened her present.</li>
