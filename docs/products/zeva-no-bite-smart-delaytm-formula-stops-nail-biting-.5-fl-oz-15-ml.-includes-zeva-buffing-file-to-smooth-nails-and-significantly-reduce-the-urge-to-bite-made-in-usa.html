            <li>Great job!</li>
            <li>Great job Zeva!</li>
            <li>We eventually realized the best solution was to place a band-aid on the finger (flexible fabric variety) and then applied a generous amount of Zeva on the bandage.  </li>
            <li>the best my nails have ever looked.</li>
            <li>Another month they will be gorgeous!  </li>
            <li>Good luck!</li>

            <li>Works great, but there is no way</li>
            <li>The best part is that she is super proud of herself for breaking the habit :D</li>

            <li>LOVE IT!</li>
            <li>it does tend to thicken a bit after a while, and the price plus shipping is kind of steep.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m loving this stuff...</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s worth it!!!  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried stopping many times but never succeeded.</li>
            <li>I also love that it has no harmful chemicals, I have always worried about the chemicals they put in most nail biting polishes.</li>
            <li>This polish works MOST of the time.  </li>
            <li>Have made many attempts to quit but have been unsuccessful.</li>
            <li>so I was able to stop myself</li>
            <li>While it may not have as many reviews as something like Mavala, it does</li>
            <li>no matter how many times I tried to stop by the end of the week my nails would be nubs again even with polish.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>But overall excellent</li>
            <li>top verify</li>
            <li>I have beautiful natural nails as well as healthy skin around the nails.  </li>
            <li>BTW this product comes with detailed instructions for use -- although it&#x27;s very easy to use.</li>
            <li>Easy to use.</li>
            <li>It is so easy.  </li>
            <li>i apply over my polish and this works fine.</li>
            <li>This is huge for me, because before I couldn&#x27;t go a day without biting.</li>
            <li>These tools keep everything in check and I must say I am proud of my nails with only 1 month&#x27;s growth.  </li>
            <li>This is a great product, I was able to break a 20 year habit in roughly a month.  </li>
            <li>So far it is working great, and she is excited about the process and the positive reinforcement she is getting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One</li>
            <li>It is worth every penny for the result!  </li>
            <li>For the most part though, this item works really well</li>
            <li>The urge to bite has faded tremendously since then.</li>
            <li>A must have for a avid nail biter!</li>
            <li>My nails look great - HOWEVER the only reason I didn&#x27;t give it a 5 star is because my 6 year old still bites hers.  </li>
            <li>Often they would remove their thumb and decide it wasn&#x27;t worth it.  </li>
            <li>I wish they had an &#x27;extra strong&#x27; version for when he is super stressed out and bites through this!  </li>
            <li>She has finally been able to grow her fingernails out.  </li>
            <li>Every time I went to bite them, the taste made me aware of what I was doing</li>
            <li>This is the first nail biting product that I can not bite through.  </li>
            <li>and this is the first time since has been 5 that he hasn&#x27;t bitten his nails.  </li>
            <li>I had tried talking to her about it and motivating her with pretty nail polish or stickers or froyo....</li>
            <li>Also, the literature states that Zeva is non-toxic, but it smells exactly like nail polish.  </li>
            <li>This really works!</li>
            <li>This nail polish is exactly what we were hoping for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>My four year old was probably discouraged from it more than my two year old.  </li>
            <li>I ordered Zeva after reading a lot of positive reviews.</li>
            <li>Following the advice Zeva gave, I have been keeping any roughness on my nails filed and smooth</li>
            <li>This stuff really works.  </li>
            <li>This stuff has really worked.</li>
            <li>This really did not work in deterring my son from nail biting.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li>Thanks b</li>
            <li>This really worked for me.  </li>
            <li>This product works very well.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not saying other products would be better...</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s job extremely well (as well as coming with a stylish bottle and a nail file).</li>
            <li>But don&#x27;t put too many coats on or it make nails look yellow and gross.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve read many reviews from parents of children, but I am an adult with a nervous habit of either nibbling on rough nails or biting them.  </li>
            <li>My daughter developed the habit of biting her nails recently and it was becoming a real problem because she would chew them down to the quick.</li>
            <li>It has always been so hard to have nice nails.  </li>
            <li>and wow, that advice has helped SO MUCH.</li>
            <li>It does taste gross and worth a shot but didn&#x27;t work for us.</li>
            <li>If you live in Hawaii, expect your product to arrive in 4 - 6 weeks.  </li>
            <li>it is pretty gross tasting.</li>
            <li>I bought this nail treatment for my young daughter.  </li>
            <li>So, I went on the hunt for a NATURAL deterrent....</li>
            <li>I bought this for both our 2 year old and 4 year old who have a thumb sucking problem.  </li>
            <li>Now my nails are returning to their natural glory.</li>
            <li>I bought a bottle of the Zeva no bite and a bottle of the Mavala Stop for my nine year old daughter who bites her nails until they bleed.  </li>
            <li>My six year old still bites her nails, but I should probably reapply bi-daily.</li>
            <li>So take it off and put a fresh one on every other day</li>
            <li>first, the nail polish is ever so slightly yellow, which doesn&#x27;t look great, annd second, the bad taste wears off, so you have to reapply every day or two.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure this could work with an occasional nail biter/thumb sucker but not with my child.</li>
            <li>They seem to truly care about their customers and although this product was a little pricey, it&#x27;s so worth it.</li>
            <li>This is the most expensive bite prevention product I have tried on my 4 year old daughter.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 21 years old and have been biting my nails for as long as I can remember.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 25 years old and have been biting my nails for as long as I can remember.</li>
            <li>In my humble opinion, the child should be a willing participant in the process if possible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This stuff really tastes like what they put in air dusters now-a-days to prevent abuse, and sometimes when eating foods with your fingers or touching your face ect you can taste this product and its extremely unpleasant.</li>
            <li>I probably paid too much for shipping too, since for the size of the box, parcel post pricing should have been way less than what I paid.</li>
            <li>Being a habitual nail biter and someone who would bite down to the bone under times of high stress this stuff works MIRACLES for me.</li>

            <li> /&gt;Finally, if you are looking for a product that will have your kid heaving in a toilet for hours, this is not it!  </li>
            <li> My two year old would suck his thumb for a couple of seconds then take it out, shake his head, scratch his tongue, cry a little bit and show me his thumb and then try again.  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t expect the negative association to kick in that fast</li>
            <li> Well it is not working for my 3 year old daughter, she still bites her nails even when we put it everyday on her nails.</li>
            <li> I have been a life long biter of my nails.  </li>
            <li> i have biten my nail for as long as i can remember</li>
            <li> Tastes gross, very bitter.</li>
            <li> The taste is unpleasant but not horrible.  </li>
            <li> This is a 5-star product hands down, ive tried other anti biting products and I could barely test them and it wasn&#x27;t working for me....</li>
            <li> All children are different, and some require a little stronger deterrent.  </li>
            <li> was because there of the rough edges on my nails.</li>
            <li> I noticed both of them would wince at the taste and then mental weigh the decision to suck their thumb.  </li>
            <li> After applying this polish once, I immediately was faced with a horrendous bitter taste whenever I subconsciously zoned in on destroying my nails.</li>
            <li> Zeva is unpleasant, but it isn&#x27;t as potent as a previous reviewer had indicated.  </li>
            <li> We&#x27;ve been applying every other day for two months.  </li>
            <li> and then she ignored the taste even reapplying every other day.</li>
            <li> But NOT as repulsive as some of the others based on those other reviews.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t get on her finger foods like some other products do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Very bitter</li>
            <li> The taste is strong-enough to notice every time, but not so strong she is afraid or anxious about it.  </li>
            <li> My son could have cared less that this was on his nails.  </li>
            <li> It lasts a few minutes in her mouth</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been painting a thin layer over my fake nails, planning on doing that until my real ones grow to a point that I&#x27;m no longer embarrassed by them.</li>
            <li> It tastes nasty, stays on thru many hand washings, and adds a very subtle sheen to my short nails.  </li>
            <li> This is the most disgusting thing I&#x27;ve ever tasted in my life!</li>
            <li> usually when I&#x27;m stressed out or at my desk at work.</li>
            <li> (I have been using it too), but doesn&#x27;t make her feel nauseated or gag as some other products do.&lt;br</li>
            <li> After all your transferring all the bacteria caught under your finger nails directly to your mouth, as well as being bad for your teeth.</li>
            <li> This product doesn&#x27;t have some of the harsh chemicals like others but it tastes bad enough</li>
            <li> Since this product is considered flammable, it has to be shipped on the slow boat, something I did not know when I purchased.  </li>
            <li> He&#x27;d do this repeatedly until he either decided it wasn&#x27;t worth it or just deal with the nasty taste.  </li>
            <li> I do find nail biting to be a nasty bad habit and blame it for getting sick more than frequently.</li>
            <li> which sucks since he works in the IT field!).  </li>
            <li> They may think of it as punishment and may become afraid or anxious.  </li>

            <li> just did not work.  I&#x27;m not saying other products would be better... but was hoping it would work</li>
            <li> I bought this nail treatment for my young daughter.  She does not like the taste but it&#x27;s not upsetting for her.  She has finally been able to grow her fingernails out.  Very glad that I chose this product.  Easy to use.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 40 - I have bitten my nails all my life.  This awful tasting stuff caused me to break my habbit...now only if I can stay that way!  My nails look great - HOWEVER the only reason I didn&#x27;t give it a 5 star is because my 6 year old still bites hers.  She says it tastes awful but it&#x27;s worth it!!!  I told her I&#x27;m going to use skunk juice next...</li>
            <li> Well it is not working for my 3 year old daughter, she still bites her nails even when we put it everyday on her nails. I will not buy it again...</li>
            <li> 6 months later and I am no longer chewing my fingernails.  Plus, they give you enough of a supply to reapply if the urge arises.</li>
            <li> I use it on my son who is a horrible nail biter. It does not add a shine so he doesn&#x27;t feel like he is wearing nail polish (he is 12)and the taste is horrible enough that he keeps his fingers out of his mouth!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 21 years old and have been biting my nails for as long as I can remember. I&#x27;ve tried stopping many times but never succeeded. The polish included a page of directions and advice and wow, that advice has helped SO MUCH. I never realized I was biting my nails was because there of the rough edges on my nails. Following the advice Zeva gave, I have been keeping any roughness on my nails filed and smooth and I have yet to even want to bite my nails! I also love that it has no harmful chemicals, I have always worried about the chemicals they put in most nail biting polishes. They seem to truly care about their customers and although this product was a little pricey, it&#x27;s so worth it. Thank you Zeva - one week no biting and I am confident this time it will stay that way!</li>
            <li> This is the most disgusting thing I&#x27;ve ever tasted in my life! This products works!! But don&#x27;t put too many coats on or it make nails look yellow and gross. So take it off and put a fresh one on every other day</li>
            <li> I bought this for my husband who is a HORRIBLE nail biter.  He bites till he bleeds at times and it is painful for him to type (which sucks since he works in the IT field!).  This polish works MOST of the time.  It is bitter and nasty tasting, which usually keeps him from biting.  I wish they had an &#x27;extra strong&#x27; version for when he is super stressed out and bites through this!  For the most part though, this item works really well and I am happy with the results.  At times he actually has nails!!!  And they look great!!!  Only downside would be the flavor gets on anything you eat with your fingers, and dont check if your kiddo is teething!  All I can say is YUCK!  That is with any polish though and is acceptable for the fact that it breaks the biting nails habit.</li>
            <li> I have bitten my nails for 28 years. Have made many attempts to quit but have been unsuccessful. I bite them subconciously, I dont even realize Im doing it. I quit biting 2 months ago with this products help. It tastes horrible. Every time I went to bite them, the taste made me aware of what I was doing so I was able to stop myself when Id start.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for one month and it is amazing!  I have beautiful natural nails as well as healthy skin around the nails.  It has always been so hard to have nice nails.  I have been biting them since I was a child.  This product will make you stop.  It is so easy.  I also bought the nail kit with the files and oil.  These tools keep everything in check and I must say I am proud of my nails with only 1 month&#x27;s growth.  Another month they will be gorgeous!  It is worth every penny for the result!  Good luck!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 25 years old and have been biting my nails for as long as I can remember. My nails are hideous so I&#x27;ve been wearing fake ones for a while. I would still gnaw on those though, so the temporary barrier didn&#x27;t help. I ordered Zeva after reading a lot of positive reviews. It&#x27;s been 2 weeks and I haven&#x27;t bit my nails! This is huge for me, because before I couldn&#x27;t go a day without biting. This polish tastes really gross, and it lingers in your mouth. By day 2, I was stopping myself before I put my fingers in my mouth because I knew what would happen. I didn&#x27;t expect the negative association to kick in that fast but it did! The urge to bite has faded tremendously since then. I still have the urge to pick at my nails, so I&#x27;ve been carrying around a nail kit so I can file away any nicks that trigger the destructiveness. I&#x27;ve been painting a thin layer over my fake nails, planning on doing that until my real ones grow to a point that I&#x27;m no longer embarrassed by them. I think any nail biter should give this a try, I know it&#x27;s going to work for me. On a side note, I think this product might not work as well for smokers. A friend of mine who smokes painted this on her nail and couldn&#x27;t taste the bitterness at all. But to me it&#x27;s disgusting!!</li>
            <li> This is the most expensive bite prevention product I have tried on my 4 year old daughter.  For the price, you&#x27;d think it would work, but it doesn&#x27;t.  I had hoped that the taste would be absolutely horrible, but like some other reviewers have stated, the taste is just unpleasant, which is probably why my daughter keeps on biting.  We&#x27;ve been applying every other day for two months.  Side note.  If you live in Hawaii, expect your product to arrive in 4 - 6 weeks.  Since this product is considered flammable, it has to be shipped on the slow boat, something I did not know when I purchased.  I probably paid too much for shipping too, since for the size of the box, parcel post pricing should have been way less than what I paid.</li>
            <li> My son could have cared less that this was on his nails.  It didn&#x27;t deter him from biting at all</li>
            <li> This is the first nail biting product that I can not bite through.  I think it even strenghtens my nails.  I chanllenged a co-worker to it as well and this is the first time since has been 5 that he hasn&#x27;t bitten his nails.  Great job!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure this could work with an occasional nail biter/thumb sucker but not with my child. It deterred her for about a week and then she ignored the taste even reapplying every other day. It does taste gross and worth a shot but didn&#x27;t work for us.</li>
            <li> My daughter developed the habit of biting her nails recently and it was becoming a real problem because she would chew them down to the quick. I had tried talking to her about it and motivating her with pretty nail polish or stickers or froyo.... It wasn&#x27;t working. So, I went on the hunt for a NATURAL deterrent.... THIS WORKS&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I only had to put in on her ONCE and she hasn&#x27;t bitten her nails for over a month! The best part is that she is super proud of herself for breaking the habit :D</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve read many reviews from parents of children, but I am an adult with a nervous habit of either nibbling on rough nails or biting them.  UGH.  This stuff really works.  It tastes nasty, stays on thru many hand washings, and adds a very subtle sheen to my short nails.  The ingredients are good, meaning non toxic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I knocked off one star for two reasons:  it does tend to thicken a bit after a while, and the price plus shipping is kind of steep.  I wish I could buy it locally.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been biting my nails since I was a child. I&#x27;ve tried everything and nothing worked! A friend suggested I try this product, I&#x27;ve been using it for about 2 months now and have yet to bite my nails once! A must have for a avid nail biter!</li>
            <li> I bought this for both our 2 year old and 4 year old who have a thumb sucking problem.  I noticed both of them would wince at the taste and then mental weigh the decision to suck their thumb.  Often they would remove their thumb and decide it wasn&#x27;t worth it.  My four year old was probably discouraged from it more than my two year old.  My two year old would suck his thumb for a couple of seconds then take it out, shake his head, scratch his tongue, cry a little bit and show me his thumb and then try again.  He&#x27;d do this repeatedly until he either decided it wasn&#x27;t worth it or just deal with the nasty taste.  As a mom it made me feel bad, but I don&#x27;t know what else to try.</li>
            <li> Lifetime nail biter. This helped me to stop. It tastes like sh** and works.</li>
            <li> Being a habitual nail biter and someone who would bite down to the bone under times of high stress this stuff works MIRACLES for me. I do find nail biting to be a nasty bad habit and blame it for getting sick more than frequently. After all your transferring all the bacteria caught under your finger nails directly to your mouth, as well as being bad for your teeth. I&#x27;m loving this stuff...Although giving up this bad habit does have some cons to it they well out weigh the benefits. This stuff really tastes like what they put in air dusters now-a-days to prevent abuse, and sometimes when eating foods with your fingers or touching your face ect you can taste this product and its extremely unpleasant. This is a 5-star product hands down, ive tried other anti biting products and I could barely test them and it wasn&#x27;t working for me....This stuff makes biting your nails so unpleasant you&#x27;d have to be beyond addicted to biting your nails. Great job Zeva!</li>
            <li> Did the trick!  My son stopped biting his nails with this product.  I would recommend this product.  Had tried everything else.</li>
            <li> Zeva is unpleasant, but it isn&#x27;t as potent as a previous reviewer had indicated.  All children are different, and some require a little stronger deterrent.  We eventually realized the best solution was to place a band-aid on the finger (flexible fabric variety) and then applied a generous amount of Zeva on the bandage.  The band-aid was replaced daily.    Also, the literature states that Zeva is non-toxic, but it smells exactly like nail polish.  No listing of ingredients provided.</li>
            <li> I have been biting my nails for over 15 years, and I&#x27;m 20. For years, I have been embarrassed to show by stubby and sometimes bleeding nails. One day, I had enough. So I took to Amazon to find a cure. While it may not have as many reviews as something like Mavala, it does it&#x27;s job extremely well (as well as coming with a stylish bottle and a nail file). After applying this polish once, I immediately was faced with a horrendous bitter taste whenever I subconsciously zoned in on destroying my nails. Now my nails are returning to their natural glory. Thank you Zeva, you changed my life.</li>
            <li> I have been a life long biter of my nails.  This stuff has really worked. It tastes terrible, so there is no reason for you to bite your nails. My wife of 26 years saya it&#x27;a the best my nails have ever looked.</li>
            <li> Zeva no bite works!&lt;br /&gt;I bite my nails and skin around nails without realizing it. usually when I&#x27;m stressed out or at my desk at work. no matter how many times I tried to stop by the end of the week my nails would be nubs again even with polish.&lt;br /&gt;I finally tried this product. it&#x27;s been 1 week and only 2 incidents of attempted fingers in mouth. As soon as i put my finger in my mouth i taste this product and stop! it is pretty gross tasting. Very bitter and it lingers. But NOT as repulsive as some of the others based on those other reviews. This product doesn&#x27;t have some of the harsh chemicals like others but it tastes bad enough so you will not bite your nails. the taste does get on finger foods a bit if you handle them so you have to keep that in mind. i apply over my polish and this works fine. BTW this product comes with detailed instructions for use -- although it&#x27;s very easy to use. AND a \\&quot;cleaning\\&quot; file to prep your nails which works great. LOVE IT!</li>
            <li> i have biten my nail for as long as i can remember this worked Great i would buy this again and again</li>
            <li> This really did not work in deterring my son from nail biting.</li>
            <li> This is a great product, I was able to break a 20 year habit in roughly a month.  I would highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> Yes, it works. I bought it for my mom and she isn&#x27;t biting her nails after using this on her nails.  Thanks b</li>
            <li> I bought a bottle of the Zeva no bite and a bottle of the Mavala Stop for my nine year old daughter who bites her nails until they bleed.  The Mavala tastes horrible.  She can&#x27;t even eat with her fingers after we put it on.  Neither one of us can even taste the Zeva.  BUY THE MAVALA!!!</li>
            <li> This really works! Tastes gross, very bitter. The only draw back is for about 2 weeks the taste lingers so if your kids eat fruit, chips or anything with their fingers they get the taste. But overall excellent</li>
            <li> Does work but leaves a yellowish haze so your bitten fingers look jaundiced.professionally you will have fingers that look even more questionable</li>
            <li> This really worked for me.  I&#x27;ve been a nail biter for two decades, but this has helped me kick the habit.  Two downsides: first, the nail polish is ever so slightly yellow, which doesn&#x27;t look great, annd second, the bad taste wears off, so you have to reapply every day or two.</li>
            <li> This product works very well.  I&#x27;m going to use this as a pattern for the rest of my reviews I&#x27;m happy with</li>
            <li> My daughter (age 6) continuously puts her hands in her mouth and bites her nails while she&#x27;s at school.  As a result, she is always getting sick.  We explained to her the risks of it, but she doesn&#x27;t realize she is doing it.  I was looking for a product to help her recognize when she is putting her hands in her mouth, without triggering her gag reflex or getting foul-tasting cream all over her food when she eats.  This nail polish is exactly what we were hoping for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;1) The taste is strong-enough to notice every time, but not so strong she is afraid or anxious about it.  It lasts a few minutes in her mouth (I have been using it too), but doesn&#x27;t make her feel nauseated or gag as some other products do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2)  It lasts for several days without having to reapply.  We don&#x27;t have to reapply every day or two, maybe every 4 or 5 days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3)  It doesn&#x27;t get on her finger foods like some other products do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4)  If she rubs her eyes accidentally, it doesn&#x27;t hurt her eyes or irritate them at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;5)  The ingredients as supposed to be non-toxic so when she does slip up, I don&#x27;t have to worry about her ingesting something toxic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;6)  So far it is working great, and she is excited about the process and the positive reinforcement she is getting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One note:  I wouldn&#x27;t use this on a child younger than 5.  They may think of it as punishment and may become afraid or anxious.  In my humble opinion, the child should be a willing participant in the process if possible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Finally, if you are looking for a product that will have your kid heaving in a toilet for hours, this is not it!  The taste is unpleasant but not horrible.  It gets on my lips whenever I touch my nails to them or accidentally lick my fingers while eating, and it&#x27;s not that bad.  Just enough to be a reminder.</li>
            <li> Works great, but there is no way top verify ingredients.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you</li>
            <li> My six year old still bites her nails, but I should probably reapply bi-daily. I forget. She says it tastes bad!</li>
