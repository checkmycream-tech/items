            <li>Also no bad smell like others mentioned.</li>
            <li>It is so easy to use and very gentle on my hair....</li>
            <li>I had the regular size for a while and gave it to a friend cuz she liked it so much, so I tried this one and like it even more.</li>

            <li>my hair is so soft.</li>

            <li> I recommend this paddle brush style for those with long hair.</li>
            <li> The Wet Brush is the only brush anyone with long hair should use!</li>

            <li> I used to have to let my hair dry before brushing it out.</li>
            <li> If I don&#x27;t brush my hair when its wet , then I get pretty knotty , so its nice to have something &amp;#34;safe&amp;#34; to brush my hair with when wet , because combs are just impossible on my hair !!!</li>
            <li> I have crazy long hair with bleach highlights that tangles easily.</li>
            <li> I used it on my wet and dry hair.</li>

            <li> My daughter has very thick, long hair and a sensitive scalp.  </li>
            <li> So just be careful with that!</li>
            <li> but the pins got ruined due to my clumsiness</li>
            <li> ; as some of the other reviews stated.  </li>
            <li> I have gotten rid of all my other brushes &amp; have 3 of these now (2 paddles &amp; 1 oval</li>
            <li> she says it hurts less than other brushes...</li>
            <li> I have blonde, thin hair and not only did I have to heavily condition my hair in the shower, but I also had to use a spray in conditioner</li>
            <li> My daughter has thick long hair, this has really helped keep her from getting angry with me for brushing her hair.</li>
            <li> and I spray a little on the tips of my hair and rub that in</li>
            <li> this is the brush for those of us who have thin hair that tangles easily (especially after shampooing).  </li>
            <li> after I towel dried my hair.  </li>
            <li> No more crying when they get out of the bath.</li>
            <li> And on my 2 yr olds curly hair who usually hates her hair touched.</li>

            <li> No more pulling!!</li>
            <li> No more screaming matches and bad words in the morning.</li>

            <li> This is an awesome brush! I have super long hair and my hair gets very tangled easily, this brush allows me to brush knots right out quick snd easy without causing pain like others. Will continue to purchase this style of brush!!</li>
            <li> Although I started using it for blow drying my hair and some of the bristles are bent now from use with the blow dryer. So just be careful with that!</li>
            <li> Look no further....this is the brush for those of us who have thin hair that tangles easily (especially after shampooing).  I have blonde, thin hair and not only did I have to heavily condition my hair in the shower, but I also had to use a spray in conditioner after I towel dried my hair.  This brush has eliminated all of that.  It is so easy to use and very gentle on my hair....simply amazing!  I have bought this brush for many of my friends and everyone loves it.</li>
            <li> Love this brush!! Not only pain free detangling but also adds shin and my hair is so soft. I used it on my wet and dry hair. And on my 2 yr olds curly hair who usually hates her hair touched. Now she barely notices me brushing it and bye bye detangling spray.</li>
            <li> I loooove this brush, I previously had the black standard one but the pins got ruined due to my clumsiness and i decided to purchase another one. I chose the lavender color which I loved, I like how they have now those holes behind the brush to allow ventilation and drying.</li>
            <li> This is the authentic Wet Brush, and the quality is superb. Never again will I rip my hair out with a wide-toothed comb in the shower! I recommend this paddle brush style for those with long hair. It&#x27;s a must-buy for long, tangly hair!</li>
            <li> My daughter has very thick, long hair and a sensitive scalp.  Most brushes make her miserable.  This one manages to detangle comfortably.  It&#x27;s the only one she will use.</li>
            <li> My daughter would scream the entire time I was doing her hair.  This brush has changed our lives!  I don&#x27;t know how it works, but it gets rid of tangles without pulling or hurting scalps.  We love it!</li>
            <li> Magic! I have three tender headed daughters. I ordered three of these brushes and they are the best. No more crying when they get out of the bath. No more pulling!!</li>
            <li> This product shipped very quickly, and I did not notice a &amp;#34;rubbery smell&amp;#34; as some of the other reviews stated.  However, I used it only a couple of times, and by the end of the day, the plastic had begun to fracture and break.  This item was returned.</li>
            <li> i can&#x27;t believe that I&#x27;ve muddled through life this long without this brush!  It works GREAT on wet hair, dry hair, short hair, long hair, curly hair, straight hair, grey hair, dog hair (I scolded my son for that one!), and KIDS hair!  Emphasis on KIDS hair because it&#x27;s sooo much easier to brush my little girl&#x27;s hair now!  No more tears!  I love it!  Buy two, my kids misplaced ours and it was a miserable two days until the new one came!</li>
            <li> A hair dresser told me about this product. My hair is wavy/straight/thick and If I didn&#x27;t have this brush I would seriously have dreads or spend 1,000&#x27;s on conditioner. If I don&#x27;t brush my hair when its wet , then I get pretty knotty , so its nice to have something &amp;#34;safe&amp;#34; to brush my hair with when wet , because combs are just impossible on my hair !!!</li>
            <li> This brush has saved the relationships between me and my daughters. No more screaming matches and bad words in the morning. Bless this brush!</li>
            <li> My daughter has thick long hair, this has really helped keep her from getting angry with me for brushing her hair. However it doesn&#x27;t remove all tangles, a lot of times I have to finish with my regular brush on the tougher tangles before I can braid or style the hair.</li>
            <li> daughter very happy with this hairbrush.  she says it hurts less than other brushes... more useful wet than dry, but even on dry hair she said it works easier.  i dont know, I have short hair.</li>
            <li> Works just like it says it works. Amazing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been essentially forcing all my female family member to try mine and of course, they then go buy their own.</li>
            <li> The Wet Brush is the only brush anyone with long hair should use! It does not pull or rip and that means no breakage!</li>
            <li> These were good if you have thin hair, but not thick hair.  I have stopped using conditioner and detangler because I put 1 teaspoon  almond oil, 1 teaspoon Argan oil, 1 teaspoon vitamin E oil, and 1 teaspoon organic virgin coconut oil. And I put that into  A squirt bottle with water and I shake it up and I spritz it over the top of my head and I spray a little on the tips of my hair and rub that in and I don&#x27;t need conditioner or detangler it doesn&#x27;t hurt to brush my hair.  And my hair is very thick and healthy and it does not fall out anymore. I also sprayed the stuff all over my body as a spray on  lotion  I have such healthy hair and skin just a tip if anybody wanted to try it. But literally do not spray too much in your hair or you will get oily hair.</li>
            <li> Incredible for long thick hair, especially wet. I have gotten rid of all my other brushes &amp; have 3 of these now (2 paddles &amp; 1 oval I use for travel). I don&#x27;t know what makes these work so well, but they are the best brush I&#x27;ve ever found. I have told everybody about them - now my mom, my daughters, my granddaughter all have them too! Great variety of colors &amp; fun print patterns.  &#x3D;) Definitely recommend.</li>
            <li> So wonderful! I have crazy long hair with bleach highlights that tangles easily. I used to have to let my hair dry before brushing it out. I had the regular size for a while and gave it to a friend cuz she liked it so much, so I tried this one and like it even more. Minimal fall out and no breakage. Also no bad smell like others mentioned. Works great on my daughters hair as well.</li>
            <li> Smell so bad! Very heavy plastic smell. Used for about 2 months, the smell is still here.&lt;br /&gt;But it is nice and gentle for long wet hair after shampoo,&lt;br /&gt;because I have extremely fine and thin hair, this brush is really good, but the smell.</li>
