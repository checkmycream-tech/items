    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>Very good, but one of the snaps on the closure tab broke almost immediately.  </li>
            <li>Could have been happy with any of the colors shown.</li>
            <li>But.... works great to hold your odd-shaped Radius brush.</li>
            <li>lol.  </li>
            <li>Great for travel,</li>
            <li>A great case to match a great toothbrush.</li>
            <li>Good case for traveling</li>
            <li>I love it!</li>
            <li>Not my first choice, but since everything else about the toothbrush and the travel case are great</li>
            <li>Ok, understood.</li>
            <li>These are perfect and essential if you travel with a Radius toothbrush.</li>
            <li>so I don&#x27;t think up another reason to buy more...</li>
            <li>for My favorite toothbrush</li>
            <li>Love the case.  </li>
            <li>Make everything more hygienic.</li>
            <li>It was stated that this case fits most toothbrushes... unless you have toothbrush about the length of a writing pen don&#x27;t bother.</li>
            <li>Really love the product and really great price at that.... will be looking forward to plenty more purchases like this in the future.</li>
            <li>Love this brush best I ever used,cleans teeth and gums better than any regular toothbrush,and will last up to a year</li>
            <li>This case (mine is bright lime green) is easy to use, fits my Radius toothbrush perfectly and is easy to open and close.</li>
            <li>I saw original and thought \\&quot;this should work\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t ask how I came up with that, but it works and I&#x27;ve been looking for a tampon case since the 80&#x27;s, so this is exciting for me.  </li>
            <li>That&#x27;s right.  </li>
            <li>It holds my my new fancy toothbrush as well as some toothbrush picks just fine.  </li>
            <li>Perfect fit for the brush, seems solid, I have no doubt it will last for as long as I use this toothbrush...</li>
            <li>Wow this is exactly what I needed for my Radius toothbrush, I wasn&#x27;t aware that they made cases for them.</li>
            <li>Because I am the only one in my house with a radius toothbrush right now, I like that</li>
            <li>which means that, as long as I am using Scuba brushes, I will have my bright pink case for my black toothbrush.</li>
            <li>Mine is a very unmanly shade of pink.</li>
            <li>, I suppose this guy will live with his pink case and like it.</li>

            <li> Ordered specifically because seller shows three color options - black, silver, and clear.</li>

            <li> These are too small for regular toothbrushes.  </li>
            <li> The only thingyou can keep your toothbrush in besides a baggie, which looks ridiculous.  </li>
            <li> Too bad, since I really like the Radius toothbrush cases.  </li>
            <li> My fault for not reading past \\&quot;Original/Scuba\\&quot; part.  </li>
            <li> Really sucks</li>

            <li> Ordered specifically because seller shows three color options - black, silver, and clear. Color shipped is random. Ok, understood. Could have been happy with any of the colors shown. Received a Pepto pink version. Hate the color! Not at all what I wanted. Really sucks and I can&#x27;t imagine why anyone would choose the color they sent - don&#x27;t know why anyone would manufacture it.&lt;br /&gt;Functional, but Fugly!</li>
            <li> Love this brush best I ever used,cleans teeth and gums better than any regular toothbrush,and will last up to a year</li>
            <li> The only thingyou can keep your toothbrush in besides a baggie, which looks ridiculous.  I can travel with this too.</li>
            <li> It holds my my new fancy toothbrush as well as some toothbrush picks just fine.  I only wish I could choose the color.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s what my dentist says! Now when I go they do not scrape for hours and my gums do not bleed. Buying one for everyone in my family!!!!</li>
            <li> Good case for traveling but you need to drill a hole in it, so whatever is in the case won&#x27;t fester.</li>
            <li> These are perfect and essential if you travel with a Radius toothbrush.</li>
            <li> You might want to include a color request in your purchase instructions. Mine is a very unmanly shade of pink. But.... works great to hold your odd-shaped Radius brush.</li>
            <li> Obviously I like this item because it keeps my oddly-sized toothbrush lint and dirt-free when I travel.  What is not to like about that!? Because I am the only one in my house with a radius toothbrush right now, I like that I can tell which toothbrush is mine without opening all the cases...but if anyone else gets one, we can color-coordinate, so we will all know which one is ours.  I am actually getting another one because I discovered that I can us it in my purse to store tampons.  That&#x27;s right.  A toothbrush case.  For tampons.  lol.  Don&#x27;t ask how I came up with that, but it works and I&#x27;ve been looking for a tampon case since the 80&#x27;s, so this is exciting for me.  Another possible use? Sewing paraphernalia.  I like to take hand-work with me sometimes, and I can store floss, my needle and sewing scissors in here.  Now I have to get three.  I should stop reviewing this now so I don&#x27;t think up another reason to buy more...</li>
            <li> for My favorite toothbrush</li>
            <li> Really love the product and really great price at that.... will be looking forward to plenty more purchases like this in the future.</li>
            <li> Love the case.  I got it for my son for when he leaves for college.  Make everything more hygienic. He can just throw it in his shower caddy and off he goes.</li>
            <li> This case (mine is bright lime green) is easy to use, fits my Radius toothbrush perfectly and is easy to open and close. Great for travel, but I even use it at home. I love it!</li>
            <li> These are too small for regular toothbrushes.  My fault for not reading past \\&quot;Original/Scuba\\&quot; part.  I saw original and thought \\&quot;this should work\\&quot;.  It didn&#x27;t.  Too bad, since I really like the Radius toothbrush cases.  I just picked the wrong one.</li>
            <li> Wow this is exactly what I needed for my Radius toothbrush, I wasn&#x27;t aware that they made cases for them. Thank you Radius, I&#x27;ll never return to a regular toothbrush again.</li>
            <li> Very good, but one of the snaps on the closure tab broke almost immediately.  Still I&#x27;ve used it like this for several months and otherwise it keeps doing what it&#x27;s supposed to.</li>
            <li> It was stated that this case fits most toothbrushes... unless you have toothbrush about the length of a writing pen don&#x27;t bother.</li>
            <li> A great case to match a great toothbrush. Perfect fit for the brush, seems solid, I have no doubt it will last for as long as I use this toothbrush...which means that, as long as I am using Scuba brushes, I will have my bright pink case for my black toothbrush. Not my first choice, but since everything else about the toothbrush and the travel case are great, I suppose this guy will live with his pink case and like it.</li>
