            <li>I also think the smell is pleasant.</li>
            <li>So even though it seems like a good shampoo, I can&#x27;t use it, which is why I give it one star.</li>

            <li>I love this stuff!  </li>
            <li>but until I find something comparable I&#x27;ll stick with this as I love what it does for my hair!</li>
            <li>The smell is amazing too.</li>
            <li>I became hooked from a sample that was sent my way from a popular monthly cosmetic subscription company.</li>
            <li>My hair is so shiny and feels so clean after a wash!!</li>
            <li>For those who are scent-sensitive, as I am, or need to be around others who are, this product has a very strong perfume.</li>

            <li>I love a nice smelling shampoo</li>
            <li>So far, I&#x27;m impressed by the results.</li>
            <li>Out of everything I&#x27;ve tried, they seem to do the best job of keeping my hair in great condition and have made it feel softer than other shampoo/conditioner pairs have been able to.</li>
            <li>Love, love, love!</li>
            <li>It feels great in the hair and it does such a great job in keeping my hair shiny.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t purchase this shampoo from Amazon, but I&#x27;m totally in love with it.</li>
            <li>This product will change your life. :)</li>
            <li>favorit is the Conditioner which is better than some mask.</li>
            <li>Love the way it makes my hair feel</li>
            <li>and I fell in love with the scent and</li>
            <li>Love this shampoo.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve been in love ever sense.</li>
            <li>It isn&#x27;t necessarily my favorite of all the hair products I&#x27;ve tried, but it isn&#x27;t overwhelming.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have no doubt that it is the authentic product.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s a shame, because I love what it does for my hair, but I just can&#x27;t handle the smell without getting a head ache.</li>
            <li>I love this shampoo&#x27;</li>
            <li>They have commented  on the smell of my hair on more than one occasion.  </li>
            <li>I love the Davines shampoo, but I&#x27;m even more in love with the conditioner.  </li>
            <li>and I am concerned if it is authentic.</li>
            <li>Amazing shampoo, and smells fabulous.  </li>
            <li>Best shampoo ever it doesn&#x27;t ruin my red color treated hair</li>
            <li>and I love the smell</li>
            <li>LOVE it.  </li>
            <li>I LOVE LOVE</li>
            <li>Smells amazing and leaves my hair feeling clean but not stripped.</li>
            <li>Some reviews say that the smell is strong or even &amp;#34;strange&amp;#34;, but I love the way it smells.  </li>
            <li>My hair is ridiculously fine and this shampoo does wonders for my hair, as do most of Davine&#x27;s products that I use.</li>
            <li>My hair is smooth, shiny and healthy with the Oi shampoo.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Too much perfume in this product which can&#x27;t be good for our hair.</li>
            <li>I purchased this shampoo at a salon and loved it so much, I bought some for my daughters</li>
            <li>I think that the company should let the consumers know in their advertising about the strong scent.</li>
            <li>wa so strong</li>
            <li>I like the shampoo but the scent is SO strong.</li>
            <li>Oi makes my hair shiny, smooth, frizz-free and they smell fantastic.</li>
            <li>I am so happy there is an alternative to American shampoos.</li>
            <li>I have a great regime for warding off the brassiness that can plague blonde hair</li>
            <li>My hair is smooth, dries faster</li>
            <li>Almost like a cheap incense.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t have time to always stop there to restock, so this site is always my backup in finding my products and free shipping and returns.</li>
            <li>It smells so good &amp; makes my hair really soft.  </li>
            <li>Very nice, gentle shampoo that leaves my fine hair soft but manageable, and not frizzy.  </li>
            <li>Leaves my hair feeling clean and moisturized.</li>
            <li>My stylist recommended it to me and he was right!</li>
            <li>This shampoo made my hair soft after the first use, it is a good product</li>
            <li>I have other Oi products and this shampoo is a great addition to my collection.</li>
            <li>Smell takes a some time to get used to, but other than that it is great.  </li>
            <li>I am over 50 &amp; struggle to find shampoo that provides good control, volume &amp; doesn&#x27;t dry out my hair.</li>
            <li>This gentle shampoo smells like  baby powder and easily lathers up into luxurious suds.</li>
            <li>but these products are worth every penny.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m giving it 4/5 stars because I&#x27;m not crazy about the scent.</li>
            <li>but the results are worth it.</li>
            <li>Worth it and</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m unsure right now if the performance of this shampoo justifies the hefty price.</li>
            <li>Whatever that oil is gives your hair such a shine, such a beautiful feel, people WILL NOTICE.</li>
            <li>My hair is soft and shiny and strong after using this.</li>
            <li>Lots of suds, makes hair feel really soft/shiny, does have a heavy fragrance, but it&#x27;s not bad, and I skip the perfume on days I use this, and I receive compliments on how good I smell.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s also worth noting that in addition to using both the shampoo and conditioner in this line, I do also use the Davines OI / Oil Absolute Beautifying Potion - 4.56 oz and Davines</li>
            <li>Great shampoo for my thick processed hair.</li>
            <li>LOVE this stuff after discovering at my local salon.</li>
            <li>Other than that it is a nice product.</li>
            <li>However I kept using it because I love the way it makes my hair feel; it cleanses without drying my hair out and also without weighing it down so that my hair feels clean, soft and full of body.  </li>
            <li>nice product, highly recommend if you have dry hair.</li>
            <li>A pea sized amount lathers very well and cleans hair very gently.</li>
            <li>Super shiny and soft!  </li>
            <li>I have been using this shampoo for a few years and love it!</li>
            <li>I have blonde fine oily hair</li>
            <li>This is the real deal, and at a decent savings, too!</li>
            <li>I really recomend to use it with the rest of it line.</li>
            <li>Too much product comes out.  </li>
            <li>I really like the scent.  </li>
            <li>and I don&#x27;t use much.  </li>
            <li>Highly perfumed!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also worth noting that I bought this directly from my salon</li>
            <li>so I can&#x27;t verify the authenticity of what&#x27;s being sold here, but can say that when you getthe real deal product, it is awesome.&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall for my hair needs I absolutely adore this shampoo.</li>
            <li>I use Davines and really like it</li>
            <li>but this is a bit much in my opinion.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s just too much).</li>
            <li>My hair is much softer to touch, shiny, and bouncy.</li>
            <li>After a wash, my hair feels clean, light, and fluffy.  </li>
            <li>I love using this shampoo every other time I wash my hair to give it a boost of shine and volume.</li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t even turn it back because it will take more time to put it back.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this shampoo.</li>
            <li>but it doesn&#x27;t do much to keep the moisture in my hair and give me the soft feel I&#x27;m looking for.</li>
            <li>my almost curly, not-really straight course hair is soft and easier to style.  </li>
            <li>Love this shampoo, doesn&#x27;t make my hair limp and gives my hair shine all day</li>
            <li>Basically, it is the kind of hair that can look fantastic or depressing depending on how I style it and what products I use.</li>
            <li>After using this product my hair felt super dry.</li>
            <li>The first morning I ever used Davines Oi Shampoo, everyone in my office asked what was different about my hair.</li>
            <li>how soft and silky it made my hair feel!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not sure if I&#x27;m seeing better results because I&#x27;m using multiple products from the same brand vs. this shampoo and conditioner alone, but did feel it was worth noting.  </li>
            <li>As I said, the scent is amazing and even though the bottle is only 3 oz or so, it lastes me about three and a half to four months of nearly daily use.</li>
            <li>It left my hair super soft and manageable without leaving it flat or oily looking.  </li>
            <li>No matter how much a shampoo and conditioner pair promised to make my hair soft, it never seemed to be enough to make a difference.</li>
            <li>Shiny, sleek, soft and with NO frizz.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t wash my hair often and this lets me extend the time between washes, plus it keeps my hair so soft and shiny.</li>
            <li>I received a complete fraud...</li>
            <li>This seems to be frequently knocked off.</li>
            <li>soft and shine like you&#x27;ve never had.</li>
            <li>I was introduced to this shampoo several months ago by my hair dresser and at first I didn&#x27;t care for it as the smell is very different and did take some getting used to.  </li>
            <li>(Kevin Murphy Blonde Angel which I would highly recommend for that purpose),</li>
            <li>A little goes a long way - Davines Oi makes your hair soft, smooth, and silky.</li>
            <li>After a few uses my hair has a nice sheen to it and is very soft to touch.&lt;br /&gt;Smells weird.</li>

            <li> nice product, highly recommend if you have dry hair.</li>
            <li> A pea sized amount lathers very well and cleans hair very gently.</li>
            <li> Super shiny and soft!  </li>
            <li> I have been using this shampoo for a few years and love it!</li>
            <li> I have blonde fine oily hair</li>
            <li> This is the real deal, and at a decent savings, too!</li>
            <li> I really recomend to use it with the rest of it line.</li>
            <li> Too much product comes out.  </li>
            <li> I really like the scent.  </li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t use much.  </li>
            <li> Highly perfumed!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also worth noting that I bought this directly from my salon</li>
            <li> so I can&#x27;t verify the authenticity of what&#x27;s being sold here, but can say that when you getthe real deal product, it is awesome.&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall for my hair needs I absolutely adore this shampoo.</li>
            <li> I use Davines and really like it</li>
            <li> but this is a bit much in my opinion.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s just too much).</li>
            <li> My hair is much softer to touch, shiny, and bouncy.</li>
            <li> After a wash, my hair feels clean, light, and fluffy.  </li>
            <li> I love using this shampoo every other time I wash my hair to give it a boost of shine and volume.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t even turn it back because it will take more time to put it back.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this shampoo.</li>
            <li> but it doesn&#x27;t do much to keep the moisture in my hair and give me the soft feel I&#x27;m looking for.</li>
            <li> my almost curly, not-really straight course hair is soft and easier to style.  </li>
            <li> Love this shampoo, doesn&#x27;t make my hair limp and gives my hair shine all day</li>
            <li> Basically, it is the kind of hair that can look fantastic or depressing depending on how I style it and what products I use.</li>
            <li> After using this product my hair felt super dry.</li>
            <li> The first morning I ever used Davines Oi Shampoo, everyone in my office asked what was different about my hair.</li>
            <li> how soft and silky it made my hair feel!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if I&#x27;m seeing better results because I&#x27;m using multiple products from the same brand vs. this shampoo and conditioner alone, but did feel it was worth noting.  </li>
            <li> As I said, the scent is amazing and even though the bottle is only 3 oz or so, it lastes me about three and a half to four months of nearly daily use.</li>
            <li> It left my hair super soft and manageable without leaving it flat or oily looking.  </li>
            <li> No matter how much a shampoo and conditioner pair promised to make my hair soft, it never seemed to be enough to make a difference.</li>
            <li> Shiny, sleek, soft and with NO frizz.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t wash my hair often and this lets me extend the time between washes, plus it keeps my hair so soft and shiny.</li>
            <li> I received a complete fraud...</li>
            <li> This seems to be frequently knocked off.</li>
            <li> soft and shine like you&#x27;ve never had.</li>
            <li> I was introduced to this shampoo several months ago by my hair dresser and at first I didn&#x27;t care for it as the smell is very different and did take some getting used to.  </li>
            <li> (Kevin Murphy Blonde Angel which I would highly recommend for that purpose),</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way - Davines Oi makes your hair soft, smooth, and silky.</li>
            <li> After a few uses my hair has a nice sheen to it and is very soft to touch.&lt;br /&gt;Smells weird.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if my sample was just not as strongly scented because it loses some of that due to the packaging or the smaller amount of product in the container, but I am sensitive to scents and this product was just not working for me on that</li>
            <li> The bottle looks small, but it doesn&#x27;t take much.  </li>
            <li> this smallish looking bottle can last a long time!</li>
            <li> This came unsealed and the color is a dark yellow color instead of a white color like the one I am currently using that I purchased at my salon.  </li>
            <li> the packaging is slightly off (all of the text is centered on the middle of the label and uses a SLIGHTLY different font).  </li>
            <li> that also tends to be naturally dry and wiry and that gets subjected to a lot of heat styling.</li>
            <li> People rave about the scent, but if you read my other reviews, I&#x27;m sensitive to overly scented items, and I find this shampoo a bit too strong smelling (the scent isn&#x27;t bad...</li>
            <li> I usually purchase it directly at my salon.</li>
            <li> I typically purchase through my salon, so I can&#x27;t vouch for the quality that is sold through sites such as Amazon (or others)</li>
            <li> Yes, it&#x27;s a bit pricey, but I had some pretty bad dry scalp issues and they are completely gone after using this product!  </li>
            <li> Expensive but worth every penny.</li>
            <li> so there is a little grey in it as well -</li>
            <li> A little goes a long.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s like I don&#x27;t want to use any other shampoo now.</li>
            <li> The consistency of the shampoo (and conditioner) were not right.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s always tempting to get something cheaper because the price is steep (especially if you have thick, longer hair like me and are using a lot)</li>
            <li> Made my hair staticky, and I hate static hair.</li>
            <li> Better than drugstore crap..</li>
            <li> It moisturizes my hair without weighing it down.</li>
            <li> I have thick hair that is colored, going grey and does not have the Virginia humidity</li>
            <li> My hair is dry, processed, thick, wavy and prone to frizz.</li>
            <li> I just spritz in a little</li>
            <li> Lid was broken when I open the thin yellow envelop and plastic bubbles inside of it.</li>
            <li> It was too messy</li>
            <li> Just need a small amount.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve since heard that purchasing places like this often gets you products that were exposed to extreme temperatures and are not able to be sold at the salon because the quality is poor.  </li>
            <li> I have thick color treated hair (salon lightened to blonde with low lights, toner and base bump)</li>
            <li> This product is not genuine!!</li>
            <li> A little expensive but your hair will thank you.</li>
            <li> this is expensive, but you&#x27;ll notice the difference in your hair.  </li>
            <li> I have had a couple of bogus Oi products off Amazon lately and am very frustrated.  </li>
            <li> To date, I&#x27;ve always gone in hopeful and ended up disappointed.</li>
            <li> The smell is also off and my hair feels terrible.  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Lid was broken when I open the thin yellow envelop and plastic bubbles inside of it. It was too messy I couldn&#x27;t even turn it back because it will take more time to put it back.</li>
            <li> The smell is both overpowering and yet somewhat addictive. I can&#x27;t stop smelling my hair. I love using this shampoo every other time I wash my hair to give it a boost of shine and volume.</li>
            <li> Love this shampoo, doesn&#x27;t make my hair limp and gives my hair shine all day</li>
            <li> This shampoo and all the OI line made wonders to my hair. Now I have the hair I used to. Shiny, sleek, soft and with NO frizz. I really recomend to use it with the rest of it line.</li>
            <li> Smells amazing and leaves my hair feeling clean but not stripped.</li>
            <li> nice product, highly recommend if you have dry hair.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t purchase this shampoo from Amazon, but I&#x27;m totally in love with it. I recommend it to all of my friends. It&#x27;s like I don&#x27;t want to use any other shampoo now. It will spoil you forever. The scent is heavenly and lingers all day. Whatever that oil is gives your hair such a shine, such a beautiful feel, people WILL NOTICE. I became hooked from a sample that was sent my way from a popular monthly cosmetic subscription company. The first morning I ever used Davines Oi Shampoo, everyone in my office asked what was different about my hair. The color looked brighter. The cut looked freshened up. I&#x27;m dead-serious. This product will change your life. :)</li>
            <li> Nothing I don&#x27;t like about this product. It&#x27;s great!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this line (Oi)  for years. My hair is dry, processed, thick, wavy and prone to frizz. I&#x27;m over 40 so there is a little grey in it as well - these products work so well - I&#x27;d hesitate to even try something else. Oi makes my hair shiny, smooth, frizz-free and they smell fantastic. I typically purchase through my salon, so I can&#x27;t vouch for the quality that is sold through sites such as Amazon (or others) but these products are worth every penny.</li>
            <li> Very nice, gentle shampoo that leaves my fine hair soft but manageable, and not frizzy.  The bottle looks small, but it doesn&#x27;t take much.  My stylist recommended it to me and he was right!</li>
            <li> I use to use pureology and kerastase and I am not going back. My hair is smooth, shiny and healthy with the Oi shampoo.&lt;br /&gt;My favorit is the Conditioner which is better than some mask.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t care for the bottle - Too much product comes out.  It needs some control to manage the amount poured.  Wasteful.  Other than that it is a nice product.</li>
            <li> Love davines!!! I have been using this shampoo for a few years and love it! My hair is so shiny and feels so clean after a wash!!</li>
            <li> I love this shampoo! It feels great in the hair and it does such a great job in keeping my hair shiny.</li>
            <li> The shampoo leaves my hair manageable &amp; controllable.  I am over 50 &amp; struggle to find shampoo that provides good control, volume &amp; doesn&#x27;t dry out my hair.</li>
            <li> I really like the scent.  Also it lathers up beautifully and rinses out well.</li>
            <li> I love this shampoo! I don&#x27;t wash my hair often and this lets me extend the time between washes, plus it keeps my hair so soft and shiny. I&#x27;m giving it 4/5 stars because I&#x27;m not crazy about the scent.</li>
            <li> My hair is ridiculously fine and this shampoo does wonders for my hair, as do most of Davine&#x27;s products that I use. I am so happy there is an alternative to American shampoos. Also, they spend their money on quality ingredients instead of fancy graphics. Intelligent Company...love that!</li>
            <li> I have been using this shampoo for over a year now.  I usually purchase it directly at my salon. I will never again purchase anywhere else but my salon.  The consistency of the shampoo (and conditioner) were not right.  I&#x27;ve since heard that purchasing places like this often gets you products that were exposed to extreme temperatures and are not able to be sold at the salon because the quality is poor.  I believe that to be the case.</li>
            <li> This shampoo is a god send. My hair has never been healthier, shinier, or silkier since using Oi.</li>
            <li> Scent is gorgeous!  Love the way it makes my hair feel and I don&#x27;t use much.  Great product.</li>
            <li> Product does not seem to be the same as when I get it at the salon I go to for all my hair needs.</li>
            <li> I also bought the conditioner and the All in One Milk because my stylist used it on my hair and I fell in love with the scent and how soft and silky it made my hair feel!</li>
            <li> Highly perfumed! For those who are scent-sensitive, as I am, or need to be around others who are, this product has a very strong perfume. So even though it seems like a good shampoo, I can&#x27;t use it, which is why I give it one star. I think that the company should let the consumers know in their advertising about the strong scent.</li>
            <li> Love this shampoo. My hair looks and smells wonderful.</li>
            <li> I have thick color treated hair (salon lightened to blonde with low lights, toner and base bump) that also tends to be naturally dry and wiry and that gets subjected to a lot of heat styling. Basically, it is the kind of hair that can look fantastic or depressing depending on how I style it and what products I use. I have a great regime for warding off the brassiness that can plague blonde hair (Kevin Murphy Blonde Angel which I would highly recommend for that purpose), but it doesn&#x27;t do much to keep the moisture in my hair and give me the soft feel I&#x27;m looking for. So I&#x27;ve been on the hunt for a shampoo and conditioner pair to use on the days I don&#x27;t use a violet shampoo. To date, I&#x27;ve always gone in hopeful and ended up disappointed. No matter how much a shampoo and conditioner pair promised to make my hair soft, it never seemed to be enough to make a difference. Then I tried the Davines Oi shampoo and conditioner and I&#x27;ve been in love ever sense. Out of everything I&#x27;ve tried, they seem to do the best job of keeping my hair in great condition and have made it feel softer than other shampoo/conditioner pairs have been able to. It&#x27;s not a miracle cure (though I&#x27;m not convinced any product is) but it definitely makes a noticeable difference. I also think the smell is pleasant. It isn&#x27;t necessarily my favorite of all the hair products I&#x27;ve tried, but it isn&#x27;t overwhelming.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s also worth noting that in addition to using both the shampoo and conditioner in this line, I do also use the Davines OI / Oil Absolute Beautifying Potion - 4.56 oz and Davines THIS IS A RELAXING MOISTURIZING FLUID after towel drying and before styling my hair. I&#x27;m not sure if I&#x27;m seeing better results because I&#x27;m using multiple products from the same brand vs. this shampoo and conditioner alone, but did feel it was worth noting.  It&#x27;s also worth noting that I bought this directly from my salon so I can&#x27;t verify the authenticity of what&#x27;s being sold here, but can say that when you getthe real deal product, it is awesome.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall for my hair needs I absolutely adore this shampoo. Whenever I stock up and see the price tag it&#x27;s always tempting to get something cheaper because the price is steep (especially if you have thick, longer hair like me and are using a lot) but the results are worth it.</li>
            <li> Great shampoo for my thick processed hair. I have thick hair that is colored, going grey and does not have the Virginia humidity well. This shampoo is amazing and is the best i&#x27;ve ever tried. My hair is smooth, dries faster and I couldn&#x27;t be happier.</li>
            <li> I received a complete fraud...the packaging is slightly off (all of the text is centered on the middle of the label and uses a SLIGHTLY different font).  The smell is also off and my hair feels terrible.  I have had a couple of bogus Oi products off Amazon lately and am very frustrated.  This seems to be frequently knocked off.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff!  It smells so good &amp; makes my hair really soft.  I have no doubt that it is the authentic product.</li>
            <li> I had gotten a sample of this shampoo and loved it.  It left my hair super soft and manageable without leaving it flat or oily looking.  Was looking forward to getting the product to use regularly, but when it arrived the scent wa so strong I had to send it back.  I&#x27;m not sure if my sample was just not as strongly scented because it loses some of that due to the packaging or the smaller amount of product in the container, but I am sensitive to scents and this product was just not working for me on that level.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a shame, because I love what it does for my hair, but I just can&#x27;t handle the smell without getting a head ache.</li>
            <li> Love, love, love! I found this shampoo from my Birchbox but it was cheaper to buy it here on Amazon. Mmmm, the smell is divine. I don&#x27;t even have to condition my hair after using this - I just spritz in a little It&#x27;s a 10 oil. As I said, the scent is amazing and even though the bottle is only 3 oz or so, it lastes me about three and a half to four months of nearly daily use.</li>
            <li> I was introduced to this shampoo several months ago by my hair dresser and at first I didn&#x27;t care for it as the smell is very different and did take some getting used to.  However I kept using it because I love the way it makes my hair feel; it cleanses without drying my hair out and also without weighing it down so that my hair feels clean, soft and full of body.  I have looked for a replacement shampoo as the price makes me cringe but until I find something comparable I&#x27;ll stick with this as I love what it does for my hair!</li>
            <li> The best product yet out there. soft and shine like you&#x27;ve never had.</li>
            <li> I use Davines and really like it but I do not care for the Oi line. Just doesn&#x27;t work for my hair</li>
            <li> So far the best shampoo I&#x27;ve used.&lt;br /&gt;If you leave it a bit longer before washing out, you may even skip conditioner - it makes your hair silky and smooth.&lt;br /&gt;The smell is awesome.</li>
            <li> I love this shampoo&#x27; I&#x27;ve been using it for about 2 years. I have blonde fine oily hair And this product gives my hair volume and shine without the oil.  Oh. And it smells really good.</li>
            <li> Leaves my hair feeling clean and moisturized. The smell is heavenly!</li>
            <li> By far the best hair product I&#x27;ve used!  Yes, it&#x27;s a bit pricey, but I had some pretty bad dry scalp issues and they are completely gone after using this product!  Some reviews say that the smell is strong or even &amp;#34;strange&amp;#34;, but I love the way it smells.  I&#x27;m a teacher, and I&#x27;m often in close proximity to my students.  They have commented  on the smell of my hair on more than one occasion.  I love the Davines shampoo, but I&#x27;m even more in love with the conditioner.  A really great product!</li>
            <li> This bottle smells like a bottle of medicine, and even when you rinse your hair the smell was still there.</li>
            <li> Made my hair staticky, and I hate static hair. Too much perfume in this product which can&#x27;t be good for our hair.</li>
            <li> This came unsealed and the color is a dark yellow color instead of a white color like the one I am currently using that I purchased at my salon.  It doesn&#x27;t smell as fragrant as the one I have and I am concerned if it is authentic.</li>
            <li> Lots of suds, makes hair feel really soft/shiny, does have a heavy fragrance, but it&#x27;s not bad, and I skip the perfume on days I use this, and I receive compliments on how good I smell. Can&#x27;t complain about my hair looking and feeling great, and smelling nice too!</li>
            <li> Amazing shampoo, and smells fabulous.  People always comment on how great my hair smells</li>
            <li> Best shampoo ever it doesn&#x27;t ruin my red color treated hair and I love the smell</li>
            <li> Paired with Davines Oi Conditioner my almost curly, not-really straight course hair is soft and easier to style.  Expensive but worth every penny.</li>
            <li> This shampoo is wonderful. It makes my hair smell so good and it is a perfect match with the conditioner. I highly recommend this shampoo. Get it with the conditioner. I have other Oi products and this shampoo is a great addition to my collection.</li>
            <li> I purchased this shampoo at a salon and loved it so much, I bought some for my daughters</li>
            <li> This one of the  best shampoos out there. A little expensive but your hair will thank you. After a few uses my hair has a nice sheen to it and is very soft to touch.&lt;br /&gt;Smells weird. Almost like a cheap incense.</li>
            <li> LOVE it.  You get what you pay for - this is expensive, but you&#x27;ll notice the difference in your hair.  After a wash, my hair feels clean, light, and fluffy.  Great smell.</li>
            <li> This shampoo made my hair soft after the first use, it is a good product and I would buy it again.</li>
            <li> I like the shampoo but the scent is SO strong. I love a nice smelling shampoo but this is a bit much in my opinion.</li>
            <li> Do not buy from this seller!! After using this product my hair felt super dry. This product is not genuine!!</li>
            <li> This is the real deal, and at a decent savings, too!</li>
            <li> I now have beautiful hair!  Super shiny and soft!  Smell takes a some time to get used to, but other than that it is great.  Just need a small amount.  this smallish looking bottle can last a long time!</li>
            <li> This was a great value.</li>
            <li> My hair is soft and shiny and strong after using this. People rave about the scent, but if you read my other reviews, I&#x27;m sensitive to overly scented items, and I find this shampoo a bit too strong smelling (the scent isn&#x27;t bad...it&#x27;s just too much). I&#x27;m unsure right now if the performance of this shampoo justifies the hefty price.</li>
            <li> I have been using this shampoo only for a week along with the OI Conditioner. So far, I&#x27;m impressed by the results. A little goes a long. A pea sized amount lathers very well and cleans hair very gently. The smell is amazing too. My hair is much softer to touch, shiny, and bouncy. It moisturizes my hair without weighing it down. I&#x27;m very happy with it and will surely buy again! Thank you Davines!</li>
            <li> I LOVE LOVE LOVE this stuff after discovering at my local salon. Don&#x27;t have time to always stop there to restock, so this site is always my backup in finding my products and free shipping and returns. Can&#x27;t beat that. I know the smell and texture of this product, so def know I have legitimate stuff. Better than drugstore crap.. I invest in hair products, especially after you pay A LOT at the salon to look FAB! Worth it and the smell gets lots on compliments.</li>
            <li> The best shampoo money can buy!!</li>
            <li> This gentle shampoo smells like  baby powder and easily lathers up into luxurious suds. A little goes a long way - Davines Oi makes your hair soft, smooth, and silky.</li>
