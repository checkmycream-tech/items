    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>It is also the best quality honey wax that I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li>I have to tell waxing is the best</li>
            <li>It was perfect!  </li>
            <li>I especially love that the strips are reusable.</li>
            <li>and whats great is that the strips are washable so you can reuse them!  </li>
            <li>The best part is its not goeey and watery like the&lt;br /&gt;Nair</li>
            <li>Perfect stuff if you&#x27;re in a time crunch.</li>
            <li>As another stated, at best you&#x27;ll get a couple of hairs, but it&#x27;s not going to give you a spa/salon quality wax.</li>
            <li>I feel awesome!</li>
            <li>Excellent for beginners!</li>
            <li>The roller works well and dispenses the perfect amount of wax</li>
            <li>(best result can be derived if used just after taking a bath and when no moisturiser is applied) and the direction in which it has to be pulled etc etc.</li>
            <li>But for me, it is excellent.</li>
            <li>and I am very happy I did.</li>
            <li>Works great!  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It is best to apply baby powder before waxing with this.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li>This product works perfectly.</li>
            <li>This is a great product!</li>
            <li>The best thing for waxing I have ever used.</li>
            <li>Works very good.</li>
            <li>Good product!</li>
            <li>Great wax kit that is TRULY RINSABLE with water...</li>
            <li>I waxed both of my legs with one of those, it&#x27;s really great.</li>
            <li>great concept but did not work for me.</li>
            <li>but it gets 98% of the job done, so I am happy with it.</li>
            <li>Happy waxing ladies :</li>
            <li>I am so happy I found this.</li>
            <li>This product is great if you wax at home.</li>
            <li>worked absolutely great in removing leg hair.</li>
            <li>They used to have a great product.  </li>
            <li>I would suggest buying your own waxing strips, because the ones that come with this aren&#x27;t the best and feels like paper.</li>
            <li>I always shaved my legs until discovering this product, which works great.</li>
            <li>That formula gets 1 star from me, but the Milk and Honey is a great buy.</li>
            <li>This greatly effects how efficient of a wax you will have and prevent patches of hair from being unwaxed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I am happy I can get it at Amazon and avoid the lines at the store!&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li>All this for $10 is an awesome deal (Saved more than $50).</li>
            <li>Honestly the roll on feature is what sold me on this product and is why I will keep using it!  </li>
            <li>This roll on wax is too good.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The product was delivered in good condition.</li>
            <li>concept was good, but the implementation not so good.</li>
            <li>Smells good, but that&#x27;s about it.</li>
            <li>up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I got the Nair home, undid the packaging and loved how the package becomes a &#x27;holder&#x27; for the roll on.</li>
            <li>so I have good practice.</li>
            <li>The waxing strips that come with it have good quality</li>
            <li>loved it .</li>
            <li>I just like the convenience of rolling this on my skin and have the wax come at a good rate.</li>
            <li>I loved this1 product and will start doing all my waxing my self.</li>
            <li>This is a great-quality wax, it is very easy to warm up and apply and great for DIY hair removal.</li>
            <li>I am very pleased with this product.</li>
            <li>favorite all around was the Parissa because it&#x27;s a great bang for your buck:</li>
            <li>I will continue using this product for sure!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been able to do two brazilians on myself - HA!  </li>
            <li>I love this wax!</li>
            <li>The applicator is great and easy to use.</li>
            <li>This is a great product that is easy to use and works.</li>
            <li>This wax is very handy and easy to apply.</li>
            <li>and it was amazing</li>
            <li>This product is amazing and affordable</li>
            <li>And for good reason...this product is way better:</li>
            <li>You just rinse them off with warm water.</li>
            <li>I did my own Brazilian with it.</li>
            <li>I was so thrilled to see it on Amazon.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I bought this product because I liked the idea of not having to get wax all over my hands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Since its a honey and sugar based wax, it is easier to remove with just warm water.</li>
            <li>Since its a honey and sugar based wax, it is easier to remove with just warm water.</li>
            <li>used this on both my husband and I, we both liked it.&lt;br /&gt;Took</li>
            <li>Well I always liked the idea of waxing, so I bought this product after many positive reviews convinced me it was one of the best.</li>
            <li>The idea is good and it is easy to use</li>
            <li>This is very easy to use.</li>
            <li>Its very very easy to use.</li>
            <li>Also this kit works best if applied directly to strips and then to hair removal area.  </li>
            <li>This is awesome so far...</li>
            <li>this by far their best for me.</li>
            <li>I tried all sorts of home waxes, this is by far the best.</li>
            <li>So far it is good!!</li>
            <li>It will probably work best if you use the whole thing in one go because I think the more you heat it up, the more the consitency changes.</li>
            <li>Love the fact that it washes off with warm water</li>
            <li>also like the Sally Hansen because it smells great and works pretty well.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s really easy to use this kind of wax.</li>
            <li>The wax rinses off easily with warm water.</li>
            <li>love that its cheap, effective, and easy to setup/clean up!</li>
            <li>Very happy overall!</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m just glad I bought this on sale at Walgreen&#x27;s rather than spending $9 on Amazon.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m just glad I bought this on sale at Walgreen&#x27;s rather than spending $9 on Amazon.</li>
            <li>a better deal that most drug stores.</li>
            <li>And here it is :-).</li>
            <li>More than 4 years&lt;</li>
            <li>I made sure to follow the directions.</li>
            <li>I did not know this product was on the market, I love it,</li>
            <li>Twist off the roller top and take out the safety plug.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll have a better idea about this when my calf stops       hurting.  </li>
            <li>--This is probably more my fault than that of the wax, but...</li>
            <li>I am a huge baby when it comes to any kind of pain, so I didn&#x27;t even get to finish one leg.</li>
            <li>, I need more paper before the bottle ran our of wax, so I had to order cloth strips separately.</li>
            <li>I rub my hand against the strip to create heat and it pulled out more hair.     </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m in love ‚ù§</li>
            <li>Love it</li>
            <li>Waxing takes more time than shaving does, and when the wax cools off it won&#x27;t work as well.  </li>
            <li>Afte using this product,t hen trying many others, I find this to be the easiest applicator and</li>
            <li>I love this roll on wax</li>
            <li>followed the directions to the letter more than once with no luck.</li>
            <li>Okay, so I was PREPARED to remove my hair...</li>
            <li>and my arms are so smooth!</li>
            <li>Made my hair removal routine into more of a pampering session.</li>
            <li>but I love this product.</li>
            <li>Make sure to appropriate the heating time according to the amount in the roll-on and also the colder the weather/less humidity better the wax.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>Waxing is more of technique and doing bikini areas</li>
            <li>Waxing is more of technique and doing bikini areas</li>
            <li>Also, make sure to have some sort of baby oil or something like that to get the wax off afterwards.  </li>
            <li>Love this product going to be buying this a lot more</li>
            <li>I wish I can give it more than five stars.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>It is more time consuming in one sitting</li>
            <li>but if it lasts it will surely save time</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall satisfied and hoping the results are a time benefit</li>
            <li>The problem is that the wax itself is really gooey and gummy, which means that it doesn&#x27;t get the hair off very effectively</li>
            <li>I use it on my cheeks and it&#x27;s pretty good at getting the hair off.</li>
            <li>(pretty good I would say) I need to find the refill bottles for it.</li>
            <li>I believe that was because I was so excited to be removing my hair!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s ok sometimes it&#x27;s not rolling easy</li>
            <li>I love how easy it is to use this product.</li>
            <li>Also, its water soluble, so very easy to clean and wash.</li>
            <li>waxing paper that come in the package is super easy to wash with warm water or  just throw them</li>
            <li>I am very satisfied with it in first use</li>
            <li>so I&#x27;m hoping this will give me more time with smooth legs than shaving.</li>
            <li>This product is very easy and quick to use.</li>
            <li>I bought this product because the reviews were pretty good, it seemed cheap and easy</li>
            <li>The best part is that you can wash with just water and soap after you finish, unlike other kinds of wax.</li>
            <li>It pretty much removed all the hairs I had on my legs: I could not be more happy about it.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;ll come off in hot water, too, but it&#x27;s just nice to make sure it&#x27;s smooth.</li>
            <li>It smells nice, and it&#x27;s not very painful.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s really easy to use,</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to heat up the wax in a microwave and apply.</li>
            <li>It comes off easily with water.</li>
            <li>And it just rinsed off so easy.</li>
            <li>So it was very quick.</li>
            <li>* ROLLER EASY TO USE -</li>
            <li>The wax is easily cleaned up using water and a paper towel.</li>
            <li>Roll-on is really easy to use.</li>
            <li>I would say waxing had never been so easy.</li>
            <li>I strongly prefer this in comparison to waxes in jars that are applied with sticks.</li>
            <li>While I miss the Peach/Mango scent that was the original, the new Milk and Honey is very nice.  </li>
            <li>it becomes fine.</li>
            <li>wax is so smooth and easy to use.</li>
            <li>Easy to set up, easy to use, and easy to clean up!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>It is fine maybe for someone who doesn&#x27;t want it to get all of the hairs...</li>
            <li>but my hairs are so fine</li>
            <li>QUICK!</li>
            <li>I thought I would have to buy a whole kit for 5x the price of this, gladly I don&#x27;t have to!</li>
            <li>--The roller top is super easy to clean.</li>
            <li>is someone going to come up with an affordable, razor free, at-home hair removal system</li>
            <li>is someone going to come up with an affordable, razor free, at-home hair removal system</li>
            <li>Nair is great for multiple reasons:&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li>It came off easily, leaving my skin clean.  </li>
            <li>It makes it easy to clean up and get it off.   </li>
            <li>If yours isn&#x27;t as powerful, it might take more.</li>
            <li>However, the &amp;#34;non-woven&amp;#34; strips are available at just about any beauty supply place.</li>
            <li>If given a choice I would any day prefer the clean n easy roll on wax over this wax.&lt;br</li>
            <li>This is a fantastic product.</li>
            <li>I swore by the Nair Naturally Smooth waxing kit for years but it has been discontinued.</li>
            <li>I was estatic when I saw that Nair had brought back this great product.  </li>
            <li>I am one happy camper that this product is back!!</li>
            <li>Easy to use and to keep my work area clean.  </li>
            <li>rolls on thinly, waxes off nicely, and the results are awesome!</li>
            <li>did reheat it several times to keep it nice and warm because when it cools the roller becomes stickier which makes it hurt to roll.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and I thought this product was very useful.</li>
            <li>Sally Hansen Quick and Easy Hair</li>
            <li>I would completely recommend it to first time users, or those that are experienced with getting waxed or waxing themselves.    </li>
            <li>It is easy and quick</li>
            <li>I am an AVID waxer and I LOVE this product.</li>
            <li>and it was worth it!  </li>
            <li>Well this product just isn&#x27;t worth the tears!</li>
            <li>A lot of people apply a lot more than necessary thinking more wax&#x3D; better hair removal.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I wasn&#x27;t completely sure what I was doing at first</li>
            <li>It is super easy to use, I heat it in microwave for 30secs two times for a full body wax</li>
            <li>My legs are so clean and you also don&#x27;t need anybody&#x27;s help also.</li>
            <li>easy to use, mess free and great results.</li>
            <li>Great product, you get a really good amount of wax that will last you a long time.</li>
            <li>so instead I tried another strip on my legs, where the hair grows more sparsely thanks to 1.5 decades of having shaved it.</li>
            <li>And I don&#x27;t feel the need to take a full on shower    </li>
            <li>/&gt;Though it&#x27;s a thicker wax and takes more time to heat up, it works really well for me.</li>
            <li>In some ways, this turned out to be true.</li>
            <li>Took me all of 10 minutes to do both my legs (full)</li>
            <li>It takes me between 45 minutes to 1 hour do my full legs/ full arms and under arms</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not painful</li>
            <li>The reusable strips are so handy and the wax is never to hot, and actually smells pretty nice.</li>
            <li>Just rinse them in warm water and then let dry.&lt;br /&gt;If your hair is long enough it works great.</li>
            <li>This was my first time waxing my legs and Nair Milk &amp; Honey made it super quick and easy.    </li>
            <li>Remover Wax Strip Kit For Under Arms Legs and Body Women]] probably worked the best of any of them, especially the smaller ones for eyebrows.</li>
            <li>I think that&#x27;s the main problem with most of these wax products anyways.</li>
            <li>I have been waxing regularly for almost 10 years now and have used almost all kind of waxing products available in the market.&lt;br /&gt;When</li>
            <li>You simple twist off the top, remove the plastic knob, replace top, and microwave to use.</li>
            <li>Luckily it washes off with water.</li>
            <li>I really love this wax, i am able to get 2 or 3 1/2 legs out of each bottle, i only have to use 2 strips for each leg.  </li>
            <li>I was more confident and I can see the process being a lot smoother next</li>
            <li>It warms in the microwave, the roll-on applicator applies just the right amount of wax, and it&#x27;s all water-soluble which means soap and water will clean it off of everything.&lt;br /&gt;A</li>
            <li>/&gt;The first time I used it, I made sure my hair was nice and long.</li>
            <li>The strip placed on top should be pressed in the normal direction of growth as well.</li>
            <li>Hope this review helps some of you out there.d on top should be pressed in the normal direction of growth as well.</li>
            <li>Can be quite messy BUT very easy to remove the stickiness with warm water.</li>
            <li>My only complain is that I wish there was more in the bottle!    </li>
            <li>This is a great product and you get salon results without the mess and cost.</li>
            <li>Unless you have EXTREMELY fine hair, it really doesn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li>I did both legs (up to mid-thigh) and don&#x27;t think I even used a full quarter of the bottle, so you&#x27;ll want to make sure you clean it off so you can reuse it several times.</li>
            <li>the first area I tried this on was my special lady parts.</li>
            <li>IT did a good job, although hard wax would probably be more thorough, I was please with this.  </li>
            <li>We bought this stuff because it was super cheap and looked easy to use, but we also bought a more normal tub of wax as a back</li>
            <li>I saw this and thought it look intriguing.</li>
            <li>And my skin feels so soft, much better than shaving.</li>
            <li>Honey Wax Women Wax by Nair, 5.7 Ounce works about as well as trying to get Facebook to change a feature back to something that you liked before, that is to say, not at all.</li>
            <li>I did not waste any precious seconds placing the cloth strip over the wax, smoothing in the direction of hair growth.</li>
            <li>I purchased it at Walgreens, and noticed it was on sale, thinking it was popular, but now I understand it was because it is such a pain.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The bottle is easy to hold and contains a decent amount.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It is worth trying.</li>
            <li>Needs more paper though, honestly at least double the paper is needed for a perfect waxing.</li>
            <li>one pack is good for half legs, full hands &amp; under arms.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t grab every single hair but about a pretty good amount.</li>
            <li>Love this better than Nads or other home waxing kit.</li>
            <li>I wish I understood the company&#x27;s position on discontinuing is other, very much superior product to this one.</li>
            <li>As with any other wax, the waxing will not be as good if there is humidity in the air, This can be prevented by turning on the air conditioning while you are waxing.</li>
            <li>This roll on wax is very easy to use, especially on larger areas, like the legs.</li>
            <li>high quality wax that goes on smoothly, is painless, and washes off with water (i.e., it isn&#x27;t gummy).</li>
            <li>Oh., they are reusable and I recently found that most of the strips are of the same kind.</li>
            <li>I normally go to the salon to get my waxing done, but found this product cheap in the supermarket</li>
            <li>and it worked well and wasnt nearly as excrutiating, but it&#x27;s not as easy as shaving</li>
            <li>By the time I&#x27;m finished waxing, I just need to rinse off the strips under warm water (no detergent/soap required) and hang them over the shower curtain rod to dry.  </li>
            <li>(I don&#x27;t think I pulled the strips off quick enough), it was messy and didn&#x27;t take much off in one go, this time I was pleased to find that it was easy to apply, quick to use and easy to clean</li>
            <li>I normally just keep a gallon bucket filled with hot water (as hot as it comes from the tap)</li>
            <li>Shaving more often also causes my skin to dry out, and I have sensitive skin on top of everything else.</li>
            <li>(simply wash them off with warm water) and can easily be cut into smaller sizes if need be.</li>
            <li>You can&#x27;t reuse the same strips and wax more than twice because the wax cools too quickly and won&#x27;t adhere for very long.&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li>On the first try the wax removed exactly one hair.</li>
            <li>Hot wax helps ease removal.</li>
            <li>My only issue is that I wished there were more strips</li>
            <li>TOTALLY NONE! :)&lt;</li>
            <li>Then put the roller top back on.</li>
            <li>(I&#x27;m thinking more the facial hair remover in this instance.)  </li>
            <li>;)</li>
            <li>stuff is an absolute dream!  </li>
            <li>The first time I used the spa clay one.</li>
            <li>Personally I like that one more.</li>
            <li>Saves so much time and money!</li>
            <li>Worked okay on my airs but not well enough for me to ever buy it again.</li>
            <li>;)</li>
            <li>With each peel-off, all of you hair may or may not come off, so you might have to continue trying, but it&#x27;s not difficult.</li>
            <li>First experience with DIY waxing</li>
            <li>Thanks Nair!</li>
            <li>/&gt;Works quickly, effectively and as painlessly as can be expected.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t have to be too hot to work well.</li>
            <li>Gets all the hair off first time.</li>
            <li>Only thing I wish they had included more strips with it.</li>
            <li>but I had to put for 20-25 for the first time then 5-10 seconds every time it starts thickening)</li>
            <li>I used it a whole lot!</li>
            <li>First time waxing legs</li>
            <li>so I&#x27;ll have more with the next kit.</li>
            <li>I used to use their hair remover products before switching to waxing last year and was hoping for something better.</li>
            <li>This product is a good idea, but it is too messy even with the roller.</li>
            <li>It was extremely messy, and the sugar wax did just as good of a job at removing the hair.</li>
            <li>You don&#x27;t need baby oil to clean up the sticky mess afterwards, just use warm water which is a plus,especially when you trying to re-wax a certain area; just wipe with damp cloth and ready to wax again.</li>
            <li>Heat the wax until it&#x27;s warm (not hot) to the touch.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It smells nice and is a lot cheaper than other products.</li>
            <li>With error and trial figure out how many seconds in the microwave are needed for a warm thin wax,</li>
            <li>a few more seconds than package said to warm up but only a few more.&lt;br /&gt;Strips are reusable which I loved.</li>
            <li>I did both legs (up to mid-thigh) and don&#x27;t think I even used a full quarter of the bottle, so you&#x27;ll want to make sure you clean it off so you can reuse it several times.water (no detergent/soap required) and hang them over the shower curtain rod to dry.  </li>
            <li>This is the first time I&#x27;ve ever had anything good to say about a Nair product, but this stuff is great!&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve previously used regular wax that comes in a tub, you need a special warmer for it, you spread it on with a wood tongue depressor, the strips stick to everything</li>
            <li>Simply rinse them with warm water, hang to dry, and they&#x27;ll work just as effectively the next time around.  </li>
            <li>I have purchased this at CVS in the past and have always loved this product.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy enough to use but it does not remove all of the hair.</li>
            <li>Since I have been waxing for so long, my hair grows back slower and much more fine.  </li>
            <li>It was easy as pie -- just a little bit messy, but easily cleaned with warm water.</li>
            <li>If you have a more powerful microwave, it might take less.  </li>
            <li>purchased it to use on my bikini area, and while \\&quot;holding my skin taut\\&quot; just as the instructions explained, the strip managed to tear the skin layers apart resulting in a huge under the skin bruise, looking similar to a kickey, in the crease of my thigh.</li>
            <li>very well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and I like that the strips are reusable, but it just doesn&#x27;t get much hair off my legs.&lt;br</li>
            <li>And nothing really came off.</li>
            <li>Since the wax is contained inside the roll on, there wasn&#x27;t that much for me to do...</li>
            <li>Remove the wax container and knead it gently so that the heat will distribute evenly.</li>
            <li>wax was ready to be used after 15 seconds in my microwave.</li>
            <li>really like the scent of this wax</li>
            <li>Strip are gone FAST.     </li>
            <li>which I think is pretty normal for wax in this price range).  </li>
            <li>No pain, no game.</li>
            <li>the wax is fast to heat up,easy to apply  </li>
            <li>and you&#x27;re ready to go.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The quality of the wax is really inferior.</li>
            <li>Really like the roll-on</li>
            <li>This really works well for me.</li>
            <li>Hair that grows in post-wax is MUCH softer than bristles that grow in post-shave...</li>
            <li>For me this product has worked really well.</li>
            <li>It can be really fast and convenient provided you have a lil practice with it.</li>
            <li>did my whole hands,</li>
            <li>Since this is a roll on, it gives you a lot of control on how much wax to apply.</li>
            <li>in all, I really like the product.</li>
            <li>in all, I really like the product.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m really amazed at how well it works.</li>
            <li>much time spend for no result.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>so you do not waste any more than is necessary.</li>
            <li>it is hassle free &amp; mess free and leaves you shinning and soft ;)</li>
            <li>Just make sure to follow the instructions and read some of the other reviews here for tips.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t come off with just about anything other than nail polish remover, which also removes your counter top, your vinyl flooring, and your skin.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li>Maybe this summer will be a good one instead of unpleasant and embarrassing. :)</li>
            <li>If it is too cool, it doesn&#x27;t really grab the hair enough.</li>
            <li>and anyone gets a clean body only in 15 min.</li>
            <li>If you are not used to waxing maybe you should first go to a professional.</li>
            <li>I only wish there were a way to close it and store it more properly once I have used it, because if I don&#x27;t spend all then it will leak, and there is no way of placing it so that it can stand straight, you have to bag it and lean it vertically onto something.</li>
            <li>Barely enough for full body</li>
            <li>Strips are reusable and barely enough for full body.</li>
            <li>Pull quickly in the opposite direction of hair growth.</li>
            <li>so I can&#x27;t comment on its effectiveness, however considering all the weird angles you have to remove the hair from, it might just be best to leave such areas to the experts or have a friend help</li>
            <li>so I can&#x27;t comment on its effectiveness, however considering all the weird angles you have to remove the hair from, it might just be best to leave such areas to the experts or have a friend help</li>
            <li>So I gave this a go - mainly because it&#x27;s a sugar wax, which tends to be gentler.  </li>
            <li>and I was lucky enough to have purchased about 25 bottles of it.  </li>
            <li>The wax strips cleaned off really quick and easy under hot water, and dried like new, ready for my second use!</li>
            <li>Also, one of the main reasons that i love it so much is that it just washes right off your hands or any little patches left on the legs.</li>
            <li>Microwave on high for 15 seconds.</li>
            <li>I pulled the wax strip off in one quick, smooth motion, staying parallel to my skin and holding my skin taught with the other hand while doing so.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t apply smoothly, and absolutely NO hair was removed after application.</li>
            <li>My first time I left the strip on without creating heat and it didn&#x27;t work as much, so</li>
            <li>It sure gets you sticky and messy.  </li>
            <li>This product I find much more convenient that the messy jars which you have to repeatedly heat, and run the risk of dripping all over.</li>
            <li>Waxing techniques: The wax should be applied in the normal direction of growth.</li>
            <li>Not enough wax to be worth the price and almost no paper to wax with.</li>
            <li>but i felt this milk and honey variety got a little less effective as it started to cool</li>
            <li>The roll on stick makes it easy to apply wax so that you dont put too much or too little.</li>
            <li>Fast &amp; no mess waxing at home.</li>
            <li>I did not have to use oil or anything to remove the extra wax from my skin, it came right off with water.</li>
            <li>I am an avid waxer and have been waxing since high school, and this was product is almost to the point of buying a warmer and actual wax that does not microwave.  </li>
            <li>kept a wet cloth nearby to clean up any stickiness from my hands which made rubbing the strips on easier.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I really don&#x27;t think 10 is enough for two whole legs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I was very surprised.</li>
            <li>How much of time I took for every waxing episode (Full arms and Half legs)?</li>
            <li>On the second try it removed exactly 3.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now</li>
            <li>I could have got a mocha from Peet&#x27;s for that, and not a small one either.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I could have got a mocha from Peet&#x27;s for that, and not a small one either.&lt;br</li>
            <li>This is my second time waxing and let me tell you, I wish they had had the original stuff I bought left in stock</li>
            <li>Of course, test a tiny drop before you roll it on because you don&#x27;t want it too hot</li>
            <li>The process of hair removal is pretty simple and does not leave any remains too.</li>
            <li>I was skeptical about buying this when I read some of the other product reviews, but it worked perfectly for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Mind you, I have fine hair on my arms, but it&#x27;s dark!</li>
            <li>I came across this roll on wax, I thought maybe I could use this wax at home and stop spending hundreds of dollars in the spa every month.&lt;br /&gt;So after reading all the positive reviews about this wax, I went ahead and bought both the facial as well as the body wax.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I had to cut the cloths in half to make them work better and last longer.  </li>
            <li>do think you get a few more break-offs with the roll-on wax than with the oil-based popsicle stick method, but it STILL feels so worth it to me not to lose half my Saturday once a month.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Yes, 15 seconds is the normal amount of time it takes to heat on high power in a regular microwave.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to apply (roll-on) and although it stings, it&#x27;s not nearly as bad as other waxing options I&#x27;ve tried in the past.  </li>
            <li>It saved me nearly $100 so far as each bottle lasts 3 rounds of waxing.</li>
            <li>All the hair on my arms and lower legs is completely gone.</li>
            <li>But I feel like the hair follicles weren&#x27;t completely ripped from my skin.</li>
            <li>Ready to use next time!  </li>
            <li>The only thing is that the wax is sticky and not water-soluble, and much gummier and thicker than the Parissa.</li>
            <li>DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME OR MONEY.     </li>
            <li>and then I washed the whole lot packing it away back in the container</li>
            <li>I have been using the Nair Roll-On Microwaveable Wax for at least 15 years and absolutely love it.  </li>
            <li>It is a complete kit and Includes sufficient number of strips.</li>
            <li>This lasts me for a complete waxing on hands+ underarms+ legs.</li>
            <li>I was tired of paying $40+ on bikini waxes and decided to try to wax on my own.</li>
            <li>(Sally Hansen lavender or vanilla oil-based wax with popsicle stick and strips), and had managed to get my time down to 2.5 hours for full legs.</li>
            <li>I do not like that you have to replace the little plug inside the top each time and subsequently wash out the roller, but I guess there&#x27;s no other way to offer a roller-style wax.</li>
            <li>then really pull the paper strip off with a fast, sharp motion.</li>
            <li>Convenient and no mess.</li>
            <li>No mess.</li>
            <li>No mess waxing is what i call it.</li>
            <li>Creates no mess.</li>
            <li>When you apply for the first time right after heating it up, you will feel that its pulling your hair a little bit but second time onward</li>
            <li>It may not work on shorter hair, but it worked perfectly on the parts I did, and it really was less painful than ones I have tried before.</li>
            <li>so naturally I have a lot of thick black body hair on my arms and legs and the wax does a good job in removing them.</li>
            <li>The roll on design makes it so much more convenient and less messy than the other options available on the market.</li>
            <li>The roll on design makes it so much more convenient and less messy than the other options available on the market.</li>
            <li>This product isn&#x27;t nearly as messy as traditional waxes and even if you get this wax anywhere it easily comes off with water.</li>
            <li>Wax rollar is not good as more wax is coming.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve always been curious about what it would be like to wax instead of shave, and this seems like a pretty idiot-proof product.</li>
            <li>: If you feel the wax is becoming too sticky or thick, then heat it again in the microwave for another 5-10 seconds depending on your microwave.</li>
            <li>I have used some other at-home waxing kits in the past , but i love how easy, non messy this is.</li>
            <li>This would be fine if it then removed the hairs it left behind the first time</li>
            <li>I always waxed my hands and legs myself, but I was kind of tired of those boxed wax, heating them up regularly then applying it by knife.</li>
            <li>IT DOESN&#x27;T WORK.&lt;br /&gt;tested  on a small part of my arm, found it a little too much liquid but got most of the hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I put out a heap of towels expecting a mess and waited for my husband to laugh as I applied and then pulled off the wax.</li>
            <li>It would barely clean up a quarter sized spot at a time, which considering how much it hurts means you are going through a lot of wax, pain and strips to remove the hair at a very slow pace.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>There wasn&#x27;t much pain (probably because it wasn&#x27;t actually doing anything), so I thought \\&quot;well maybe the hair has just gotten too long here</li>
            <li>I would personally rather get wax by a professional</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so worth the few</li>
            <li>Take a shower and clean the area with soap (without any moisturizers for e.g. Dove is not suitable).</li>
            <li>I was surprised that I was able to wax my entire legs and bikini line in less than a half hour!   </li>
            <li>I ended up throwing the product out with half the bottle used up because I ran out of strips (and because of the above reasons, it wasn&#x27;t worth continuing</li>
            <li>is the ONLY type of hot wax (I have tried 4-5 other brands and types of wax) that did not hurt me</li>
            <li>I almost didn&#x27;t buy this item because of all the terrible reviews I read about this item, i&#x27;m so glad I didn&#x27;t listen to them; I love this wax!</li>
            <li>The only complaint I would have was that the packaging didn&#x27;t &#x27;re-seal&#x27;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wondered if it was pure luck the first time I used it, so the next time I decided to give my underarms a go.</li>
            <li>but some methods are very messy, some are painful and some are useless but this wax is very easy to use, give excellent results without pain and creates no mess.</li>
            <li>It only worked on the fine hairs on my arm but not my coarse thick leg hair.  </li>
            <li>HALF strip can take about the whole calves.</li>
            <li>so you then have to stop once you&#x27;ve used them all, wash them, and then wait for them to dry completely.</li>
            <li>--Very little mess to clean up!</li>
            <li>tried this product after having tried several different products and having had professional waxing done, and it fell far short of the other waxes.</li>
            <li>Surprisingly, my leg isn&#x27;t throbbing too badly, and I just might consider trying this again tomorrow night.</li>

    <h2>Negative Reviews</h2>
    <ol>
            <li> It is also the best quality honey wax that I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> I have to tell waxing is the best</li>
            <li> It was perfect!  </li>
            <li> I especially love that the strips are reusable.</li>
            <li> and whats great is that the strips are washable so you can reuse them!  </li>
            <li> The best part is its not goeey and watery like the&lt;br /&gt;Nair</li>
            <li> Perfect stuff if you&#x27;re in a time crunch.</li>
            <li> As another stated, at best you&#x27;ll get a couple of hairs, but it&#x27;s not going to give you a spa/salon quality wax.</li>
            <li> I feel awesome!</li>
            <li> Excellent for beginners!</li>
            <li> The roller works well and dispenses the perfect amount of wax</li>
            <li> (best result can be derived if used just after taking a bath and when no moisturiser is applied) and the direction in which it has to be pulled etc etc.</li>
            <li> But for me, it is excellent.</li>
            <li> and I am very happy I did.</li>
            <li> Works great!  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It is best to apply baby powder before waxing with this.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li> This product works perfectly.</li>
            <li> This is a great product!</li>
            <li> The best thing for waxing I have ever used.</li>
            <li> Works very good.</li>
            <li> Good product!</li>
            <li> Great wax kit that is TRULY RINSABLE with water...</li>
            <li> I waxed both of my legs with one of those, it&#x27;s really great.</li>
            <li> great concept but did not work for me.</li>
            <li> but it gets 98% of the job done, so I am happy with it.</li>
            <li> Happy waxing ladies :</li>
            <li> I am so happy I found this.</li>
            <li> This product is great if you wax at home.</li>
            <li> worked absolutely great in removing leg hair.</li>
            <li> They used to have a great product.  </li>
            <li> I would suggest buying your own waxing strips, because the ones that come with this aren&#x27;t the best and feels like paper.</li>
            <li> I always shaved my legs until discovering this product, which works great.</li>
            <li> That formula gets 1 star from me, but the Milk and Honey is a great buy.</li>
            <li> This greatly effects how efficient of a wax you will have and prevent patches of hair from being unwaxed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I am happy I can get it at Amazon and avoid the lines at the store!&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> All this for $10 is an awesome deal (Saved more than $50).</li>
            <li> Honestly the roll on feature is what sold me on this product and is why I will keep using it!  </li>
            <li> This roll on wax is too good.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The product was delivered in good condition.</li>
            <li> concept was good, but the implementation not so good.</li>
            <li> Smells good, but that&#x27;s about it.</li>
            <li> up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I got the Nair home, undid the packaging and loved how the package becomes a &#x27;holder&#x27; for the roll on.</li>
            <li> so I have good practice.</li>
            <li> The waxing strips that come with it have good quality</li>
            <li> loved it .</li>
            <li> I just like the convenience of rolling this on my skin and have the wax come at a good rate.</li>
            <li> I loved this1 product and will start doing all my waxing my self.</li>
            <li> This is a great-quality wax, it is very easy to warm up and apply and great for DIY hair removal.</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with this product.</li>
            <li> favorite all around was the Parissa because it&#x27;s a great bang for your buck:</li>
            <li> I will continue using this product for sure!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been able to do two brazilians on myself - HA!  </li>
            <li> I love this wax!</li>
            <li> The applicator is great and easy to use.</li>
            <li> This is a great product that is easy to use and works.</li>
            <li> This wax is very handy and easy to apply.</li>
            <li> and it was amazing</li>
            <li> This product is amazing and affordable</li>
            <li> And for good reason...this product is way better:</li>
            <li> You just rinse them off with warm water.</li>
            <li> I did my own Brazilian with it.</li>
            <li> I was so thrilled to see it on Amazon.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I bought this product because I liked the idea of not having to get wax all over my hands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Since its a honey and sugar based wax, it is easier to remove with just warm water.</li>
            <li> Since its a honey and sugar based wax, it is easier to remove with just warm water.</li>
            <li> used this on both my husband and I, we both liked it.&lt;br /&gt;Took</li>
            <li> Well I always liked the idea of waxing, so I bought this product after many positive reviews convinced me it was one of the best.</li>
            <li> The idea is good and it is easy to use</li>
            <li> This is very easy to use.</li>
            <li> Its very very easy to use.</li>
            <li> Also this kit works best if applied directly to strips and then to hair removal area.  </li>
            <li> This is awesome so far...</li>
            <li> this by far their best for me.</li>
            <li> I tried all sorts of home waxes, this is by far the best.</li>
            <li> So far it is good!!</li>
            <li> It will probably work best if you use the whole thing in one go because I think the more you heat it up, the more the consitency changes.</li>
            <li> Love the fact that it washes off with warm water</li>
            <li> also like the Sally Hansen because it smells great and works pretty well.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really easy to use this kind of wax.</li>
            <li> The wax rinses off easily with warm water.</li>
            <li> love that its cheap, effective, and easy to setup/clean up!</li>
            <li> Very happy overall!</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m just glad I bought this on sale at Walgreen&#x27;s rather than spending $9 on Amazon.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m just glad I bought this on sale at Walgreen&#x27;s rather than spending $9 on Amazon.</li>
            <li> a better deal that most drug stores.</li>
            <li> And here it is :-).</li>
            <li> More than 4 years&lt;</li>
            <li> I made sure to follow the directions.</li>
            <li> I did not know this product was on the market, I love it,</li>
            <li> Twist off the roller top and take out the safety plug.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll have a better idea about this when my calf stops       hurting.  </li>
            <li> --This is probably more my fault than that of the wax, but...</li>
            <li> I am a huge baby when it comes to any kind of pain, so I didn&#x27;t even get to finish one leg.</li>
            <li> , I need more paper before the bottle ran our of wax, so I had to order cloth strips separately.</li>
            <li> I rub my hand against the strip to create heat and it pulled out more hair.     </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in love ‚ù§</li>
            <li> Love it</li>
            <li> Waxing takes more time than shaving does, and when the wax cools off it won&#x27;t work as well.  </li>
            <li> Afte using this product,t hen trying many others, I find this to be the easiest applicator and</li>
            <li> I love this roll on wax</li>
            <li> followed the directions to the letter more than once with no luck.</li>
            <li> Okay, so I was PREPARED to remove my hair...</li>
            <li> and my arms are so smooth!</li>
            <li> Made my hair removal routine into more of a pampering session.</li>
            <li> but I love this product.</li>
            <li> Make sure to appropriate the heating time according to the amount in the roll-on and also the colder the weather/less humidity better the wax.</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> Waxing is more of technique and doing bikini areas</li>
            <li> Waxing is more of technique and doing bikini areas</li>
            <li> Also, make sure to have some sort of baby oil or something like that to get the wax off afterwards.  </li>
            <li> Love this product going to be buying this a lot more</li>
            <li> I wish I can give it more than five stars.</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> It is more time consuming in one sitting</li>
            <li> but if it lasts it will surely save time</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall satisfied and hoping the results are a time benefit</li>
            <li> The problem is that the wax itself is really gooey and gummy, which means that it doesn&#x27;t get the hair off very effectively</li>
            <li> I use it on my cheeks and it&#x27;s pretty good at getting the hair off.</li>
            <li> (pretty good I would say) I need to find the refill bottles for it.</li>
            <li> I believe that was because I was so excited to be removing my hair!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ok sometimes it&#x27;s not rolling easy</li>
            <li> I love how easy it is to use this product.</li>
            <li> Also, its water soluble, so very easy to clean and wash.</li>
            <li> waxing paper that come in the package is super easy to wash with warm water or  just throw them</li>
            <li> I am very satisfied with it in first use</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m hoping this will give me more time with smooth legs than shaving.</li>
            <li> This product is very easy and quick to use.</li>
            <li> I bought this product because the reviews were pretty good, it seemed cheap and easy</li>
            <li> The best part is that you can wash with just water and soap after you finish, unlike other kinds of wax.</li>
            <li> It pretty much removed all the hairs I had on my legs: I could not be more happy about it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;ll come off in hot water, too, but it&#x27;s just nice to make sure it&#x27;s smooth.</li>
            <li> It smells nice, and it&#x27;s not very painful.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s really easy to use,</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to heat up the wax in a microwave and apply.</li>
            <li> It comes off easily with water.</li>
            <li> And it just rinsed off so easy.</li>
            <li> So it was very quick.</li>
            <li> * ROLLER EASY TO USE -</li>
            <li> The wax is easily cleaned up using water and a paper towel.</li>
            <li> Roll-on is really easy to use.</li>
            <li> I would say waxing had never been so easy.</li>
            <li> I strongly prefer this in comparison to waxes in jars that are applied with sticks.</li>
            <li> While I miss the Peach/Mango scent that was the original, the new Milk and Honey is very nice.  </li>
            <li> it becomes fine.</li>
            <li> wax is so smooth and easy to use.</li>
            <li> Easy to set up, easy to use, and easy to clean up!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> It is fine maybe for someone who doesn&#x27;t want it to get all of the hairs...</li>
            <li> but my hairs are so fine</li>
            <li> QUICK!</li>
            <li> I thought I would have to buy a whole kit for 5x the price of this, gladly I don&#x27;t have to!</li>
            <li> --The roller top is super easy to clean.</li>
            <li> is someone going to come up with an affordable, razor free, at-home hair removal system</li>
            <li> is someone going to come up with an affordable, razor free, at-home hair removal system</li>
            <li> Nair is great for multiple reasons:&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li> It came off easily, leaving my skin clean.  </li>
            <li> It makes it easy to clean up and get it off.   </li>
            <li> If yours isn&#x27;t as powerful, it might take more.</li>
            <li> However, the &amp;#34;non-woven&amp;#34; strips are available at just about any beauty supply place.</li>
            <li> If given a choice I would any day prefer the clean n easy roll on wax over this wax.&lt;br</li>
            <li> This is a fantastic product.</li>
            <li> I swore by the Nair Naturally Smooth waxing kit for years but it has been discontinued.</li>
            <li> I was estatic when I saw that Nair had brought back this great product.  </li>
            <li> I am one happy camper that this product is back!!</li>
            <li> Easy to use and to keep my work area clean.  </li>
            <li> rolls on thinly, waxes off nicely, and the results are awesome!</li>
            <li> did reheat it several times to keep it nice and warm because when it cools the roller becomes stickier which makes it hurt to roll.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and I thought this product was very useful.</li>
            <li> Sally Hansen Quick and Easy Hair</li>
            <li> I would completely recommend it to first time users, or those that are experienced with getting waxed or waxing themselves.    </li>
            <li> It is easy and quick</li>
            <li> I am an AVID waxer and I LOVE this product.</li>
            <li> and it was worth it!  </li>
            <li> Well this product just isn&#x27;t worth the tears!</li>
            <li> A lot of people apply a lot more than necessary thinking more wax&#x3D; better hair removal.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I wasn&#x27;t completely sure what I was doing at first</li>
            <li> It is super easy to use, I heat it in microwave for 30secs two times for a full body wax</li>
            <li> My legs are so clean and you also don&#x27;t need anybody&#x27;s help also.</li>
            <li> easy to use, mess free and great results.</li>
            <li> Great product, you get a really good amount of wax that will last you a long time.</li>
            <li> so instead I tried another strip on my legs, where the hair grows more sparsely thanks to 1.5 decades of having shaved it.</li>
            <li> And I don&#x27;t feel the need to take a full on shower    </li>
            <li> /&gt;Though it&#x27;s a thicker wax and takes more time to heat up, it works really well for me.</li>
            <li> In some ways, this turned out to be true.</li>
            <li> Took me all of 10 minutes to do both my legs (full)</li>
            <li> It takes me between 45 minutes to 1 hour do my full legs/ full arms and under arms</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not painful</li>
            <li> The reusable strips are so handy and the wax is never to hot, and actually smells pretty nice.</li>
            <li> Just rinse them in warm water and then let dry.&lt;br /&gt;If your hair is long enough it works great.</li>
            <li> This was my first time waxing my legs and Nair Milk &amp; Honey made it super quick and easy.    </li>
            <li> Remover Wax Strip Kit For Under Arms Legs and Body Women]] probably worked the best of any of them, especially the smaller ones for eyebrows.</li>
            <li> I think that&#x27;s the main problem with most of these wax products anyways.</li>
            <li> I have been waxing regularly for almost 10 years now and have used almost all kind of waxing products available in the market.&lt;br /&gt;When</li>
            <li> You simple twist off the top, remove the plastic knob, replace top, and microwave to use.</li>
            <li> Luckily it washes off with water.</li>
            <li> I really love this wax, i am able to get 2 or 3 1/2 legs out of each bottle, i only have to use 2 strips for each leg.  </li>
            <li> I was more confident and I can see the process being a lot smoother next</li>
            <li> It warms in the microwave, the roll-on applicator applies just the right amount of wax, and it&#x27;s all water-soluble which means soap and water will clean it off of everything.&lt;br /&gt;A</li>
            <li> /&gt;The first time I used it, I made sure my hair was nice and long.</li>
            <li> The strip placed on top should be pressed in the normal direction of growth as well.</li>
            <li> Hope this review helps some of you out there.d on top should be pressed in the normal direction of growth as well.</li>
            <li> Can be quite messy BUT very easy to remove the stickiness with warm water.</li>
            <li> My only complain is that I wish there was more in the bottle!    </li>
            <li> This is a great product and you get salon results without the mess and cost.</li>
            <li> Unless you have EXTREMELY fine hair, it really doesn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li> I did both legs (up to mid-thigh) and don&#x27;t think I even used a full quarter of the bottle, so you&#x27;ll want to make sure you clean it off so you can reuse it several times.</li>
            <li> the first area I tried this on was my special lady parts.</li>
            <li> IT did a good job, although hard wax would probably be more thorough, I was please with this.  </li>
            <li> We bought this stuff because it was super cheap and looked easy to use, but we also bought a more normal tub of wax as a back</li>
            <li> I saw this and thought it look intriguing.</li>
            <li> And my skin feels so soft, much better than shaving.</li>
            <li> Honey Wax Women Wax by Nair, 5.7 Ounce works about as well as trying to get Facebook to change a feature back to something that you liked before, that is to say, not at all.</li>
            <li> I did not waste any precious seconds placing the cloth strip over the wax, smoothing in the direction of hair growth.</li>
            <li> I purchased it at Walgreens, and noticed it was on sale, thinking it was popular, but now I understand it was because it is such a pain.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The bottle is easy to hold and contains a decent amount.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It is worth trying.</li>
            <li> Needs more paper though, honestly at least double the paper is needed for a perfect waxing.</li>
            <li> one pack is good for half legs, full hands &amp; under arms.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t grab every single hair but about a pretty good amount.</li>
            <li> Love this better than Nads or other home waxing kit.</li>
            <li> I wish I understood the company&#x27;s position on discontinuing is other, very much superior product to this one.</li>
            <li> As with any other wax, the waxing will not be as good if there is humidity in the air, This can be prevented by turning on the air conditioning while you are waxing.</li>
            <li> This roll on wax is very easy to use, especially on larger areas, like the legs.</li>
            <li> high quality wax that goes on smoothly, is painless, and washes off with water (i.e., it isn&#x27;t gummy).</li>
            <li> Oh., they are reusable and I recently found that most of the strips are of the same kind.</li>
            <li> I normally go to the salon to get my waxing done, but found this product cheap in the supermarket</li>
            <li> and it worked well and wasnt nearly as excrutiating, but it&#x27;s not as easy as shaving</li>
            <li> By the time I&#x27;m finished waxing, I just need to rinse off the strips under warm water (no detergent/soap required) and hang them over the shower curtain rod to dry.  </li>
            <li> (I don&#x27;t think I pulled the strips off quick enough), it was messy and didn&#x27;t take much off in one go, this time I was pleased to find that it was easy to apply, quick to use and easy to clean</li>
            <li> I normally just keep a gallon bucket filled with hot water (as hot as it comes from the tap)</li>
            <li> Shaving more often also causes my skin to dry out, and I have sensitive skin on top of everything else.</li>
            <li> (simply wash them off with warm water) and can easily be cut into smaller sizes if need be.</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t reuse the same strips and wax more than twice because the wax cools too quickly and won&#x27;t adhere for very long.&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li> On the first try the wax removed exactly one hair.</li>
            <li> Hot wax helps ease removal.</li>
            <li> My only issue is that I wished there were more strips</li>
            <li> TOTALLY NONE! :)&lt;</li>
            <li> Then put the roller top back on.</li>
            <li> (I&#x27;m thinking more the facial hair remover in this instance.)  </li>
            <li> ;)</li>
            <li> stuff is an absolute dream!  </li>
            <li> The first time I used the spa clay one.</li>
            <li> Personally I like that one more.</li>
            <li> Saves so much time and money!</li>
            <li> Worked okay on my airs but not well enough for me to ever buy it again.</li>
            <li> ;)</li>
            <li> With each peel-off, all of you hair may or may not come off, so you might have to continue trying, but it&#x27;s not difficult.</li>
            <li> First experience with DIY waxing</li>
            <li> Thanks Nair!</li>
            <li> /&gt;Works quickly, effectively and as painlessly as can be expected.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t have to be too hot to work well.</li>
            <li> Gets all the hair off first time.</li>
            <li> Only thing I wish they had included more strips with it.</li>
            <li> but I had to put for 20-25 for the first time then 5-10 seconds every time it starts thickening)</li>
            <li> I used it a whole lot!</li>
            <li> First time waxing legs</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;ll have more with the next kit.</li>
            <li> I used to use their hair remover products before switching to waxing last year and was hoping for something better.</li>
            <li> This product is a good idea, but it is too messy even with the roller.</li>
            <li> It was extremely messy, and the sugar wax did just as good of a job at removing the hair.</li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t need baby oil to clean up the sticky mess afterwards, just use warm water which is a plus,especially when you trying to re-wax a certain area; just wipe with damp cloth and ready to wax again.</li>
            <li> Heat the wax until it&#x27;s warm (not hot) to the touch.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It smells nice and is a lot cheaper than other products.</li>
            <li> With error and trial figure out how many seconds in the microwave are needed for a warm thin wax,</li>
            <li> a few more seconds than package said to warm up but only a few more.&lt;br /&gt;Strips are reusable which I loved.</li>
            <li> I did both legs (up to mid-thigh) and don&#x27;t think I even used a full quarter of the bottle, so you&#x27;ll want to make sure you clean it off so you can reuse it several times.water (no detergent/soap required) and hang them over the shower curtain rod to dry.  </li>
            <li> This is the first time I&#x27;ve ever had anything good to say about a Nair product, but this stuff is great!&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve previously used regular wax that comes in a tub, you need a special warmer for it, you spread it on with a wood tongue depressor, the strips stick to everything</li>
            <li> Simply rinse them with warm water, hang to dry, and they&#x27;ll work just as effectively the next time around.  </li>
            <li> I have purchased this at CVS in the past and have always loved this product.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy enough to use but it does not remove all of the hair.</li>
            <li> Since I have been waxing for so long, my hair grows back slower and much more fine.  </li>
            <li> It was easy as pie -- just a little bit messy, but easily cleaned with warm water.</li>
            <li> If you have a more powerful microwave, it might take less.  </li>
            <li> purchased it to use on my bikini area, and while \\&quot;holding my skin taut\\&quot; just as the instructions explained, the strip managed to tear the skin layers apart resulting in a huge under the skin bruise, looking similar to a kickey, in the crease of my thigh.</li>
            <li> very well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and I like that the strips are reusable, but it just doesn&#x27;t get much hair off my legs.&lt;br</li>
            <li> And nothing really came off.</li>
            <li> Since the wax is contained inside the roll on, there wasn&#x27;t that much for me to do...</li>
            <li> Remove the wax container and knead it gently so that the heat will distribute evenly.</li>
            <li> wax was ready to be used after 15 seconds in my microwave.</li>
            <li> really like the scent of this wax</li>
            <li> Strip are gone FAST.     </li>
            <li> which I think is pretty normal for wax in this price range).  </li>
            <li> No pain, no game.</li>
            <li> the wax is fast to heat up,easy to apply  </li>
            <li> and you&#x27;re ready to go.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The quality of the wax is really inferior.</li>
            <li> Really like the roll-on</li>
            <li> This really works well for me.</li>
            <li> Hair that grows in post-wax is MUCH softer than bristles that grow in post-shave...</li>
            <li> For me this product has worked really well.</li>
            <li> It can be really fast and convenient provided you have a lil practice with it.</li>
            <li> did my whole hands,</li>
            <li> Since this is a roll on, it gives you a lot of control on how much wax to apply.</li>
            <li> in all, I really like the product.</li>
            <li> in all, I really like the product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really amazed at how well it works.</li>
            <li> much time spend for no result.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> so you do not waste any more than is necessary.</li>
            <li> it is hassle free &amp; mess free and leaves you shinning and soft ;)</li>
            <li> Just make sure to follow the instructions and read some of the other reviews here for tips.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t come off with just about anything other than nail polish remover, which also removes your counter top, your vinyl flooring, and your skin.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> Maybe this summer will be a good one instead of unpleasant and embarrassing. :)</li>
            <li> If it is too cool, it doesn&#x27;t really grab the hair enough.</li>
            <li> and anyone gets a clean body only in 15 min.</li>
            <li> If you are not used to waxing maybe you should first go to a professional.</li>
            <li> I only wish there were a way to close it and store it more properly once I have used it, because if I don&#x27;t spend all then it will leak, and there is no way of placing it so that it can stand straight, you have to bag it and lean it vertically onto something.</li>
            <li> Barely enough for full body</li>
            <li> Strips are reusable and barely enough for full body.</li>
            <li> Pull quickly in the opposite direction of hair growth.</li>
            <li> so I can&#x27;t comment on its effectiveness, however considering all the weird angles you have to remove the hair from, it might just be best to leave such areas to the experts or have a friend help</li>
            <li> so I can&#x27;t comment on its effectiveness, however considering all the weird angles you have to remove the hair from, it might just be best to leave such areas to the experts or have a friend help</li>
            <li> So I gave this a go - mainly because it&#x27;s a sugar wax, which tends to be gentler.  </li>
            <li> and I was lucky enough to have purchased about 25 bottles of it.  </li>
            <li> The wax strips cleaned off really quick and easy under hot water, and dried like new, ready for my second use!</li>
            <li> Also, one of the main reasons that i love it so much is that it just washes right off your hands or any little patches left on the legs.</li>
            <li> Microwave on high for 15 seconds.</li>
            <li> I pulled the wax strip off in one quick, smooth motion, staying parallel to my skin and holding my skin taught with the other hand while doing so.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t apply smoothly, and absolutely NO hair was removed after application.</li>
            <li> My first time I left the strip on without creating heat and it didn&#x27;t work as much, so</li>
            <li> It sure gets you sticky and messy.  </li>
            <li> This product I find much more convenient that the messy jars which you have to repeatedly heat, and run the risk of dripping all over.</li>
            <li> Waxing techniques: The wax should be applied in the normal direction of growth.</li>
            <li> Not enough wax to be worth the price and almost no paper to wax with.</li>
            <li> but i felt this milk and honey variety got a little less effective as it started to cool</li>
            <li> The roll on stick makes it easy to apply wax so that you dont put too much or too little.</li>
            <li> Fast &amp; no mess waxing at home.</li>
            <li> I did not have to use oil or anything to remove the extra wax from my skin, it came right off with water.</li>
            <li> I am an avid waxer and have been waxing since high school, and this was product is almost to the point of buying a warmer and actual wax that does not microwave.  </li>
            <li> kept a wet cloth nearby to clean up any stickiness from my hands which made rubbing the strips on easier.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I really don&#x27;t think 10 is enough for two whole legs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I was very surprised.</li>
            <li> How much of time I took for every waxing episode (Full arms and Half legs)?</li>
            <li> On the second try it removed exactly 3.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now</li>
            <li> I could have got a mocha from Peet&#x27;s for that, and not a small one either.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I could have got a mocha from Peet&#x27;s for that, and not a small one either.&lt;br</li>
            <li> This is my second time waxing and let me tell you, I wish they had had the original stuff I bought left in stock</li>
            <li> Of course, test a tiny drop before you roll it on because you don&#x27;t want it too hot</li>
            <li> The process of hair removal is pretty simple and does not leave any remains too.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical about buying this when I read some of the other product reviews, but it worked perfectly for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Mind you, I have fine hair on my arms, but it&#x27;s dark!</li>
            <li> I came across this roll on wax, I thought maybe I could use this wax at home and stop spending hundreds of dollars in the spa every month.&lt;br /&gt;So after reading all the positive reviews about this wax, I went ahead and bought both the facial as well as the body wax.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I had to cut the cloths in half to make them work better and last longer.  </li>
            <li> do think you get a few more break-offs with the roll-on wax than with the oil-based popsicle stick method, but it STILL feels so worth it to me not to lose half my Saturday once a month.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Yes, 15 seconds is the normal amount of time it takes to heat on high power in a regular microwave.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to apply (roll-on) and although it stings, it&#x27;s not nearly as bad as other waxing options I&#x27;ve tried in the past.  </li>
            <li> It saved me nearly $100 so far as each bottle lasts 3 rounds of waxing.</li>
            <li> All the hair on my arms and lower legs is completely gone.</li>
            <li> But I feel like the hair follicles weren&#x27;t completely ripped from my skin.</li>
            <li> Ready to use next time!  </li>
            <li> The only thing is that the wax is sticky and not water-soluble, and much gummier and thicker than the Parissa.</li>
            <li> DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME OR MONEY.     </li>
            <li> and then I washed the whole lot packing it away back in the container</li>
            <li> I have been using the Nair Roll-On Microwaveable Wax for at least 15 years and absolutely love it.  </li>
            <li> It is a complete kit and Includes sufficient number of strips.</li>
            <li> This lasts me for a complete waxing on hands+ underarms+ legs.</li>
            <li> I was tired of paying $40+ on bikini waxes and decided to try to wax on my own.</li>
            <li> (Sally Hansen lavender or vanilla oil-based wax with popsicle stick and strips), and had managed to get my time down to 2.5 hours for full legs.</li>
            <li> I do not like that you have to replace the little plug inside the top each time and subsequently wash out the roller, but I guess there&#x27;s no other way to offer a roller-style wax.</li>
            <li> then really pull the paper strip off with a fast, sharp motion.</li>
            <li> Convenient and no mess.</li>
            <li> No mess.</li>
            <li> No mess waxing is what i call it.</li>
            <li> Creates no mess.</li>
            <li> When you apply for the first time right after heating it up, you will feel that its pulling your hair a little bit but second time onward</li>
            <li> It may not work on shorter hair, but it worked perfectly on the parts I did, and it really was less painful than ones I have tried before.</li>
            <li> so naturally I have a lot of thick black body hair on my arms and legs and the wax does a good job in removing them.</li>
            <li> The roll on design makes it so much more convenient and less messy than the other options available on the market.</li>
            <li> The roll on design makes it so much more convenient and less messy than the other options available on the market.</li>
            <li> This product isn&#x27;t nearly as messy as traditional waxes and even if you get this wax anywhere it easily comes off with water.</li>
            <li> Wax rollar is not good as more wax is coming.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always been curious about what it would be like to wax instead of shave, and this seems like a pretty idiot-proof product.</li>
            <li> : If you feel the wax is becoming too sticky or thick, then heat it again in the microwave for another 5-10 seconds depending on your microwave.</li>
            <li> I have used some other at-home waxing kits in the past , but i love how easy, non messy this is.</li>
            <li> This would be fine if it then removed the hairs it left behind the first time</li>
            <li> I always waxed my hands and legs myself, but I was kind of tired of those boxed wax, heating them up regularly then applying it by knife.</li>
            <li> IT DOESN&#x27;T WORK.&lt;br /&gt;tested  on a small part of my arm, found it a little too much liquid but got most of the hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I put out a heap of towels expecting a mess and waited for my husband to laugh as I applied and then pulled off the wax.</li>
            <li> It would barely clean up a quarter sized spot at a time, which considering how much it hurts means you are going through a lot of wax, pain and strips to remove the hair at a very slow pace.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> There wasn&#x27;t much pain (probably because it wasn&#x27;t actually doing anything), so I thought \\&quot;well maybe the hair has just gotten too long here</li>
            <li> I would personally rather get wax by a professional</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so worth the few</li>
            <li> Take a shower and clean the area with soap (without any moisturizers for e.g. Dove is not suitable).</li>
            <li> I was surprised that I was able to wax my entire legs and bikini line in less than a half hour!   </li>
            <li> I ended up throwing the product out with half the bottle used up because I ran out of strips (and because of the above reasons, it wasn&#x27;t worth continuing</li>
            <li> is the ONLY type of hot wax (I have tried 4-5 other brands and types of wax) that did not hurt me</li>
            <li> I almost didn&#x27;t buy this item because of all the terrible reviews I read about this item, i&#x27;m so glad I didn&#x27;t listen to them; I love this wax!</li>
            <li> The only complaint I would have was that the packaging didn&#x27;t &#x27;re-seal&#x27;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wondered if it was pure luck the first time I used it, so the next time I decided to give my underarms a go.</li>
            <li> but some methods are very messy, some are painful and some are useless but this wax is very easy to use, give excellent results without pain and creates no mess.</li>
            <li> It only worked on the fine hairs on my arm but not my coarse thick leg hair.  </li>
            <li> HALF strip can take about the whole calves.</li>
            <li> so you then have to stop once you&#x27;ve used them all, wash them, and then wait for them to dry completely.</li>
            <li> --Very little mess to clean up!</li>
            <li> tried this product after having tried several different products and having had professional waxing done, and it fell far short of the other waxes.</li>
            <li> Surprisingly, my leg isn&#x27;t throbbing too badly, and I just might consider trying this again tomorrow night.</li>
            <li> First of all- application and storage is VERY messy.</li>
            <li> It was too hot to touch and got cold too quickly.  </li>
            <li> but you get the same thing even   when you go to salons and other professional places.  </li>
            <li> Since then, I&#x27;ve gotten professional waxings, which work much better, but they&#x27;re so expensive!  </li>
            <li> I have a warmer for those round wax tins but prefer to use this because it&#x27;s more convenient and less of a mess.</li>
            <li> or you&#x27;ll hurt yourself, but unlike the hard wax, if it is a bit too hot, you can get it off immediately with water, instead of it sticking and burning.</li>
            <li> Even with an amateur (me), this stuff worked really well.</li>
            <li> If you follow the directions and YOUR HAIR IS LONG ENOUGH this product should work.</li>
            <li> Anyway, the non-inclusion of any kind of vitamin E oil to remove the wax left behind sucks.</li>
            <li> Anyway, the non-inclusion of any kind of vitamin E oil to remove the wax left behind sucks.</li>
            <li> I read a lot of good things about this product, but was disappointed.</li>
            <li> I usually use epiliator for taking out the remaining few hair just to have clean look.</li>
            <li> will go back to my classic wax, no more roll on.</li>
            <li> It was nearly the same size and a little cheaper</li>
            <li> and it only hurt a little bit, and it took much faster than expected!!  </li>
            <li> With this soft wax formula; however, you can just wash off any extra wax or drips or mistakes with plain water.</li>
            <li> B004MKFY3W Veet Cold Wax Strips Leg and Body, 40-Count]] worked better than that!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Save it up for a few months and go get a professional wax instead.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Save it up for a few months and go get a professional wax instead.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> How long was i using it?</li>
            <li> How long do I take now to wax?</li>
            <li> Complete waste of money.</li>
            <li> I am unclear on what has happened, but this works, but not nearly as well.  </li>
            <li> under arms and legs, it took me around 40 mins in total and now the bottle is almost empty.</li>
            <li> Not only that, each pack only contains ten cloth strips, which when used leaves you with half a bottle of wax and is barely enough to wax from the knees down.</li>
            <li> While this roll on was definitely gentler, it did not work half as well as a traditional wax.</li>
            <li> bottle cost us about $10 with reusable strips, and we still have about half of the bottle left for the next time she needs to wax.</li>
            <li> I have super thick dark hair and every other wax i&#x27;ve used</li>
            <li> We&#x27;re taking the other tub back to target.</li>
            <li> They dry quickly.&lt;br /&gt;5)</li>
            <li> They dry quickly.&lt;br /&gt;5)</li>
            <li> : The skin has to be dry before you apply wax.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried using it 5 times now and I followed the directions each time and it never pulled a single hair out.</li>
            <li> Sure, it wasn&#x27;t a measly 3 follicles like with the other tries, but come on.</li>
            <li> Those things are normal (at least in my experience with do-it-yourself waxing).</li>
            <li> Just wash the used wax off with water, hang to dry and viola!</li>
            <li> (While they are reusable, the wax is water soluble so it won&#x27;t adhere to wet strips; you have to let the strips dry before you reuse them.)</li>
            <li> /&gt;The smell is pleasant too.&lt;br /&gt;About the Nair Clay roll-on wax (the only thing sold at CVS now), it is absolutely horrible!</li>
            <li> I selected this roll-on product because I suspected it would be less messy and easier to use than dipping a wooden stick into a pot of wax the traditional way.</li>
            <li> I followed the directions to the letter, I cut the strips to a little larger than the size of the area I wanted to wax.</li>
            <li> though it does leave some little tiny hairs</li>
            <li> But at least with this product, you can get in and out of the (waxing) game QUICK!</li>
            <li> Even though i read many bad reviews before purchasing it, i still wanted to see for myself.</li>
            <li> I did not buy it on amazon because of the many bad reviews I read here.</li>
            <li> although messy it works on my coarse hair.</li>
            <li> When I used, absolutely no hair was removed.</li>
            <li> Arrived on time and the product is what I expected.</li>
            <li> follow the directions carefully</li>
            <li> (less if bottle is half empty) and roll it on towards the direction of hair growth, place white fabric strip and lift off against hair growth.</li>
            <li> I am not sure why this has so many bad reviews, maybe different ethnicities or hair strength.</li>
            <li> And you have less mess because you&#x27;re not going back and forth from the tub of wax to your leg.</li>
            <li> I have thick hair (I&#x27;m Indian) but also very sensitive skin and this roll-on took off nearly all of my hair and left very little redness behind.</li>
            <li> Really wish I hadn&#x27;t wasted my money on such a useless product.</li>
            <li> Other than that</li>
            <li> I have used other home waxing products before.</li>
            <li> i&#x27;ve tried Nair&#x27;s wax (and other over the store bought brands) products but</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m looking into other products for the mustache area</li>
            <li> This became so swollen and bulged I was afraid I had actually damaged a large blood vessel.</li>
            <li> I hate shaving my legs because I don&#x27;t feel very smooth after using shaving cream and razors in the shower.</li>
            <li> The first time I ever waxed in the bikini area, I did it myself with a different product and it hurt so badly</li>
            <li> At this point, I freaked, threw down the cloth strip, and promptly called it a night.     </li>
            <li> Just a wipe down with water removes the wax  and leaves no sticky residue.</li>
            <li> A little redness obviously due to the trauma you caused by plucking all those hairs at once.</li>
            <li> The swelling has gone down slightly, but I now walk with a slight tenderness for that side and don&#x27;t know what pants I&#x27;m going to wear tomorrow</li>
            <li> It is less messier than Veet</li>
            <li> I ran out of wax and was going to buy my typical microwaveable Sally Hansen wax.</li>
            <li> , I wax my legs and calves in less than half an hour.</li>
            <li> but it hurts less than a others I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> For an efficient wax the body hair has to be around half a centimeter or else</li>
            <li> Considering the amount of mess in my bathroom.</li>
            <li> How much mess I create in the Bathroom now?</li>
            <li> once you&#x27;ve used them, they are not reusable, and it&#x27;s a sticky mess.  </li>
            <li> think that if you are not very used to wax your body by yourself, you cannot blame the tool that you are not able to use, if the result is not satisfactory.</li>
            <li> If the strip is the least bit damp it will either remove only some wax from your leg, usually with no hair, or no wax at all</li>
            <li> It rinses off with little effort and the creamy smell is divine.</li>
            <li> Also, you might have to press the bottle a little bit for wax to reach from bottle to roller.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> , I&#x27;ve let it go and will need to shave and wait a few days for it to grow and try again\\&quot;</li>
            <li> waste your money on this product.</li>
            <li> waste your money on this product.</li>
            <li> Press firmly to the area you wish to wax, gliding the applicator in the direction of the hair growth.</li>
            <li> Take one of the reusable strips and press it firmly to the waxed area immediately after applying; you don&#x27;t want the wax to harden on the area.</li>
            <li> The round roller can be removed so that the wax can be rinsed off.</li>
            <li> I wish it came with some sort of a cap to cover the messy roller after use.</li>
            <li> Here&#x27;s what I&#x27;ve learned from using this for a few years now-- temperature matters.</li>
            <li> These are the reasons I had trouble with this product:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> To make this worse there are only about 10 or 15 strips</li>
            <li> Nair Roll on Milk &amp; Honey wax is a waste of time and money.</li>
            <li> You have to try it a few times to get the hang of it-</li>
            <li> so really few.</li>
            <li> Wasted money.</li>
            <li> A bit messy as they all are</li>
            <li> Plus, even if it did remove all the hair, the application is too messy that I wouldnt want to use it anyway.</li>
            <li> Once you&#x27;ve dried the skin, apply some baby powder to absorb any remaining moisture.</li>
            <li> enough to create a thin layer on the body yet not burn the skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I started crying.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t understand why some people gave it such a poor review.  </li>
            <li> There is very little mess, and the strips are washable and reusable.</li>
            <li> It is messy, gooey, sticky and just does not remove the hair.&lt;br /&gt;Total waste of money!</li>
            <li> :/</li>
            <li> What a waste of $5.50!</li>
            <li> What a waste of $5.50!</li>
            <li> my skin is just irritated with bumps, I&#x27;m not sure.</li>
            <li> I had to reapply to try and get those small patches of hair off.  </li>
            <li> It worked for me but not sure if it&#x27;ll work for you.</li>
            <li> Just always remember to test a small amount on a &amp;#34;tougher&amp;#34; area of your skin first.&lt;br /&gt;3)  </li>
            <li> Terrible consistency, does not rinse off without rigorous scrubbing, and does not perform any better than the Milk and Honey version.</li>
            <li> I usually wax every 6 weeks and 1.5 bottle is my usage.</li>
            <li> I usually buy an additional 250 strips every 6 months or so.</li>
            <li> No more sticky countertop.</li>
            <li> Although its quite expensive, its mess-free, which was like my basic requirement.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, the minimal pain is due to the lack of hair removal!</li>
            <li> This Nair product is not nearly as good as previous microwave wax products.  </li>
            <li> Yet this is a hard product to find on the shelves.</li>
            <li> It was supper hard to apply.</li>
            <li> It just sucks.</li>
            <li> It just sucks.</li>
            <li> I feel a lot of people are giving this product bad reviews because it made them bleed in a few areas or they had red spots, but let me tell you something: you&#x27;re RIPPING THE HAIR OUT of your body!</li>
            <li> For me, the cold kits that you are supposed to just press on and pull off simply do not work at all, and</li>
            <li> I was so anxious about removing my arm hair!</li>
            <li> Now I understand how this can be a little inconvenient but with continuous usage of wax your hair growth slows down and this might become manageable.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It does&#x27;t pull out very small hair</li>
            <li> Anyway, the first couple rounds it wasn&#x27;t very painful.</li>
            <li> and I hate getting them done as I find this area most painful for waxing.</li>
            <li> I wish I had discovered this sooner instead of trying that Sally Hansen Brazilian Wax that left me in a painful tizzy.</li>
            <li> In fact, about 4 strips into one leg, I actually became so frustrated at my lack of progress that I threw it all out and washed up.</li>
            <li> /&gt;- Not a good value for the money.</li>
            <li> They were usually messy and complicated to use.</li>
            <li> After following the instructions twice and being disappointed both times, I gave up.</li>
            <li> Long-time leg waxer here (no shaving for 3 years now), with tough, fast-growing leg hair.</li>
            <li> hard wax kits are too difficult to use because you have to chip off the wax that didn&#x27;t pull off on the paper, and that makes me nervous.</li>
            <li> Graduated to hard wax, and was NOT impressed.</li>
            <li> I rolled the wax on in a thin, transparent layer, in the direction of hair growth, as the directions state.</li>
            <li> The residue turns into horrible little crumbs when wet</li>
            <li> I found it less painful than the salon and the hair</li>
            <li> other two products I tried were: [[ASIN:</li>
            <li> Irritates the skin: the poor quality of the wax means that it&#x27;s hard to control and extremely painful.</li>
            <li> It WAS painful, as waxing usually always is, so i cant complain about that.</li>
            <li> Overall, I am very disappointed with this product.</li>
            <li> I kept telling myself that I must be doing it wrong, because it was not doing anything for me.</li>
            <li> It does not have a weird smell like some do.</li>
            <li> So this doesn&#x27;t get nearly as expensive with strips as it does with non-washable wax.  </li>
            <li> The instructions are clunky and difficult to read.&lt;br</li>
            <li> : Remember that since you&#x27;re doing it yourself and not at a spa, there will be areas that you will be unable to wax irrespective of the amount of wax you apply there.</li>
            <li> : Remember that since you&#x27;re doing it yourself and not at a spa, there will be areas that you will be unable to wax irrespective of the amount of wax you apply there.</li>
            <li> This wax though is the only product that did not give me horrible bumps or rashes.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It also did a very poor job of removing all the hair.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t be afraid to rewarm it during the course of your waxing session.  </li>
            <li> 4 stars because it&#x27;s expensive!</li>
            <li> Too bad.</li>
            <li> And it wasn&#x27;t painful, so</li>
            <li> that won&#x27;t bother it :(</li>
            <li> I was really disappointed &amp; tried Amazon immediately &amp; since I&#x27;m a Prime member I received it in 2 days</li>
            <li> I am really disappointed with this  Nair product.</li>
            <li> Annoying?</li>
            <li> Retarded?</li>
            <li> I hate shaving or using epiliator</li>
            <li> hate shaving</li>
            <li> Not this wax, one painful wax and all of the hair is gone!</li>
            <li> Awful.</li>
            <li> Just awful.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed!</li>
            <li> This product is terrible.</li>
            <li> but really it is a terrible product</li>
            <li> WORST WAX EVER!    </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Great wax kit that is TRULY RINSABLE with water... Won&#x27;t take off hair as efficiently as NON-RINSABLE wax kits but I prefer not to have excess wax stuck to my skin for days!! Also this kit works best if applied directly to strips and then to hair removal area.  Very happy overall!</li>
            <li> I waxed both of my legs with one of those, it&#x27;s really great. And my skin feels so soft, much better than shaving.</li>
            <li> I followed all the instructions on the package, and either I&#x27;m not getting something, or this just doesn&#x27;t work for me very well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s really easy to use, and I like that the strips are reusable, but it just doesn&#x27;t get much hair off my legs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first time I used it, I made sure my hair was nice and long. It was almost 1/4 inch!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Maybe I didn&#x27;t heat the wax up enough? I applied the wax and the strip, rubbed in the direction of hair growth and pulled against the direction of hair growth. And nothing really came off. I tried again and again, and nothing happened. It just hurt.  :/</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to heat up the wax in a microwave and apply. Convenient and no mess. It is also the best quality honey wax that I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> Read the reviews here and decided to give this a whirl!  I&#x27;ve been using Nair&#x27;s peach-melon sugar wax on my legs and underarms for years, but I guess they&#x27;re not making it anymore.  And for good reason...this product is way better: rolls on thinly, waxes off nicely, and the results are awesome! Just make sure to follow the instructions and read some of the other reviews here for tips. I wish I had discovered this sooner instead of trying that Sally Hansen Brazilian Wax that left me in a painful tizzy.</li>
            <li> I tried this product over and over again. I kept telling myself that I must be doing it wrong, because it was not doing anything for me. After what was probably my 15th attempt, I have given up. This product did not work for me at all. It only pulled out about 5 hairs max.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried using it 5 times now and I followed the directions each time and it never pulled a single hair out. DO NOT BUY!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used lots of home wax kits before, none of which worked as well as I wanted them to, though the [[ASIN:B000AAAVZO Sally Hansen Quick and Easy Hair Remover Wax Strip Kit For Under Arms Legs and Body Women]] probably worked the best of any of them, especially the smaller ones for eyebrows. But I digress, I&#x27;m not here to talk about Sally Hansen, I&#x27;m here to talk about the Nair Roll On Milk and Honey Wax Women Wax by Nair, 5.7 Ounce.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Nair Roll On Milk and Honey Wax Women Wax by Nair, 5.7 Ounce works about as well as trying to get Facebook to change a feature back to something that you liked before, that is to say, not at all. I followed the directions to the letter, I cut the strips to a little larger than the size of the area I wanted to wax. I rolled the wax on in a thin, transparent layer, in the direction of hair growth, as the directions state. I did not waste any precious seconds placing the cloth strip over the wax, smoothing in the direction of hair growth. I pulled the wax strip off in one quick, smooth motion, staying parallel to my skin and holding my skin taught with the other hand while doing so. On the first try the wax removed exactly one hair. ONE. On the second try it removed exactly 3.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now granted, the first area I tried this on was my special lady parts. There wasn&#x27;t much pain (probably because it wasn&#x27;t actually doing anything), so I thought \\&quot;well maybe the hair has just gotten too long here, I&#x27;ve let it go and will need to shave and wait a few days for it to grow and try again\\&quot; so instead I tried another strip on my legs, where the hair grows more sparsely thanks to 1.5 decades of having shaved it. It removed about 50% of the hair from the area I tested. Sure, it wasn&#x27;t a measly 3 follicles like with the other tries, but come on. Even the [[ASIN:B004MKFY3W Veet Cold Wax Strips Leg and Body, 40-Count]] worked better than that!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another thing I found...weird? Annoying? Retarded? I guess the insult you use doesn&#x27;t matter. Anyway, the non-inclusion of any kind of vitamin E oil to remove the wax left behind sucks. It just sucks. Especially when ALL the wax is left behind.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m just glad I bought this on sale at Walgreen&#x27;s rather than spending $9 on Amazon. What a waste of $5.50! I could have got a mocha from Peet&#x27;s for that, and not a small one either.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t waste your money on this product. Save it up for a few months and go get a professional wax instead.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When is someone going to come up with an affordable, razor free, at-home hair removal system THAT ACTUALLY WORKS?!&#x27;t matter.

            <li> great concept but did not work for me.</li>
            <li> a better deal that most drug stores.</li>
            <li> Awful. Just awful. Really wish I hadn&#x27;t wasted my money on such a useless product. It doesn&#x27;t apply smoothly, and absolutely NO hair was removed after application. After following the instructions twice and being disappointed both times, I gave up.</li>
            <li> I have been using gigi all pupose honee wax with the warmer and spatula stick but its messy[[ASIN:B000SX7NX6 Gigi All Purpose Honee Microwave Formula, 8 Ounce]].  I decided to use this roll on wax because it seems cleaner and faster.  It only worked on the fine hairs on my arm but not my coarse thick leg hair.  I even put the nair wax out and replaced it with my gigi wax inside roll on container.  It was too hot to touch and got cold too quickly.  Back to Gigi wax although messy it works on my coarse hair.</li>
            <li> This roll on wax is too good. Fast &amp; no mess waxing at home. I have tried epilator, shaver &amp; waxing. I have to tell waxing is the best &amp; I was looking for a roll on wax to get back to it. And here it is :-). It does&#x27;t pull out very small hair but it gets 98% of the job done, so I am happy with it. one pack is good for half legs, full hands &amp; under arms. I still have around 1/4th of bottle left. All this for $10 is an awesome deal (Saved more than $50). Happy waxing ladies :-).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tip: If you feel the wax is becoming too sticky or thick, then heat it again in the microwave for another 5-10 seconds depending on your microwave. Hot wax helps ease removal.</li>
            <li> Nair is great for multiple reasons:&lt;br /&gt;- It is super easy to use, I heat it in microwave for 30secs two times for a full body wax&lt;br /&gt;- It is less messier than Veet&lt;br /&gt;- It comes off easily with water. I used to struggle with Veet.&lt;br /&gt;- It comes with reusable strips</li>
            <li> I bought this product at Target on a whim. I was tired of paying $40+ on bikini waxes and decided to try to wax on my own. It was easy as pie -- just a little bit messy, but easily cleaned with warm water. I have thick hair (I&#x27;m Indian) but also very sensitive skin and this roll-on took off nearly all of my hair and left very little redness behind. I warmed the wax for 10 seconds, let it stand for a minute, and warmed it again for another 10 seconds. To get it going, I rolled it several times on a sheet of paper. Then I applied it to my hair, rubbed the re-usable paper strip against the wax, pulled my skin taught, and pulled the strip off off against the direction that my hair grows. It came off easily, leaving my skin clean.  My only issue is that I wished there were more strips so I could wax my bikini line, stomach, and thighs all in one session. (While they are reusable, the wax is water soluble so it won&#x27;t adhere to wet strips; you have to let the strips dry before you reuse them.) Other than that though, you can&#x27;t beat the price. It saved me nearly $100 so far as each bottle lasts 3 rounds of waxing. If you follow the directions and YOUR HAIR IS LONG ENOUGH this product should work.</li>
            <li> 1. What was i using before this? GIGI wax with Electric wax warmer&lt;br /&gt;2. How long was i using it? More than 4 years&lt;br /&gt;3. Am I a pro in waxing? Considering the amount of time i had been waxing., Yes! Considering the amount of mess in my bathroom., NO!:(&lt;br /&gt;4. How much of time I took for every waxing episode (Full arms and Half legs)? 1.5 Hrs with cleanup time&lt;br /&gt;4. Did this product help? This is awesome so far... Roller glides like a breeze&lt;br /&gt;5. How long do I take now to wax? 30 minutes with washing the wax strips (Oh., they are reusable and I recently found that most of the strips are of the same kind. Even that of GIGI&#x27;s)&lt;br /&gt;6. How much mess I create in the Bathroom now? NONE...TOTALLY NONE! :)&lt;br /&gt;7. Will I recommend this product to others? Yes for all those who cannot afford / dislike LASER... and yeah that L word cud cause skin cancer.. :0</li>
            <li> I have used other home waxing products before. But I think this one is a keeper. It doesn&#x27;t hurt the way others do. It does not have a weird smell like some do. And it just rinsed off so easy. I did not have to use oil or anything to remove the extra wax from my skin, it came right off with water. I made sure to follow the directions. All the hair on my arms and lower legs is completely gone. It may not work on shorter hair, but it worked perfectly on the parts I did, and it really was less painful than ones I have tried before. Since the wax is contained inside the roll on, there wasn&#x27;t that much for me to do...roll on, lay the strip, and immediately pull it off.  And it wasn&#x27;t painful, so I didn&#x27;t have to psych myself up for each pull. So it was very quick. I am so happy I found this. Maybe this summer will be a good one instead of unpleasant and embarrassing. :)</li>
            <li> I did not know this product was on the market, I love it,</li>
            <li> I actually bought this product from Target for about $8 thinking that I could use it on my upper lip and chin area. Only when I got home did I see on the packaging that it is for legs and body.     Oh, well; I&#x27;ll try it for its intended use, then.    I hate shaving my legs because I don&#x27;t feel very smooth after using shaving cream and razors in the shower. Then the next day I have stubble and have to do it all over again. As a result, I sometimes go for almost two weeks before I will shave in the shower again. Shaving more often also causes my skin to dry out, and I have sensitive skin on top of everything else. I&#x27;ve always been curious about what it would be like to wax instead of shave, and this seems like a pretty idiot-proof product. And it is, unless you&#x27;re like me and misread the label before purchasing.    How to use the product:    Twist off the roller top and take out the safety plug. Then put the roller top back on. Place the entire thing in the microwave on a plate off-centered with the applicator face up. Microwave on high for 15 seconds. Remove the wax container and knead it gently so that the heat will distribute evenly. Press firmly to the area you wish to wax, gliding the applicator in the direction of the hair growth. Take one of the reusable strips and press it firmly to the waxed area immediately after applying; you don&#x27;t want the wax to harden on the area. Pull quickly in the opposite direction of hair growth. Now the hair is gone, and you&#x27;re likely to be wincing in pain!    Pros:    --Very little mess to clean up! I strongly prefer this in comparison to waxes in jars that are applied with sticks. (I&#x27;m thinking more the facial hair remover in this instance.)  --The strips are reusable. Simply rinse them with warm water, hang to dry, and they&#x27;ll work just as effectively the next time around.  --The roller top is super easy to clean. The round roller can be removed so that the wax can be rinsed off. Then you can use your finger to help the wax comeoff of the piece that the        roller attaches to.  --The wax was ready to be used after 15 seconds in my microwave. It was perfect!  --I really like the scent of this wax; it&#x27;s not stinky. And I don&#x27;t feel the need to take a full on shower    Cons:    --Maybe my skin is just irritated with bumps, I&#x27;m not sure. But I feel like the hair follicles weren&#x27;t completely ripped from my skin. I&#x27;ll have a better idea about this when my calf stops       hurting.  --The wax and the strips working together didn&#x27;t remove every piece of hair. I had to reapply to try and get those small patches of hair off.  --This is probably more my fault than that of the wax, but...my leg started bleeding. At this point, I freaked, threw down the cloth strip, and promptly called it a night.     I am a huge baby when it comes to any kind of pain, so I didn&#x27;t even get to finish one leg. Surprisingly, my leg isn&#x27;t throbbing too badly, and I just might consider trying this again tomorrow night.</li>
            <li> When I used, absolutely no hair was removed. Complete waste of money. Unless you have EXTREMELY fine hair, it really doesn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li> This is my second time waxing and let me tell you, I wish they had had the original stuff I bought left in stock so I didn&#x27;t end up with this! While this roll on was definitely gentler, it did not work half as well as a traditional wax. In fact, about 4 strips into one leg, I actually became so frustrated at my lack of progress that I threw it all out and washed up. Very disappointed!</li>
            <li> This was my first time waxing my legs and Nair Milk &amp; Honey made it super quick and easy.    I would completely recommend it to first time users, or those that are experienced with getting waxed or waxing themselves.    I especially love that the strips are reusable. You just rinse them off with warm water. My only complain is that I wish there was more in the bottle!    I&#x27;m sold, never going back to shaving again.</li>
            <li> i&#x27;ve tried Nair&#x27;s wax (and other over the store bought brands) products but this by far their best for me. You don&#x27;t need baby oil to clean up the sticky mess afterwards, just use warm water which is a plus,especially when you trying to re-wax a certain area; just wipe with damp cloth and ready to wax again. I like the milk &amp; honey scent too.     I have to say though, I need more paper before the bottle ran our of wax, so I had to order cloth strips separately. I think that&#x27;s the main problem with most of these wax products anyways.</li>
            <li> I did not buy it online but I bought it from target for 8 bucks. It will vary from hair to hair so my answer might vary as well.    PRO: HALF strip can take about the whole calves. The knee and the thigh will be a bit trickier. It doesn&#x27;t grab every single hair but about a pretty good amount. You&#x27;ll see one or two sticking out here and there.    CON: Can be quite messy BUT very easy to remove the stickiness with warm water. Strip are gone FAST.     Trick: It worked for me but not sure if it&#x27;ll work for you. You could rub the strip against your leg to create heat in order to pull hair. My first time I left the strip on without creating heat and it didn&#x27;t work as much, so I rub my hand against the strip to create heat and it pulled out more hair.     Hope this helps.</li>
            <li> I am an AVID waxer and I LOVE this product. I ran out of wax and was going to buy my typical microwaveable Sally Hansen wax. I saw this and thought it look intriguing. It was nearly the same size and a little cheaper for I thought I&#x27;d give it a try....and it was worth it!  PROS  * QUICK! - The roller cuts out the step of spreading on the wax manually using a popsicle stick or whatnot. I was surprised that I was able to wax my entire legs and bikini line in less than a half hour!   * ROLLER EASY TO USE - And you have less mess because you&#x27;re not going back and forth from the tub of wax to your leg. Honestly the roll on feature is what sold me on this product and is why I will keep using it!  * WATER SOLUBLE - This is a big deal for me. It makes it easy to clean up and get it off.   * STRIPS REUSABLE - At first I was disappointed that there weren&#x27;t that many strips UNTIL I found out that they were reusable. Just wash the used wax off with water, hang to dry and viola! Ready to use next time!  CONS  * STRAGGLERS - It will get about 95% of all your hair if you keep applying it when it&#x27;s hot/warm (which I think is pretty normal for wax in this price range).  I feel a lot of people are giving this product bad reviews because it made them bleed in a few areas or they had red spots, but let me tell you something: you&#x27;re RIPPING THE HAIR OUT of your body! Those things are normal (at least in my experience with do-it-yourself waxing). No pain, no game. ;) But at least with this product, you can get in and out of the (waxing) game QUICK!</li>
            <li> I saw this in rite Aid and decided to take a chance since its cheaper than the place i go to!  i came home and tried it and it was amazing the wax is fast to heat up,easy to apply  and it only hurt a little bit, and it took much faster than expected!!  and whats great is that the strips are washable so you can reuse them!  though it does leave some little tiny hairs but you get the same thing even   when you go to salons and other professional places.  This product is amazing and affordable i would recommend it to anyone!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in love ‚ù§ with this product</li>
            <li> This product is great if you wax at home. It is easy and quick, I wax my legs and calves in less than half an hour. I also wax my bikini line and armpits. The best part is that you can wash with just water and soap after you finish, unlike other kinds of wax. I tried all sorts of home waxes, this is by far the best.</li>
            <li> Well I always liked the idea of waxing, so I bought this product after many positive reviews convinced me it was one of the best. I purchased it at Walgreens, and noticed it was on sale, thinking it was popular, but now I understand it was because it is such a pain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I purchased it to use on my bikini area, and while \\&quot;holding my skin taut\\&quot; just as the instructions explained, the strip managed to tear the skin layers apart resulting in a huge under the skin bruise, looking similar to a kickey, in the crease of my thigh. This became so swollen and bulged I was afraid I had actually damaged a large blood vessel. The swelling has gone down slightly, but I now walk with a slight tenderness for that side and don&#x27;t know what pants I&#x27;m going to wear tomorrow that won&#x27;t bother it :(&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It also did a very poor job of removing all the hair. It would barely clean up a quarter sized spot at a time, which considering how much it hurts means you are going through a lot of wax, pain and strips to remove the hair at a very slow pace.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I waxed a strip on my thigh and it worked well and wasnt nearly as excrutiating, but it&#x27;s not as easy as shaving so I&#x27;m not going to wax them all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m returning this product tomorrow to get a refund, and may have to see a doctor depending on how this looks in the morning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, even though my mother always tells me that \\&quot;beauty is painful\\&quot; ... Well this product just isn&#x27;t worth the tears!</li>
            <li> This is very easy to use. I did my own Brazilian with it. I def reccomend!! Roll on is simple and you don&#x27;t have to wait for the wax to harden. Takes a lot of unneeded steps and waiting out of waxing. Love it</li>
            <li> This is the first time I&#x27;ve ever had anything good to say about a Nair product, but this stuff is great!&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve previously used regular wax that comes in a tub, you need a special warmer for it, you spread it on with a wood tongue depressor, the strips stick to everything once you&#x27;ve used them, they are not reusable, and it&#x27;s a sticky mess.  It doesn&#x27;t come off with just about anything other than nail polish remover, which also removes your counter top, your vinyl flooring, and your skin.&lt;br /&gt;This stuff is an absolute dream!  It warms in the microwave, the roll-on applicator applies just the right amount of wax, and it&#x27;s all water-soluble which means soap and water will clean it off of everything.&lt;br /&gt;A couple of things:&lt;br /&gt;1)  Yes, 15 seconds is the normal amount of time it takes to heat on high power in a regular microwave.  But that isn&#x27;t carved in stone.  If you have a more powerful microwave, it might take less.  If yours isn&#x27;t as powerful, it might take more. Heat the wax until it&#x27;s warm (not hot) to the touch.&lt;br /&gt;2)  Don&#x27;t be afraid to rewarm it during the course of your waxing session.  Waxing takes more time than shaving does, and when the wax cools off it won&#x27;t work as well.  Just always remember to test a small amount on a &amp;#34;tougher&amp;#34; area of your skin first.&lt;br /&gt;3)  This comes with 10 strips to remove the wax.  I just finished waxing (legs only) and it took me 19 strips.  However, the &amp;#34;non-woven&amp;#34; strips are available at just about any beauty supply place. Grab yourself an extra package before you start using this method.&lt;br /&gt;AND&lt;br /&gt;4)  The strips are washable and re-usable.  So this doesn&#x27;t get nearly as expensive with strips as it does with non-washable wax.  I normally just keep a gallon bucket filled with hot water (as hot as it comes from the tap) next to me and drop my used strips into the bucket when they&#x27;re too covered with wax to use again.  By the time I&#x27;m finished waxing, I just need to rinse off the strips under warm water (no detergent/soap required) and hang them over the shower curtain rod to dry.  They dry quickly.&lt;br /&gt;5) Don&#x27;t forget to thoroughly rinse the applicator and replace the plug when you&#x27;re done.  I did both legs (up to mid-thigh) and don&#x27;t think I even used a full quarter of the bottle, so you&#x27;ll want to make sure you clean it off so you can reuse it several times.water (no detergent/soap required) and hang them over the shower curtain rod to dry.  They dry quickly.&lt;br /&gt;5) Don&#x27;t forget to thoroughly rinse the applicator and replace the plug when you&#x27;re done.

            <li> I purchased this a second time. The first time I used the spa clay one. Personally I like that one more. This is a no-brainer wax. It comes in a convenient microwavable roller bottle with reusable wax strips. If you know how to use wax to get rid of hair, you won&#x27;t have a problem. If you are not used to waxing maybe you should first go to a professional. It didn&#x27;t work too well in the bikini area. I use it for arms and legs. I wish it came with some sort of a cap to cover the messy roller after use.</li>
            <li> I am regular in swimming and I have to wax my legs once in 2 months. This wax is very handy and easy to apply. My legs are so clean and you also don&#x27;t need anybody&#x27;s help also. I am very pleased with this product. So far it is good!!</li>
            <li> This roll on wax is very easy to use, especially on larger areas, like the legs. There is very little mess, and the strips are washable and reusable. Good product!</li>
            <li> No mess. I have a warmer for those round wax tins but prefer to use this because it&#x27;s more convenient and less of a mess. Just pop in the microwave and you&#x27;re ready to go. Saves so much time and money!</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t buy this online. I tried it several times...even tried the rubbing it to create heat thing that one reviewer suggested. Only removed a few--meaning 3--hairs from my leg. Worked okay on my airs but not well enough for me to ever buy it again. Too bad.</li>
            <li> worked absolutely great in removing leg hair.</li>
            <li> This product is a good idea, but it is too messy even with the roller. I read a lot of good things about this product, but was disappointed.</li>
            <li> I have been waxing regularly for almost 10 years now and have used almost all kind of waxing products available in the market.&lt;br /&gt;When I came across this roll on wax, I thought maybe I could use this wax at home and stop spending hundreds of dollars in the spa every month.&lt;br /&gt;So after reading all the positive reviews about this wax, I went ahead and bought both the facial as well as the body wax.&lt;br /&gt;The quality of the wax is really inferior. It is messy, gooey, sticky and just does not remove the hair.&lt;br /&gt;Total waste of money! If given a choice I would any day prefer the clean n easy roll on wax over this wax.&lt;br /&gt;Though it&#x27;s a thicker wax and takes more time to heat up, it works really well for me. The best part is its not goeey and watery like the&lt;br /&gt;Nair roll on wax</li>
            <li> Supposedly a hair removal product but does no removing of hair.  It sure gets you sticky and messy.  Do Not Buy!!</li>
            <li> Great product, you get a really good amount of wax that will last you a long time. The applicator is great and easy to use. You simple twist off the top, remove the plastic knob, replace top, and microwave to use. The wax is easily cleaned up using water and a paper towel. The wax strips it came with are reusuable (simply wash them off with warm water) and can easily be cut into smaller sizes if need be. This is a great product and you get salon results without the mess and cost.</li>
            <li> This Nair product is not nearly as good as previous microwave wax products.  They used to have a great product.  I am unclear on what has happened, but this works, but not nearly as well.  I am an avid waxer and have been waxing since high school, and this was product is almost to the point of buying a warmer and actual wax that does not microwave.  I wish I understood the company&#x27;s position on discontinuing is other, very much superior product to this one.</li>
            <li> Arrived on time and the product is what I expected.</li>
            <li> This works almost as well as paying a ton of money to have your waxing done at a salon. I use it on my face, and arms, but still shave my legs because it&#x27;s quicker. For me, the cold kits that you are supposed to just press on and pull off simply do not work at all, and the the do it yourself hard wax kits are too difficult to use because you have to chip off the wax that didn&#x27;t pull off on the paper, and that makes me nervous. With this soft wax formula; however, you can just wash off any extra wax or drips or mistakes with plain water. Phew! Here&#x27;s what I&#x27;ve learned from using this for a few years now-- temperature matters. If it is too cool, it doesn&#x27;t really grab the hair enough. Of course, test a tiny drop before you roll it on because you don&#x27;t want it too hot or you&#x27;ll hurt yourself, but unlike the hard wax, if it is a bit too hot, you can get it off immediately with water, instead of it sticking and burning.</li>
            <li> I love this product and was unable to find it in the stores. I was so thrilled to see it on Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;The product was delivered in good condition. This product I find much more convenient that the messy jars which you have to repeatedly heat, and run the risk of dripping all over.</li>
            <li> Afte using this product,t hen trying many others, I find this to be the easiest applicator and the wax is the easiest to remove (simply with soap and water). Yet this is a hard product to find on the shelves. I hope it&#x27;s not being discontinued.</li>
            <li> I used to buy it from the market &amp; all of a sudden they stopped selling it! I was really disappointed &amp; tried Amazon immediately &amp; since I&#x27;m a Prime member I received it in 2 days ;) I love this roll on wax it is hassle free &amp; mess free and leaves you shinning and soft ;)</li>
            <li> I bought this product because I liked the idea of not having to get wax all over my hands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The concept was good, but the implementation not so good. And I ended up with wax on my hands anyway.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried this product after having tried several different products and having had professional waxing done, and it fell far short of the other waxes. I used it for waxing legs and arms. These are the reasons I had trouble with this product:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Not a good value for the money. The problem is that the wax itself is really gooey and gummy, which means that it doesn&#x27;t get the hair off very effectively and it also hurts a lot. You can&#x27;t reuse the same strips and wax more than twice because the wax cools too quickly and won&#x27;t adhere for very long.&lt;br /&gt;- Irritates the skin: the poor quality of the wax means that it&#x27;s hard to control and extremely painful. My skin was irritated for quite a while after using it: I had red follicles for days.&lt;br /&gt;- Not enough strips with the package. I ended up throwing the product out with half the bottle used up because I ran out of strips (and because of the above reasons, it wasn&#x27;t worth continuing use)&lt;br /&gt;- The instructions are clunky and difficult to read.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The other two products I tried were: [[ASIN:B0002PU86E Chamomile Body Sugar 5 Ounces]] and [[ASIN:B000AADEWQ Sally Hansen Lavendar Spa Wax Hair Removal Kit for Body Legs Arms and Bikini]].&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My favorite all around was the Parissa because it&#x27;s a great bang for your buck: high quality wax that goes on smoothly, is painless, and washes off with water (i.e., it isn&#x27;t gummy). This is a fantastic product. I also wrote a review about it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also like the Sally Hansen because it smells great and works pretty well. The only thing is that the wax is sticky and not water-soluble, and much gummier and thicker than the Parissa. So even though it works well, it makes for a bit of a mess.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hope this helps!</li>
            <li> Smells good, but that&#x27;s about it. This doesn&#x27;t work at all. It just yanks your hair instead of pulling it out. I really wish it worked, because my other waxes are messy, but the mess is worth it if this is the alternative.</li>
            <li> This product is terrible. The idea is good and it is easy to use but the wax does not remove all the hairs. I had to keep reapplying and trying again. This would be fine if it then removed the hairs it left behind the first time but nope, it only gets some so you have to try a third time. To make this worse there are only about 10 or 15 strips so you then have to stop once you&#x27;ve used them all, wash them, and then wait for them to dry completely. If the strip is the least bit damp it will either remove only some wax from your leg, usually with no hair, or no wax at all so you then have to go wash it off your leg.  I also want to add that I have a cosmetologist license so I have been trained in waxing and know what I am doing. I bought this product because the reviews were pretty good, it seemed cheap and easy but really it is a terrible product, you get what you pay for.</li>
            <li> Really like the roll-on but i felt this milk and honey variety got a little less effective as it started to cool - it would just get gooey. It will probably work best if you use the whole thing in one go because I think the more you heat it up, the more the consitency changes.</li>
            <li> easy to use, mess free and great results. Perfect stuff if you&#x27;re in a time crunch. 4 stars because it&#x27;s expensive!</li>
            <li> WORST WAX EVER!    DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME OR MONEY.     PULLS SKIN, NOT HAIR.    MY LEGS AND HAIR PITS ARE BLEEDING.    returning this to target ASAP</li>
            <li> Works very good. Love the fact that it washes off with warm water</li>
            <li> This product isn&#x27;t nearly as messy as traditional waxes and even if you get this wax anywhere it easily comes off with water. I would suggest buying your own waxing strips, because the ones that come with this aren&#x27;t the best and feels like paper.</li>
            <li> It smells nice, and it&#x27;s not very painful. Unfortunately, the minimal pain is due to the lack of hair removal! I tried, and I tried, and I tried. As another stated, at best you&#x27;ll get a couple of hairs, but it&#x27;s not going to give you a spa/salon quality wax. You&#x27;ll still be hairy when you&#x27;re done.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I followed the directions to the letter more than once with no luck. Save your money and time.</li>
            <li> This really works well for me. I don&#x27;t have deal with the hassle of using spatulas to apply wax. The process of hair removal is pretty simple and does not leave any remains too.</li>
            <li> Nair Roll on Milk &amp; Honey wax is a waste of time and money. It&#x27;s easy enough to use but it does not remove all of the hair. Not only that, each pack only contains ten cloth strips, which when used leaves you with half a bottle of wax and is barely enough to wax from the knees down.</li>
            <li> I would personally rather get wax by a professional</li>
            <li> Okay, so I was PREPARED to remove my hair...and I did!    I bought this from Walgreens for about $8. I was so anxious about removing my arm hair! I followed the directions and began to wax my arm hair. Mind you, I have fine hair on my arms, but it&#x27;s dark! Anyway, the first couple rounds it wasn&#x27;t very painful. I believe that was because I was so excited to be removing my hair! With each peel-off, all of you hair may or may not come off, so you might have to continue trying, but it&#x27;s not difficult. After awhile, your skin may become irritated, and you may even see blood specs. Once I was done I applied regular cream nair on the stray hairs. It&#x27;s day2 and my arms are so smooth! I feel awesome! Hope this helps!</li>
            <li> I always shaved my legs until discovering this product, which works great. You have to try it a few times to get the hang of it- follow the directions carefully then really pull the paper strip off with a fast, sharp motion. Hair that grows in post-wax is MUCH softer than bristles that grow in post-shave...</li>
            <li> First experience with DIY waxing so I started out with these. Excellent for beginners! IT did a good job, although hard wax would probably be more thorough, I was please with this.  UPDATE: Graduated to hard wax, and was NOT impressed. It was extremely messy, and the sugar wax did just as good of a job at removing the hair. I will continue using this product for sure!</li>
            <li> [This review is for the Milk and Honey roll-on wax.] I swore by the Nair Naturally Smooth waxing kit for years but it has been discontinued. I selected this roll-on product because I suspected it would be less messy and easier to use than dipping a wooden stick into a pot of wax the traditional way. In some ways, this turned out to be true. The roller works well and dispenses the perfect amount of wax so you do not waste any more than is necessary. The bottle is easy to hold and contains a decent amount. I used this formula on my underarms, bikini area, and legs with no issues at all. It rinses off with little effort and the creamy smell is divine. Made my hair removal routine into more of a pampering session. I do not like that you have to replace the little plug inside the top each time and subsequently wash out the roller, but I guess there&#x27;s no other way to offer a roller-style wax. The cleaning is necessary in order for the product to work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*DO NOT BUY THE MOROCCAN OIL FORMULA* Terrible consistency, does not rinse off without rigorous scrubbing, and does not perform any better than the Milk and Honey version. The residue turns into horrible little crumbs when wet and it took me ages to get the clumps off the strips and out from under my fingernails. That formula gets 1 star from me, but the Milk and Honey is a great buy.</li>
            <li> I normally go to the salon to get my waxing done, but found this product cheap in the supermarket so thought I&#x27;d give it a go. Last time I tried waxing at home, the pain was excruciating (I don&#x27;t think I pulled the strips off quick enough), it was messy and didn&#x27;t take much off in one go, this time I was pleased to find that it was easy to apply, quick to use and easy to clean up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I got the Nair home, undid the packaging and loved how the package becomes a &#x27;holder&#x27; for the roll on. I put out a heap of towels expecting a mess and waited for my husband to laugh as I applied and then pulled off the wax. I found it less painful than the salon and the hair all came off in one go. I was very surprised. Took me all of 10 minutes to do both my legs (full) and then I washed the whole lot packing it away back in the container it came in. The wax strips cleaned off really quick and easy under hot water, and dried like new, ready for my second use! The only complaint I would have was that the packaging didn&#x27;t &#x27;re-seal&#x27;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wondered if it was pure luck the first time I used it, so the next time I decided to give my underarms a go. The hair is longer there and I hate getting them done as I find this area most painful for waxing. Not this time. One strip each underarm and I was done!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will be saving over $100 a month on waxing now! Thanks Nair!</li>
            <li> I hate shaving or using epiliator but I love this product. Roll-on is really easy to use. I have been using it for 3 years so I have good practice. I usually use epiliator for taking out the remaining few hair just to have clean look. I usually wax every 6 weeks and 1.5 bottle is my usage. The waxing strips that come with it have good quality but they are just 10 so really few. I usually buy an additional 250 strips every 6 months or so. Caution: I burnt myself an year ago and the mark is still there. I heated it for 15 seconds by mistake even though the amount of wax left in the roll-on left was like 1/6th. Make sure to appropriate the heating time according to the amount in the roll-on and also the colder the weather/less humidity better the wax. Also it&#x27;s time consuming if uuu want to be thorough. It takes me between 45 minutes to 1 hour do my full legs/ full arms and under arms</li>
            <li> I was skeptical about buying this when I read some of the other product reviews, but it worked perfectly for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Works quickly, effectively and as painlessly as can be expected.</li>
            <li> I got this from Bed, Bath and Beyond since I was in a hurry, and now I regret it. If I had used Amazon I would have read the comments. It does not work, it removed 2 hairs (if that) and now my skin is irritated. Throwing the entire bottle away. Wasted money.</li>
            <li> My wife started waxing her legs at home because we couldn&#x27;t afford to pay the salon prices anymore. We bought this stuff because it was super cheap and looked easy to use, but we also bought a more normal tub of wax as a back up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I got talked into doing it for her because she couldn&#x27;t get herself to rip the strips off. Even with an amateur (me), this stuff worked really well. It got every hair that wasn&#x27;t in-grown.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bottle cost us about $10 with reusable strips, and we still have about half of the bottle left for the next time she needs to wax. We&#x27;re taking the other tub back to target.</li>
            <li> Love this better than Nads or other home waxing kit. Doesn&#x27;t have to be too hot to work well. Gets all the hair off first time. A bit messy as they all are but it hurts less than a others I&#x27;ve tried. Love it.</li>
            <li> First of all- application and storage is VERY messy. Luckily it washes off with water. I like that it comes with reusable strips. I used this on my legs and it removed about 40% of the hair for each strip. I hadnt shaved for about two weeks when i used it. It WAS painful, as waxing usually always is, so i cant complain about that. Overall, I am very disappointed with this product. Even though i read many bad reviews before purchasing it, i still wanted to see for myself. And I did, and now i regret buying it. Plus, even if it did remove all the hair, the application is too messy that I wouldnt want to use it anyway. I do not recommend this product.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really easy to use this kind of wax. However in my opinion it&#x27;s a bit pricey. I like it and I have been recommending it to all my friends.</li>
            <li> loved it . takes off hair in one go. must buy!</li>
            <li> Wax rollar is not good as more wax is coming.</li>
            <li> I use it on my cheeks and it&#x27;s pretty good at getting the hair off. It&#x27;s not painful and I think I&#x27;ll buy it again. My only criticism is that I can&#x27;t find a way to make it work on my upper lip so I&#x27;m looking into other products for the mustache area</li>
            <li> For me this product has worked really well. I have been buying this product regularly. It can be really fast and convenient provided you have a lil practice with it. Only thing I wish they had included more strips with it. People who are writing -ve reviews about this, I think are not following the basic principle of waxing, that you are not suppose to use moisturizer on your skin b4 u wax (best result can be derived if used just after taking a bath and when no moisturiser is applied) and the direction in which it has to be pulled etc etc. if u follow simple rules of waxing this product can give u desired results.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ok sometimes it&#x27;s not rolling easy</li>
            <li> I always waxed my hands and legs myself, but I was kind of tired of those boxed wax, heating them up regularly then applying it by knife. This solves all those problems. Just put it in microwave for 20-25 seconds (Yes, it says 15 but I had to put for 20-25 for the first time then 5-10 seconds every time it starts thickening) just roll it on your skin and pull. I would say waxing had never been so easy. When you apply for the first time right after heating it up, you will feel that its pulling your hair a little bit but second time onward it becomes fine. Also, you might have to press the bottle a little bit for wax to reach from bottle to roller.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just give it try, use it once, you will know will know how it works. I am very satisfied with it in first use itself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did my whole hands, under arms and legs, it took me around 40 mins in total and now the bottle is almost empty. (pretty good I would say) I need to find the refill bottles for it. Please let me know if you found it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I totally recommend it for girls who can go out at all without waxing.</li>
            <li> No mess waxing is what i call it. I just bought it once as a trial and have been hooked. I just like the convenience of rolling this on my skin and have the wax come at a good rate. I keep refilling it as required as well.</li>
            <li> I am reading a lot of reviews that complain about how the wax doesn&#x27;t work and thought I&#x27;d share my 2 cents about the product. I am an Indian woman so naturally I have a lot of thick black body hair on my arms and legs and the wax does a good job in removing them. Here are a couple of things about waxing to keep in mind:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. Body hair length: If you&#x27;re looking to remove hair just coming out of the follicles this is not your product. Infact, waxing isn&#x27;t your option. For an efficient wax the body hair has to be around half a centimeter or else the wax will miss out pulling those hair since the wax strip doesn&#x27;t have enough surface area to pull the hair out. Now I understand how this can be a little inconvenient but with continuous usage of wax your hair growth slows down and this might become manageable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. Moisturized skin: The skin has to be dry before you apply wax. Take a shower and clean the area with soap (without any moisturizers for e.g. Dove is not suitable). Once you&#x27;ve dried the skin, apply some baby powder to absorb any remaining moisture. This greatly effects how efficient of a wax you will have and prevent patches of hair from being unwaxed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3. Humidity: As with any other wax, the waxing will not be as good if there is humidity in the air, This can be prevented by turning on the air conditioning while you are waxing. Humidity prevents hair to stick to the wax strip&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4. Amount of wax: Apply the thinnest layer of wax on a body area. A lot of people apply a lot more than necessary thinking more wax&#x3D; better hair removal. However that couldn&#x27;t be further from the truth. Since this is a roll on, it gives you a lot of control on how much wax to apply. With error and trial figure out how many seconds in the microwave are needed for a warm thin wax, enough to create a thin layer on the body yet not burn the skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;5. Waxing techniques: The wax should be applied in the normal direction of growth. The strip placed on top should be pressed in the normal direction of growth as well. However when pulling the strip out, you need to pull it out in the opposite direction. So plan accordingly and leave an area of the strip on the end with which you can pull the strip out easily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;5. Human error: Remember that since you&#x27;re doing it yourself and not at a spa, there will be areas that you will be unable to wax irrespective of the amount of wax you apply there. Waxing is more of technique and doing bikini areas yourself will always be tricky. I haven&#x27;t tried it in the bikini area so I can&#x27;t comment on its effectiveness, however considering all the weird angles you have to remove the hair from, it might just be best to leave such areas to the experts or have a friend help you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, I really like the product. Since its a honey and sugar based wax, it is easier to remove with just warm water. The roll on design makes it so much more convenient and less messy than the other options available on the market. The strips are reusable but if you don&#x27;t want to reuse them, one can buy strips online on amazon or in beauty stores like Ulta. Hope this review helps some of you out there.d on top should be pressed in the normal direction of growth as well.

            <li> I have purchased this at CVS in the past and have always loved this product. I am happy I can get it at Amazon and avoid the lines at the store!&lt;br /&gt;This wax is so smooth and easy to use. It is as simple as the directions say... just unplug it, put it in micro for 15 seconds (less if bottle is half empty) and roll it on towards the direction of hair growth, place white fabric strip and lift off against hair growth. Does not give you pimples or cause a rash. A little redness obviously due to the trauma you caused by plucking all those hairs at once. Wash off remaining wax with water! That simple.</li>
            <li> I have been waxing for over 20 years. I am caucasian and do 1/2 leg and bikini line.  I really love this wax, i am able to get 2 or 3 1/2 legs out of each bottle, i only have to use 2 strips for each leg.  microwave for 15 seconds as per instructions.  I am not sure why this has so many bad reviews, maybe different ethnicities or hair strength. But for me, it is excellent. compared with paying $35 for a 1/2 leg wax in a salon, the price is unbeatable.  I can do 1/2 leg in 15 minutes and be out of the door.  Also, one of the main reasons that i love it so much is that it just washes right off your hands or any little patches left on the legs. compared to traditional wax that left sticky patches on my legs which my tights and leggings then got stuck to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is worth trying. At $11 what have you got to lose!</li>
            <li> I did not buy it on amazon because of the many bad reviews I read here. One day I found it for sale in a Kmart for only 2.45 dollars so I decided to give it a try and I am very happy I did. This product is very easy and quick to use. It pretty much removed all the hairs I had on my legs: I could not be more happy about it. The strips are just enough for one session as well as the wax inside the roll-on applicator.&lt;br /&gt;I think that if you are not very used to wax your body by yourself, you cannot blame the tool that you are not able to use, if the result is not satisfactory. I will buy this roll-on again and I suggest you to do the same!!!</li>
            <li> Easy to set up, easy to use, and easy to clean up!&lt;br /&gt;I used this on both my husband and I, we both liked it.&lt;br /&gt;Took a few more seconds than package said to warm up but only a few more.&lt;br /&gt;Strips are reusable which I loved. Just rinse them in warm water and then let dry.&lt;br /&gt;If your hair is long enough it works great. Even did a bikini wax that turned out nice.&lt;br /&gt;Just love that its cheap, effective, and easy to setup/clean up!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to apply (roll-on) and although it stings, it&#x27;s not nearly as bad as other waxing options I&#x27;ve tried in the past.  The first time I ever waxed in the bikini area, I did it myself with a different product and it hurt so badly I started crying.  Since then, I&#x27;ve gotten professional waxings, which work much better, but they&#x27;re so expensive!  So I gave this a go - mainly because it&#x27;s a sugar wax, which tends to be gentler.  Works great!  I&#x27;ve been able to do two brazilians on myself - HA!  I had to cut the cloths in half to make them work better and last longer.  But after that, I have run out of the cloths and now I have to buy a refill...which isn&#x27;t too bad...like $7 on Amazon, and still cheaper than paying $25-$50 for someone else to do this each time.  Also, make sure to have some sort of baby oil or something like that to get the wax off afterwards.  It&#x27;ll come off in hot water, too, but it&#x27;s just nice to make sure it&#x27;s smooth.</li>
            <li> Long-time leg waxer here (no shaving for 3 years now), with tough, fast-growing leg hair. I&#x27;d been using the wax in a jar (Sally Hansen lavender or vanilla oil-based wax with popsicle stick and strips), and had managed to get my time down to 2.5 hours for full legs. With the roll-on wax I&#x27;m just over 1 hour to cover the same area. It&#x27;s so worth the few extra dollars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do think you get a few more break-offs with the roll-on wax than with the oil-based popsicle stick method, but it STILL feels so worth it to me not to lose half my Saturday once a month.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And the instructions don&#x27;t cover this clearly enough - but you can and should reuse the strips without cleaning them off - they&#x27;ll last for about 4-5 &amp;#34;pulls&amp;#34; each, one layer over another.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Finally - this doesn&#x27;t work for my armpits at all (and I wouldn&#x27;t even approach bikini line with it), so I still use the oil-based ones for armpits, but that&#x27;s just a 10-minute commitment once a week, and the jar lasts forever when you&#x27;re only using it for that.</li>
            <li> I tried this 3 different times, hoping that it was just trial and error.&lt;br /&gt;No, it doesn&#x27;t work. It is fine maybe for someone who doesn&#x27;t want it to get all of the hairs...I don&#x27;t know who would want that...&lt;br /&gt;You definitely get what you pay for with this one.</li>
            <li> They don&#x27;t have this at CVS since last year.&lt;br /&gt;This is the ONLY type of hot wax (I have tried 4-5 other brands and types of wax) that did not hurt me and I did not have any bumps after waxing.&lt;br /&gt;It is best to apply baby powder before waxing with this.&lt;br /&gt;The waxing paper that come in the package is super easy to wash with warm water or  just throw them away.&lt;br /&gt;The smell is pleasant too.&lt;br /&gt;About the Nair Clay roll-on wax (the only thing sold at CVS now), it is absolutely horrible! It was supper hard to apply. The wax consistency does not exist and the waxing paper cannot be washed at all (not to mention it being white and sticky, yuck!)</li>
            <li> I have been using the Nair Roll-On Microwaveable Wax for at least 15 years and absolutely love it.  At one point, Nair had stopped manufacturing this product and I was lucky enough to have purchased about 25 bottles of it.  I was even buying the microwavable wax in a jar and putting it in the roll-on containers just so I could keep using it.  I was estatic when I saw that Nair had brought back this great product.  While I miss the Peach/Mango scent that was the original, the new Milk and Honey is very nice.  The trick to waxing your legs is letting the hair grow some so that the wax has something to attach to.  Since I have been waxing for so long, my hair grows back slower and much more fine.  I would rather wax than shave.  This is a great product that is easy to use and works. I don&#x27;t understand why some people gave it such a poor review.  I am one happy camper that this product is back!!</li>
            <li> This is a great-quality wax, it is very easy to warm up and apply and great for DIY hair removal. I only wish there were a way to close it and store it more properly once I have used it, because if I don&#x27;t spend all then it will leak, and there is no way of placing it so that it can stand straight, you have to bag it and lean it vertically onto something.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried a lot of at home wax kits. They were usually messy and complicated to use. This product works perfectly. The roll on stick makes it easy to apply wax so that you dont put too much or too little. It also means you don&#x27;t have to use those wooden sticks. The wax rinses off easily with warm water. I loved this1 product and will start doing all my waxing my self.</li>
            <li> Love this product going to be buying this a lot more</li>
            <li> Not enough wax to be worth the price and almost no paper to wax with. This wax though is the only product that did not give me horrible bumps or rashes. It smells nice and is a lot cheaper than other products. Needs more paper though, honestly at least double the paper is needed for a perfect waxing.</li>
            <li> I almost didn&#x27;t buy this item because of all the terrible reviews I read about this item, i&#x27;m so glad I didn&#x27;t listen to them; I love this wax! I have super thick dark hair and every other wax i&#x27;ve used I would always have to re-wax it again and again. Not this wax, one painful wax and all of the hair is gone! I&#x27;m really amazed at how well it works. I thought I would have to buy a whole kit for 5x the price of this, gladly I don&#x27;t have to! The reusable strips are so handy and the wax is never to hot, and actually smells pretty nice. I don&#x27;t know why it only has three stars? I love this wax!</li>
            <li> This is a great product! I used it a whole lot! I just dont know how to refill them once its over or if I have to keep buying these bottles.</li>
            <li> The best thing for waxing I have ever used. Its very very easy to use. Creates no mess. Barely enough for full body and anyone gets a clean body only in 15 min. I wish I can give it more than five stars. Iused to wax from years but some methods are very messy, some are painful and some are useless but this wax is very easy to use, give excellent results without pain and creates no mess. Strips are reusable and barely enough for full body. I love it.</li>
            <li> I love how easy it is to use this product.Just pop it in the microwave and it is heated. You may have to reheat it couple of times, but that is not a problem for me. It is a complete kit and Includes sufficient number of strips. This lasts me for a complete waxing on hands+ underarms+ legs. I have used some other at-home waxing kits in the past , but i love how easy, non messy this is. Just a wipe down with water removes the wax  and leaves no sticky residue. No more sticky countertop. I would definitely recommend this product.</li>
            <li> First time waxing legs and I thought this product was very useful. I&#x27;d tried out the Sally Hansen strips but my hairs are so fine it didn&#x27;t work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wasn&#x27;t completely sure what I was doing at first and it still worked. By leg two I was more confident and I can see the process being a lot smoother next time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did reheat it several times to keep it nice and warm because when it cools the roller becomes stickier which makes it hurt to roll.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I kept a wet cloth nearby to clean up any stickiness from my hands which made rubbing the strips on easier.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Figured out I could use each strip about four times before it became too globbed with wax. Just wish I&#x27;d known you could rinse and reuse them so I&#x27;ll have more with the next kit. I really don&#x27;t think 10 is enough for two whole legs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hate shaving so I&#x27;m hoping this will give me more time with smooth legs than shaving. It is more time consuming in one sitting but if it lasts it will surely save time overall.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also tried it on underarms. I did have to reapply several times because that&#x27;s a pesky area and I eventually made my husband come help me so he could pull it correctly while keeping the skin taut.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall satisfied and hoping the results are a time benefit</li>
            <li> I bought thIs product for my underarmS,  IT DOESN&#x27;T WORK.&lt;br /&gt;tested  on a small part of my arm, found it a little too much liquid but got most of the hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had to used 5 bands in order to get some hair out for one underarm. The wax was too liquid even though it was not warm.&lt;br /&gt;too much time spend for no result.&lt;br /&gt;I will go back to my classic wax, no more roll on. I am really disappointed with this  Nair product. I used to use their hair remover products before switching to waxing last year and was hoping for something better.</li>
            <li> Easy to use and to keep my work area clean.  Works like a charm to remove hair from my legs.</li>
            <li> Although its quite expensive, its mess-free, which was like my basic requirement. Also, its water soluble, so very easy to clean and wash.</li>
