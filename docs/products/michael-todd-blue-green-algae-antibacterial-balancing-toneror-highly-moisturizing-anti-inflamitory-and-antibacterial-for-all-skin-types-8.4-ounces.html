            <li>I personally love this product!</li>
            <li>But I love the product over all!</li>
            <li>Amazing product, no complaints.</li>
            <li>It also has a nice spa smell to it.</li>
            <li>I love this product so good on the face</li>
            <li>I love this toner.</li>
            <li>I love this toner.</li>
            <li>The Michael Todd toner is much more soothing and gentler to my skin because it doesn&#x27;t have any alcohol.  </li>
            <li>I also like this better than the MT lemon toner, too.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve always enjoyed it for what it does</li>
            <li>I love that this brand is cruelty free :).</li>
            <li>I bought this after a YouTuber strongly recommended it.</li>
            <li>It can act as an extra cleansing step after your cleansers and has great antibacterial effects.</li>
            <li>This toner is great for combatting blemishes and for wiping any excess residue left on skin.  </li>
            <li>I enjoyed this at first but didn&#x27;t see a change at all.</li>
            <li>It makes my skin feel clean &amp; refreshed.</li>
            <li>I feel my skin clean all the time</li>
            <li>I love how this toner cleans my skin, while still being gentle and made of organic ingredients.</li>
            <li>A bit overpriced for my liking, but a good toner overall.</li>
            <li>Also love that all the ingredients are natural!</li>
            <li>I first received a sample size of this from birch box, I wasn&#x27;t really excited for it when I got it</li>
            <li>Was great to save a little on it by purchasing through Amazon.</li>
            <li>This is the only product I use for my acne and it has cleared my skin amazingly.</li>
            <li>Worth every penny.</li>
            <li>Like most 13 year old girls, you get acne</li>
            <li>It gives me a fresh clean feeling &amp; really helps my break outs..</li>
            <li>The item was shipped super fast and arrived before Christmas...</li>
            <li>It glides on easily, makes my skin feel extra clean without being dried out, and smells good.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s actually pretty hydrating and doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin and makes my skin feel 10x cleaner after I have cleansed my face.</li>
            <li>I never used a toner before because I heard they would dry out your skin (despite the fact that I have super oily sensitive skin) and I bought this toner and love it!</li>
            <li>which is pretty much preventing anti-bacterial acne breakouts.</li>
            <li>This really stand out among their products.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>but I used it on a cotton pad, it ended up getting off the extra makeup I had on my face as well as making my face feel clean and refreshed.</li>
            <li>It does have tea tree oil in it which is sometime effective in treating small breakouts</li>
            <li>It dried out my skin the most.</li>
            <li>It smells like freshly cut grass, but not annoyingly overwhelming, I actually enjoy the smell.</li>
            <li>So here I am repurchasing the bigger size, totally worth the money 100%.</li>
            <li>I prefer the clean, pure smell of the last bottle I had to this slightly cologny musty smell from this bottle.</li>
            <li>As far as acne?  </li>
            <li>Cleans and gets off all excess makeup and dirt, does not irritate my often sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>The scent is extremely strong, and the packaging is odd since it dispenses through a tiny opening, but it&#x27;s not really a deal-breaker for me.</li>
            <li>I have slightly oily skin, but normally just go for \\&quot;normal skin\\&quot; products as I&#x27;ve never thought it&#x27;s oily enough to be considered \\&quot;oily\\&quot;, but</li>
            <li>The product itself keeps my skin clear and provides moisture needed in this dry weather.  </li>

            <li> The product itself keeps my skin clear and provides moisture needed in this dry weather.  </li>
            <li> It says it helps prevent acne, and I don&#x27;t particularly have a lot of acne, just a few stubborn spots on my cheeks and lower jaw.</li>
            <li> I contacted Michael Todd and they informed me that Pure Essence Health is not an authorized distributor of Michael Todd products and that the products I received were outdated.</li>
            <li> No reduction in spots and no real change in quality and look of skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure there&#x27;s enough in this product to make a difference.</li>
            <li> I used to use toners that have alcohol in them, but they would always burn a little and make my face red and dried out.  </li>
            <li> The product had a sour odor.</li>
            <li> yeah...let down...</li>
            <li> However, if your skin is really really thin and sensitive, it might sting a little when applying this toner.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t get the tight feeling either.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, although this product smells quite nice, for me, applying it morning and night after washing my face for 2 -3 weeks, I&#x27;ve seen no change whatsoever in my skin :(</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product a few times in the past.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s because I bought it on Amazon, but it seems to have some smelly fragrance added to it.</li>
            <li> (annoying right?)</li>
            <li> I seriously recommend this.</li>
            <li> Not saying it&#x27;s bad, it just didn&#x27;t work on me in any way, shape, or form.</li>
            <li> Really disappointed.</li>

            <li> GREAT WORK&lt;br /&gt;PRICE GOOD</li>
            <li> I never used a toner before because I heard they would dry out your skin (despite the fact that I have super oily sensitive skin) and I bought this toner and love it! It&#x27;s actually pretty hydrating and doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin and makes my skin feel 10x cleaner after I have cleansed my face. Just follow up with a moisturizer after this</li>
            <li> This product is good if you have acne prone skin. It dried out my skin the most.</li>
            <li> Awesome product.  Would definitely recommend.</li>
            <li> I have used all sorts of Michael Todd creme, cleansers, masks and toners. This really stand out among their products. It can act as an extra cleansing step after your cleansers and has great antibacterial effects. Also love that all the ingredients are natural! The toner suits all skin types but I would especially recommend this to people with acne prone skin. However, if your skin is really really thin and sensitive, it might sting a little when applying this toner.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my sister, she loves it and has helped her with her skin.</li>
            <li> Amazing product, no complaints. Was great to save a little on it by purchasing through Amazon. Would definitely recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I love how this toner cleans my skin, while still being gentle and made of organic ingredients.</li>
            <li> This toner is great for combatting blemishes and for wiping any excess residue left on skin.  It also has a nice spa smell to it.</li>
            <li> I purchased this with the Honey Oat cleanser and while I wasn&#x27;t a fan of the cleanser I do like the toner.&lt;br /&gt;It does have a stronger scent, I think it&#x27;s lavender according to the packaging.  It does remove any trace makeup or dirt left on my face after I wash it.  As far as acne?  I don&#x27;t have an issue.  It does have tea tree oil in it which is sometime effective in treating small breakouts, my daughter never had any luck with it.  I&#x27;m not sure there&#x27;s enough in this product to make a difference.</li>
            <li> I love this toner. It is moisturizing and does not sting. I use it daily and the breakouts I had went away. I seriously recommend this. The item was shipped super fast and arrived before Christmas...you can&#x27;t beat that. I love it!!! ❤️</li>
            <li> I bought this after a YouTuber strongly recommended it. It says it helps prevent acne, and I don&#x27;t particularly have a lot of acne, just a few stubborn spots on my cheeks and lower jaw. Unfortunately, although this product smells quite nice, for me, applying it morning and night after washing my face for 2 -3 weeks, I&#x27;ve seen no change whatsoever in my skin :( Really disappointed. I have slightly oily skin, but normally just go for \\&quot;normal skin\\&quot; products as I&#x27;ve never thought it&#x27;s oily enough to be considered \\&quot;oily\\&quot;, but yeah...let down... Not saying it&#x27;s bad, it just didn&#x27;t work on me in any way, shape, or form. No reduction in spots and no real change in quality and look of skin.</li>
            <li> I love this toner. This is the only product I use for my acne and it has cleared my skin amazingly. It smells like freshly cut grass, but not annoyingly overwhelming, I actually enjoy the smell. I love that this brand is cruelty free :). Worth every penny.</li>
            <li> I love this product so good on the face works wonders, I will be buying again once I am done with my bottle.</li>
            <li> I personally love this product! It makes my skin feel clean &amp; refreshed. I used to use the &amp;#34;acne free&amp;#34;. Like most 13 year old girls, you get acne (annoying right?) anyways, I use this every morning &amp; night with my purity by philosophy. I literally can&#x27;t express how good this makes my skin feel! It gives me a fresh clean feeling &amp; really helps my break outs.. I would use the purity by philosophy &amp; this together. But I love the product over all! Get some!!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s descent. A bit overpriced for my liking, but a good toner overall.</li>
            <li> This product has GREATLY helped my skin! The scent is extremely strong, and the packaging is odd since it dispenses through a tiny opening, but it&#x27;s not really a deal-breaker for me. I would recommend this to anyone, especially those struggling with acne!</li>
            <li> I enjoyed this at first but didn&#x27;t see a change at all. Will not be repurchasing for the price.</li>
            <li> I used to use toners that have alcohol in them, but they would always burn a little and make my face red and dried out.  The Michael Todd toner is much more soothing and gentler to my skin because it doesn&#x27;t have any alcohol.  I also like this better than the MT lemon toner, too.  It glides on easily, makes my skin feel extra clean without being dried out, and smells good.  I&#x27;d recommend it!</li>
            <li> Best toner ever!! I feel my skin clean all the time</li>
            <li> I first received a sample size of this from birch box, I wasn&#x27;t really excited for it when I got it so I avoided using it. Then one day I just decided too. Anyways.. I&#x27;ve never used a toner prior to this so I guess I didn&#x27;t understand the concept either but I used it on a cotton pad, it ended up getting off the extra makeup I had on my face as well as making my face feel clean and refreshed. I didn&#x27;t get the tight feeling either. So here I am repurchasing the bigger size, totally worth the money 100%.</li>
            <li> Great results if u don&#x27;t mind the smell</li>
            <li> This made me break out. I have acne scarring and combination skin in the summer/dry skin in the winter. Wasn&#x27;t for me.</li>
            <li> The product had a sour odor. I contacted Michael Todd and they informed me that Pure Essence Health is not an authorized distributor of Michael Todd products and that the products I received were outdated.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product a few times in the past. I&#x27;ve always enjoyed it for what it does which is pretty much preventing anti-bacterial acne breakouts. I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s because I bought it on Amazon, but it seems to have some smelly fragrance added to it. I know a lot of the Michael Todd products have been re-packaged and possible reformulated. I prefer the clean, pure smell of the last bottle I had to this slightly cologny musty smell from this bottle.</li>
            <li> This is my second bottle and I think I will continue to order this.  The product itself keeps my skin clear and provides moisture needed in this dry weather.  The only think I don&#x27;t like is that I have to pay for the shipping!</li>
            <li> Cleans and gets off all excess makeup and dirt, does not irritate my often sensitive skin. Sometimes I rinse it off after using it so that it doesn&#x27;t get mixed with my prescription creams.</li>
            <li> Great product. Clears my acne up and is not drying. Highly recommend!</li>
