            <li>It was easy to get the natural ingredients into the bottom.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>They are easy to fill and completely reusable.  </li>
            <li>Very fast service.  </li>

            <li>Works Great, but hard to get the homemade concoction into the bottle.</li>
            <li>pretty well!&lt;br</li>
            <li>I filled mine with natural ingredients (castor oil, Vitamin E, and almond oil) to use on my eyelashes at night before I go to bed.  </li>
            <li>and this was exactly what I needed.</li>
            <li>It was pretty tricky.</li>
            <li>those interested:</li>
            <li>/&gt;However, I give it the 4 stars because it works exactly like a mascara</li>
            <li>easy to fill with a small syringe, or zip top bag with the corner cut out.</li>
            <li>Hopefully this will keep them soft and full.</li>
            <li>I use it twice a day and my lashes have seriously lengthened on their own!</li>
            <li>I mixed coconut oil, castor oil and aloe vera gel (alcohol free just straight gel).</li>
            <li>These cost way too much money for what they are.</li>
            <li>This recipe is light but just enough for me!</li>
            <li>The syringe makes it much easier in my opinion.</li>
            <li>This product is better than I expected.</li>
            <li>really like this mascara ..</li>
            <li>but it does get very gloppy and have to wipe off on tissue...</li>
            <li>so I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s really working</li>
            <li>Works very well with the castor oil i put in.</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t expecting much when I ordered this.  </li>
            <li>Worked really well for my at home mascara recipe.</li>
            <li>and now I know to be more careful.  </li>
            <li>I bought this to put homemade eyelash oil mix in (like many of the other reviewers here-</li>
            <li>Seems to be exactly what I needed so far.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend them.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.  </li>
            <li>I am seeing great results for my normally thin eyebrows!</li>
            <li>These are just new mascara wands.  </li>
            <li>I would make the clear part out of a nice thick glass.</li>
            <li>Product is fine for basic mascara, but brush is very bristly and &amp;#34;old-school.&amp;#34; It doesn&#x27;t seem to pick much product up because there&#x27;s so little room between bristles.</li>
            <li>Make sure you find an extremely small funnel to fill though</li>
            <li>The brush is pretty basic but it makes applying the castor oil to my lashes and brows easier and it does get all of my lashes.</li>
            <li>I used vitamin E oil and castor oil), and it was easy to get the oil in, and the little plastic stopper keeps it from getting out if the tube falls over.</li>
            <li>I kept it empty to use the brush to groom my eyebrows after filling them in, and the clear plastic tube keeps the wand clean in my makeup bag.</li>
            <li>sturdy clear tube with a brush that seems sturdy.</li>
            <li>My clear formula remains clear in the tube and when I apply.</li>
            <li>healthier longer eye lashes the natural way</li>
            <li>but I was happily surprised when I got it in the mail</li>
            <li>So far, I don&#x27;t regret spending the $2, but you get what you pay for.</li>
            <li>or else there most likely will be a mess!</li>
            <li>If you mess up your formula, the container is pretty much shot.</li>
            <li>Now leaving black residue may sound like an odd statement about a mascara tube and it might make a person smile at the irony.  </li>
            <li>Like most of the other buyers, I bought this empty tube to put castor oil in it</li>
            <li>This product is exactly what it looks like: an empty mascara tube with a wand.</li>
            <li>Empty mascara bottle was exactly as advertised.</li>
            <li>The bristles are super-soft and round, the kind that usually comes in plumping-type mascaras.</li>
            <li>The little black piece you see in the picture (above the brush) is supposed to be inserted into the top once you put the mascara in the tube.</li>
            <li>I tried clear nail polish but that would only last a day or so, so I&#x27;m ordering another one</li>
            <li>However, I was looking for an easy, less messy way of applying castor oil to my eyelashes.</li>

            <li> I highly recommend them.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it.  </li>
            <li> I am seeing great results for my normally thin eyebrows!</li>
            <li> These are just new mascara wands.  </li>
            <li> I would make the clear part out of a nice thick glass.</li>
            <li> Product is fine for basic mascara, but brush is very bristly and &amp;#34;old-school.&amp;#34; It doesn&#x27;t seem to pick much product up because there&#x27;s so little room between bristles.</li>
            <li> Make sure you find an extremely small funnel to fill though</li>
            <li> The brush is pretty basic but it makes applying the castor oil to my lashes and brows easier and it does get all of my lashes.</li>
            <li> I used vitamin E oil and castor oil), and it was easy to get the oil in, and the little plastic stopper keeps it from getting out if the tube falls over.</li>
            <li> I kept it empty to use the brush to groom my eyebrows after filling them in, and the clear plastic tube keeps the wand clean in my makeup bag.</li>
            <li> sturdy clear tube with a brush that seems sturdy.</li>
            <li> My clear formula remains clear in the tube and when I apply.</li>
            <li> healthier longer eye lashes the natural way</li>
            <li> but I was happily surprised when I got it in the mail</li>
            <li> So far, I don&#x27;t regret spending the $2, but you get what you pay for.</li>
            <li> or else there most likely will be a mess!</li>
            <li> If you mess up your formula, the container is pretty much shot.</li>
            <li> Now leaving black residue may sound like an odd statement about a mascara tube and it might make a person smile at the irony.  </li>
            <li> Like most of the other buyers, I bought this empty tube to put castor oil in it</li>
            <li> This product is exactly what it looks like: an empty mascara tube with a wand.</li>
            <li> Empty mascara bottle was exactly as advertised.</li>
            <li> The bristles are super-soft and round, the kind that usually comes in plumping-type mascaras.</li>
            <li> The little black piece you see in the picture (above the brush) is supposed to be inserted into the top once you put the mascara in the tube.</li>
            <li> I tried clear nail polish but that would only last a day or so, so I&#x27;m ordering another one</li>
            <li> However, I was looking for an easy, less messy way of applying castor oil to my eyelashes.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if this is normal for the wand or if it is the result of the coconut oil somehow breaking down the fibers.  </li>
            <li> Total waste of  nearly $5!</li>
            <li> (didn&#x27;t take too long to ship either!).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> but that is likely due to the concoction.  </li>
            <li> mixed in this little mascara holder</li>
            <li> This is an empty container with a brush.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not consistent with it</li>
            <li> I bought these to use for my eyelash growth serum, but the brush was extremely clumpy.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m also ordering something to get my serum past the opening without backing up and just being a big mess.&lt;br</li>
            <li> it was packed very carefully.</li>
            <li> It does work and was a reasonable price but the tinted coconut oil is slightly disturbing.</li>
            <li> i hate touching it</li>
            <li> I ordered these so that I could put JBCO (Jamaican black castor oil) in it to use on my eyelashes to help w/ growth.</li>
            <li> the black piece that comes with it that sits inside the opening is genius.  </li>
            <li> I made a little funnel out of aluminum foil to get the castor oil into the little bottle opening.</li>
            <li> like these little tubes a lot.</li>
            <li> fill one of these little babies with castor oil and use on your lashes and see if they grow??</li>
            <li> , be warned: it&#x27;s messy.</li>
            <li> and it was a bit messy</li>
            <li> Seen the difference in a few weeks already.</li>
            <li> It comes with a small funnel that you could use to fill the tube.</li>
            <li> Apply once a day usually at night before I go to bed.</li>
            <li> The tube is plastic and it comes with a rubber stopper thing, I&#x27;m not sure what it&#x27;s called, but you have to put it into the opening of the tube</li>
            <li> Getting the serum in was a very messy ordeal and in the process of shaking and getting the serum to fall in, I somehow cracked it.  </li>
            <li> I would recommend buying the small funnel that is a suggested purchase as it is hard to fill.</li>
            <li> Since castor oil is so thick</li>
            <li> plastic feels thick and durable</li>
            <li> They were somewhat difficult to fill, but this was not the fault of this quality product.</li>
            <li> but it was almost impossible to get my home made mascara into this tube.</li>
            <li> I hate wasting....</li>
            <li> Very disappointed.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> This is just what I needed.  I plan on making homemade mascara.  Looks like a can reuse it, too.  Very fast service.  Will use them again.</li>
            <li> I have ordered two of these to keep oil in for my eyebrows and eyelashes. Nothing fancy, but does what I need it to.</li>
            <li> love them,  I use them to make my own mascara,</li>
            <li> Beware, this is plastic. I was hoping it was glass for some reason so i could sterilize and reuse it. If you mess up your formula, the container is pretty much shot. Total waste of  nearly $5! These cost way too much money for what they are. Very disappointed. Wish they would mention this is plastic.</li>
            <li> Product is fine for basic mascara, but brush is very bristly and &amp;#34;old-school.&amp;#34; It doesn&#x27;t seem to pick much product up because there&#x27;s so little room between bristles. Will probably not order again because of brush type.</li>
            <li> I bought this so I could put Castor Oil in for my lashes. I made a little funnel out of aluminum foil to get the castor oil into the little bottle opening. Worked just fine. The mascara bottle works for what I ordered it for.</li>
            <li> This is a simple mascara case, but I like that... It&#x27;s very dainty and holds just enough. The little black piece you see in the picture (above the brush) is supposed to be inserted into the top once you put the mascara in the tube. It helps slough off clumps of mascara pretty well!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, I made my own mascara out of aloe vera gel, coconut oil, activated charcoal, vitamin E oil, and a bit of bentonite clay. This recipe is light but just enough for me! And it all works so well with this brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are planning to make your own mascara like me for the first time, be warned: it&#x27;s messy. You need to get a syringe of some kind. Don&#x27;t bother with the plastic bag. The syringe makes it much easier in my opinion.</li>
            <li> This product is exactly what it looks like: an empty mascara tube with a wand. The bristles are super-soft and round, the kind that usually comes in plumping-type mascaras. The tube and cap are quality and feel sturdy. It comes with a small funnel that you could use to fill the tube. I kept it empty to use the brush to groom my eyebrows after filling them in, and the clear plastic tube keeps the wand clean in my makeup bag.</li>
            <li> I mixed coconut oil, castor oil and aloe vera gel (alcohol free just straight gel). I mixed this and some how managed to get it into the tube. Apply once a day usually at night before I go to bed.</li>
            <li> This is perfect for putting in your own eyelash mixture.  The product it self seems to be made of good quality and holds a good amount of the mixture that I made.</li>
            <li> This product is better than I expected. I use it to brush coconut oil into my lashes before bed. It actually comes in 3 pieces. The two you see in the picture and then one that makes sure that not too much comes out on the brush which is really nice.</li>
            <li> Good container for my homemade mascara.  A little pricey for what it is, but it seems to be good quality.</li>
            <li> Great product! Would order again!</li>
            <li> like these little tubes a lot. wish there were more! easy to fill with a small syringe, or zip top bag with the corner cut out.</li>
            <li> I bought this to put homemade eyelash oil mix in (like many of the other reviewers here- I used vitamin E oil and castor oil), and it was easy to get the oil in, and the little plastic stopper keeps it from getting out if the tube falls over. Seems to be exactly what I needed so far.</li>
            <li> Great product. Many uses from homemade mascara to eyelash serum. Only wish they sold them in multiple&#x27;s instead of singles.</li>
            <li> This is an empty container with a brush. One must fill it with whatever product one wishes.  I haven&#x27;t used it yet.</li>
            <li> Very nice design, looks like a quality product.  Definitely need a funnel to fill but that will be the case with any kind of mascara container.  I will buy more.</li>
            <li> When I decided I would make my own mascara, I needed to have a dispenser and this works just perfectly.</li>
            <li> These mascara tubes are great!  The are easy to fill if you use a medicine dropper or syringe, and work very well.</li>
            <li> really like this mascara .. but it does get very gloppy and have to wipe off on tissue...I hate wasting.... but overall, it&#x27;s great mascara ..best one i ever owned</li>
            <li> this item arrived in perfect condition. it was packed very carefully. I live in Alaska and it comes a long way to me and it was in perfect condition</li>
            <li> This is a nicely sized bottle. I use it for my castor oil to apply easily to my lashes. It&#x27;s a nice bottle, if I needed more I would re order</li>
            <li> These work great and are just as functional as the ones you buy in the store. I make my own homeade products as well as use jamaican castor oil in some of the tubes for healthy lashes :)</li>
            <li> I love making my own mascara also they say castor oil helps your eyelashes grow.  fill one of these little babies with castor oil and use on your lashes and see if they grow??</li>
            <li> I purchased so I could make my own eyelash growth serum, it has held up very well. I can&#x27;t believe more people don&#x27;t sell these, arrived promptly.</li>
            <li> I bought this to make my own mascara.  I had difficulty getting the mascara in the tube but that is likely due to the concoction.  This seemed adequate, had an average-quality brush and the top screwed on just fine so it didn&#x27;t leak.</li>
            <li> i love this! i did some research and turns out castor oil and vitamin e oil are good at helping with eyebrow hair growth.  Since castor oil is so thick i hate touching it so now i dont need to! i put castor oil and vitamin e oil mixed in this little mascara holder and i apply it with the brush every evening to help with hair growth! I am seeing great results for my normally thin eyebrows!</li>
            <li> This product is great.  I ordered 3.  I made my own mascara and found them very durable, and easy to use.  I will definitely order again.  Item shipped quickly.</li>
            <li> Works Great, but hard to get the homemade concoction into the bottle.</li>
            <li> It is as described. I have not used it yet but it is a regular mascara bottle. I am going to make my own mascara and put it in this bottle.&lt;br /&gt;Should be fun, and on top of that I know there&#x27;s not chemicals in it.</li>
            <li> I ordered these so that I could put JBCO (Jamaican black castor oil) in it to use on my eyelashes to help w/ growth. I&#x27;m not consistent with it so I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s really working lol but the containers were just what i needed. I liked the added insert as well.</li>
            <li> Now leaving black residue may sound like an odd statement about a mascara tube and it might make a person smile at the irony.  I bought this tube to use for applying coconut oil on my lashes at night.  With the whitish oil, it is obvious that the oil comes off with a gray/black coloring to it.  I don&#x27;t know if this is normal for the wand or if it is the result of the coconut oil somehow breaking down the fibers.  It does work and was a reasonable price but the tinted coconut oil is slightly disturbing.</li>
            <li> I bought these to use for my eyelash growth serum, but the brush was extremely clumpy. I ended up just using my fingers. The bottle itself also leaked a ton, and I threw this out before I could even use all of the serum.</li>
            <li> These are just new mascara wands.  I used them to add castor oil to.  The castor oil is supposed to help lash growth.  I bought two and use them on my lashes and my brows.  I labeled them and keep them separate.  In a couple weeks I have noticed a great deal of growth.</li>
            <li> The clear mascara tube is made of strong plastic, not flimsy at all, and contains a rubber stopper and wand.  I filled mine with natural ingredients (castor oil, Vitamin E, and almond oil) to use on my eyelashes at night before I go to bed.  Hopefully this will keep them soft and full.</li>
            <li> Works very well with the castor oil i put in.</li>
            <li> I attempted making my own mascara and this was exactly what I needed. I would recommend buying the small funnel that is a suggested purchase as it is hard to fill. I used a plastic bag with a hole cut in the corner and it was a bit messy</li>
            <li> جميل هذا المنتج اقوم بملئه بما أريد واستخدمه كنت أبحث عن هذا ماسكرا فارغه منذ زمن والحمدلله أني وجدته هنا شكرا</li>
            <li> sturdy clear tube with a brush that seems sturdy. the only problem I had was getting my homemade mascara into the tube. It was pretty tricky.</li>
            <li> Empty mascara bottle was exactly as advertised. Make sure you find an extremely small funnel to fill though or else there most likely will be a mess!</li>
            <li> Used the bottle to create an eyelash strengthening oil for my eyelashes. The container worked perfectly! Glad it shipped pretty quickly.</li>
            <li> This is perfect for me, I am using almond oil at night to see if it will grow my lashes, takes for months to see improvement.  But these are perfect.</li>
            <li> I used mine for Castor Oil for the regrowth of my eyelashes. It works  great...I also take the Biotin and Keratin vitamins. Seen the difference in a few weeks already.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t expecting much when I ordered this.  I found this great DIY on pinterest on how to get healthier longer eye lashes the natural way and I figured I&#x27;d give it a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I thought this would be a bit flimsy but I was happily surprised when I got it in the mail (didn&#x27;t take too long to ship either!).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The plastic feels thick and durable so I&#x27;m not worried about the bottle cracking.  It was easy to get the natural ingredients into the bottom.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I gave it 4 stars since I&#x27;ve only had it for 2 days.  I want to see how it holds up over time!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For those interested: [...]</li>
            <li> Worked really well for my at home mascara recipe. Was very pleased with this and will order again in the future.</li>
            <li> For the at home cosmetic chemist these are perfect!  They are easy to fill and completely reusable.  I highly recommend them.</li>
            <li> I bought this tube specifically to make my own lash growth serum and the size it perfect! I use it twice a day and my lashes have seriously lengthened on their own!</li>
            <li> Great item, i love it simply because i make my own lash serum to keep them long strong and healthy so this is a +++ item!The tube is nicely made and no leaking, its perfect thank you, oh and very well packaged too thank you.</li>
            <li> Definitely will buy again. Used this for making homemade mascara.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a mascara brush and tube for an experiment I wanted to try. This is absolutely perfect, would highly recommend!</li>
            <li> I use this to make my homemade lash extension formula.  It works as well as any mascara tube.  Doesn&#x27;t leak.  My clear formula remains clear in the tube and when I apply.</li>
            <li> I use this to put baby oil on my lashes after I take my mascara off.....It was a must have for me.</li>
            <li> This Brush and case is wonderful and will help my eyelash growth serum to last a super long time, the brush is nice n soft yet strong and fully covers across the eyelashes. This was an excellent purchase and I will purchase more.</li>
            <li> I admit I have no idea what that plug is for unless it&#x27;s just that a plug for when you have the brush out.  I wanted to use this to hold the ingredients to an eyelash growth serum. Getting the serum in was a very messy ordeal and in the process of shaking and getting the serum to fall in, I somehow cracked it.  I tried clear nail polish but that would only last a day or so, so I&#x27;m ordering another one and now I know to be more careful.  I&#x27;m also ordering something to get my serum past the opening without backing up and just being a big mess.&lt;br /&gt;However, I give it the 4 stars because it works exactly like a mascara would and it&#x27;s nice to be able to see the contents inside.</li>
            <li> This product was just as advertised, it was also a very quick shipment, thank you very much! I look forward to using it to make my own mascara</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s cheap and great for testing things you find on Pinterest. So far, I don&#x27;t regret spending the $2, but you get what you pay for.</li>
            <li> This is a good empty container for doing my own DIY lash growth serum. AWESOME!</li>
            <li> I like it. It isn&#x27;t how I would make a mascara tube, which is why I put 4 stars out of 5. I would make the clear part out of a nice thick glass. But then it wouldn&#x27;t be as cheap as these ones! Brush works well. Plastic part is fine. I just prefer glass. But I don&#x27;t think glass mascara tubes exist!</li>
            <li> Great item just what I ordered</li>
            <li> I ordered to use for a home mix to grow eyelashes.  Container is as advertised and very happy with the product.</li>
            <li> These mascara tubes worked well for my homemade mascara.  They were somewhat difficult to fill, but this was not the fault of this quality product.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s nice, i use it to put coconut and castor oil to treat my eye lashes</li>
            <li> I use these mascara wands to apply castor and coconut oil to apply to my lashes and brows. I want them to grow longer and thicker and these work perfectly.</li>
            <li> I like the brush but it was almost impossible to get my home made mascara into this tube.</li>
            <li> These mascara tubes are made way better than I thought they would be. Enjoying being able to make my own mascara without all the preservatives and fillers manufactured mascara has in it. Thank you for making a way for me to use my homemade mascara without worry. Perfect!</li>
            <li> I do not make my own mascara.  However, I was looking for an easy, less messy way of applying castor oil to my eyelashes. (This supposedly helps them grow longer and stronger with time.)  This product fit the bill perfectly.  I highly recommend it.  It is a great quality item, not cheap looking at all.</li>
            <li> I got this to apply castor oil to my lashes every night.  I was able to fill it completely without spilling and the black piece that comes with it that sits inside the opening is genius.  I would buy more if I ever need it. Love it.</li>
            <li> Like most of the other buyers, I bought this empty tube to put castor oil in it so I could easily apply to my lashes and brows. The tube is plastic and it comes with a rubber stopper thing, I&#x27;m not sure what it&#x27;s called, but you have to put it into the opening of the tube and it helps to scrape off excess product on the brush. The brush is pretty basic but it makes applying the castor oil to my lashes and brows easier and it does get all of my lashes. It&#x27;s a great buy and works great for my uses.</li>
