            <li>the colors are changed by hot or cold...also the colors are not as nice as they appear on the bottle....</li>
            <li>Nail Polish is too light and chips off easily.</li>

            <li>Did not look pretty, no shine or smooth.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not even worth the one atar rating</li>
            <li>This polish is a lot of fun .</li>

            <li> The polish did not change at all. This purchase was complete waste of my money. This item is definitely not worth buying.</li>
            <li> Nail Polish is too light and chips off easily. Excellent color change but doesn&#x27;t stay on long. It starts chipping immediately after application.</li>
            <li> They don&#x27;t change color like they should to me. Actually they don&#x27;t change at all except in the bottle under running water. have other brands that change very well.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ok I especially like the orange,blue, green and pink one but the purple really didn&#x27;t work</li>

            <li> Didn&#x27;t change colors at all. And the eating are junk. Sticker earing would have been better. The polish doesn&#x27;t change no mater how thick you put it on. Wish I could return it but I don&#x27;t want to pay for shipping, plus some of the polish color my niece likes even tho they don&#x27;t change color like they are supposed too. Just wish I could have saved some money. It&#x27;s not even worth the one atar rating</li>
            <li> Was disappointed, the colors were real dull, chipped right away, it did change colors tho, the tips would change with the change of hot &amp; cold from holding a cold soda or hot cup of coffee. Did not look pretty, no shine or smooth. I was thinking maybe it got frozen in travel.</li>
            <li> Did not change color. This product was a rip off! Would not buy again!!!</li>
