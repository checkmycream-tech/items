            <li>I love this aloe vera oil for my hair.</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>With most of the oils I mentioned I can see some benefit to my skin--</li>
            <li>satisfied with the product.</li>
            <li>I know nothing about Dr. Adorable.</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m sure it will be fine.  </li>
            <li>I got this because I burn really easily in the summer.</li>
            <li>I used it mainly on my skin and loved the results.</li>
            <li>I love my aloe and this pure organic is light and goes on my skin very smoothly.  </li>
            <li>Nice size works really well when I&#x27;m making my bath products and when I use it in my bathwater</li>
            <li>Seemed very fresh.</li>
            <li>pretty sure I had an ulcer.</li>
            <li>Nice and ligh, soaks in pretty well for a straight oil.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t bother with all those compounded harsh chemicals on all the shelves sold with beautiful seductive commercials.</li>
            <li>Makes my hair feel very soft and easy to manage.</li>
            <li>Very high quality!</li>
            <li>First,  it arrived the day after I purchase it.</li>
            <li>the dr adorable brand is the only brand I can vouch for however.</li>
            <li>I have used many different oils</li>
            <li>It appears to be a good product, but directions, ingredients, processing or ANYthing proving the safety of the product, etc. is missing.</li>
            <li>Soaks in beautifully and has no scent so it can be used as a carrier oil for other essential oils.  </li>
            <li>this stuff is amazing on the outside, just imagine what it can do on the inside!&amp;#34; So far I have no complaints, it has helped me inside and out and I would highly recommend this product to anyone who was interested.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think this product is real.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s unusual for me to use anything without some assurance of its purity from the manufacturer.</li>
            <li>it works better than olive coconut shea butter jojoba or any other oil</li>
            <li>I give high ratings.</li>
            <li>this one smelled like old vegetable oil and didn&#x27;t really do anything for my skin.  </li>
            <li>Will definitely purchase more in the near future.</li>
            <li>Great fast absorbing after shower oil - does have a slight cooking oil smell, but nothing a few drops of essential oil added to the bottle wouldn&#x27;t fix.</li>
            <li>Mixed well with other oils, very light smell.</li>
            <li>This was my first purchase of this brand and this item and it won&#x27;t be my last.  </li>
            <li>Your skin will never be the same after your first application.</li>
            <li>makes my skin soft and even tone</li>
            <li>My husband uses it everyday and appears to enjoy it.</li>
            <li>I have kinky natural hair</li>
            <li>Tip if you want a very moisturing spritz for hair daily mix 1/2 oz of this with a few squirts of herbal essence conditioner smooth lisse and fill the rest with water and shake.</li>
            <li>Makes your skin so soft.</li>
            <li>But it can be dealt with by storing in a dark, cool place to make the quality last.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> This is a great quality oil.  I have used it for the obvious sunburn healing, but also I rub it on my scalp once a week to help my dry scalp.  I will definitely be replenishing from the same source when I run out!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think this product is real. It&#x27;s consistency is too thick, also if it where purely from aloe vera it wouldn&#x27;t have a yellow tint to it. It seems like some type of generic vegetable oil. Also I can not seem to find the location where it was manufactured. On the bottle it states \\&quot;country of origin South Africa\\&quot; however I think it is misleading.</li>
            <li> makes my skin soft and even tone</li>
            <li> I seldom ever leave negative reviews but feel I should.  This oil stains your clothing and the stains cannot be removed.  I have ruined two shirts after applying the oil to my arms.  My wife noticed the pillow cases were stained but we could not figure out the cause.  It is the oil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hope someone can tell me how to remove the stains from a $400 shirt.</li>
            <li> wonderful oil, for hair and body, do an excellent job</li>
            <li> I purchase quite a bit of oils from Dr. Adorable Inc and I&#x27;m always pleased with my purchases. I love Aloe Vera Oil for my skin and hair products. Great stuff!</li>
            <li> I give high ratings. First,  it arrived the day after I purchase it. My husband uses it everyday and appears to enjoy it. I use it in my hair and skin and I like the oil.</li>
            <li> arrived on time and correct</li>
            <li> This was my first purchase of this brand and this item and it won&#x27;t be my last.  I love this aloe vera oil for my hair.</li>
            <li> Aloe Vera Oil helps boost healing of the skin especially burns and cuts. It is odorless. I love this product.</li>
            <li> I purchased this oil to pair with vitamin E oil, distilled water and rosewater for a homemade body mist.  Love it!  I will purchase more!</li>
            <li> Is all that I hoped for.</li>
            <li> Seemed very fresh. Mixed well with other oils, very light smell. Will definitely purchase more in the near future. Great!</li>
            <li> I love my aloe and this pure organic is light and goes on my skin very smoothly.  Delivery was excellent and will order again.</li>
            <li> Excellent Product. I have psoriasis and i use it every day to help with the dryness. It has been helping a lot!!!</li>
            <li> Great for smooth skin.</li>
            <li> This is the best oil ever I will be doing a youtube review on my channel for this. I have kinky natural hair this stuff works wonders. it works better than olive coconut shea butter jojoba or any other oil I have used to try to get my hair moisturized the dr adorable brand is the only brand I can vouch for however. Tip if you want a very moisturing spritz for hair daily mix 1/2 oz of this with a few squirts of herbal essence conditioner smooth lisse and fill the rest with water and shake. The dry hair I gone your hair will twist and bantu knot and wash n go like a charm. don&#x27;t waste your money on all those other oils. I&#x27;ve tried them all for you and this is it. Your welcome</li>
            <li> including olive, coconut, pomegranate, rosehip seed oil, grapeseed oil. . but this one didn&#x27;t do it for me.  With most of the oils I mentioned I can see some benefit to my skin-- this one smelled like old vegetable oil and didn&#x27;t really do anything for my skin.  I love aloe, and wish I could say this one was good but it just didn&#x27;t measure up.</li>
            <li> Makes my hair feel very soft and easy to manage.</li>
            <li> Best and purest Aloe Vera oil. Your skin will never be the same after your first application. Don&#x27;t bother with all those compounded harsh chemicals on all the shelves sold with beautiful seductive commercials. Dr Adorable is the best and nourishes your skin naturally.</li>
            <li> I got this to spray on my bird after bathing.  I just adopted her, so we haven&#x27;t used it yet, but I&#x27;m sure it will be fine.  It is light, thin and there is really not smell that I noticed.</li>
            <li> Great Oil&lt;br /&gt;Very satisfied with the product.</li>
            <li> Nice size works really well when I&#x27;m making my bath products and when I use it in my bathwater thank you kindly..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;sincerely yours Jennifer Marciano&lt;br /&gt;PS to all the readers: My packages were late because I ordered during the holiday seasons so it took some time, We all know how that goes.&lt;br /&gt;You can only blame some post office not the seller......</li>
            <li> Nice and ligh, soaks in pretty well for a straight oil. Aloe is supposed to be healing, I have dry &amp;  irritated skin and I think this oil helps.</li>
            <li> Great product. Makes your skin so soft.</li>
            <li> This oil is AMAZING.....I have used many different oils but this is the BEST. As always with Dr Adorable fast shipping &amp; another wonderful product.</li>
            <li> I got this because I burn really easily in the summer. Thankfully this year I actually used sunscreen (homemade) and didn&#x27;t burn as bad, but there were still come spots. This stuff healed it overnight, no joke. I was very impressed. I used it mainly on my skin and loved the results. I recently have been adding a little bit each day to my water bottle and it has helped with my digestive issues - pretty sure I had an ulcer. I thought to myself, &amp;#34;if this stuff is amazing on the outside, just imagine what it can do on the inside!&amp;#34; So far I have no complaints, it has helped me inside and out and I would highly recommend this product to anyone who was interested.</li>
            <li> Very high quality! Perfect!</li>
            <li> It appears to be a good product, but directions, ingredients, processing or ANYthing proving the safety of the product, etc. is missing. (my reason for 3 stars) It&#x27;s unusual for me to use anything without some assurance of its purity from the manufacturer. My using it is based on Amazon&#x27;s reputation. I know nothing about Dr. Adorable.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s wonderful aloe, however I don&#x27;t like that it is in a plastic container and see-through.  Essential oils should be in glass amber or cobalt blue containers. But it can be dealt with by storing in a dark, cool place to make the quality last. But for the price, the size and quality is great.</li>
            <li> Great oil for the price.  Soaks in beautifully and has no scent so it can be used as a carrier oil for other essential oils.  Great on sunburn.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not aloe vera its some type of oil</li>
            <li> Great fast absorbing after shower oil - does have a slight cooking oil smell, but nothing a few drops of essential oil added to the bottle wouldn&#x27;t fix. I mix mine with scented lotions and that works great for me. I have dry skin and I find this oil moisturizes well without a greasy residue.</li>
