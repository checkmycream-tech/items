            <li>I love the scent of sandalwood and now I can love it more.</li>
            <li>I am glad to make it a part of my morning routine.</li>
            <li>THIS MAKES A WONDERFUL GIFT TO MANY DIFFERENT PEOPLE.</li>
            <li>one of my favorite fragrances from Bath and Body Works.</li>
            <li>It is my favorite lotion for about 2 years now.</li>
            <li>names\\&quot;, I know which to avoid, and I make sure</li>
            <li>At this time, we have not been provided a definitive date  as to when the Sandalwood Rose product line will become available.</li>
            <li>So glad it was still available out there somewhere.</li>
            <li>We are pleased that you are still interested in our Sandalwood Rose.    </li>
            <li>I am originally from Asia and the idea of Sandalwood with rose appealed to me as a super combo...</li>
            <li>I knew I loved it when I bought it from my local store and would love to see more sandlewood products.</li>
            <li>Great fragrance--goes on strong and invigorating in the morning and levels off nicely after a few hours.</li>
            <li>Okay...I fell for all the hype and ended up ordering  this lotion and body wash from bbw website with free shipping code.</li>
            <li>No longer available in an of the stores. ?</li>
            <li>haven&#x27;t experienced any allergic reaction until today, when I put it on and five minutes later was breaking out into hives.</li>
            <li>You&#x27;re better off finding a higher quality lotion.</li>
            <li>I was first acquainted to this fragrance through a friend.  </li>
            <li>This has been my long time favorite for many years!  </li>
            <li>paying 50$ on ebay per bottle is a bit much, even for a favorite scent...</li>
            <li>This was priced so fairly and arrived brand new, well packaged, and very timely.  </li>
            <li>I receive more compliments on this product because it is soft and never too strong or offensive.  </li>
            <li>This is one of those wonderful, pleasing smells, that when you wear it, everyone and I do mean everyone, says, &amp;#34;Oh</li>
            <li>Shipped quickly.</li>
            <li>I am very satisfied and would definitely buy from this vendor again.</li>
            <li>I love this product so much that I am willing to pay an increased cost via Amazon.com</li>
            <li>I got an email from people that work for Bath and Body Works saying that sandalwood rose would be back in June for the semi annual sale.</li>
            <li>Each time I find the sandlewood rose fragrance I have to buy multiple!</li>
            <li>The scent is automatically calming and worth the cost.</li>
            <li>then I can understand why this might be worth the price to you</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t say that I feel less stressed, but I love the aroma and that does make me feel better.  </li>
            <li>This lotion and line in general does nothing magical for you.</li>
            <li>As new fragrances become available in our  Classics Collection, we will send an email to announce their return.  </li>
            <li>It made me feel powerful and sexy at the same time.  </li>
            <li>Was going out of town and really needed it quickly - and got it.</li>
            <li>Very fast and in store condition.  </li>
            <li>, I think of a number of other cheap smells that they can do away with, but I was happy to finally find this smell at a reasonable price.</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>I bought my bottle for $3 on a sale a years back and fell in love.  </li>
            <li>I love getting my back rubbed with this stuff</li>
            <li>I no longer buy a product based on pretty packaging, branding, or scent.</li>
            <li>Regular store does not carry it anymore, glad my daughter found it here.</li>
            <li>Sincerely,      Tracey S.  BathandBodyWorks.com Customer Service      I suggest flooding their email begging for this back!</li>
            <li>would never be worth 60.00 for a 6oz bottle its bath and body works I like the scent but not that much.</li>
            <li>We will provide email updates as new  Classic scents become available.    </li>
            <li>This really has a pretty synthetic smell...</li>
            <li>I fell in love with it&#x27;s scent &amp; the richness of the cream &amp; decided to buy it even though it was more expensive than I had originally</li>
            <li>I CERTAINLY WILL INCLUDE MYSELF.</li>
            <li>Very highly priced compared to bath and body works price of $13 a bottle.</li>
            <li>but when the purchase cost is just a little more than the shipping why pay more to ship earlier?</li>
            <li>Very soothing put it on at bedtime.  </li>
            <li>Very soothing and relaxing.</li>
            <li>but I really like sandalwood scents and decided to indulge myself.  </li>
            <li>I just can&#x27;t find a scent I like as much as this one.</li>
            <li>This is the only item I actually enjoy from Bath and Body Works.</li>
            <li>I had NO idea there was \\&quot;hype\\&quot; about this item or that people are selling the stuff for this much on line until today.</li>
            <li>you&#x27;re like me, and enjoy the scent because you associate it with a specific period of your life, etc.</li>
            <li>even the rose is not very rose like.</li>
            <li>but like another review mentioned the scent is not authentic rose and sandalwood.</li>
            <li>This is hands down my favorite lotion ever.  </li>
            <li>No, I&#x27;m not promoting any particular brand.</li>
            <li>and Body Works in general has a ton of low quality ingredients that do nothing for your skin except lather it with gunk like sulfates, parabens, and drying ingredients that are cheap to use and make profit from.  </li>
            <li>Unfortunately we have experienced a delay in receiving this product from  our vendors.  </li>
            <li>Purchased online since the store does not produce this regularly--I am told in limited batches on special occasions.</li>
            <li>Just like new.</li>
            <li>The scent is definitely sexy and very womanly -- not a fragrance for college aged women or teens but for adult women.  </li>
            <li>People with sensitive skin: beware!</li>
            <li>However, If you&#x27;re new to it and haven&#x27;t tried it you&#x27;re really NOT missing out.</li>
            <li>Wow.  </li>
            <li>Was exactly what I expected -- had used the Bath &amp; Body Works Aromatherapy before and could not find it again until I found it on Amazon!  </li>
            <li>I was shocked it has been discontinued, I dont understand why Bath and Body Works would discontinue such a popular scent with a cool bottle.</li>

            <li> I do suggest we pass the email address to friends and family to ask them to email BBW and tell them they need to bring this scent back and keep it around for a long while.</li>
            <li> Just a small pump to moisturize my hands at night has helped my skin improve tremendously, with the added benefit of that soothing scent drifting past my nose all night while I sleep.</li>
            <li> Body stores limited it.  </li>
            <li> This product is my absolute favorite and I was very disappointed when I could no longer buy it at Bath and Body Works.  </li>
            <li> Love this too bad Bath and Body Works doesn&#x27;t sell it anymore.</li>
            <li> When I finally ran out a few weeks ago</li>
            <li> if u have ever used Sandalwood oil...or sandalwood in any other form you would know.</li>
            <li> This bottle of lotion was pretty expensive compared to the others</li>
            <li> It was a little expensive but to me worth it.</li>
            <li> Sandalwood is a scent that&#x27;s hard to find locally or on-line.  </li>
            <li> With that said, this is not worth the $79.</li>
            <li> when Bath &amp; Body Works let me down.</li>

            <li> everyone, stop buying sandalwood rose from this over pticed distributor. I got an email from people that work for Bath and Body Works saying that sandalwood rose would be back in June for the semi annual sale. so save your money and wait till June</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t expecting this to be all packaged up, but it was :]  Came as if i had gotten it in the store!</li>
            <li> Great calming essense.  This fragrance blend was discontinued at Bath &amp; Body Works.  Several of us would like to see this one come back.</li>
            <li> when Bath &amp; Body Works let me down. This is my favorite fragrance of lotion at B&amp;BW, but they have quit selling it.    Let me know if you get any more. I&#x27;m also looking for Vickery &amp; Clarke anti-oxidant face serum. CVS suddenly quit selling it. Let me know if you get any of that as well.    Thanks!</li>
            <li> Great lotion, no longer available in stores.  Love the feel and scent.</li>
            <li> Okay...I fell for all the hype and ended up ordering  this lotion and body wash from bbw website with free shipping code. Cheapest way to do it i guess considering its not found in stores. That said...This really has a pretty synthetic smell...if u have ever used Sandalwood oil...or sandalwood in any other form you would know. I am originally from Asia and the idea of Sandalwood with rose appealed to me as a super combo...But this was on the contrary...I think this is woody but to call it sandalwood and even the rose is not very rose like. The combination is good...not great.IMO</li>
            <li> B&amp;BW stopped making this. I found it online and it&#x27;s just like the sample I bought in the store.  Purchase and shipping were a breeze. Thumbs up.</li>
            <li> Love the smell. No longer available in an of the stores. ?</li>
            <li> So happy to be able to find this product.  I was very satisfied with the way it was packaged when delivered.  Would use this company again.</li>
            <li> Arrived packaged safely and no problems. This has been discontinued by Bath and Body - the only scent I ever wore for years.  No cologne or body spray, but the lotion is thick but not greasy.  Love it.</li>
            <li> LOVE this scent. So glad it was still available out there somewhere.</li>
            <li> This product is my absolute favorite and I was very disappointed when I could no longer buy it at Bath and Body Works.  The scent is perfect for me and moisturizing properties long-lasting. My request is that you continue to carry this item -- if you choose to discontinue, please provide advance notice so I can purchase enough to last my lifetime.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not he product I had a problem with it was the delivery time. Sixteen days is a little long to deliver a small package. I knew I had options but when the purchase cost is just a little more than the shipping why pay more to ship earlier? I actually ended up going to Bath and body works store and got the same product a week before I received my package. I only ordered on line that because I understood that this product wasn&#x27;t going to be produced any longer.</li>
            <li> Couldn&#x27;t find this product anywhere for years - can&#x27;t believe they actually had it!  It&#x27;s awesome!</li>
            <li> Very soothing put it on at bedtime.  Lovely too smell whilst I slumber.  Also is a wonderful to wake to.</li>
            <li> I receive more compliments on this product because it is soft and never too strong or offensive.  Very soothing and relaxing.</li>
            <li> Was exactly what I expected -- had used the Bath &amp; Body Works Aromatherapy before and could not find it again until I found it on Amazon!  Thanks&lt;br /&gt;Also am enjoying the Massage Oil.</li>
            <li> I too have sent an email to BBW and got a similar letter suggesting I sign up for their emails but I need more email like I need to have my limbs amputated.  However, they did provide the website for the classics line (...) and I just have a reminder in my microsoft outlook to check the site once a week.  Some of the classics fragrances are greatly discounted so it is a good deal.    My husband, who loves the smell of this scent on me, waxes nostalgic about the bathroom smelling like a \\&quot;Turkish Harem\\&quot; when I used it.  Actually the fragrance wafted from our bedroom/bathroom into the living room and when I came out he would perk up and grin at me.  The scent is definitely sexy and very womanly -- not a fragrance for college aged women or teens but for adult women.  It made me feel powerful and sexy at the same time.  I do suggest we pass the email address to friends and family to ask them to email BBW and tell them they need to bring this scent back and keep it around for a long while.</li>
            <li> i ABSOLUTELY Loved this scent and line of products.  I don&#x27;t know why they discontinued it, but they should, please, please bring it back.  It&#x27;s the best scent I&#x27;ve ever used....</li>
            <li> This is hands down my favorite lotion ever.  Each time I find the sandlewood rose fragrance I have to buy multiple!</li>
            <li> This bottle of lotion was pretty expensive compared to the others but I really like sandalwood scents and decided to indulge myself.  Wow.  It is one of the best scents I have ever experienced.  The Rose combined with the Sandalwood creates a uniquely wonderful aroma.  The lotion is very thick and comes in a glass pump bottle.  Very happy to have found this.</li>
            <li> I love the scent of sandalwood and now I can love it more. The feel is warm an smoothing to my body. I am glad to make it a part of my morning routine.</li>
            <li> I found this was discontinued in candles, body lotions, spritz, etc.!!!!!  I found it here on Amazon and was very happy to see to get it a price that was not a rip off. You only need a tiny bit for all over so I definitely will use it sparingly.</li>
            <li> THIS MAKES A WONDERFUL GIFT TO MANY DIFFERENT PEOPLE. I THINK IT WILL SERVE ME WELL ON MY&lt;br /&gt;CHRISTMAS LIST. I CERTAINLY WILL INCLUDE MYSELF. THE QUICK SERVICE MADE A VERY GOOD IMPRESSION.</li>
            <li> I have been looking for this product since it has been discontinued. I have found it on other sites at outrageous prices. This was priced so fairly and arrived brand new, well packaged, and very timely.  I am very satisfied and would definitely buy from this vendor again.</li>
            <li> I love the smell of this lotion! I got it in december as a way to help relieve stress at college. I don&#x27;t use it every day but maybe once every two weeks or so.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I haven&#x27;t experienced any allergic reaction until today, when I put it on and five minutes later was breaking out into hives. As soon as I washed off the lotion with soap and water, the hives started disappearing, so it was definitely something in the lotion. People with sensitive skin: beware!</li>
            <li> Love this too bad Bath and Body Works doesn&#x27;t sell it anymore. Many compliments!! It was a little expensive but to me worth it.</li>
            <li> This is another wonderful find.  Sandalwood is a scent that&#x27;s hard to find locally or on-line.  I hope to buy it again.</li>
            <li> I love the smooth and silky skin smell so good</li>
            <li> I just can&#x27;t find a scent I like as much as this one. Shipped quickly. Just like new. Just wish they were still making it.</li>
            <li> Very fast and in store condition.  Thank you! Was going out of town and really needed it quickly - and got it.</li>
            <li> one of my favorite fragrances from Bath and Body Works. Have no idea why they discontinued it, I think of a number of other cheap smells that they can do away with, but I was happy to finally find this smell at a reasonable price.</li>
            <li> I knew I loved it when I bought it from my local store and would love to see more sandlewood products.</li>
            <li> I love this lotion! The scent is automatically calming and worth the cost. It is my favorite lotion for about 2 years now.</li>
            <li> Very nice! Like it alot</li>
            <li> This is the only item I actually enjoy from Bath and Body Works. I bought my bottle for $3 on a sale a years back and fell in love.  I had NO idea there was \\&quot;hype\\&quot; about this item or that people are selling the stuff for this much on line until today. With that said, this is not worth the $79. I love getting my back rubbed with this stuff but like another review mentioned the scent is not authentic rose and sandalwood. This lotion and line in general does nothing magical for you. The ingredients aren&#x27;t all that!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re like me, and enjoy the scent because you associate it with a specific period of your life, etc. then I can understand why this might be worth the price to you (it&#x27;s not to me). However, If you&#x27;re new to it and haven&#x27;t tried it you&#x27;re really NOT missing out. You&#x27;re better off finding a higher quality lotion. Google skin care forums and read about the things people are using that actually make a difference in their skin. Don&#x27;t believe the hype about the sandalwood rose line!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bath and Body Works in general has a ton of low quality ingredients that do nothing for your skin except lather it with gunk like sulfates, parabens, and drying ingredients that are cheap to use and make profit from.  I used to shop there all the time until I became an informed consumer. I no longer buy a product based on pretty packaging, branding, or scent. I look at the ingredients try to understand the \\&quot;weird names\\&quot;, I know which to avoid, and I make sure I get what I&#x27;m paying for. Don&#x27;t be deceived! Get informed before you give your money away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Look up HOMEMADE Vitamin C Serum, the Oil Cleansing Method, zinc oxide sunscreen, and essential oils. No, I&#x27;m not promoting any particular brand. Get informed! It changed my skin and my life.</li>
            <li> This has been my long time favorite for many years!  So dissapointed the Bath @ Body stores limited it.  Don&#x27;t like paying a lot extra just to order on line &amp; charged additional fee from yet another company.</li>
            <li> Regular store does not carry it anymore, glad my daughter found it here. Keep up the good work and keep it in please</li>
            <li> I love this product so much that I am willing to pay an increased cost via Amazon.com</li>
            <li> Purchased online since the store does not produce this regularly--I am told in limited batches on special occasions. Great fragrance--goes on strong and invigorating in the morning and levels off nicely after a few hours.</li>
            <li> Have been using this body lotion for years. When I finally ran out a few weeks ago I was shocked it has been discontinued, I dont understand why Bath and Body Works would discontinue such a popular scent with a cool bottle.</li>
            <li> This lotion smells amazing.  Just a small pump to moisturize my hands at night has helped my skin improve tremendously, with the added benefit of that soothing scent drifting past my nose all night while I sleep. I&#x27;m going to order the body wash as well.  Why on earth was this ever discontinued?</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say that I feel less stressed, but I love the aroma and that does make me feel better.  The product was well protected in bubble wrap and I will purchase this item again.</li>
            <li> This is one of those wonderful, pleasing smells, that when you wear it, everyone and I do mean everyone, says, &amp;#34;Oh you smell so good, what are you wearing!&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> This is in truth the ONLY lotion I&#x27;ll use, the only Scent I&#x27;ll use.     Recently I sent an Email to their CS since lets face it.. paying 50$ on ebay per bottle is a bit much, even for a favorite scent... and I was told -        Dear Sheridan,    We are pleased that you are still interested in our Sandalwood Rose.

            <li> offer was 60.00 for 6 bottles.  reg price is 11.00. I only got 1 bottle. sent mess to company and said i would like to return as not what i read. would never be worth 60.00 for a 6oz bottle its bath and body works I like the scent but not that much. Paid to ship back not happy.</li>
            <li> Very highly priced compared to bath and body works price of $13 a bottle. Love the scent!!! Best scent of any bath and body works fragrances.</li>
            <li> I was first acquainted to this fragrance through a friend.  I fell in love with it&#x27;s scent &amp; the richness of the cream &amp; decided to buy it even though it was more expensive than I had originally thought.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, the short-lasting lovely fragrance was faint, the consistancy was very thin &amp; it did not leave any moisture to the skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would NOT recommend this.</li>
