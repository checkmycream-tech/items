            <li> Have been using this product for a long time.  </li>
            <li> Whenever I applied it my skin was irritated and felt really strange.</li>
            <li> It works well for my dry skin</li>
            <li> I can still use it there, I just have to be careful.  </li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s getting harder and harder to find.</li>
            <li> Some other moisturizer I tried couldn&#x27;t even be used under the eye at all.  </li>
            <li> I returned this item before trying it because it was received a month before the expiration date - be careful!</li>
            <li> I have to be very careful when applying it in the eye area.  </li>
            <li> Only negative is the eye burn, so it didn&#x27;t get five stars for that reason only.&lt;br</li>

            <li> Unfortunately, it burns my eyes.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll use the Continuous Hydration for that - I&#x27;ve never had any ill effects using that on my eyes.  </li>
            <li> SPF 15 doesn&#x27;t give any bad</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> so rich and creamy and I have definitely noticed the improvement in my skin.</li>
            <li> I like this facial moisturizer.  The consistency is good and is easliy applied.  I like the SPF, which is mainly why I bought it.  It doesn&#x27;t leave my face looking too greasy, unlike many firming/wrinkle creams with SPF. Unfortunately, it burns my eyes.  I have to be very careful when applying it in the eye area.  I have to make sure I don&#x27;t apply it too close to the eye, otherwise my eyes will burn.  I can still use it there, I just have to be careful.  Some other moisturizer I tried couldn&#x27;t even be used under the eye at all.  I had to use a different one for that area.  I may purchase it again if I can&#x27;t find anything else I like.  As far as wrinkles and lines, it doesn&#x27;t really do anything, but I didn&#x27;t expect it to.  My skin looks a little better after I apply it, unlike some other brands.</li>
            <li> A nice thick cream that goes on nicely, disappears into the skin and is not heavy or greasy. It works well for my dry skin and I&#x27;m delighted that unlike many others I don&#x27;t get break outs from it. I can&#x27;t say that it&#x27;s firmed up anything - only been using it about 2 weeks but it does leave my skin smooth and moisturized. I&#x27;d continue using it.</li>
            <li> I love the Healthy Skin &amp; Ageless Essentials lines of Neutrogena products.  I&#x27;ve used the Healthy Skin Anti-Wrinkle Anti-Blemish Cleanser, and the Ageless Essentials Continuous Hydration - Night for years now, and just added this firming cream to see how it goes.  I do like it; it tightened up my face and got rid of numerous tiny blemishes after the first use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will advise not to use it on or close to your eyes - it burns if you accidentally get some IN your eyes.  I&#x27;ll use the Continuous Hydration for that - I&#x27;ve never had any ill effects using that on my eyes.  I&#x27;m happy to add this to my Neutrogena skin care regimen; it does do what it&#x27;s supposed to, and then some. Only negative is the eye burn, so it didn&#x27;t get five stars for that reason only.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The price is the best, here on Amazon, when you use &#x27;Subscribe &amp; Save&#x27;, which is ultra-convenient.  I do use &#x27;Subscribe and Save&#x27; for many, many products.  I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> Repeat purchase - best price for a good product.</li>
            <li> haven&#x27;t used long enough to evaluate the cream, but pump didn&#x27;t work from the 1st time I tried to use it...hoping it is worth the effort of not having a working pump...</li>
            <li> I use this every day.  I don&#x27;t know if it firms my skin, but I am 75 and I don&#x27;t notice my skin getting worse, so maybe I am holding my own by using this product.  It goes on smoothly, doesn&#x27;t cause any problem under liquid makeup and doesn&#x27;t look chalky with the SPF ingredient.  I love it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s always a welcomed surprise for a product to provide the results it claims. I noticed results within a day or two of my first application. I would recommend this product.</li>
            <li> My favorite and it has to have SPF15</li>
            <li> I have been using this cream for a few weeks now and haven&#x27;t noticed much difference regarding wrinkles, but it does keep my face hydrated and it smells great! I will order again for the value.</li>
            <li> Used this product for almost 20 years - it works!</li>
            <li> I love this product.  It is non-greasy and soaks into the skin nicely.  The SPF 15 helps on a daily basis&lt;br /&gt;against sun damage.  Very nice product!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t want to flaunt in here about my facial creams, but I have used Marcela Borghese, Estee Lauder, Lancome, etc.but no one can match this product. I hope Neutrogena doesn&#x27;t raise the price or take it from the market.</li>
            <li> I purchase this for my husband so I know he is getting some form of sunscreen on his face daily. He actually applies it regularly to his face so it&#x27;s a winner for me. The only negative I can state about this product is that it smells a little like beer. Strange, I know.</li>
            <li> I have not noticed any &amp;#34;firming,&amp;#34; but I&#x27;m hoping it is, at least, nourishing my skin. I probably would not buy it again.</li>
            <li> I Have applied this cream daily and I like the way my skin looks and feels.  I have notice a change on my skin, I have sensitive and kind of dried face skin, this product has made my skin look radiant and alive.</li>
            <li> I love the dispenser, texture of this cream. I would definitely buy it again. Best facial cream I have ever bought.</li>
            <li> Have been using this product for a long time.  It has the combined benefits of sun protection and a great moisturizer which is light and non-greasy.  My 66-year old face loves it.</li>
            <li> The skin on my face is really sensitive and I was looking for something for sensitive and dry skin. Whenever I applied it my skin was irritated and felt really strange. I would never buy it again.</li>
            <li> Using another item, so decided to use it instead.  Will be using instead in the future,  The item is good.</li>
            <li> I love this product I like the smell its nice and clean. Its not too greasy goes on smooth and absorbs quickly. Have only used less than a week so not sure how good it works.</li>
            <li> I returned this item before trying it because it was received a month before the expiration date - be careful!</li>
            <li> The cream stung severely when I applied it.</li>
            <li> I LIKED NEUTROGENA PRODUCT&#x27;S, ... ALWAYS USE IT</li>
            <li> Well this stuff works so good and it&#x27;s getting harder and harder to find. I hope they don&#x27;t stop making it!</li>
            <li> I am 50 and for my skin it is a very good cream.Finished 3 tubes . No irritations at all. Skin looks really fresh . There is no feeling that you have a cream on your face. SPF 15 doesn&#x27;t give any bad smell(i don&#x27;t know why people complaining about this) . Will order again.</li>
            <li> Love this and so hard to find in local stores!!!</li>
            <li> I am not sure about this product.  I have used this whole bottle, but no results yet. I guess I need to buy more and use a lot more to see results. I may buy another bottle.</li>
            <li> I love this product as it moisturizes without being oily, has firming effect and does not aggitate my sensitive skin. I use this during the day under makeup.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really just sunscreen. Doesn&#x27;t do anything else.</li>
            <li> Excellent product, goes on easily, does not feel heavy on the skin but, alas, the wrinkles have not gone away.  This is the second time I have bought this product and will continue to use it regularly.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been buying this cream for several years from a local store and the fragrance has always been pleasant. This time I bought online. The product I received smells kind of vinegary. The exp. date is 2014/11.&lt;br /&gt;??????</li>
            <li> not greasy light weight skin feels soft no dryness</li>
            <li> I like this because it feels light and thorough both. Works as a moisturizer &amp; under makeup. Also purse size.</li>
