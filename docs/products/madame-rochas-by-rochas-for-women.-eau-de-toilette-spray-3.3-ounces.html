            <li>I love it.  </li>
            <li>I love</li>
            <li>This product smells NOTHING like the well known, iconic fragrance of Madam Rochas.</li>
            <li>No doubt, Madame Rochas is a great fragrance in the classic style.</li>
            <li>I would not recommend it to anyone that had the original!</li>
            <li>it isn&#x27;t to strong adn</li>
            <li>Like the Fahrenheit from Dior, one of those, strong and unique.</li>
            <li>Even with a light spray and a mist walk-through, aldehydes are all I smelled for a couple hours.</li>
            <li>I enjoy it</li>
            <li>It reeks of cheap men&#x27;s cologne.</li>
            <li>This is a nice parfume for a older woman&lt;br /&gt;didnt</li>
            <li>This product has completely meet our expectations, we like it and we will remain loyal to it like good friends</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s a a sip from the original one.</li>
            <li>The perfumes from the past are still the best, and this is one of them.</li>

            <li>it was double the price that i had paid through Amazon.com, my wife loved it for it&#x27;s</li>
            <li>True to the scent of Madame Rochas.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very allergic, but this is one sense that does not render me &amp;#34;senseless&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;Still get compliments from friends and strangers on how lovely in smells on me,&lt;br</li>
            <li>This is a rare exception</li>
            <li>It mostly smells like rosewater and other florals combined into a sophisticated scent.  </li>
            <li>This Madame rochas is nothing like the one my husband got me when we were first married!</li>
            <li>Thanks Amazon for making Christmas shopping so much easier!</li>
            <li>When they are available you need to stock up because they may be retired the next time you want to buy one.&lt;br /&gt;In</li>
            <li>Recommended for evening wear and intimate encounters.  </li>
            <li>I usually shop at Amazon with full confidence knowing that I will be satisfied with the quality of the products I receive.</li>
            <li>Classic</li>
            <li>I have discovered that classic fragrances are released on a cycle.  </li>
            <li>Madame Rochas is a classic floral scent.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a classic one from Rochas.</li>
            <li>However, the aldehydes were far too much for me to handle.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve never smelt the original, and apparently the new formula is the victim of cost-cutting.</li>
            <li>mother used it when she was young till now.&lt;br /&gt;It is a steal , we recommend buy it.</li>
            <li>It is a classy, timeless fragrance.</li>
            <li>near what it used to be.</li>
            <li>His was my favorite in the late 70s!</li>
            <li>Soft, simple fragrance.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not the same as the old one perfume you remember from 80s.</li>
