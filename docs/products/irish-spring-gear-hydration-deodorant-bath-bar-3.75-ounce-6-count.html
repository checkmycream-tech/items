            <li>Good job Irish spring!</li>
            <li>/&gt;They are mild on my skin and has mild perfume.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will</li>
            <li>Unbelievable deodorizing soap so nice to use and leaves you smelling fresh and clean all day I have many women come up to me</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t have that strong Irish Spring smell you get from the original.  </li>
            <li>Great, long lasting scent with luxurious sudsing power.</li>
            <li>This soap smells really fresh, It does not hold up to water really well.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;ve never tried this and like fresh smells try this, I am normally a lemon/lime guy</li>
            <li>But if you keep it dry it will mostly be ok.</li>
            <li>Super fast shipping completely sarisfied, and will order again.</li>
            <li>(4-ages 7-24) in my house, This Irish spring sap smells fantastic in the bathroom as well as on the skin.  </li>
            <li>My husband who has exclusively used the original Irish spring loves the smell of this soap.</li>
            <li>The bar itself is a nice size for my hand, which are on the small side.&lt;br /&gt;Add</li>
            <li>The soap feels the same as the original on your skin it just has a new smell.</li>
            <li>I was quite surprised because he has to have his original Irish spring.</li>
            <li>My husband uses it and has not complained at all.</li>
            <li>When a tiny bubble squirted up into my eye, I spent the better part of an hour feeling like I had an ice pick in my eye.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t irritate their skin and so far,  no allergic reactions from anyone in my household.  </li>
            <li>I laugh and say its a soap called Irish spring gear but only can get it from the USA on Amazon web site.</li>
            <li>scent that does not smell too much.&lt;br /&gt;Wears down quick.</li>
            <li>I use the Old Spice Wolfthorn bar soap on a regular basis.</li>
            <li>It does not dry my skin out like some soaps.</li>
            <li>That could be good or bad depending on if you like Irish Spring to began with it.  </li>

            <li> Unbelievable deodorizing soap so nice to use and leaves you smelling fresh and clean all day I have many women come up to me asking want am I using as a deodorant or perfume. I laugh and say its a soap called Irish spring gear but only can get it from the USA on Amazon web site. They love it</li>
            <li> We love this soap! Great, clean scent.</li>
            <li> Smells and cleans great. Long lasting fragrance.</li>
            <li> I use the Old Spice Wolfthorn bar soap on a regular basis. I have a bar of this Irish Spring soap next to it when I want to feel &amp;#34;cleaner&amp;#34;. Smell is strong and works great!</li>
            <li> Excelent..! &#x3D;-D, Update: This soap smells great , I love its smell reminds me of a soap that sold while in Venezuela called &amp;#34;Banner&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> This product cleans well and smells good. Don&#x27;t get it in your eye though. When a tiny bubble squirted up into my eye, I spent the better part of an hour feeling like I had an ice pick in my eye. I thought I was going to have to go to the hospital. It hurt so bad I could hardly open my eye to flush it out.&lt;br /&gt;It smells good though! :)</li>
            <li> Super fast shipping completely sarisfied, and will order again.</li>
            <li> Smells good in the shower and definitely helps me feel fresh all day which is a good thing during the summer heat!</li>
            <li> Its just ok.  Compared to regular Irish Spring I am told by my husband that it is the same.</li>
            <li> finally a soap that smells good, for a man. not to strong but a good clean scent.</li>
            <li> I love this product - always have, always will. It is a good value for a great soap. I order this a couple of times a year.</li>
            <li> Seems like the size of the bars are going down while the price is staying the same. These soap bars are now 3.75oz and still cost 10 bucks for pack of 6&lt;br /&gt;They are mild on my skin and has mild perfume.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will purchase at a lower price but as of now will stick with the 16 count lever soap that you get for 14.99</li>
            <li> I purchase this for the boys (4-ages 7-24) in my house, This Irish spring sap smells fantastic in the bathroom as well as on the skin.  It doesn&#x27;t irritate their skin and so far,  no allergic reactions from anyone in my household.  This soap in my opinion is handy, smells great and good to keep in the house for teenagers/youngmen.</li>
            <li> Smells great and def more moisturizers than the original soap. My boyfriend is pro Dove soap, so we will see if he likes it.</li>
            <li> Smells like my grandpa! Sounds odd but we use it to rub the legs of our outdoor furniture to keep the dogs from chewing on them. Great cheap soap</li>
            <li> Leaves the skin hydrated and makes me feel energized.</li>
            <li> While not quite as good as Dove for Men this soap is better than traditional Dial, etc.</li>
            <li> Really refreshing! Live in Florida and these hot muggy months make it almost impossible to really feel clean. This new soap is the most delightful solution. Great, long lasting scent with luxurious sudsing power. The entire bathroom is scented all day long. The bar itself is a nice size for my hand, which are on the small side.&lt;br /&gt;Add to that, the price is great.</li>
            <li> Very nice smell and very hydrating.  Would purchase again</li>
            <li> Reminds me of the odor from working around diesel fuel and gear lube. No comparison to the icy blast type. I will never use this again.</li>
            <li> Ok soap.&lt;br /&gt;Some minimal foam.&lt;br /&gt;Nice scent that does not smell too much.&lt;br /&gt;Wears down quick.</li>
            <li> I still prefer bar soap. And for those that do as well, you should know that Irish Spring smells great, and leaves you with a good clean.</li>
            <li> My husband who has exclusively used the original Irish spring loves the smell of this soap. I was quite surprised because he has to have his original Irish spring. If we go out of town he must have his soap. I bought these and he said he really liked the smell. I smelled them and they do have like a cologne scent and it really smells nice. So it looks like he has made the switch from original to the gear. The soap feels the same as the original on your skin it just has a new smell. Good job Irish spring!</li>
            <li> Good value. Smell is OK.</li>
            <li> This soap is always mushy.  It doesn&#x27;t stay hard and therefore is wasteful as big clumps fall off when you use it in the shower.  I like the scent though.</li>
            <li> Stocking up has never been so easy!!  Suscribe and Save!!</li>
            <li> It was a good bargain.  My husband uses it and has not complained at all.</li>
            <li> Smells good and lasts through the day. It does not dry my skin out like some soaps.</li>
            <li> I buy this for all the boys in my home and use it for myself because I like the scent.</li>
            <li> This soap smells really fresh, It does not hold up to water really well. But if you keep it dry it will mostly be ok. If you&#x27;ve never tried this and like fresh smells try this, I am normally a lemon/lime guy but this is a welcome change.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If it goes on sale again I would buy it.</li>
            <li> This soap is ok.  I mean it&#x27;s soap.  Doesn&#x27;t have that strong Irish Spring smell you get from the original.  That could be good or bad depending on if you like Irish Spring to began with it.  No one has told me I stink, so it works.</li>
            <li> Hubby loves the clean scent as do I. Good soap!</li>
            <li> product as described--shipped in 2 days</li>
            <li> This smells the same as the bodywash. It really smells good.</li>
            <li> Got it on time.  The soap is just soap, nothing special</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s soap. Bought it because we are trying to get out of the antibacterial game.</li>
