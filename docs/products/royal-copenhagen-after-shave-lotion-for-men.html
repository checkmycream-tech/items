            <li> The aftershave - note, not the cologne - of RC is subtle enough not to be overpowering, yet does what I need it to do on the areas of my face that actually experience the assault of my safety razor.</li>
            <li> Hard to find in stores nowadays.</li>
            <li> It has a very subtle smell which the ladies like - not a strong, overpowering smell.  </li>

            <li> I have VERY discerning tastes regarding the scents I endure in my multiple environments. The aftershave - note, not the cologne - of RC is subtle enough not to be overpowering, yet does what I need it to do on the areas of my face that actually experience the assault of my safety razor.

            <li> I have used Royal Copenhagen After Shave since 1976. It works very well and I receive many compliments about its fragrance. It has been discontinued in all local stores so I must buy it on line. Amazon provides access to the product at the lowest cost.</li>

I been using royal copenhagen for years and will&lt;br /&gt;never purchase this product again. This is really disappointing it&#x27;s&lt;br /&gt;like a box of chocolates you don&#x27;t know what your going to get.&lt;br /&gt;not a happy guy! norman</li>
