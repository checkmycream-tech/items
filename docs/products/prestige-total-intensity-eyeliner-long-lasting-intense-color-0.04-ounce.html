            <li>B000V321BM CoverGirl Perfect Blend Pencil Mink(W) 115, 1 Count]].  </li>
            <li>This eyeliner is great.</li>
            <li>I read some reviews on MakeUpAlley that claimed this was great for lining the tightline because it stuck and did not budge.</li>
            <li>I am a big fan of the Stila eyeliners, but this is the best I&#x27;ve ever tried.</li>
            <li>Love this eyeliner.</li>
            <li>Love love love this eyeliner.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The brown is a perfect color for me, not too dark but not too light.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s just fine for an inexpensive eye liner.</li>
            <li>It glides on so smooth and lasts all day.</li>
            <li>Nice to get the pencils at a reasonable price.</li>
            <li>It will not be too light, so don&#x27;t worry about that.</li>
            <li>I was pleasantly surprised with how much I liked the color with this one.  </li>
            <li>The tip is a bit soft but a nice color.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to draw a very smooth line on the back of my hand (but that&#x27;s not where I use eyeliner).  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Whenever I see it available on Amazon, I will buy as many as possible.</li>
            <li>But really stayed on most of the day and didn&#x27;t have much racoon eye issues.  </li>
            <li>It is very soft and easy to apply.</li>
            <li>Perfect Blend eyeliner comes in a few different colors and is also inexpensive</li>
            <li>Good liner but does smear a little bit.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re large enough that when you blend the liner (which you have to do very quickly because once it dries, it stays), they get all over your skin in that</li>
            <li>and I find it much easier to work with.</li>
            <li>It is a darker brown which is why I like it so much.</li>
            <li>the problem is that its so soft, it has to be sharpened pretty much after every 2 uses.</li>
            <li>I was sort of hesitant to purchase this because I don&#x27;t like most brown eyeliner, I prefer black.  </li>
            <li>I own a variety of different eyeliners and this one is more difficult to apply.</li>
            <li>Goes on extra smooth--I thought for sure it would not last because of how soft it went on the lid.  </li>
            <li>Not soft enough to go on smoothly, Takes too  much work.</li>
            <li>It really sticks and doesn&#x27;t budge from regular skin (like the back of your hand or your eyelid), that much is true.</li>
            <li>I live in the tropics and this eyeliner stays put without making me look like I have panda</li>
            <li>but this eyeliner is better than urban decay and any other pencil that I have ever used.</li>
            <li>Long lasting and goes on smoothly.</li>
            <li>But when applying it to my eyes, it&#x27;s too soft and clumpy.</li>
            <li>I was told this would last all day on the waterline, it goes on really well</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s soft and I use it up in a hurry.  </li>
            <li>this doesn&#x27;t smudge as much as the average eyeliner and its very pigmented.</li>
            <li>However, it does smear easily and leave behind makeup even after washing it off, and I have sensitive eyes so after a while I realized that it caused my eyes to be irritated.</li>
            <li>I really like the color of this eyeliner, but unfortunately, if you need to use any sort of eye moisturizer, the color fades quickly.</li>

            <li> this doesn&#x27;t smudge as much as the average eyeliner and its very pigmented. the problem is that its so soft, it has to be sharpened pretty much after every 2 uses.</li>
            <li> Good liner but does smear a little bit.</li>
            <li> This eyeliner is great. It is very soft and easy to apply. It creates a thick line, which was just what I was looking for. The color is just as I expected. However, it does smear easily and leave behind makeup even after washing it off, and I have sensitive eyes so after a while I realized that it caused my eyes to be irritated. Therefore, I can no longer use this product especially on my waterline.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure why everyone else loves this eyeliner so much. I own a variety of different eyeliners and this one is more difficult to apply. It&#x27;s easy to draw a very smooth line on the back of my hand (but that&#x27;s not where I use eyeliner).  But when applying it to my eyes, it&#x27;s too soft and clumpy. I generally just apply liner to the base of my lashes on my upper lid, but this pencil will not work at all for that purpose.  Instead I would recommend [[ASIN:B000V321BM CoverGirl Perfect Blend Pencil Mink(W) 115, 1 Count]].  The Cover Girl Perfect Blend eyeliner comes in a few different colors and is also inexpensive and I find it much easier to work with.</li>
            <li> I was sort of hesitant to purchase this because I don&#x27;t like most brown eyeliner, I prefer black.  However, I got the black one and while I like it, it is definitely pretty dark for everyday use. I was pleasantly surprised with how much I liked the color with this one.  It is a darker brown which is why I like it so much. I will definitely be using this on a daily basis.</li>
            <li> I am a big fan of the Stila eyeliners, but this is the best I&#x27;ve ever tried. It glides on so smooth and lasts all day. The brown is a perfect color for me, not too dark but not too light. I will definitely be buying this again and again!</li>
            <li> Really disappointed. It smeared and got every where. I had to remove all of my eye makeup and start over.</li>
            <li> Love this eyeliner. Long lasting and goes on smoothly.</li>
            <li> Love love love this eyeliner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please don&#x27;t tell anyone but this eyeliner is better than urban decay and any other pencil that I have ever used. I live in the tropics and this eyeliner stays put without making me look like I have panda eyes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Whenever I see it available on Amazon, I will buy as many as possible.</li>
            <li> I was told this would last all day on the waterline, it goes on really well but by the end of the day it wears off.</li>
            <li> The dark brown is so intense that I would consider it black.</li>
            <li> I really like the color of this eyeliner, but unfortunately, if you need to use any sort of eye moisturizer, the color fades quickly.</li>
            <li> Not soft enough to go on smoothly, Takes too  much work. I would not recommend it nor will I buy it again.</li>
            <li> I like this color but it&#x27;s soft and I use it up in a hurry.  Nice to get the pencils at a reasonable price.</li>
            <li> The tip is a bit soft but a nice color. It&#x27;s just fine for an inexpensive eye liner. I guess I would recommend it.</li>
            <li> Goes on extra smooth--I thought for sure it would not last because of how soft it went on the lid.  But really stayed on most of the day and didn&#x27;t have much racoon eye issues.  I did set it using a brush and dark shadows.  4 instead of 5 stars as the color has a very slight pearlescence--did go away w/ using powder to set eyeliner.</li>
            <li> I read some reviews on MakeUpAlley that claimed this was great for lining the tightline because it stuck and did not budge. Lies! It smeared and bled off my waterline as soon as I put the stuff on. It really sticks and doesn&#x27;t budge from regular skin (like the back of your hand or your eyelid), that much is true. But it is NOT for tightlining purposes unless you have much less moisture there than me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Be ware, it has glitter particles in it, which I found very annoying because it is not obvious from the product picture. They&#x27;re large enough that when you blend the liner (which you have to do very quickly because once it dries, it stays), they get all over your skin in that area.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The color is a very dark brown but not black, for those that care. It will not be too light, so don&#x27;t worry about that.</li>
