            <li>Take it from me - at your own risk!</li>
            <li>Too scratchy and not in a good way.</li>
            <li>It feels so good on my back!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I have one at home, but sometimes when you&#x27;re or &amp; about, you need a good scratch</li>
            <li>good scratchier but</li>
            <li>Scratching on one&#x27;s skin feels good, but I wouldn&#x27;t back-scratch through my clothes.  </li>
            <li>good price.</li>
            <li>You guys (the creators) know good and well</li>
            <li>massage is good too.</li>
            <li>This is good when I&#x27;m stress or need some alone time.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s good quality for the price.</li>
            <li>Rollers give you a good massage.  </li>
            <li>Very satisfied.</li>
            <li>I was able to duct tape it to reinforce it and it works great, but they need to rethink their packaging of this product.</li>
            <li>Maybe better if used on a sun burn!</li>
            <li>I love this!</li>
            <li>The claw scratching is perfect  but the messaging rollers broke at first time use</li>
            <li>Amazing how one can develop procedures to address situations when one has to.</li>
            <li>It is lightweight, but effective.</li>
            <li>roller option is kind of a joke, but I didn&#x27;t get it for that anyway.</li>
            <li>It is sturdy and nice, and will do the job</li>
            <li>spend more to get good quality.</li>
            <li>and I hear she loved it. :)</li>
            <li>Nice and sturdy.</li>

            <li>I liked it.</li>
            <li>, the massage wheels are kind of a novelty.  </li>
            <li>For the price, great and free shipping, even greater.  </li>
            <li>It is a great value, ships quickly.</li>
            <li>Breaks easily, but otherwise good purchase.</li>
            <li>ThIs item worked great, was sturdy with no sharp edges and great price.</li>
            <li>The length makes it extremely easy to use!</li>
            <li>Overall a great product at a great price; but doesn&#x27;t exceed expectations.</li>
            <li>It needed sanding and a better lacquer finish.</li>
            <li>The wood seems &amp;#34;splintery&amp;#34; for lack of a better word.</li>
            <li>The strap could a better material.</li>
            <li>this thing is cheap!</li>
            <li>and we love them</li>
            <li>You will be glad you bought it.</li>

            <li>but does the job can not say much more</li>
            <li>:)</li>
            <li>:) :)</li>
            <li>/&gt;The build quality could have been a bit better as I had a piece of bamboo splintered off and sticking out on the side but for the price..</li>
            <li>The Bamboo Therapeutic Back Scratch-er is excellent.  </li>
            <li>Yes, I love this thing.</li>
            <li>Well worth your money!!</li>
            <li>It arrived fast and in good condition.</li>
            <li>It is nicely made and scratches all the right itches.</li>
            <li>Other than that great purchase!</li>
            <li>Strong and sturdy</li>
            <li>Made of strong wood you can use it as a weapon.</li>
            <li>just be aware it is kind of a do it yourself project.</li>
            <li>A 2x2 taped to the scratcher end works just fine though.    </li>
            <li>Looks and works fine.</li>
            <li>now it is fine.  </li>
            <li>The backscratcher works fine.  </li>
            <li>Very cheaply made, not even a good back scratcher.</li>
            <li>durable bamboo light weight</li>
            <li>cheap.  </li>
            <li>My husband had to go use his eclectic sander to make it smooth</li>
            <li>Great back scratcher!</li>
            <li>Cheaply made and unsanded wood</li>
            <li>This is not bamboo, it&#x27;s cheap wood.  </li>
            <li>Free shipping.</li>
            <li>Does not feel cheaply made.</li>
            <li>Arrived in a few days, as described, and works great!</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t happy that is was delivered a week later then promised</li>
            <li>Too cheap to return and exchange.  </li>
            <li>I will enjoy them for years to come.</li>
            <li>cheap, broke almost immediately</li>
            <li>Who doesn&#x27;t love a good back scratch?</li>
            <li>This is a very nice back bamboo scratcher, but I still don&#x27;t get what the 2 wheels are for ?</li>
            <li>purchased it for me, but my husband uses it more than I do and loves it just as much!</li>
            <li>We didn&#x27;t handle it roughly or anything, it just kind of broke on its own.</li>
            <li>These are a good back scratcher.  </li>
            <li>but I wasn&#x27;t concerned because he really just wanted it to be able to scratch his</li>
            <li>but they are still good for scratching the back!</li>
            <li>feels good on my back.</li>
            <li>in price and quality, but for the price not a bad deal.  </li>
            <li>The rest of it is made pretty strong.</li>
            <li>The massage wheels fell off quickly, but I didn&#x27;t buy it for that.</li>
            <li>This scratcher is cheaply made and it has a cheap price, so you really do get what you pay for.</li>
            <li>Strong material that makes scratching the back itch very easy.  </li>
            <li>pretty cheap material.</li>
            <li>Perfect for those hard to reach spots!</li>
            <li>It came pretty fast and I was pleased with that.</li>
            <li>The rollers are not put together very well, and fall apart easily.  </li>
            <li>It would of been a good product except it was so rough</li>
            <li>The rollers are nice, but not necessary.</li>
            <li>But as far as the massage rollers go, you might need to reinforce those sticks that are holding the rollers in place some more.</li>
            <li>it wasnt worth it</li>
            <li>The scratcher isn&#x27;t worth 25 cents.  </li>
            <li>Does the job and price was right.</li>
            <li>i like how it is just the right sharpness.</li>
            <li>Neither of which were Right.</li>
            <li>Works right through your shirt too though.</li>
            <li>My old one broke after 9 years when I ran over it with my wheel chair and this replacement is the perfect length to reach every where on my entire back!!!</li>
            <li>These are nice and long and sturdy.  </li>
            <li>Luckily, you won&#x27;t be paying too much.</li>
            <li>Product was shipped super fast too&#x27;.</li>
            <li>I seller was very kind to send me replacements but even the replacements are in different phases of completion...out of 4 total..</li>
            <li>Finally, a product that does not break easily, chip away quickly, or scrape my skin.</li>
            <li>Although, it looked a little cheaply made but honestly for the money I can&#x27;t really complain.</li>
            <li>I love this back scratcher.</li>
            <li>My boys bought this for their father as a Christmas gift as he will pick up anything (including scissors &amp; knives..:) to scratch his back.</li>
            <li>I got it within 2 days &amp; it looks exactly like the picture.</li>
            <li>In my first use, I got splinters in my skin and drew blood from my finger...</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s pretty durable.</li>
            <li>I would probably order a better class item next time.</li>
            <li>middleschool students make better back</li>
            <li>Overall, its okay.</li>
            <li>Exactly what I Needed.</li>
            <li>ok for a back scratcher.</li>
            <li>Wheels fell off first time I used it</li>
            <li>It is exactly what I was looking for</li>
            <li>This produce seems very durable!</li>
            <li>It does exactly what you need it to do.</li>
            <li>I would recommend this back scratcher to my friends but most of them have blocked me.  </li>
            <li>I will never buy another one without seeing it first.  </li>
            <li>If that&#x27;s something you need you are better off buying a separate massager along with this back</li>
            <li>Love it to scratch those almost unreachable areas on my back.  </li>
            <li>It has a nice wide scratch hand&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>but I only mostly use the scratcher.</li>
            <li>Love this back scratcher ...</li>
            <li>Not very expensive and gets the job done!</li>
            <li>This cookie cutter style back scratcher also lacks the scratchers to give a truly good back scratch.</li>
            <li>I currently use that open hole as a thumb hold while I&#x27;m using this scratcher, but it still isn&#x27;t as good as the retractable one I had that decided to retire after 9 years.</li>
            <li>I was very surprised with how quick the order got to me.  </li>
            <li>But it&#x27;s long and cute and does the trick.</li>
            <li>The rollers are too small to do any good.  </li>
            <li>It works fine as a back scratcher,  but on the first day we got it, the two rolling wheels just fell out of place.</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m not too happy with the fact that I have to sand this down to give it a proper finish.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I ordered a large quantity for Christmas.</li>
            <li>It arrived with a large crack in it.  </li>
            <li>The length  is good, the price is right, but it needs sanding - very rough handle and back of scratcher.  </li>
            <li>I just wanted a back scratcher, and it does just fine.</li>
            <li>thanks take it every where recommending to friends and family thanks again would buy again ty</li>
            <li>They don&#x27;t - minus 1 star. :-)</li>
            <li>The rollers aren&#x27;t really massaging anything</li>
            <li>It wasn&#x27;t even cut straight.</li>
            <li>Thank you so much.</li>
            <li>rollers on the handle dont really feel like anything.</li>
            <li>It really doesn&#x27;t even deserve one star.</li>
            <li>and you cant really feel them as well.</li>
            <li>I was not expecting much but one scratchers had the massage balls fall out as soon as I unwrapped them</li>
            <li>It is very sturdy and well constructed.</li>
            <li>I am just one that tends to look at the whole picture of what the proposed product, or creation for that matter, is described as.</li>
            <li>but I really can&#x27;t complain because of the price.</li>
            <li>Stratches very well.....</li>
            <li>She also said that it was very flimsy.  </li>
            <li>This one does the trick and it&#x27;s very sturdy.  </li>
            <li>Woks out very well</li>
            <li>I really like this product and would recommend it.</li>
            <li>This one is reasonably well made and finished, though the price has spiked over time.  </li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>The &amp;#34;teeth&amp;#34; on the one I received are quite aggressive and can really dig in.</li>
            <li>not good-too much varnish</li>
            <li>Nice heavy duty bamboo.  </li>
            <li>Wow!!!</li>
            <li>good scratching, the cord at the top is a little lame, it will break, but it is easy to replace</li>
            <li>This one does have two rollers for massaging at the other end and looks hand carved, although I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s not.</li>
            <li>He was excited to get his back scratcher.</li>
            <li>the others and the wood is very rough in many places.</li>
            <li>Very good for scratching the old back; however, I use them mostly for other reasons of late.</li>
            <li>Other than that unfulfilled promise, seriously, this thing is great!</li>
            <li>The varnish is blotchy and the wood is not completely covered in the smooth finish.</li>
            <li>The roller is good for tight shoulder muscles, especially along the spine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>This back scratcher is mediocre at its best!</li>
            <li>Bought three different kinds of back scratchers and this was my favorite.</li>
            <li>particularly like this one</li>
            <li>But I purchased it mainly for the scratcher anyway.  </li>
            <li>I was going to take it out to my shop and sand it down a little, but the more I used it the more</li>
            <li>Way too high a price for this article.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this for purchase</li>
            <li>Very strong and durable - not like some of the flimsy ones I have purchased in the past.  </li>
            <li>Claw is not very sharp which is a good thing, but sharp enough to get the itch.</li>
            <li>Most back scratchers are coated with varnish to make them hard and splinter free.  </li>
            <li>The massage wheels are too delicate to be effective.  </li>
            <li>I am going to buy a few more for spares.</li>
            <li>the rollers on the back fell right off</li>
            <li>Hard to find good ones in big box stores.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a back scratcher and it scratches :)  Not much else to say here.</li>
            <li>time, I will definitely purchase the one from the store for a similar price and a smooth finish.,</li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t imagine anyone buying it for the purpose of using it to massage a part of their body as any back scratcher you buy with that &amp;#34;feature&amp;#34; really doesn&#x27;t do much for you in that department.</li>
            <li>Wood should be a little thicker but other wise acceptable for the price.</li>
            <li>Exactly as advertised... one back scratcher.</li>
            <li>I purchased the identical product locally for me and it is much higher quality for $1.99.  </li>
            <li>the scratcher does its job, but if you want an above average one, I&#x27;d spend a couple more bucks on it.</li>
            <li>Pretty cool little back scratcher!</li>
            <li>Forget the plastic or brass do-dads, gimme a real bamboo back scratcher.</li>
            <li>I bought this to replace a scratcher  which had been stolen  from me, and it is nowhere near the quality.  </li>
            <li>thing I ever purchased by far</li>
            <li>Be gentle if you use it on your skin - or simply take some sand paper to it.</li>
            <li>It does the job, but you have to arch your back to really get an itch.</li>
            <li>So overall if it is cheap enough and you need a back scratcher go for it.</li>
            <li>It works, not very expensive, but gets the job done at a very low price.</li>
            <li>He takes it to work every day and has to be careful to keep up with it because other employees also love it.</li>
            <li>(I have another bamboo scratcher with a small square handle that flips easily, which is aggravating);</li>
            <li>The rollers weren&#x27;t the main selling point anyway, but still seems a little strange that they broke so easily.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Shipping was very fast and product does what we expected so</li>
            <li>I like this scratcher very much, but one needs to be careful using it.</li>
            <li>It was exactly what I expected.  </li>
            <li>I love this for the hard to reach places on my back.</li>
            <li>Cleans up quickly and if you follow the maintenance plan it will never give you trouble.  </li>
            <li>The back scratching part is okay, but the therapeutic part with the rollers actually is pretty lame.  </li>
            <li>The 18 inch length is just right, but the one and a half inch width leaves alot to be desired.</li>
            <li>It is more or less what I expected for the low price (you get what you pay for), but still a few extra minutes spent doing a proper finish would have been nice.</li>
            <li>found that the rollers could be useful and were, at times, but on the whole, they tend to get in the way when making the long reach down or up the back.  </li>
            <li>Bamboo is very sturdy and they should last a long time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Nearly all of them had big splinters on the sides or places where the bamboo had shredded.  </li>
            <li>This back scratcher is a marked improvement over the moldy stick with a rusty nail that I WAS using.  </li>
            <li>Also the little wooden &amp;#34;axles&amp;#34; for the rollers built into the handles were loose and could easily have fallen out at any time.  </li>
            <li>I keep an earlier &#x27;plain jane&#x27; back scratcher in my car to pull the mail out of my deep rural mailbox, as well as to resolve the occasional leg itch that you can&#x27;t get to while driving.  :)</li>
            <li>but they gum up and are hard to clean.  </li>
            <li>Apparently his back itches.  </li>
            <li>my son has a problem with dry skin &amp; can&#x27;t reach his back, he loves his new back scratcher.</li>

            <li> i got this for my husband and it works great.</li>
            <li> Take it from me - at your own risk!</li>
            <li> Too scratchy and not in a good way.</li>
            <li> It feels so good on my back!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I have one at home, but sometimes when you&#x27;re or &amp; about, you need a good scratch</li>
            <li> good scratchier but</li>
            <li> Scratching on one&#x27;s skin feels good, but I wouldn&#x27;t back-scratch through my clothes.  </li>
            <li> good price.</li>
            <li> You guys (the creators) know good and well</li>
            <li> massage is good too.</li>
            <li> This is good when I&#x27;m stress or need some alone time.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s good quality for the price.</li>
            <li> Rollers give you a good massage.  </li>
            <li> Very satisfied.</li>
            <li> I was able to duct tape it to reinforce it and it works great, but they need to rethink their packaging of this product.</li>
            <li> Maybe better if used on a sun burn!</li>
            <li> I love this!</li>
            <li> The claw scratching is perfect  but the messaging rollers broke at first time use</li>
            <li> Amazing how one can develop procedures to address situations when one has to.</li>
            <li> It is lightweight, but effective.</li>
            <li> roller option is kind of a joke, but I didn&#x27;t get it for that anyway.</li>
            <li> It is sturdy and nice, and will do the job</li>
            <li> spend more to get good quality.</li>
            <li> and I hear she loved it. :)</li>
            <li> Nice and sturdy.</li>
            <li> They made wonderful gifts for a couple of colleagues as well as being very sturdy.  </li>
            <li> I liked it.</li>
            <li> , the massage wheels are kind of a novelty.  </li>
            <li> For the price, great and free shipping, even greater.  </li>
            <li> It is a great value, ships quickly.</li>
            <li> Breaks easily, but otherwise good purchase.</li>
            <li> ThIs item worked great, was sturdy with no sharp edges and great price.</li>
            <li> The length makes it extremely easy to use!</li>
            <li> Overall a great product at a great price; but doesn&#x27;t exceed expectations.</li>
            <li> It needed sanding and a better lacquer finish.</li>
            <li> The wood seems &amp;#34;splintery&amp;#34; for lack of a better word.</li>
            <li> The strap could a better material.</li>
            <li> this thing is cheap!</li>
            <li> and we love them</li>
            <li> You will be glad you bought it.</li>
            <li> Fantastic!  </li>

            <li> I love love love this.</li>
            <li> I love mine and wouldn&#x27;t be without one.</li>
            <li> it works better than any others i have tried and the price was amazing!great shipping.</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> but does the job can not say much more</li>
            <li> :)</li>
            <li> :) :)</li>
            <li> /&gt;The build quality could have been a bit better as I had a piece of bamboo splintered off and sticking out on the side but for the price..</li>
            <li> The Bamboo Therapeutic Back Scratch-er is excellent.  </li>
            <li> Yes, I love this thing.</li>
            <li> Well worth your money!!</li>
            <li> It arrived fast and in good condition.</li>
            <li> It is nicely made and scratches all the right itches.</li>
            <li> Other than that great purchase!</li>
            <li> Strong and sturdy</li>
            <li> Made of strong wood you can use it as a weapon.</li>
            <li> just be aware it is kind of a do it yourself project.</li>
            <li> A 2x2 taped to the scratcher end works just fine though.    </li>
            <li> Looks and works fine.</li>
            <li> now it is fine.  </li>
            <li> The backscratcher works fine.  </li>
            <li> Very cheaply made, not even a good back scratcher.</li>
            <li> durable bamboo light weight</li>
            <li> cheap.  </li>
            <li> My husband had to go use his eclectic sander to make it smooth</li>
            <li> Great back scratcher!</li>
            <li> Cheaply made and unsanded wood</li>
            <li> This is not bamboo, it&#x27;s cheap wood.  </li>
            <li> Free shipping.</li>
            <li> Does not feel cheaply made.</li>
            <li> Arrived in a few days, as described, and works great!</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t happy that is was delivered a week later then promised</li>
            <li> Too cheap to return and exchange.  </li>
            <li> I will enjoy them for years to come.</li>
            <li> cheap, broke almost immediately</li>
            <li> Who doesn&#x27;t love a good back scratch?</li>
            <li> This is a very nice back bamboo scratcher, but I still don&#x27;t get what the 2 wheels are for ?</li>
            <li> purchased it for me, but my husband uses it more than I do and loves it just as much!</li>
            <li> We didn&#x27;t handle it roughly or anything, it just kind of broke on its own.</li>
            <li> These are a good back scratcher.  </li>
            <li> but I wasn&#x27;t concerned because he really just wanted it to be able to scratch his</li>
            <li> but they are still good for scratching the back!</li>
            <li> feels good on my back.</li>
            <li> in price and quality, but for the price not a bad deal.  </li>
            <li> The rest of it is made pretty strong.</li>
            <li> The massage wheels fell off quickly, but I didn&#x27;t buy it for that.</li>
            <li> This scratcher is cheaply made and it has a cheap price, so you really do get what you pay for.</li>
            <li> Strong material that makes scratching the back itch very easy.  </li>
            <li> pretty cheap material.</li>
            <li> Perfect for those hard to reach spots!</li>
            <li> It came pretty fast and I was pleased with that.</li>
            <li> The rollers are not put together very well, and fall apart easily.  </li>
            <li> It would of been a good product except it was so rough</li>
            <li> The rollers are nice, but not necessary.</li>
            <li> But as far as the massage rollers go, you might need to reinforce those sticks that are holding the rollers in place some more.</li>
            <li> it wasnt worth it</li>
            <li> The scratcher isn&#x27;t worth 25 cents.  </li>
            <li> Does the job and price was right.</li>
            <li> i like how it is just the right sharpness.</li>
            <li> Neither of which were Right.</li>
            <li> Works right through your shirt too though.</li>
            <li> My old one broke after 9 years when I ran over it with my wheel chair and this replacement is the perfect length to reach every where on my entire back!!!</li>
            <li> These are nice and long and sturdy.  </li>
            <li> Luckily, you won&#x27;t be paying too much.</li>
            <li> Product was shipped super fast too&#x27;.</li>
            <li> I seller was very kind to send me replacements but even the replacements are in different phases of completion...out of 4 total..</li>
            <li> Finally, a product that does not break easily, chip away quickly, or scrape my skin.</li>
            <li> Although, it looked a little cheaply made but honestly for the money I can&#x27;t really complain.</li>
            <li> I love this back scratcher.</li>
            <li> My boys bought this for their father as a Christmas gift as he will pick up anything (including scissors &amp; knives..:) to scratch his back.</li>
            <li> I got it within 2 days &amp; it looks exactly like the picture.</li>
            <li> In my first use, I got splinters in my skin and drew blood from my finger...</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s pretty durable.</li>
            <li> I would probably order a better class item next time.</li>
            <li> middleschool students make better back</li>
            <li> Overall, its okay.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I Needed.</li>
            <li> ok for a back scratcher.</li>
            <li> Wheels fell off first time I used it</li>
            <li> It is exactly what I was looking for</li>
            <li> This produce seems very durable!</li>
            <li> It does exactly what you need it to do.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this back scratcher to my friends but most of them have blocked me.  </li>
            <li> I will never buy another one without seeing it first.  </li>
            <li> If that&#x27;s something you need you are better off buying a separate massager along with this back</li>
            <li> Love it to scratch those almost unreachable areas on my back.  </li>
            <li> It has a nice wide scratch hand&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> but I only mostly use the scratcher.</li>
            <li> Love this back scratcher ...</li>
            <li> Not very expensive and gets the job done!</li>
            <li> This cookie cutter style back scratcher also lacks the scratchers to give a truly good back scratch.</li>
            <li> I currently use that open hole as a thumb hold while I&#x27;m using this scratcher, but it still isn&#x27;t as good as the retractable one I had that decided to retire after 9 years.</li>
            <li> I was very surprised with how quick the order got to me.  </li>
            <li> But it&#x27;s long and cute and does the trick.</li>
            <li> The rollers are too small to do any good.  </li>
            <li> It works fine as a back scratcher,  but on the first day we got it, the two rolling wheels just fell out of place.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m not too happy with the fact that I have to sand this down to give it a proper finish.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I ordered a large quantity for Christmas.</li>
            <li> It arrived with a large crack in it.  </li>
            <li> The length  is good, the price is right, but it needs sanding - very rough handle and back of scratcher.  </li>
            <li> I just wanted a back scratcher, and it does just fine.</li>
            <li> thanks take it every where recommending to friends and family thanks again would buy again ty</li>
            <li> They don&#x27;t - minus 1 star. :-)</li>
            <li> The rollers aren&#x27;t really massaging anything</li>
            <li> It wasn&#x27;t even cut straight.</li>
            <li> Thank you so much.</li>
            <li> rollers on the handle dont really feel like anything.</li>
            <li> It really doesn&#x27;t even deserve one star.</li>
            <li> and you cant really feel them as well.</li>
            <li> I was not expecting much but one scratchers had the massage balls fall out as soon as I unwrapped them</li>
            <li> It is very sturdy and well constructed.</li>
            <li> I am just one that tends to look at the whole picture of what the proposed product, or creation for that matter, is described as.</li>
            <li> but I really can&#x27;t complain because of the price.</li>
            <li> Stratches very well.....</li>
            <li> She also said that it was very flimsy.  </li>
            <li> This one does the trick and it&#x27;s very sturdy.  </li>
            <li> Woks out very well</li>
            <li> I really like this product and would recommend it.</li>
            <li> This one is reasonably well made and finished, though the price has spiked over time.  </li>
            <li> Thanks</li>
            <li> The &amp;#34;teeth&amp;#34; on the one I received are quite aggressive and can really dig in.</li>
            <li> not good-too much varnish</li>
            <li> Nice heavy duty bamboo.  </li>
            <li> Wow!!!</li>
            <li> good scratching, the cord at the top is a little lame, it will break, but it is easy to replace</li>
            <li> This one does have two rollers for massaging at the other end and looks hand carved, although I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s not.</li>
            <li> He was excited to get his back scratcher.</li>
            <li> the others and the wood is very rough in many places.</li>
            <li> Very good for scratching the old back; however, I use them mostly for other reasons of late.</li>
            <li> Other than that unfulfilled promise, seriously, this thing is great!</li>
            <li> The varnish is blotchy and the wood is not completely covered in the smooth finish.</li>
            <li> The roller is good for tight shoulder muscles, especially along the spine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> This back scratcher is mediocre at its best!</li>
            <li> Bought three different kinds of back scratchers and this was my favorite.</li>
            <li> particularly like this one</li>
            <li> But I purchased it mainly for the scratcher anyway.  </li>
            <li> I was going to take it out to my shop and sand it down a little, but the more I used it the more</li>
            <li> Way too high a price for this article.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this for purchase</li>
            <li> Very strong and durable - not like some of the flimsy ones I have purchased in the past.  </li>
            <li> Claw is not very sharp which is a good thing, but sharp enough to get the itch.</li>
            <li> Most back scratchers are coated with varnish to make them hard and splinter free.  </li>
            <li> The massage wheels are too delicate to be effective.  </li>
            <li> I am going to buy a few more for spares.</li>
            <li> the rollers on the back fell right off</li>
            <li> Hard to find good ones in big box stores.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a back scratcher and it scratches :)  Not much else to say here.</li>
            <li> time, I will definitely purchase the one from the store for a similar price and a smooth finish.,</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t imagine anyone buying it for the purpose of using it to massage a part of their body as any back scratcher you buy with that &amp;#34;feature&amp;#34; really doesn&#x27;t do much for you in that department.</li>
            <li> Wood should be a little thicker but other wise acceptable for the price.</li>
            <li> Exactly as advertised... one back scratcher.</li>
            <li> I purchased the identical product locally for me and it is much higher quality for $1.99.  </li>
            <li> the scratcher does its job, but if you want an above average one, I&#x27;d spend a couple more bucks on it.</li>
            <li> Pretty cool little back scratcher!</li>
            <li> Forget the plastic or brass do-dads, gimme a real bamboo back scratcher.</li>
            <li> I bought this to replace a scratcher  which had been stolen  from me, and it is nowhere near the quality.  </li>
            <li> thing I ever purchased by far</li>
            <li> Be gentle if you use it on your skin - or simply take some sand paper to it.</li>
            <li> It does the job, but you have to arch your back to really get an itch.</li>
            <li> So overall if it is cheap enough and you need a back scratcher go for it.</li>
            <li> It works, not very expensive, but gets the job done at a very low price.</li>
            <li> He takes it to work every day and has to be careful to keep up with it because other employees also love it.</li>
            <li> (I have another bamboo scratcher with a small square handle that flips easily, which is aggravating);</li>
            <li> The rollers weren&#x27;t the main selling point anyway, but still seems a little strange that they broke so easily.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Shipping was very fast and product does what we expected so</li>
            <li> I like this scratcher very much, but one needs to be careful using it.</li>
            <li> It was exactly what I expected.  </li>
            <li> I love this for the hard to reach places on my back.</li>
            <li> Cleans up quickly and if you follow the maintenance plan it will never give you trouble.  </li>
            <li> The back scratching part is okay, but the therapeutic part with the rollers actually is pretty lame.  </li>
            <li> The 18 inch length is just right, but the one and a half inch width leaves alot to be desired.</li>
            <li> It is more or less what I expected for the low price (you get what you pay for), but still a few extra minutes spent doing a proper finish would have been nice.</li>
            <li> found that the rollers could be useful and were, at times, but on the whole, they tend to get in the way when making the long reach down or up the back.  </li>
            <li> Bamboo is very sturdy and they should last a long time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Nearly all of them had big splinters on the sides or places where the bamboo had shredded.  </li>
            <li> This back scratcher is a marked improvement over the moldy stick with a rusty nail that I WAS using.  </li>
            <li> Also the little wooden &amp;#34;axles&amp;#34; for the rollers built into the handles were loose and could easily have fallen out at any time.  </li>
            <li> I keep an earlier &#x27;plain jane&#x27; back scratcher in my car to pull the mail out of my deep rural mailbox, as well as to resolve the occasional leg itch that you can&#x27;t get to while driving.  :)</li>
            <li> but they gum up and are hard to clean.  </li>
            <li> Apparently his back itches.  </li>
            <li> my son has a problem with dry skin &amp; can&#x27;t reach his back, he loves his new back scratcher.</li>
            <li> This product is just right for those hard to reach places on your back, i would definitely recommend it.</li>
            <li> Yes, it was cheap, but it is worth less than nothing because of the useless time spent on it.</li>
            <li> If you don&#x27;t have monkey arms, this is the ticket to reach those itchy spots in the middle of your back.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also long enough to get to the area of your back that you need</li>
            <li> Not sure the roller have any real uses</li>
            <li> The wood isn&#x27;t sanded and when I opened it I pricked my finger on a long splinter - no, not splinter, a split of wood, let&#x27;s say, because it is much bigger than a splinter.  </li>
            <li> There were other, more expensive back scratchers, but bamboo is durable and I can have a back scratcher in every room now!</li>
            <li> the handle is flat</li>
            <li> It feels like the whole thing will snap if you press hard enough to feel the effects of the rollers.</li>
            <li> It is poorly made and I had to use super glue as it was cracked in two places,</li>
            <li> As a back scratcher, it works as well as any other bamboo back scratcher.</li>
            <li> I personally prefer the retractable back scratchers, but I decided to try this one due to the price.  </li>
            <li> The overall finish was on the rough side-</li>
            <li> Should have expected that from the low price.</li>
            <li> Not as pictured, 18 inches long.  </li>
            <li> All of the edges on the back scratcher are rough.  </li>
            <li> The long handle;</li>
            <li> I like that it has a scratcher on one side and the wheels on the other to roll over your back.</li>
            <li> it only had a finish on one side, so the other side was splintering since it was unfinished wood.</li>
            <li> And a bonus feature is that you can use it for scratching other things besides you back.  </li>
            <li> Very long</li>
            <li> I expected a finish that was smoother and not so rough - Lacked the proper finishing.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s a thick clear coating all over it and the bamboo is just low quality.</li>
            <li> how come I never live by that rule?  </li>
            <li> The back scratcher was not filed down enough so the teeth were very rough and cut into my skin.</li>
            <li> arrived cracked, not worth the cost to ship back for refund</li>
            <li> But the price &amp; speed of delivery,, Not worth persuing further...</li>
            <li> This product was received and was not very much like the picture.</li>
            <li> not high quality or finished.  </li>
            <li> That would be the end of the story if they didn&#x27;t have the little wheels on the opposite end that are supposed to give you a massage.  </li>
            <li> Received back scratcher with a split in the handle and one of two massage rollers missing.</li>
            <li> Material is rough and bristle, but it gets the job done.</li>
            <li> You know, there&#x27;s not much to a backscratcher.  </li>
            <li> There was a few issues of splinters, especially when using the massage rollers.</li>
            <li> Rough, needed to be sanded and refinished before using.  </li>
            <li> It was only a few bucks</li>
            <li> The &amp;#34;hand&amp;#34; end is rough and unfinished as well.</li>
            <li> Rough finish.</li>
            <li> Not what I expected and</li>
            <li> Also the finish was rough and the wood on one was peeling a bit on the side.</li>
            <li> what was expected..  </li>
            <li> con: the rollers seem like they could break with moderate to heavy use</li>
            <li> The item came faster than expected as well.</li>
            <li> The little wooden dowels that hold the wheels in are small and fragile.  </li>
            <li> Since this is hard to find I finally got what i needed for a very long time.</li>
            <li> I read other post about the massage rollers not working well</li>
            <li> Other then that it does the job.</li>
            <li> Just describe them as something to do other than twiddle your thumbs or something, not as a massage tool.</li>
            <li> It is functional and can be used in a number of ways due to its rollers, length, and scratcher design.</li>
            <li> I may try again some other time.</li>
            <li> Bought other</li>
            <li> Every time I use the scratcher, I have to be very careful not to get splinters.</li>
            <li> Nice back scratcher, but the packaging was terrible.  </li>
            <li> The massage balls are not particularly useful.  </li>
            <li> I felt it was not worth my time to</li>
            <li> I believe that there is a lacquer coating on the instrument that may have dried with rough edges.</li>
            <li> and he uses 1 for himself and the other for our 130lb Teddy Bear (Rottweiler)!</li>
            <li> All they did was cut four slices into the end of the wood so that it is slightly seperated for a \\&quot;scratching surface\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> I wish it was slightly longer though</li>
            <li> handle has a slight curve to it;</li>
            <li> May need to sand it down some, and/or get rid of loose slivers, but that&#x27;s common.  </li>
            <li> This is a dollar store unit...lacks a little varnish compared to one&#x27;s I&#x27;ve seen.</li>
            <li> So i did a little sanding, and added a drop of wood glue to hold the little axles in place.  </li>
            <li> Wouldn&#x27;t be without these little jewels anymore.</li>
            <li> the little rollers don&#x27;t do anything.</li>
            <li> They are a bit narrow but work well.  </li>
            <li> Picked off a few splinters.  </li>
            <li> The one I got looked like the varnish had not even dried when they shipped it.  </li>
            <li> The quality is poor, The finish is third rate, The finger end is not uniform &amp;</li>
            <li> My secret pal at work requested a back scratcher</li>
            <li> It showed up broken, I sent it back.</li>
            <li> and it was also black then cracked in a week!</li>
            <li> This one is almost plain wood.  </li>
            <li> Mangled, blackish,dirty-looking, multi colored of mishaped mess!</li>
            <li> Wood is raw and has splinters.  </li>
            <li> no more scissors...</li>
            <li> Mediocre to low quality.</li>
            <li> Roller thing seems pointless</li>
            <li> The massage rollers are pointless.  </li>
            <li> This is definitely a commodity within my treasury dept; so don&#x27;t get the 4 star rating twisted (I will explain).</li>
            <li> I sent this to my sister and she said there was no real protective wrapping for this, just a thin plastic covering.  </li>
            <li> The back massager end can be done away with because it is completely useless, but I didnt buy it for that end.</li>
            <li> I could actually picture some poor little children making this product in a dingy factory being paid a quarter a day!!!</li>
            <li> One was broken upon shipment, due to hole being non-aligned.  </li>
            <li> Poorly made - not worth any price.  </li>
            <li> Everyone needs one of these for the hard to reach place.  </li>
            <li> Instead, 6 weeks late, he got a fart noise machine.</li>
            <li> Intended to return them but procrastinated until it was too late.</li>
            <li> shipping was slow.</li>
            <li> The only bad thing is that I can&#x27;t carry this with me all the time.</li>
            <li> The quality is not good.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re long enough and everything, but the quality is HORRIBLE!</li>
            <li> It comes with two massage wheels that are on small axels that render them useless.</li>
            <li> Just weak string.</li>
            <li> Purely made, unsanded parts of the wood &amp; VERY uncomfortable to use!!</li>
            <li> One came broken and both the rollers keep falling out</li>
            <li> someone who makes things by hand and sells them, I would be ashamed to let anything with this poor of a finish go out the door to one of my customers.</li>
            <li> Poor quality Bamboo..  </li>
            <li> I would have rejected this unit on poor workmanship before shipment...  </li>
            <li> Works, but they are thin.</li>
            <li> came off and it was chipping and just poorly made</li>
            <li> Poorly made wood that was sharred in spots .eorst</li>
            <li> And the massage beads were chipped and broken all over.</li>
            <li> Poorly made.  </li>
            <li> Extremely poor quality, splinters,large crack in the handle.</li>
            <li> Horrible condition and very splintered like it was used</li>
            <li> When I opened it, the rollers were already broken.</li>
            <li> /&gt;( order four, two came broken )</li>
            <li> but they were thin and not sturdy.</li>
            <li> This one is poorly built and is loaded with splinters.  </li>
            <li> Jagged and uneven teeth and extremely painful to use.  </li>
            <li> The little wheels on the handle are stupid.</li>
            <li> Rollers were useless and one feel off.</li>
            <li> Not impressed.</li>
            <li> I gave one to my daughter and kept 2 for myself(I&#x27;m selfish like that),</li>
            <li> Also the massage rollers are useless.</li>
            <li> the rolling part is useless but he doesn&#x27;t care for it</li>
            <li> Very poor.  </li>
            <li> This item is very poorly made.</li>
            <li> Very poorly made.</li>
            <li> Very poor quality.</li>
            <li> Got splinters in my fingers before even getting the awkwardly wrapped package opened.  </li>
            <li> The scratcher itself works, but all the splintering was disappointing.</li>
            <li> I am afraid that my husband would get splinters if he uses this.</li>
            <li> in the manner I did, an impossible task.</li>
            <li> what manufacturer makes a bad product is this?  </li>
            <li> Bad quality, workmanship, and design.</li>
            <li> I was really disappointed in this purchase.</li>
            <li> This is crap.  </li>
            <li> I was very disappointed with this crudely made, unfinished item.  </li>
            <li> EXTREMELY DISAPPOINTING!!</li>
            <li> /&gt;the wood is horribly splintered</li>
            <li> Terrible cracking wood.</li>
            <li> Terrible, terrible product.  </li>

    <ol>
            <li> Perfect!  I bought one for work, one for home, and a couple for a friend.</li>
            <li> The massage wheels fell off quickly, but I didn&#x27;t buy it for that. I just wanted a back scratcher, and it does just fine.</li>
            <li> Always wanted one of these and now I wish I had gotten it sooner</li>
            <li> Received back scratcher with a split in the handle and one of two massage rollers missing.</li>
            <li> Ever have that itch you can&#x27;t quite reach?  Then this is the device to get.  The only bad thing is that I can&#x27;t carry this with me all the time.</li>
            <li> durable bamboo light weight thanks take it every where recommending to friends and family thanks again would buy again ty</li>
            <li> The overall finish was on the rough side- I expected a finish that was smoother and not so rough - Lacked the proper finishing. It needed sanding and a better lacquer finish. I found one that had the proper finish at walmart.</li>
            <li> These are a good back scratcher.  They are a bit narrow but work well.  The massage balls are not particularly useful.  I was hoping that they could be used to apply lotion but they gum up and are hard to clean.  A 2x2 taped to the scratcher end works just fine though.    Overall a great product at a great price; but doesn&#x27;t exceed expectations.</li>
            <li> I bought this scratcher because my husband would make me scratch his back every night! Now he scratches it on his on and he is as happy as a lark!</li>
            <li> I bought this for my husband and it works great for a backscratcher. I read other post about the massage rollers not working well but I wasn&#x27;t concerned because he really just wanted it to be able to scratch his back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shipping was very fast and product does what we expected so this was a 5 star buy for me.</li>
            <li> One came broken and both the rollers keep falling out</li>
            <li> A backscratcher is a backscratcher. These are nice and long and sturdy.  That would be the end of the story if they didn&#x27;t have the little wheels on the opposite end that are supposed to give you a massage.  They don&#x27;t - minus 1 star. :-)</li>
            <li> Too scratchy and not in a good way. The wood seems &amp;#34;splintery&amp;#34; for lack of a better word.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a back scratcher and it scratches :)  Not much else to say here.</li>
            <li> Picked off a few splinters.  Otherwise all is well.  Save the big padded  envelope; they cost a buck or two at the post office.</li>
            <li> I am happy with this! It feels so good on my back!&lt;br /&gt;I purchased it for me, but my husband uses it more than I do and loves it just as much!</li>
            <li> I love this back scratcher. I have one at home, but sometimes when you&#x27;re or &amp; about, you need a good scratch so I purchased this one for travel and it is GREAT!!!</li>
            <li> It does it&#x27;s job! The rollers aren&#x27;t really massaging anything but my husband loves those too! My boys bought this for their father as a Christmas gift as he will pick up anything (including scissors &amp; knives..:) to scratch his back. It&#x27;s a 2pack and he uses 1 for himself and the other for our 130lb Teddy Bear (Rottweiler)! He loves them and again...they do the job...no more scissors...and for THAT they get 5 stars!!!&#x27;</li>
            <li> cheap.  not high quality or finished.  i was splintered removing the product from the pkg.  wouldn&#x27;t recommend.</li>
            <li> For the price, great and free shipping, even greater.  Looks and works fine.</li>
            <li> When product arrived it was of the lowest quality. It wasn&#x27;t even cut straight. I don&#x27;t even think it was finished. I will never buy from them again.</li>
            <li> my son has a problem with dry skin &amp; can&#x27;t reach his back, he loves his new back scratcher. I got it within 2 days &amp; it looks exactly like the picture. So there were no surprises.</li>
            <li> The back scratching part is okay, but the therapeutic part with the rollers actually is pretty lame.  Way too high a price for this article.</li>
            <li> I gave it to my fianc&amp;eacute; as a gag gift, but he loves it and actually uses it all the time! It is lightweight, but effective.</li>
            <li> Delivered as advertised. It works, not very expensive, but gets the job done at a very low price. Very satisfied. Kent O.</li>
            <li> The massage wheels are too delicate to be effective.  As a back scratcher, it works as well as any other bamboo back scratcher.</li>
            <li> It would of been a good product except it was so rough I was getting slivers in my hands just trying to hold it. My husband had to go use his eclectic sander to make it smooth so I can use it.</li>
            <li> Arrived as promised.  And works perfectly. Thank you so much.</li>
            <li> pretty cheap material. Should have expected that from the low price. rollers on the handle dont really feel like anything. the scratcher does its job, but if you want an above average one, I&#x27;d spend a couple more bucks on it.</li>
            <li> Very poor.  End was burnt in manufacture.  Rollers were useless and one feel off.</li>
            <li> When my back itches, nothing scratches like bamboo fingers! Forget the plastic or brass do-dads, gimme a real bamboo back scratcher.</li>
            <li> Wood is raw and has splinters.  I sanded the scratcher and added a coat of shellac.  It was cheaper than sending it back.</li>
            <li> Great product for the price.</li>
            <li> It is poorly made and I had to use super glue as it was cracked in two places,</li>
            <li> This back scratcher is mediocre at its best! It comes with two massage wheels that are on small axels that render them useless. You can&#x27;t even apply pressure without them buckling or cracking. The 18 inch length is just right, but the one and a half inch width leaves alot to be desired. This cookie cutter style back scratcher also lacks the scratchers to give a truly good back scratch. All they did was cut four slices into the end of the wood so that it is slightly seperated for a \\&quot;scratching surface\\&quot;. This scratcher is cheaply made and it has a cheap price, so you really do get what you pay for. Luckily, you won&#x27;t be paying too much.</li>
            <li> Great back scratcher! However, the roller part can give you splinters. Other than that great purchase!</li>
            <li> Nice heavy duty bamboo.  roller option is kind of a joke, but I didn&#x27;t get it for that anyway. word</li>
            <li> Does the job and price was right.</li>
            <li> This item is very poorly made. It splinters, it has a short handle, and the rollers don&#x27;t roll. I threw it away. It really doesn&#x27;t even deserve one star. I would not recommend this product.</li>
            <li> good scratchier but the rollers on the back fell right off and you cant really feel them as well.</li>
            <li> Cheaply made and unsanded wood-you can get splinters using it. Wouldn&#x27;t recommend.</li>
            <li> Wow!!! Oohh la la...does it great job.</li>
            <li> To die for.  My old one broke after 9 years when I ran over it with my wheel chair and this replacement is the perfect length to reach every where on my entire back!!!</li>
            <li> Mediocre to low quality. Material is rough and bristle, but it gets the job done.</li>
            <li> The quality is not good. Every time I use the scratcher, I have to be very careful not to get splinters.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just super-duper!</li>
            <li> You know, there&#x27;s not much to a backscratcher.  If it has a fork on one end, it&#x27;s going to scratch your back!  This one does have two rollers for massaging at the other end and looks hand carved, although I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s not. But it&#x27;s long and cute and does the trick.</li>
            <li> In my first use, I got splinters in my skin and drew blood from my finger... what manufacturer makes a bad product is this?  Bad quality, workmanship, and design.</li>
            <li> The strap could a better material. Just weak string. Wood should be a little thicker but other wise acceptable for the price.</li>
            <li> This is a dollar store unit...lacks a little varnish compared to one&#x27;s I&#x27;ve seen. Does the job. Seek a Dollar tree and pay $1</li>
            <li> This is a very nice back bamboo scratcher, but I still don&#x27;t get what the 2 wheels are for ?</li>
            <li> this thing is cheap! in price and quality, but for the price not a bad deal.  The one I got looked like the varnish had not even dried when they shipped it.  Also the little wooden &amp;#34;axles&amp;#34; for the rollers built into the handles were loose and could easily have fallen out at any time.  So i did a little sanding, and added a drop of wood glue to hold the little axles in place.  now it is fine.  just be aware it is kind of a do it yourself project.</li>
            <li> Roller thing seems pointless but that&#x27;s not why you&#x27;re buying this</li>
            <li> It is more or less what I expected for the low price (you get what you pay for), but still a few extra minutes spent doing a proper finish would have been nice. It is sturdy and nice, and will do the job but I&#x27;m not too happy with the fact that I have to sand this down to give it a proper finish.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As someone who makes things by hand and sells them, I would be ashamed to let anything with this poor of a finish go out the door to one of my customers. But not everyone is about quality, sometimes it&#x27;s just about quantity.</li>
            <li> You get what you pay for. Junk! I asked for and received a refund, they didn&#x27;t even want it back.</li>
            <li> I was not expecting much but one scratchers had the massage balls fall out as soon as I unwrapped them but they are still good for scratching the back!</li>
            <li> I got 3 slivers just taking these out of the package. They&#x27;re not sanded properly at all. The varnish is blotchy and the wood is not completely covered in the smooth finish. They&#x27;re long enough and everything, but the quality is HORRIBLE! you get what you pay for. This is not bamboo, it&#x27;s cheap wood.  I should&#x27;ve went with the $18 dollar one.</li>
            <li> This back scratcher is a life saver. It is nicely made and scratches all the right itches. It is very sturdy and well constructed.</li>
            <li> arrived cracked, not worth the cost to ship back for refund</li>
            <li> The length  is good, the price is right, but it needs sanding - very rough handle and back of scratcher.  Scratching on one&#x27;s skin feels good, but I wouldn&#x27;t back-scratch through my clothes.  The wood would catch on the fabric and snag it..</li>
            <li> this was as advertised and sturdy.  I wish it was slightly longer though, I am a big guy.&lt;br /&gt;thank you</li>
            <li> I was very disappointed with this crudely made, unfinished item.  I bought this to replace a scratcher  which had been stolen  from me, and it is nowhere near the quality.  I will have to sand and finish the item, myself.</li>
            <li> You get what you pay for...how come I never live by that rule?  This is crap.  The wood isn&#x27;t sanded and when I opened it I pricked my finger on a long splinter - no, not splinter, a split of wood, let&#x27;s say, because it is much bigger than a splinter.  I am going to do what I should have done from the beginning - spend more to get good quality.</li>
            <li> It came in with splinters coming out so but I guess that&#x27;s what you paid for</li>
            <li> It arrived fast and in good condition. There was a few issues of splinters, especially when using the massage rollers. It&#x27;s pretty durable. But check the area around the rollers before using them or griping them. Other then that it does the job.</li>
            <li> I got one for me and one for my mom and we love them</li>
            <li> The backscratcher works fine.  May need to sand it down some, and/or get rid of loose slivers, but that&#x27;s common.  The massage rollers are pointless.  The little wooden dowels that hold the wheels in are small and fragile.  One was broken upon shipment, due to hole being non-aligned.  My advice is to skip the rollers, and get a simpler one without them.</li>
            <li> I received the backscratcher cracked! I felt it was not worth my time to return.&lt;br /&gt;I taped it as a temporary fix.</li>
            <li> Bought it for my dog, Max, and he loves it.  I use the massage rollers on his upper back, and the scratcher on the lower back, by his tail.</li>
            <li> It works perfectly! Well worth your money!! I highly recommend it. It is a great value, ships quickly. You will be glad you bought it.</li>
            <li> The rollers are nice, but not necessary. Maybe better if used on a sun burn!</li>
            <li> Very good for scratching the old back; however, I use them mostly for other reasons of late. Recent back surgery has made putting on socks, under ware, etc. in the manner I did, an impossible task. I use the back scratchers to pull my under ware up to a point where I can reach them. Amazing how one can develop procedures to address situations when one has to. Wouldn&#x27;t be without these little jewels anymore.</li>
            <li> The quality is poor, The finish is third rate, The finger end is not uniform &amp; the fingers are of various thicknesses &amp; crooked... Poor quality Bamboo..  I would have rejected this unit on poor workmanship before shipment...  But the price &amp; speed of delivery,, Not worth persuing further...</li>
            <li> It works ,could be wider scratching area.</li>
            <li> The scratchers was shipped and deliver on time and i very happy with the product.&lt;br /&gt;i have no problem telling family and friends about this product.</li>
            <li> Exactly as advertised... one back scratcher. Free shipping. good price. Not sure the roller have any real uses but they don&#x27;t hurt anything.</li>
            <li> Works great. Does not feel cheaply made. I have no complaints.</li>
            <li> Works, but they are thin. I have never figured out what the rollers are for. I would probably order a better class item next time.</li>
            <li> Fantastic!  Great scratcher!</li>
            <li> Awesome backscratcher! Hard to find good ones in big box stores.I am going to buy a few more for spares.</li>
            <li> this was garbage. middleschool students make better back scratchers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;the fork teeth are cut cockeyed and unevenly&lt;br /&gt;the rollers are misaligned in their sockets so they do not spin&lt;br /&gt;the wood is horribly splintered</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t even have it 24hrs and it broke one of the rollers came off and it was chipping and just poorly made</li>
            <li> Very strong and durable - not like some of the flimsy ones I have purchased in the past.  Very long</li>
            <li> I ordered a back scratcher for my husband who is stationed in Afghanistan. He was excited to get his back scratcher. Instead, 6 weeks late, he got a fart noise machine.</li>
            <li> Sturdy and perfect length. Very happy with product. Would not hesitate to recommend. I do not use the massage roller. It&#x27;s a back scratcher.</li>
            <li> I love this for the hard to reach places on my back. Boyfriend loves this as well. I highly recommend this for purchase</li>
            <li> works great, very sturdy</li>
            <li> I am very happy with my product.  It was exactly what I expected.  I was very surprised with how quick the order got to me.  Excellent transaction.&lt;br /&gt;Sincerely, Joe Gomez</li>
            <li> It is ok it does it&#x27;s job besides the mold on it and one of the scratchers are split. But I can&#x27;t complain for the price.</li>
            <li> I threw away this product! Poorly made wood that was sharred in spots .eorst thing I ever purchased by far</li>
            <li> Breaks easily, but otherwise good purchase. I like that it has a scratcher on one side and the wheels on the other to roll over your back. My secret pal at work requested a back scratcher and I hear she loved it. :)</li>
            <li> Not as pictured, 18 inches long.  Rough, needed to be sanded and refinished before using.  Got splinters in my fingers before even getting the awkwardly wrapped package opened.  The THREE wheels are nice but snagged my clothes and it is awkward to hold.</li>
            <li> This is definitely a commodity within my treasury dept; so don&#x27;t get the 4 star rating twisted (I will explain). I do use and love this thing. The reach is great, and the sharpness is perfect. I am just one that tends to look at the whole picture of what the proposed product, or creation for that matter, is described as. Massage wheels? Come on now. You guys (the creators) know good and well that those things will probably make you itch again if anything. Just describe them as something to do other than twiddle your thumbs or something, not as a massage tool. Other than that unfulfilled promise, seriously, this thing is great!</li>
            <li> Not impressed. Showed up without a stain or top coat of any sort just carved wood. And the massage beads were chipped and broken all over.</li>
            <li> There were other, more expensive back scratchers, but bamboo is durable and I can have a back scratcher in every room now!</li>
            <li> It arrived today, cracked but I really can&#x27;t complain because of the price. I might order another one. Overall, its okay.</li>
            <li> Finally, a product that does not break easily, chip away quickly, or scrape my skin. This product is just right for those hard to reach places on your back, i would definitely recommend it. But as far as the massage rollers go, you might need to reinforce those sticks that are holding the rollers in place some more.</li>
            <li> ThIs item worked great, was sturdy with no sharp edges and great price. Product was shipped super fast too&#x27;. I definitely recommend.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve purchased and used several back scratchers,  but this one is definitely the poorest quality.&lt;br /&gt;Finish feels unfinished and put together poorly.&lt;br /&gt;Prone to splinters if not careful.&lt;br /&gt;I purchased this item out of convenience not having to go to the store, but that was a mistake.&lt;br /&gt;Next time, I will definitely purchase the one from the store for a similar price and a smooth finish.,</li>
            <li> Very poorly made. it only had a finish on one side, so the other side was splintering since it was unfinished wood. Also, the cutout for one of the rollers was not all the way through so it did not spin. It was only a few bucks so I just tossed it.</li>
            <li> Very cheaply made, not even a good back scratcher. There&#x27;s a thick clear coating all over it and the bamboo is just low quality. the little rollers don&#x27;t do anything. the only thing I use this thing for now is to get balls out from under the couch for our dog.</li>
            <li> Arrived in a few days, as described, and works great! Who doesn&#x27;t love a good back scratch?</li>
            <li> I love love love this. Reaches where it needs to. Strong and sturdy</li>
            <li> If you don&#x27;t have monkey arms, this is the ticket to reach those itchy spots in the middle of your back.  I love mine and wouldn&#x27;t be without one.</li>
            <li> perfect. no one should be without one.</li>
            <li> I love this! So very nice! Stratches very well.....massage is good too. This is good when I&#x27;m stress or need some alone time. Great buy!</li>
            <li> Exactly what I Needed. Gets the job done.</li>
            <li> ok for a back scratcher. Everyone needs one of these for the hard to reach place.  Your back itches and never anyone around to scratch it.</li>
            <li> I sent this to my sister and she said there was no real protective wrapping for this, just a thin plastic covering.  She also said that it was very flimsy.  Yes, it was cheap, but it is worth less than nothing because of the useless time spent on it.</li>
            <li> Poorly made - not worth any price.  All of the edges on the back scratcher are rough.  I got a splinter just taking the item from the shipping bag in which it was mailed.  The &amp;#34;hand&amp;#34; end is rough and unfinished as well.The rollers are too small to do any good.  I was really disappointed in this purchase.</li>
            <li> Too short, needs to be about 2 - 3 inches longer.</li>
            <li> please use the review for the 17.5&amp;#34; ThinkBamboo Bamboo Scratcher Backscratcher that I submitted a couple of minutes ago and apply it to this review please.  I made a mistake.</li>
            <li> I ordered a large quantity for Christmas. Nearly all of them had big splinters on the sides or places where the bamboo had shredded.  The scratcher itself works, but all the splintering was disappointing.</li>
            <li> it works better than any others i have tried and the price was amazing!great shipping. i may get another one. i like how it is just the right sharpness.</li>
            <li> I just recieved this, and the rings/balls fell off that are on the end.  The entire scratcher has splintered wood, it is not refinish or anything.  Save your money.</li>
            <li> It was a gift and the recipient uses it daily-like a toothbrush.  If something happens to it, we immediately replace.  Get this for people who constantly want to scratch their backs.</li>
            <li> Poorly made.  Wheels fell off first time I used it and I got splinters from the scratcher.  I threw it away.</li>
            <li> Bought three different kinds of back scratchers and this was my favorite. A replacement for one I lost in a house fire I gave one to my daughter and kept 2 for myself(I&#x27;m selfish like that), one in the front room and one in my bedroom.</li>
            <li> Extremely poor quality, splinters,large crack in the handle. Rough finish. Would not recommend at all!</li>
            <li> It replaces one that I had for years. It is exactly what I was looking for</li>
            <li> We&#x27;ve had several back scratchers and they all broke.  This one does the trick and it&#x27;s very sturdy.  Love it.</li>
            <li> I personally prefer the retractable back scratchers, but I decided to try this one due to the price.  Upon opening the package, one of the wheel rollers broke and fell off.  I currently use that open hole as a thumb hold while I&#x27;m using this scratcher, but it still isn&#x27;t as good as the retractable one I had that decided to retire after 9 years.</li>
            <li> This was a gift, so I can NOT review!</li>
            <li> Terrible cracking wood. Not what I expected and I guess you get what you pay for.</li>
            <li> Woks out very well&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;simple item but does the job can not say much more it is such a simple item</li>
            <li> it wasnt worth it it was so crappy made</li>
            <li> Product as described. shipping was slow. Got 2 tracking numbers. Neither of which were Right.</li>
            <li> Nice back scratcher, but the packaging was terrible.  It arrived with a large crack in it.  I was able to duct tape it to reinforce it and it works great, but they need to rethink their packaging of this product.</li>
            <li> This produce seems very durable! The length makes it extremely easy to use! I would recommend this for personal use or even a gift for someone else</li>
            <li> My husband always asks me to scratch his back- so I bought him this and now I don&#x27;t have to do it anymore! He loves it!</li>
            <li> This was a great item. Since this is hard to find I finally got what i needed for a very long time.</li>
            <li> perfect item for anyone</li>
            <li> Perfect for those hard to reach spots! I really like this product and would recommend it. Be gentle if you use it on your skin - or simply take some sand paper to it. Works right through your shirt too though.</li>
            <li> I have had several versions of this...the earliest is just a scratcher and is shorter.  Also have a couple of later ones with the rollers at the bottom.  This one is reasonably well made and finished, though the price has spiked over time.  Bamboo is very sturdy and they should last a long time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I particularly like this one because I think it&#x27;s a bit longer than the others I&#x27;ve had (and given away occasionally after visitors have used them).  The roller is good for tight shoulder muscles, especially along the spine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have some side uses for this...I keep an earlier &#x27;plain jane&#x27; back scratcher in my car to pull the mail out of my deep rural mailbox, as well as to resolve the occasional leg itch that you can&#x27;t get to while driving.  :)</li>
            <li> My son actually had this on his Christmas list.  Apparently his back itches.  A lot.  This product is sturdy, and though pricier than I would pay at a brick and morter, has served him well and is still in one piece 4 months later.</li>
            <li> I purchased the identical product locally for me and it is much higher quality for $1.99.  I purchased four from this site to give to cousins at a recent birthday celebration assuming they would be the same quality. A couple looked as if they had been used to roast marshmallows--wood looked charred on one end. Also the finish was rough and the wood on one was peeling a bit on the side. The one I have is varnished and the wood is perfect.  Intended to return them but procrastinated until it was too late. They serve the intended purpose, but I don&#x27;t recommend them as gifts.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s good quality for the price. I wasn&#x27;t happy that is was delivered a week later then promised but that&#x27;s a delivery issue. I would recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I am very happy with it.  Mine looks slightly different than the one pictured.  It has three massage rollers instead of two.  It does exactly what you need it to do.</li>
            <li> My husband loves this!!</li>
            <li> This back scratcher is a marked improvement over the moldy stick with a rusty nail that I WAS using.  Emphasis on WAS because I&#x27;ll never go back to that lock-jaw inducing monstrosity now that I have a therapeutic back scratcher.  The fact that it is light-weight bamboo is just icing on the cake.  And a bonus feature is that you can use it for scratching other things besides you back.  Who knew?  Cleans up quickly and if you follow the maintenance plan it will never give you trouble.  The massage balls on the handle not only give soothing relief to various ailments but can be used to roll out cookie dough.  I would recommend this back scratcher to my friends but most of them have blocked me.  I will probably order one for every room in the house but two back scratchers seems so first-worldy.  Take it from me - at your own risk! :) :) :)</li>
            <li> Made of strong wood you can use it as a weapon. It&#x27;s also long enough to get to the area of your back that you need</li>
            <li> This product was received and was not very much like the picture. One of the &#x27;teeth&#x27; on the scratcher side sticks out farther than the others and the wood is very rough in many places. I am afraid that my husband would get splinters if he uses this.</li>
            <li> Horrible condition and very splintered like it was used and it was also black then cracked in a week!</li>
            <li> The back scratcher was not filed down enough so the teeth were very rough and cut into my skin. Also the massage rollers are useless.</li>
            <li> It was purchased for a friend as a gift. Initial comment was that it works well.  I can&#x27;t speak to the endurance of it.</li>
            <li> good scratching, the cord at the top is a little lame, it will break, but it is easy to replace</li>
            <li> #1 on our son&#x27;s Christmas list. He loves it. It is functional and can be used in a number of ways due to its rollers, length, and scratcher design.He takes it to work every day and has to be careful to keep up with it because other employees also love it. Lesson learned: don&#x27;t share your backscratcher, ever! He also uses it as a scratcher for his cat and it has almost the affect of catnip.</li>
            <li> It works fine as a back scratcher,  but on the first day we got it, the two rolling wheels just fell out of place. We didn&#x27;t handle it roughly or anything, it just kind of broke on its own. The rollers weren&#x27;t the main selling point anyway, but still seems a little strange that they broke so easily.</li>
            <li> It showed up broken, I sent it back. I never had the chance to use it. I may try again some other time.</li>
            <li> I seller was very kind to send me replacements but even the replacements are in different phases of completion...out of 4 total..one works efficiently. The rest will scratch your back up or leave you with splinters.</li>
            <li> Works like it should and price was great.</li>
            <li> had it for 5 years still works great</li>
            <li> Nice and sturdy. I would recommend it.</li>
            <li> Do not buy this!!!  The scratcher isn&#x27;t worth 25 cents.  This would be a mistake.  Do not buy this, ever.</li>
            <li> It came pretty fast and I was pleased with that. Although, it looked a little cheaply made but honestly for the money I can&#x27;t really complain. Pretty cool little back scratcher!</li>
            <li> Jagged and uneven teeth and extremely painful to use.  Too cheap to return and exchange.  I will never buy another one without seeing it first.  Terrible, terrible product.  I&#x27;d give it a zero if there were one.</li>
            <li> I dont kno if it was just me but i thought it would be laminated or glossed or something but it wasnt. It hurts your fingers and hands because it gives you splinters i threw mine away like days after i got it.</li>
            <li> A solid back scratcher and works as intended. I never use the massage part of it as I bought it for scratching my back. I couldn&#x27;t imagine anyone buying it for the purpose of using it to massage a part of their body as any back scratcher you buy with that &amp;#34;feature&amp;#34; really doesn&#x27;t do much for you in that department. If that&#x27;s something you need you are better off buying a separate massager along with this back scratcher.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The build quality could have been a bit better as I had a piece of bamboo splintered off and sticking out on the side but for the price.. well, you kinda get what you pay for. I tore of the offending piece and have been happy with it ever since.</li>
            <li> Love it to scratch those almost unreachable areas on my back.  Thanks</li>
            <li> The product was delivered to my daughter for our granchild.  Mangled, blackish,dirty-looking, multi colored of mishaped mess! Looking like it was a used product. It did not at ALL resemble the picture or what was expected..  I would never recommend this to anyone. It shouldn&#x27;t touch anyone&#x27;s skin!</li>
            <li> When I opened it, the rollers were already broken. But I purchased it mainly for the scratcher anyway.  But the splinters that came off while I scratched my back made it unbearable to use.</li>
            <li> The Bamboo Therapeutic Back Scratch-er is excellent.  They made wonderful gifts for a couple of colleagues as well as being very sturdy.  I will enjoy them for years to come.</li>
            <li> In the simiilest of terms it accomplishes the task. Not of the highest quality but you get what you pay for.</li>
            <li> I like this scratcher very much, but one needs to be careful using it. The &amp;#34;teeth&amp;#34; on the one I received are quite aggressive and can really dig in. I was going to take it out to my shop and sand it down a little, but the more I used it the more I liked it. I have had it for several weeks and have not taken it to the shop, and probably will not. I believe that there is a lacquer coating on the instrument that may have dried with rough edges. I have had a reaction to some medication which has turned me body red and itches beyond belief. This scratcher has been a big help.What I like about it:&lt;br /&gt;1. The long handle; 2. handle has a slight curve to it; 3. the handle is flat so I do not have the scratcher turning on me and not knowing  where the teeth are. (I have another bamboo scratcher with a small square handle that flips easily, which is aggravating); 4. It has a nice wide scratch hand&lt;br /&gt;I found that the rollers could be useful and were, at times, but on the whole, they tend to get in the way when making the long reach down or up the back.  My only con would be concern of the aggressiveness of the teeth. That is why only four stars instead of five.</li>
            <li> Yes, I love this thing. You know who your friends are when you have an itch on your back that you can&#x27;t get to. But, what do you do in the middle of the night? Don&#x27;t even think about waking your spouse, buy this instead. You&#x27;ll save yourself the cost of going out to dinner and Ewww, Ahhh the relief of it all! LOL</li>
            <li> The claw scratching is perfect  but the messaging rollers broke at first time use</li>
            <li> i got this for my husband and it works great. the rolling part is useless but he doesn&#x27;t care for it</li>
            <li> It scratches my back, which is what I bought it for. The little wheels on the handle are stupid.</li>
            <li> cheap, broke almost immediately</li>
            <li> This was a gift for my husband. He loves it. He hasn&#x27;t asked me to scratch his back ever since &#x27;Lucy&#x27; arrived.  Yes, he named the stick.</li>
            <li> not good-too much varnish ..needs to be sanded and worked on to be used&lt;br /&gt;( order four, two came broken )</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a back scratcher...it scratches my back with ease and comfort...it&#x27;s a back scratcher.</li>
            <li> yes! this is what I needed. feels good on my back. con: the rollers seem like they could break with moderate to heavy use but I only mostly use the scratcher.</li>
            <li> Strong material that makes scratching the back itch very easy.  Rollers give you a good massage.  Bought other but they were thin and not sturdy.</li>
            <li> It does the job, but you have to arch your back to really get an itch. Claw is not very sharp which is a good thing, but sharp enough to get the itch. The back massager end can be done away with because it is completely useless, but I didnt buy it for that end. So overall if it is cheap enough and you need a back scratcher go for it.</li>
            <li> &#x60;My hubby loves it!  It arrived on time or Christmas and it was in perfect condition.  I may just buy a second one at some point in time.</li>
            <li> The wood is not sanded properly. I haven&#x27;t used the product yet, because I would get splinters. I will have to sand it and hope that I can turn it into a usable scratcher. Buyer beware...</li>
            <li> I would recommend a different brand.  This one is poorly built and is loaded with splinters.  Most back scratchers are coated with varnish to make them hard and splinter free.  This one is almost plain wood.  It does have some varnish, but the fingers and the holes where the massage wheels are are loaded with splinters.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, the massage wheels are kind of a novelty.  It feels like the whole thing will snap if you press hard enough to feel the effects of the rollers.</li>
            <li> Love this back scratcher ...Not very expensive and gets the job done!</li>
            <li> Amazing!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sturdy and very effective for those itches that you just can&#x27;t reach! I would definitely recommend this item. The item came faster than expected as well. Thank you!</li>
            <li> Very poor quality. One of the rollers in the handle was already nonfunctional/broken when I received it. Do not recommend!</li>
            <li> The rollers are not put together very well, and fall apart easily.  The rest of it is made pretty strong.</li>
            <li> rollers fell off on the 1st. day and it splinters</li>
            <li> EXTREMELY DISAPPOINTING!! I could actually picture some poor little children making this product in a dingy factory being paid a quarter a day!!! Purely made, unsanded parts of the wood &amp; VERY uncomfortable to use!!</li>
