            <li>My client likes it because it&#x27;s easier to use and light, great for her heights, under 5 feet.</li>
            <li>nice and sturdy.</li>
            <li>Perfect for my 5&#x27; 86 yr old mom!</li>
            <li>It is exactly what I wanted and I am happy with it.</li>
            <li>My mom&#x27; physical therapist was impressed with the quality and price.  </li>
            <li>but I haven&#x27;t been able to find out what is doing it.</li>
            <li>This is the best walker for short people.  </li>
            <li>I am pleased</li>
            <li>I am glad I was told to purchase this size for her.</li>
            <li>Walker is sturdy and easy to maneuver.  </li>
            <li>In addition it is easy to collapse the sides.  </li>
            <li>Easily assembled, sturdy.</li>
            <li>Working out just fine.</li>

            <li>Purchased this for my mother to replace an older model.  </li>
            <li>Actually I couldnt believe that not only was it exactly as pictured, but the price was so very much lower for the walker than  in ALL the stores I shopped it in.  </li>
            <li>Purchased it for my father and he was reluctant to use it at first and now uses it daily.  </li>
            <li>WOW!</li>
            <li>Delivered to my home, all the parts necessary, brand new, lowest price.  </li>
            <li>Very hard to find basket and tray to fit.</li>

            <li> Perfect for my mother who is shrinking with ostioarthritis</li>
            <li> Walker is sturdy and easy to maneuver.  Purchased it for my father and he was reluctant to use it at first and now uses it daily.  I priced other walkers similar to this locally and they were much more expensive.  I would definitely recommend it.</li>
            <li> Mom is 5&#x27;2&amp;#34; and it fits her perfectly</li>
            <li> Excellent product for the price.  My mom&#x27; physical therapist was impressed with the quality and price.  She said that she would have expected it to cost $130.</li>
            <li> Great quality,  great value</li>
            <li> Exactly what I was looking for.  I needed something narrower, smaller and lightweight.  Perfect for my 5&#x27; 86 yr old mom!</li>
            <li> Great quality and delivered before the requested time!</li>
            <li> It is exactly what I wanted and I am happy with it. However, it has started making a clicking sound when I walk with it. The sound is not really annoying but I haven&#x27;t been able to find out what is doing it. I do like the size.</li>
            <li> Working out just fine.</li>
            <li> Light enough so I can put it in the car myself. Also, right height for my 57&amp;#34; height.</li>
            <li> This is the best walker for short people.  The price is right and it&#x27;s sturdy.  In addition it is easy to collapse the sides.  It&#x27;s a good product.  I recommend buying this one.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 5&#x27;3 1/2&amp;#34; and having it on the highest setting is a bit short, but it will work for my abdominal recovery period since I&#x27;ll be bent over.  Besides front wheels it also comes with two different types of back glider caps; a pair for carpet and a pair for non-carpeted areas.</li>
            <li> Purchased this for my mother to replace an older model.  This one closes a lot easier, however, and it is sturdier than her previous walker.  I think it will last longer because of this.</li>
            <li> It arrived before time. An amazing product.  It was beyond my expectation.  Actually I couldnt believe that not only was it exactly as pictured, but the price was so very much lower for the walker than  in ALL the stores I shopped it in.  Delivered to my home, all the parts necessary, brand new, lowest price.  Can&#x27;t beat that.  WOW!</li>
            <li> Would give it 4 stars, but it&#x27;s noisy.  My client likes it because it&#x27;s easier to use and light, great for her heights, under 5 feet.</li>
            <li> nice and sturdy. a bit short, but works out well for elderly.</li>
            <li> Good sturdy walker.  I am pleased</li>
            <li> This was as expected and we are happy with it.  My mother is 4&#x27;10&amp;#34; and 98 lbs.  I am glad I was told to purchase this size for her.</li>
            <li> works perfectly for my needs</li>
            <li> Very hard to find basket and tray to fit.</li>
            <li> Finally found a walker that could be adjusted for my 5 foot frame. Definitely provides the support I need when trying to walk. Only complaint is that the wheels are beginning to squeek after just a few months of use.</li>
            <li> Easily assembled, sturdy.</li>
            <li> Ordered it for my grandma. Exactly what she needed and wanted.</li>
            <li> My wife finds it very useful.</li>
            <li> Perfect for our shorter client!</li>
            <li> I expected that it would come with something for the back legs to facilitate rolling.</li>
