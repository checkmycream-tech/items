            <li>What more could you ask for?</li>
            <li>Amazing, really foams good when used on a bath scrubbie sponge.  </li>
            <li>I fell in love with the name first!!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m old, and the hymn Amazing Grace is an all time favorite!  </li>
            <li>I love the mild fresh smell and lathers well</li>
            <li>Always my favorite, a classic clean scent!</li>
            <li>The fragrance is very feminine not floral or sweet and fruity like most bath gels are.  </li>

            <li>Thanks.</li>
            <li>but i&#x27;m not paying 39 bucks for it when you can get it else where for much cheaper.</li>
            <li>Dried my hair out but, nice scent.  </li>
            <li>It only takes up half the space in the shower, because it&#x27;s perfect for your hair right on down to your toes!  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not super sudsy, but it does make some light bubbles.  </li>
            <li>Why is this selling for such a high price?</li>

            <li> I find the lather to be average.  </li>
            <li> I like that the fragrance is subtle and doesn&#x27;t compete with any other fragrances I might use.  </li>
