    <ol>
            <li>Came in perfect timing.</li>
            <li>this is 1 of the best skin moisturizers around, for your healing process.. use in the healing process and aftercare for the life of your tat</li>
            <li>That stuff is awesome!</li>
            <li>Excellent product and service!</li>
            <li>Very awesome stuff have a lot of tattoo&#x27;s and this stuff is great</li>
            <li>The best stuff I ever used took care of my tattoos very nice.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 16 hours into a 36 hour piece and this stuff is working great.</li>
            <li>good product - like all the rest of their product line - very effective</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve paid more to the Dr. and for meds than my tat!</li>
            <li>And amazing on keeping my tattoo from drying out or fading.</li>
            <li>can honestly say that with this product tattoos heal quicker and easier.</li>
            <li>The greatest lotion for tattoos by far I&#x27;ve tried them all !!</li>
            <li>I started off using Aquaphor and that in turn works much better.</li>
            <li>but in all honesty you get better healing from store brand aquafor</li>
            <li>much better looking tattoos after I use this product.</li>
            <li>Great stuff for new tats.</li>
            <li>As the tattoo heals, it just flakes off like you had a very mild sunburn.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>This gel has a funny smell and I needed to apply it way more often than I did the Aquaphor.</li>
            <li>I originally bought one H20 kit, and then just started buying the 2oz moisturizing cream.</li>
            <li>The whole process takes two weeks or more.</li>
            <li>Love how it feels and how it moisturizes new tattoos and helps to stop cracking.</li>
            <li>This product applies very easily and is not too oily and barely has any odor.</li>
            <li>Really keeps tats looking fresh after they have healed.</li>
            <li>I just got my most recent tattoo on Thursday evening.</li>
            <li>It went on easy, spread easy, and kept the tattoo protected well in harsh winter conditions.</li>
            <li>That way my leg isn&#x27;t all goopy feeling, but instead feels super soft and stays well protected.</li>
            <li>When I first started getting tattooed, I was told fragrance free lotion was the only way to go.</li>
            <li>and I really like this product because I can take it to work with me.</li>
            <li>Healed relatively fast</li>
            <li>With the Aquatat, the tattoo heals almost twice as fast.</li>
            <li>We&#x27;ve used H2Ocean products after getting new tattoos for years now.  </li>
            <li>If you are here either because you are new to tattoo healing or you are looking to change, buy the two I listed.</li>
            <li>It will hurt your new tattoo.</li>
            <li>A small tad last a while and covers a nice are as well.&lt;br</li>
            <li>In the end, its convenient that the tube is small and can pretty much fit in your back pocket, but I don&#x27;t think I will buy it again.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Highly recommend this product, I have seen major improvements in healing, reduction in pain and</li>
            <li>I bought this because I use a bunch of the other H2Ocean products and this was nothing really to write home about.</li>
            <li>Your mainly paying for the label and brand by purchasing these products no real special tattoo treatment.</li>

            <li> My leg is broken out, I&#x27;m now having to take antihistamines, Steriods, and use hydrocortisone cream!</li>
            <li> you read articles about tattoo aftercare, you&#x27;ll know that you should apply a very thin layer to your tattoo to keep it from drying.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li> I recently just got a tattoo and I really like this product because I can take it to work with me. This product does what its suppose to do.</li>
            <li> Just got my 4th tattoo a few weeks ago and I ordered this in advance. Came in perfect timing. And amazing on keeping my tattoo from drying out or fading. Healed relatively fast</li>
            <li> I bought this because I use a bunch of the other H2Ocean products and this was nothing really to write home about. I started off using Aquaphor and that in turn works much better. This gel has a funny smell and I needed to apply it way more often than I did the Aquaphor. In the end, its convenient that the tube is small and can pretty much fit in your back pocket, but I don&#x27;t think I will buy it again.</li>
            <li> Works well but in all honesty you get better healing from store brand aquafor and you get a much larger supply for your money. Your mainly paying for the label and brand by purchasing these products no real special tattoo treatment. I&#x27;d pass on the product it&#x27;s average but it still performs it&#x27;s intended job.</li>
            <li> OMG I used this for a few days on my new tat, and I have had a terrible reaction! My leg is broken out, I&#x27;m now having to take antihistamines, Steriods, and use hydrocortisone cream! I&#x27;ve paid more to the Dr. and for meds than my tat! BEWARE! Look at the ingredients!</li>
            <li> this is 1 of the best skin moisturizers around, for your healing process.. use in the healing process and aftercare for the life of your tat</li>
            <li> Great stuff for new tats.</li>
            <li> We&#x27;ve used H2Ocean products after getting new tattoos for years now.  Love how it feels and how it moisturizes new tattoos and helps to stop cracking.</li>
            <li> I originally bought one H20 kit, and then just started buying the 2oz moisturizing cream. and the Aquatat Moisturizer, 1.75 oz  That stuff is awesome! If you are here either because you are new to tattoo healing or you are looking to change, buy the two I listed. The Aquatat can replace your aquaphor/AD and the cream can replace lotion. I actually mix them tbh, 2 parts Cream one part aquatat. That way my leg isn&#x27;t all goopy feeling, but instead feels super soft and stays well protected. I&#x27;m 16 hours into a 36 hour piece and this stuff is working great.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t get this. It will hurt your new tattoo. Seriously damages the work done. Also causes your skin to break out in acne.</li>
            <li> When I first started getting tattooed, I was told fragrance free lotion was the only way to go. So that&#x27;s what I used for years. About 4 tattoos ago, my artist recommended I get some Aquatat- I will no longer use anything else.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t know if it will work for you, or if your experience is similar to mine. With lotion, the tattoo slowly raises, and then the raised parts slowly come off like scabs. The whole process takes two weeks or more. In my experience, this led to a lot of color loss and some scarring. With the Aquatat, the tattoo heals almost twice as fast. There is no scabbing and no color loss. As the tattoo heals, it just flakes off like you had a very mild sunburn.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have and will continue to recommend this stuff to everyone I know that gets ink. I just got my most recent tattoo on Thursday evening. It is now Wednesday morning and I&#x27;m about 90% healed.</li>
            <li> My tattoo artist used this during the tattoo process and I used it as aftercare afterwards. It went on easy, spread easy, and kept the tattoo protected well in harsh winter conditions. Colors stayed in with no problems and for the first time ever I had no cracking during the late stages of the healing process.</li>
            <li> Excellent product and service!</li>
            <li> Very awesome stuff have a lot of tattoo&#x27;s and this stuff is great</li>
            <li> Have numerous tattoos for the past 20 years.

            <li> The best stuff I ever used took care of my tattoos very nice.I will buy it again for my next tattoo.</li>
