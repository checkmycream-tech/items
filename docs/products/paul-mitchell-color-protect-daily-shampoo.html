            <li>Buy some, it&#x27;s an excellent product!</li>
            <li>Product good as gold!!</li>
            <li>Great product!</li>
            <li>Love how well it keeps the color on my hair without drying it out!!!</li>
            <li>I purchased this from my salon, who had a great sale on it.</li>
            <li>My hair feels and looks great after using it.  </li>
            <li>this a  is great for tinted hair</li>
            <li>The shampoo never got a good lather.</li>
            <li>And, it has a wonderful, light aroma.  </li>
            <li>item is good, but not perfect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Color</li>
            <li>I am very satisfied with it.  </li>
            <li>I love it!</li>
            <li>Love this shampoo!  </li>
            <li>I have used others and liked them as well</li>
            <li>I LOVE this product and was happy to find it available through Amazon.  </li>
            <li>It smells great and leaves your hair managable and looking super healthy.</li>
            <li>I will switch to something more moisturizing in the winter though because I don&#x27;t think this will be the answer for winter hair.</li>
            <li>I love this shampoo.</li>
            <li>so glad she did</li>
            <li>i love it</li>
            <li>You can get greasy hair for free!  </li>
            <li>but this one seems to be good for my hair right now (summer)</li>
            <li>They were on sale at Ulta buy 2, get 1 free, so I bought without checking reviews (something I almost NEVER do, for this reason).</li>
            <li>but overall I am happy with this product.  </li>
            <li>Fast shipping amazing product.</li>
            <li>I wanted to get a specially formulated one.</li>
            <li>But not bad....</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t suds up very much, which is what you want in a shampoo, but still gets my hair super clean.</li>
            <li>Brightening isn&#x27;t the intention of this product though, but it WOULD be a nice future feature!</li>
            <li>I have found it to clean thoroughly and yet to be gentle.</li>
            <li>You&#x27;ll quickly find that many others have had similar issues with this</li>
            <li>I used this shampoo and conditioner twice, no problems the first time, and I figured it might not have the greasy effect on my hair.</li>
            <li>She claims that her hair looked shinier after the first use, and she hasn&#x27;t stopped singing its praise since I gave it to her.</li>
            <li>Another factor---although it is listed as a &amp;#34;daily&amp;#34; shampoo---I&#x27;ve NEVER used shampoo more than every 3-4 days---and definitely not a need for me with this one.  </li>
            <li>paul mitchell was only ok</li>
            <li>- i felt like i needed to use more to accomplish the same as redkens product.</li>
            <li>I have short highlighted hair and this is a good daily product.</li>
            <li>I have naturally straight, perfect thickness hair, and I usually let my hair air dry at night with no issues.</li>
            <li>It took a weeks worth of washes to even make my hair feel soft again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>must say, though, that during the first week of use, my fine, wavy (and color treated) hair developed a thicker texture that held flat ironing and styling</li>
            <li>And mind you, this is not because of my hair-I can use any shampoo, from the ones at the dollar store to the high end ones, and have never had this issue.</li>
            <li>This shampoo made my hair extra oily the first day.</li>
            <li>Every one is different as far as how hair reacts to certain shampoos, but, for me---HIGHLY recommend this one!</li>
            <li>How could my hair feel so greasy and grimey right after I blow dry it.</li>
            <li>it looked like I hadn&#x27;t showered in days even directly after blow</li>
            <li>I have found that washing my hair every other day or every third day works - it seems to keep my hair clean that long</li>
            <li>I tried other Paul Mitchell&#x27;s shampoos and they worked very well even without using conditioner.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Not bad, but less the was expected.</li>
            <li>So ordered a bottle and guess what it super dried my hair!!</li>

            <li> You buy shampoo to clean your hair, not make it worse than before you started.</li>
            <li> my hair felt very greasy and dull...</li>
            <li> I have used this shampoo for a long time and would recommend this to anyone</li>
            <li> I mean, there was so much grease in my hair that I could see a film on my hand after running it through my hair.</li>
            <li> I do follow up with conditioner since my hair is on the dry side</li>
            <li> In fact, though, my previous stylist had told me, it does contain enough &amp;#34;conditioners&amp;#34; , that you really do not need additional  conditioners afterward---don&#x27;t know if this could have been part of that experience due to the extra conditioner--??  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used other shampoos that were for color treated hair and my hair color faded within a few weeks.</li>
            <li> it cleans well and doesn&#x27;t leave any odd type of coating on my hair.  </li>
            <li> is saved but hair becomes dry and hard to comb.</li>
            <li> It was so bad that my boyfriend, who usually never notices anything, asked me what I put into my hair because it looked gross.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money on this, at all.</li>
            <li> This shampoo leaves a heavy residue in your hair no matter</li>
            <li> It also made my hair look like I skipped a few showers.</li>
            <li> Noticed that some mentioned the shampoo dried their hair and thought well that&#x27;s them.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money on this stuff.  </li>
            <li> Usually I use Dove, but because I got my hair colored</li>
            <li> (I&#x27;d give this a negative star if it let me.)</li>
            <li> It cleans my thick hair, keeps my lighter hair color until time</li>
            <li> One wash with this stuff made my hair worse than 4 days without shampooing with Dove.</li>
            <li> ---I&#x27;ve NEVER experienced anything like that.  </li>
            <li> I thought I was going crazy.</li>
            <li> This stuff is terrible, I wish I would have read reviews on here before I purchased.</li>
            <li> Worst shampoo ever...</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> It smells great and leaves your hair managable and looking super healthy. I love it! I alternate it with Joico K-pack. I switch shampoo every month between the 2 brands and my hair always looks great! The conditioner is not slimy eaither; its creamier, and does not feel gross when you are applying it. Buy some, it&#x27;s an excellent product! The salon I go to uses it on all patrons who color thier hair or bleach.</li>
            <li> I purchased this from my salon, who had a great sale on it. I&#x27;ve used other shampoos that were for color treated hair and my hair color faded within a few weeks. With PM Daily Shampoo, its been over a month and my gray still hasn&#x27;t come back! It doesn&#x27;t suds up very much, which is what you want in a shampoo, but still gets my hair super clean. Definitely recommend!</li>
            <li> This stuff is terrible, I wish I would have read reviews on here before I purchased. They were on sale at Ulta buy 2, get 1 free, so I bought without checking reviews (something I almost NEVER do, for this reason). I used this shampoo and conditioner twice, no problems the first time, and I figured it might not have the greasy effect on my hair. However, the second time I used it, I washed my hair and went to bed. I have naturally straight, perfect thickness hair, and I usually let my hair air dry at night with no issues. When I woke up the next morning my hair was COATED with oil. It was so bad that my boyfriend, who usually never notices anything, asked me what I put into my hair because it looked gross. I mean, there was so much grease in my hair that I could see a film on my hand after running it through my hair. And mind you, this is not because of my hair-I can use any shampoo, from the ones at the dollar store to the high end ones, and have never had this issue. Usually I use Dove, but because I got my hair colored I wanted to get a specially formulated one. One wash with this stuff made my hair worse than 4 days without shampooing with Dove. You buy shampoo to clean your hair, not make it worse than before you started. Don&#x27;t waste your money on this, at all.</li>
            <li> I got this shampoo in combination with the conditioner. After washing with it a few days I noticed my hair didn&#x27;t feel soft, I just felt like there was a film on it like old hairspray. The shampoo never got a good lather. Try another product before this one.</li>
            <li> Love this shampoo!  It cleans well and moisturizers my hair.  I have used this shampoo for a long time and would recommend this to anyone</li>
            <li> Worst shampoo ever...my hair felt very greasy and dull...I threw it away</li>
            <li> I bought my mom, who dyes her hair every 6 months or so, both the shampoo and conditioner of Paul Mitchell&#x27;s Color Care line. I don&#x27;t personally use the product, but she tells me that she loves it. She claims that her hair looked shinier after the first use, and she hasn&#x27;t stopped singing its praise since I gave it to her.</li>
            <li> This was recommended by my hair dresser.</li>
            <li> This shampoo leaves a heavy residue in your hair no matter how well you rinse it out. Its been two weeks since I switched back to my regular shampoo and I still feel like my hair hasn&#x27;t recovered from this. It took a weeks worth of washes to even make my hair feel soft again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I thought I was going crazy. How could my hair feel so greasy and grimey right after I blow dry it. It felt like I washed my hair in bacon grease. People have different needs. My hair can regularly go 3-4 days without getting oily. This shampoo made my hair extra oily the first day. It also made my hair look like I skipped a few showers. I do not recommend!</li>
            <li> My hairdresser recommended this product.  I have used others and liked them as well but this one seems to be good for my hair right now (summer) it cleans well and doesn&#x27;t leave any odd type of coating on my hair.  I don&#x27;t have to shampoo twice to remove product from my hair either which is an added bonus.  I do follow up with conditioner since my hair is on the dry side but overall I am happy with this product.  I will switch to something more moisturizing in the winter though because I don&#x27;t think this will be the answer for winter hair.</li>
            <li> I love this shampoo. I have found it to clean thoroughly and yet to be gentle. My hair feels and looks great after using it.  I am very satisfied with it.  I have found that washing my hair every other day or every third day works - it seems to keep my hair clean that long</li>
            <li> But not bad....I had a trial size of this shampoo and that&#x27;s why I purchased this product. It was not the same as the trial size.</li>
            <li> I have used PM Color Protect Shampoo for years...wouldn&#x27;t want to have&lt;br /&gt;to be without it.  It cleans my thick hair, keeps my lighter hair color until time&lt;br /&gt;to color again, is so creamy.  And, it has a wonderful, light aroma.  I carry a&lt;br /&gt;small size when I travel.  Product good as gold!!</li>
            <li> Great product! I have this on subscribe and save so I don&#x27;t run out!</li>
            <li> Not bad, but less the was expected. I tried other Paul Mitchell&#x27;s shampoos and they worked very well even without using conditioner.&lt;br /&gt;this item is good, but not perfect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Color is saved but hair becomes dry and hard to comb.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping amazing product. Love how well it keeps the color on my hair without drying it out!!! My hair stylist recommended it and im so glad she did</li>
            <li> I have short highlighted hair and this is a good daily product. Seems to keep my highlights intact, but doesn&#x27;t brighten at all.  Brightening isn&#x27;t the intention of this product though, but it WOULD be a nice future feature!</li>
            <li> Read the reviews just as you are doing. Noticed that some mentioned the shampoo dried their hair and thought well that&#x27;s them. So ordered a bottle and guess what it super dried my hair!! So if this is  a concern do NOT purchase this shampoo.</li>
            <li> this a  is great for tinted hair i love it my color does not disapere  with this product than you</li>
            <li> This shampoo is beyond gross.  After two weeks of daily use (as advertized on the bottle) my hair became so greasy it looked like I hadn&#x27;t showered in days even directly after blow drying.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Simply do a search of others&#x27; reviews on this product.  You&#x27;ll quickly find that many others have had similar issues with this shampoo.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I must say, though, that during the first week of use, my fine, wavy (and color treated) hair developed a thicker texture that held flat ironing and styling well.  But, by the second week it was so greasy I couldn&#x27;t even get to styling--soooo gross it needed to be washed AGAIN and with something else!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t think one&#x27;s hair could look dirtier/greasier than before shampooing, but Paul Mitchell nailed it on this one.  Don&#x27;t waste your money on this stuff.  You can get greasy hair for free!  (I&#x27;d give this a negative star if it let me.)</li>
            <li> I LOVE this product and was happy to find it available through Amazon.  Some of the reviews mentioned experiencing &amp;#34;oiliness&amp;#34; to quite a degree&amp;#34;---I&#x27;ve used it for years, but the salon I go to doesn&#x27;t carry it---I&#x27;ve NEVER experienced anything like that.  In fact, though, my previous stylist had told me, it does contain enough &amp;#34;conditioners&amp;#34; , that you really do not need additional  conditioners afterward---don&#x27;t know if this could have been part of that experience due to the extra conditioner--??  Another factor---although it is listed as a &amp;#34;daily&amp;#34; shampoo---I&#x27;ve NEVER used shampoo more than every 3-4 days---and definitely not a need for me with this one.  I do have my hair colored (covers the gray/white)---no problems with fading, etc .  Every one is different as far as how hair reacts to certain shampoos, but, for me---HIGHLY recommend this one!</li>
            <li> paul mitchell was only ok - i felt like i needed to use more to accomplish the same as redkens product.</li>
