    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>This stuff is awesome.</li>
            <li>I am so impressed at how well this works.</li>
            <li>Best of all, no leftover make up whatsoever.</li>
            <li>This stuff is totally awesome, taking off even the hardest traces of all make up, and your face is supple after you wash.</li>
            <li>My face is in great shape since I discovered this cleanser.</li>
            <li>This is great for your skin.</li>
            <li>This is a great product at a great price.</li>
            <li>it is cheaper than others and the quality is good.</li>
            <li>I used the Purity gel (still have some) but for me , the oil is superior.</li>
            <li>It is superior to everything else.  </li>
            <li>I was so glad to find it on Amazon and at a great price, too.  </li>
            <li>Love it!  </li>
            <li>Love this stuff!  </li>
            <li>But its kind of nice still, lighter, and still moisturizing.</li>
            <li>It smells nice too, but that tells me there is probably added fragrance which I am not a fan of, but</li>
            <li>Liked the oily feeling of this cleanser and thought that it did its job as a cleanser.  </li>
            <li>But, once the makeup is off it feels divine, and if you don&#x27;t wash it off like the bottle recommends you do afterwards, it also functions as a nice skin moisturizer.</li>
            <li>The oil is very light too.</li>
            <li>I love the way it feels after I&#x27;m done.</li>
            <li>I love all of the purity products.</li>
            <li>Not only does it do an excellent job</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve read that some people don&#x27;t like it because it doesn&#x27;t have a pump like most others have</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t like all Philosophy products, but really love this one.</li>
            <li>I have had oily skin for most of my life</li>
            <li>I for sure need to use another cleanser to get rid of the smeared mascara.</li>
            <li>It takes many MANY cotton balls of this stuff to remove my caked-on whore paint.</li>
            <li>I love that this oil will take off my waterproof mascara as well as cleanse my skin.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not really a lazy solution since it takes more time to remove makeup then just getting out of bed and washing my face, but it is still really good stuff regardless</li>
            <li>I am baffled about why this product gets such great reviews.</li>
            <li>After using it my face feels so silky smooth.  </li>
            <li>I really like this product and love the light clean smell!  </li>
            <li>Love love love this facial cleanser.</li>
            <li>I was originally going to order MAC&#x27;s cleansing oil</li>
            <li>After the first try I was in love with it.</li>
            <li>this doen&#x27;t clean your skin as well as i had thought.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m super excited that it hasn&#x27;t irritated my skin or broke it out.</li>
            <li>The bottle was full as it should have been and it has become a \\&quot;have-to-have\\&quot; staple for me.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll be back for more!</li>
            <li>I use this oil daily followed by a warm wash cloth....</li>
            <li>Due to my sensitivity  to most cleansing products, I&#x27;m doubly pleased to have found this cleansing product.  </li>
            <li>It was reasonably priced, it smells nice, and it removes nearly all my makeup, including the waterproof stuff ;)</li>
            <li>and you should absolutely try it for perfectly clean and balanced, glowing skin.</li>
            <li>I know many try to get rid of oil, but I want a little more oil.  </li>
            <li>They&#x27;re very gentle.</li>
            <li>but as I get older it has become more &amp;#34;combination.&amp;#34; I received a sample of this and was completely blown away...</li>
            <li>(I&#x27;m an avid &amp;#34;OCM-er&amp;#34; aka the Oil Cleansing Method).</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d almost be willing to put up with that</li>
            <li>(I was primarily using them to remove makeup, so I really had to put a lot on my face), but this cleansing oil rinses cleanly away with water; no second washing needed!  </li>
            <li>It removes make up easily, and it seems to balance my skin better than ordinary soap.</li>
            <li>it took off ALL of my makeup, didn&#x27;t leave my skin oily and made my skin super soft.</li>
            <li>I think I was lured by the name (Purity sounds so dang pure).  </li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t remove all of my eye makeup on its own, so I have started applying a little bit of jojoba oil to my eyes to loosen the makeup there before I use this cleansing oil.  </li>
            <li>Really gets the makeup off.</li>
            <li>I really like this cleansing oil.  </li>
            <li>I purchased it to gently remove my makeup and cleanse my face every night.  </li>
            <li>That seems to work really well, and the cleansing oil removes the jojoba oil with no problem.  </li>
            <li>I really like this product.</li>
            <li>I really really like this.  </li>
            <li>but that really doesn&#x27;t bother me.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t really have to use much and it removes everything.</li>
            <li>and I received it very promptly.</li>
            <li>I find I don&#x27;t really use it much</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>As a woman, I want to keep a little more oil to my skin to help with moisture and elasticity to help prevent aging quicker.  </li>
            <li>It normally retails for about 20 dollars in store but was 44 dollars on Amazon.</li>
            <li>I like to try new things.  </li>
            <li>It removes my makeup well and it leaves my face feeling very soft but not greasy.</li>
            <li>It completely emulsifies in water!  </li>
            <li>read: am too lazy) to take my makeup off for bed, and the idea of being able to lie in bed and not use water to remove my makeup seemed appealing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It makes it so soft and no breakouts!</li>
            <li>product is the real deal, it smells and feels the same as the stuff I normally get from Macy&#x27;s.</li>
            <li>My face is soft and moisturized after I rinse off this cleansing oil.  </li>
            <li>Leaves my skin perfectly soft.</li>
            <li>I am medium as far as oil/dry.  </li>
            <li>That said, I tend to wash again with a gentle facial cleanser to remove traces of the melted make up.</li>
            <li>This cleansing oil cleans well and does not leave my skin feeling stripped of it&#x27;s natural hydrating oils.</li>
            <li>This lightweight oil sweeps away all the grime from your face and leaves it soft.  </li>
            <li>Good bye to dry days and tight dry skin....</li>
            <li>This sometimes allows water to get into the bottle (and I swear I&#x27;m trying to use it like a normal person, not just dumping water all over it or anything), and this oil changes from clear to white when it comes into contact with water.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s definitely worth the money, I could see this lasting a long time.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s $8 more than DHC&#x27;s and $40 less than Shu Umera&#x27;s with a pleasing, water-like texture (be careful, it pours out quickly and you need less than a quarter-sized amount) that completely and effortlessly removes all make-up and dirt/oil to leave your skin cleansed and</li>
            <li>, I prefer the older version of purity made simple to this newer version.</li>
            <li>face feels soft after using and not dry.</li>
            <li>I recommend this to my friends who have combo, normal or dry skin.</li>
            <li>Completely the opposite of what everyone grew up hearing, I can only imagine.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s visually unattractive, but the white parts turn back to clear overnight.  </li>
            <li>Just the right amount of foaming after water is applied and no breakouts or excessive oiliness.</li>
            <li>This Philosophy Cleansing Oil never burns and it nourishes my dry, sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>Cleansing with oil takes a little getting used to; you certainly don&#x27;t get any lather or that squeaky clean/tight skin feeling, but makeup melts away and face feels moisturized.</li>
            <li>This is the only stuff so far that takes off ALL my makeup and actually makes my face feel clean with no residue or dryness left behind.</li>
            <li>Purity Made Simple classic face washes is one of the only ones I can use at any price range without breaking out (the other being the now-discontinued L&#x27;Oreal Skin Genesis face wash, the one that also removes eye makeup)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I thought I would try something other than my normal cleansing oil (DHC Deep Cleansing Oil).</li>

            <li> I thought I would try something other than my normal cleansing oil (DHC Deep Cleansing Oil).</li>
            <li> I have tried quite a few high end facial cleansers.  </li>
            <li> This is my fourth bottle, lasts a long time too.</li>
            <li> It is so nice to not have to use those irritating makeup remover cloths that hardly remove anything.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have occasional problems with facial redness, my skin is sensitive and it is dry year round.</li>
            <li> When I first ordered this product I was slightly skeptical because my skin is very sensitive and</li>
            <li> (it was a few dollars less) and see if I like it as much as Philosophy&#x27;s.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I prefer it over conventional soaps and cleansing with other oils alone (such as jojoba, avocado, or coconut oil).  </li>
            <li> a water-free removal method it falls a little short.</li>
            <li> I have never experienced any bad side effects from using this oil and I highly recommend it for cleansing dry, flaky and irritable skin that is sensitive, prone to occasional redness and year round dryness that mild Rosacea can cause.</li>
            <li> I have also just dried my face and used my regular moisturizer and the combo</li>
            <li> I rub it around on my face and eyes for about a minute or two, then I wet my hands and scrub my face down with the water and then all I have to do is rinse.</li>
            <li> rather it come in a pump bottle so that there is less chance of water getting into it when I&#x27;m using it.  </li>
            <li> The Purity Cleansing Oil doesn&#x27;t lather even slightly and it stings my eyes.</li>
            <li> I have dry skin and hate the tight, dry feeling I get after using some cleansers despite claims of being gentle and hydrating.  </li>
            <li> I was a little leery since my face can be oily sometimes.</li>
            <li> I can see this lasting for at least a few months so that would mean that it would end up being cheaper than the wipes you can get at the store.</li>
            <li> I just can&#x27;t get past the smell --  </li>
            <li> I am disappointed in the performance of this particular product.  </li>
            <li> It isn&#x27;t as thick and moisturizing as using olive oil or coconut oil</li>
            <li> Also the ingredients aren&#x27;t totally scary.</li>
            <li> This has a faint herbal like fragrance.</li>
            <li> You won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
            <li> So disappointed.</li>
            <li> I hated how I had to wash my face with soap after using those oils</li>

            <li> Love it!  Really gets the makeup off.</li>
            <li> I really like this cleansing oil.  I purchased it to gently remove my makeup and cleanse my face every night.  I prefer it over conventional soaps and cleansing with other oils alone (such as jojoba, avocado, or coconut oil).  I hated how I had to wash my face with soap after using those oils (I was primarily using them to remove makeup, so I really had to put a lot on my face), but this cleansing oil rinses cleanly away with water; no second washing needed!  It doesn&#x27;t remove all of my eye makeup on its own, so I have started applying a little bit of jojoba oil to my eyes to loosen the makeup there before I use this cleansing oil.  That seems to work really well, and the cleansing oil removes the jojoba oil with no problem.  My face is soft and moisturized after I rinse off this cleansing oil.  It is definitely a staple in my routine now, and I will continue to purchase it with no reservations.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only reason I rate it as four stars instead of five is that the container it comes in is not a pump container, but a squeeze cap.  This sometimes allows water to get into the bottle (and I swear I&#x27;m trying to use it like a normal person, not just dumping water all over it or anything), and this oil changes from clear to white when it comes into contact with water.  It&#x27;s visually unattractive, but the white parts turn back to clear overnight.  I would rather it come in a pump bottle so that there is less chance of water getting into it when I&#x27;m using it.  I may consider putting it into a different bottle in the future.</li>
            <li> I really like this product. I was a little leery since my face can be oily sometimes. I love the way it feels after I&#x27;m done. It removes make up easily, and it seems to balance my skin better than ordinary soap.</li>
            <li> This stuff is awesome. Makeup just melted off without any problems. I love all of the purity products. They&#x27;re very gentle.</li>
            <li> Love love love this facial cleanser. Leaves my skin perfectly soft. I recommend this to my friends who have combo, normal or dry skin.</li>
            <li> Due to my sensitivity  to most cleansing products, I&#x27;m doubly pleased to have found this cleansing product.  Not only does it do an excellent job, it doesn&#x27;t irritate your skin or eyes.</li>
            <li> I really really like this.  I know many try to get rid of oil, but I want a little more oil.  Thankfully I don&#x27;t have issues with breakouts.  I am medium as far as oil/dry.  As a woman, I want to keep a little more oil to my skin to help with moisture and elasticity to help prevent aging quicker.  I really like this product and love the light clean smell!  I have not issues with it getting all my makeup off.</li>
            <li> It isn&#x27;t as thick and moisturizing as using olive oil or coconut oil (I&#x27;m an avid &amp;#34;OCM-er&amp;#34; aka the Oil Cleansing Method). But its kind of nice still, lighter, and still moisturizing. It smells nice too, but that tells me there is probably added fragrance which I am not a fan of, but all well. I&#x27;ll take it to use at my cabin. Probably won&#x27;t re-purchase though, stick to my coconut oil with tea tree oil and lavender.</li>
            <li> This product melts off makeup, including waterproof mascara. When used as directed it rinses of leaving a feeling of moisture and never oiliness. That said, I tend to wash again with a gentle facial cleanser to remove traces of the melted make up. I have also just dried my face and used my regular moisturizer and the combo has never left me feeling greasy.</li>
            <li> I have tried quite a few high end facial cleansers.  I have dry skin and hate the tight, dry feeling I get after using some cleansers despite claims of being gentle and hydrating.  This cleansing oil cleans well and does not leave my skin feeling stripped of it&#x27;s natural hydrating oils.</li>
            <li> it is cheaper than others and the quality is good. I didn&#x27;t like the bottle thought, because the product would seep through...and I am a traveler.</li>
            <li> Liked the oily feeling of this cleanser and thought that it did its job as a cleanser.  I just can&#x27;t get past the smell --  It smells like bug spray.</li>
            <li> I have always used purity made simple, but when I found this oil I had to make a switch.  It does not leave your face oily at all.  It completely emulsifies in water!  Give it a try.  You won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
            <li> I had been hearing about oils being all the rage for cleansing so I figured I would try one.  It broke my face out within a week. I don&#x27;t use it as a cleanser anymore.</li>
            <li> When I first ordered this product I was slightly skeptical because my skin is very sensitive and almost every remover I&#x27;ve tried irritates my skin or my eyes. I was originally going to order MAC&#x27;s cleansing oil but even that irritates me. It normally retails for about 20 dollars in store but was 44 dollars on Amazon. So, after tons of research on this product I decided to give this a whirl. After the first try I was in love with it. I&#x27;ve read that some people don&#x27;t like it because it doesn&#x27;t have a pump like most others have but that really doesn&#x27;t bother me. I don&#x27;t really have to use much and it removes everything. I rub it around on my face and eyes for about a minute or two, then I wet my hands and scrub my face down with the water and then all I have to do is rinse. I am so impressed at how well this works. It&#x27;s definitely worth the money, I could see this lasting a long time. I&#x27;m super excited that it hasn&#x27;t irritated my skin or broke it out. I highly recommend this product. It is so nice to not have to use those irritating makeup remover cloths that hardly remove anything.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That is something I else I want to mention as well. I used to use 2 simple wipes every night to remove my makeup which ended up costing me about 12 dollars a month. I can see this lasting for at least a few months so that would mean that it would end up being cheaper than the wipes you can get at the store.</li>
            <li> It was reasonably priced, it smells nice, and it removes nearly all my makeup, including the waterproof stuff ;)</li>
            <li> This is the only stuff so far that takes off ALL my makeup and actually makes my face feel clean with no residue or dryness left behind. Also the ingredients aren&#x27;t totally scary. I use it nightly and I&#x27;m on my 3rd bottle (one bottle lasts me several months). I don&#x27;t like all Philosophy products, but really love this one.</li>
            <li> This is my second bottle and I like it. It does not leave any grease after washing. The oil is very light too.</li>
            <li> this doen&#x27;t clean your skin as well as i had thought.  it also makes your vision blurry for a bit.</li>
            <li> I have had oily skin for most of my life but as I get older it has become more &amp;#34;combination.&amp;#34; I received a sample of this and was completely blown away...it took off ALL of my makeup, didn&#x27;t leave my skin oily and made my skin super soft. I was so glad to find it on Amazon and at a great price, too.  I used the Purity gel (still have some) but for me , the oil is superior.</li>
            <li> I am baffled about why this product gets such great reviews. I thought I would try something other than my normal cleansing oil (DHC Deep Cleansing Oil). I think I was lured by the name (Purity sounds so dang pure).  I don&#x27;t even use a lot of eye makeup and no foundation at all.  The Purity Cleansing Oil doesn&#x27;t lather even slightly and it stings my eyes. I&#x27;d almost be willing to put up with that *if* it actually removed my makeup, which it only does halfheartedly.  I for sure need to use another cleanser to get rid of the smeared mascara. So disappointed. Thankfully I know what does work... The DHC Cleansing Oil may be tad bit heavier but it works like a dream. Just the right amount of foaming after water is applied and no breakouts or excessive oiliness. Best of all, no leftover make up whatsoever.</li>
            <li> I was eyeballing another makeup removing oil, but passed once I read the ingredients. Purity Made Simple classic face washes is one of the only ones I can use at any price range without breaking out (the other being the now-discontinued L&#x27;Oreal Skin Genesis face wash, the one that also removes eye makeup)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was drawn to this because sometimes I forget (read: am too lazy) to take my makeup off for bed, and the idea of being able to lie in bed and not use water to remove my makeup seemed appealing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product is the real deal, it smells and feels the same as the stuff I normally get from Macy&#x27;s. I know counterfeits are a big worry online.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As a water-free removal method it falls a little short. It takes many MANY cotton balls of this stuff to remove my caked-on whore paint. But, once the makeup is off it feels divine, and if you don&#x27;t wash it off like the bottle recommends you do afterwards, it also functions as a nice skin moisturizer. It&#x27;s not really a lazy solution since it takes more time to remove makeup then just getting out of bed and washing my face, but it is still really good stuff regardless</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been a decade-long fan of cleansing oil to remove make-up. I&#x27;ve tried DHC, Shu Umera and now Philosophy. It&#x27;s $8 more than DHC&#x27;s and $40 less than Shu Umera&#x27;s with a pleasing, water-like texture (be careful, it pours out quickly and you need less than a quarter-sized amount) that completely and effortlessly removes all make-up and dirt/oil to leave your skin cleansed and glowing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using Philosophy&#x27;s Purity Cleansing Oil for over two years and have ordered this item three or four times. I found Pre de Provence cleansing oil on Amazon but have yet to try it (it was a few dollars less) and see if I like it as much as Philosophy&#x27;s.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re on the fence about cleansing oil and fear it&#x27;ll cause blemishes - it won&#x27;t and you should absolutely try it for perfectly clean and balanced, glowing skin.</li>
            <li> I use this oil daily followed by a warm wash cloth....skin feels like buttah!  This is my fourth bottle, lasts a long time too.</li>
            <li> I love that this oil will take off my waterproof mascara as well as cleanse my skin.&lt;br /&gt;My face feels soft after using and not dry.</li>
            <li> This lightweight oil sweeps away all the grime from your face and leaves it soft.  I&#x27;ve been using this for about 6 months and have not had even one breakout.  It is superior to everything else.  I&#x27;ve been using cleansers for decades.</li>
            <li> This oil was well packaged and I received it very promptly. The bottle was full as it should have been and it has become a \\&quot;have-to-have\\&quot; staple for me. It removes my makeup well and it leaves my face feeling very soft but not greasy. I have occasional problems with facial redness, my skin is sensitive and it is dry year round. This Philosophy Cleansing Oil never burns and it nourishes my dry, sensitive skin. I have never experienced any bad side effects from using this oil and I highly recommend it for cleansing dry, flaky and irritable skin that is sensitive, prone to occasional redness and year round dryness that mild Rosacea can cause. My face is in great shape since I discovered this cleanser.</li>
            <li> This is great for your skin. It makes it so soft and no breakouts!</li>
            <li> What a concept, oil on the face. Completely the opposite of what everyone grew up hearing, I can only imagine. This stuff is totally awesome, taking off even the hardest traces of all make up, and your face is supple after you wash. Good bye to dry days and tight dry skin....</li>
            <li> Love this stuff!  After using it my face feels so silky smooth.  I definitely would recommend to people with skin on the drier side.</li>
            <li> This is a great product at a great price. Cleansing with oil takes a little getting used to; you certainly don&#x27;t get any lather or that squeaky clean/tight skin feeling, but makeup melts away and face feels moisturized. This has a faint herbal like fragrance. I&#x27;ll be back for more!</li>
            <li> I like to try new things.  I am disappointed in the performance of this particular product.  I find I don&#x27;t really use it much, I prefer the older version of purity made simple to this newer version.</li>
            <li> I like how my skin feels after using this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I didn&#x27;t like was that it didn&#x27;t remove mascara and instead it ended up below my eyes where I had to use a second cleaner to get it off.</li>
