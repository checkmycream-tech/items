            <li>However, it holds well and smells very nice.</li>
            <li>Smells great and makes hair feel and look good</li>
            <li>Not as great as I thought it would be, still good though.</li>
            <li>Best part is, amazon consistently has the best pricing!</li>
            <li>I guess when you&#x27;re the best you can justify charging the most.</li>
            <li>Great product, good hold.</li>
            <li>We love this - best price is always on amazon</li>
            <li>I helps to keep your hair in place and has a pleasant smell.&lt;br /&gt;For</li>
            <li>and it holds good and smell nice too!</li>
            <li>Zero hold doesn&#x27;t smell good at all, it reminds me of oven cleaner.  </li>
            <li>Good Product.</li>
            <li>Good deal, good product.</li>
            <li>Looks good but ....</li>
            <li>Good product.</li>
            <li>This is good product if you are looking for pomade.</li>
            <li>Good hold without the greasy look.  </li>
            <li>Good price also.</li>
            <li>smells good, and does the job.</li>
            <li>This product is good for hold that doesn&#x27;t make your hair rigid.</li>
            <li>Me to, honestly good product</li>
            <li>I loved this stuff.</li>
            <li>Good for the money.</li>
            <li>Shine makes hair looks good and holds it in position.  </li>
            <li>Once hair dries it looks good.</li>
            <li>what product is good for what hair?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Get my hair fairly damp, work the Fiber in, and it would give me good hold...</li>
            <li>And the Fiber is fairly sticky...</li>
            <li>so your hair needs to be fairly damp to work it in, but then it doesn&#x27;t want to stay</li>
            <li>Loved this product for years, good price on Amazon.</li>
            <li>this stuff looks about as good as a fat chick in a modeling photo.  </li>
            <li>It has a good scent.</li>
            <li>but I didn&#x27;t like it as good as the Crew Pomade.  </li>
            <li>Crew Pomade smells good</li>
            <li>As a guy, I like to style my fair but without the shine or stiffness of gel.</li>
            <li>good stuff to use to control your hair when combing.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a nice pomade with great shine and control, without being sticky.  </li>
            <li>good stuff.</li>
            <li>Good product.  </li>
            <li>but you do need to finish off with a good hair spray(that applies to ANY pomade).&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>You are good for about 6 hrs</li>
            <li>Surprisingly, my hair feels &amp;#34;softer&amp;#34; to the touch.  </li>
            <li>Good stuff, just a bit pricey.</li>
            <li>Great for keeping your hair nice and shiny</li>
            <li>My hair make good now</li>
            <li>It good</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s as good as it has always been.</li>
            <li>This pomade has a good hold without making your hair look &#x27;too gelled&#x27;.  </li>
            <li>Also smells good, which is a bonus.  </li>
            <li>A good choice</li>
            <li>but it was not as good.</li>
            <li>Good hold.</li>
            <li>It smells good, not greasy, and gives a good medium hold.</li>
            <li>Well I think good</li>
            <li>Moldable hair after applied, doesnt smell so good, oily smell</li>
            <li>what product is good for what hair?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Get my hair fairly damp, work the Fiber in, and it would give me good hold...</li>
            <li>And the Fiber is fairly sticky...</li>
            <li>so your hair needs to be fairly damp to work it in, but then it doesn&#x27;t want to stay</li>
            <li>Honestly, the Pomade is great.</li>
            <li>but it doesnt smells really good.</li>
            <li>It leaves my hair smelling delicious and looking super sleek..</li>
            <li>Very satisfied.</li>
            <li>has great hold and a somehow satisfying scent.</li>
            <li>Very Pleased.</li>
            <li>Love this product!  </li>
            <li>Love this product!</li>
            <li>love this!</li>
            <li>Great smell, easy to wash out, and holds all day.</li>
            <li>Smells great, works well, washes out easily.</li>
            <li>It is light and silky and it smells great.</li>
            <li>Good and better price.</li>
            <li>Smells good, work better.</li>
            <li>It is nice to find it on Amazon at a cheaper price.</li>
            <li>Has a nice hold.</li>
            <li>Worked well, gave my hair a nice shine.</li>
            <li>It also holds hair nicely without the use of hair spray.</li>
            <li>Gives a nice shine to the my hair</li>
            <li>nice product with nice smell...</li>
            <li>Product arrived as promised, nicely packed.</li>
            <li>Nice not too sticky.</li>
            <li>Never had this kind of experience when purchased from a retail store.</li>
            <li>just nice.</li>
            <li>nice guy</li>
            <li>Does not offer a good hold for more than 5 minutes</li>
            <li>Started using this and liked it.</li>
            <li>so it didn&#x27;t keep it up as I would have liked, but</li>
            <li>It gave it nice texture and if your looking for any pomade this is the one to shoot for.</li>
            <li>It smells really nice too.</li>
            <li>Nice pomade.</li>
            <li>Good and reputable company and site.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s kind of fro-y and frizzy.  </li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re looking for a pomade for a greaser-style look then stick with Layrite or Suavecito, but if you want a really nice product to style your hair that won&#x27;t leave flakes or clumps after then this is for you.</li>
            <li>For me, that shinier look is nice if I&#x27;m going to a wedding, or dressing up...that sort of thing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Works great, doesn&#x27;t stay in your hair for days, smells good, and the price is right.</li>
            <li>The first can of pomade I got had a nice opaque color that smelled really good and had a great hold in my hair.</li>
            <li>Best product I have found for my high humidity (Miami) environment with my wavy/curly hair that just waits for an opportunity to frizz out.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t take much to get a great hold and it has a good scent.</li>
            <li>holds well, smells good and washes out easy.</li>
            <li>Very easy to wash off.</li>
            <li>Love this and the price is better at amazon!</li>
            <li>Used it for years and still just as happy with Crew as I was the first time!</li>
            <li>Good product, very light, easy to wash from it,</li>
            <li>The best way I can describe the smell is like an old book or a library.</li>
            <li>The best part about this product is it washes out completely when shampooed.</li>
            <li>This pomade is pretty good, nice smell and changes the color of my brown hair a nice brighter color.</li>
            <li>it was more of a matte finish which might be nice for some, but too many flakes.</li>
            <li>Smell is mild and pleasant.</li>
            <li>I clean it up, then my hair is good to go the rest of the day.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s good for what it is and the price is right !</li>
            <li>Great Service and the item was exactly as described.</li>
            <li>Just how it&#x27;s described it&#x27;s a really great product first time using</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t stand up to sweat but other than that it is a good product that gets my hair to look and smell great!</li>
            <li>The best part of it is the smell, the smell is like a very manly, clean smell.</li>
            <li>Definitely a strong hold for the day and has a nice smell to it as well.</li>
            <li>Enjoy this, not greasy, easy to use once it&#x27;s in my hair, no scent, keeps my hair looking good throughout the day.</li>
            <li>Good For Straight Hair!!</li>
            <li>Crew pomade is very good, but complete ly overpriced;</li>
            <li>Shine goes away if u run comb through your hair more the 4 or 5 times.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This is my husband&#x27;s favorite hair styling product and over the years I&#x27;ve started using it as well.  </li>
            <li>What we like the most is it&#x27;s texture.</li>
            <li>Way better...</li>
            <li>I wish I could give this more than 5 stars.  </li>
            <li>I like the matte look better</li>
            <li>He has bought it in the salon for much more.</li>
            <li>But the price is what really is appealing to me.</li>
            <li>I love this stuff</li>
            <li>It is much more costly at Target or Wal-mart.</li>
            <li>over all its ok</li>
            <li>I love this stuff.</li>
            <li>But I love the smell of it, too.</li>
            <li>sure that is a health hazard to some degree?</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m sure there&#x27;s better stuff out there.</li>
            <li>Price wayyyyyyyyy better than anywhere else .</li>
            <li>but I sure do what my hair to look like I haven&#x27;t washed in 7 days and then parted it?</li>
            <li>Well not at all satisfying.</li>
            <li>So please make sure you are not allergic to it.</li>
            <li>Amazon price is better than Salon price.</li>
            <li>Best for male hair.  </li>
            <li>One issue I have noticed is the top and sides of mine look like they&#x27;re drying out.</li>
            <li>Now the pomade has much more</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve gotten more compliments with it in than not.</li>
            <li>Great price and fast delivery</li>
            <li>I love the smell too.</li>
            <li>how i love this product  </li>
            <li>If I try and it still mostly does not impress I may just leave it as is</li>
            <li>I PROBABLY should give this 5 stars -- since I haven&#x27;t had anything better...</li>
            <li>So I just sprinkle some water on my hair and I am able to recomb it.  </li>
            <li>and they have the nerve to charge up to 5 times more than some better pomades.</li>
            <li>The product is gel form which is much better than the paste type.  </li>
            <li>Overall excellent product.</li>
            <li>Holds for a couple days, always looks the best on the second day.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t know why I needed 10 more words.</li>
            <li>This is my favorite Pomade.</li>
            <li>I have tried many through the years</li>
            <li>I love this stuff.</li>
            <li>This product adds a shine to your hair that makes it look more healthy.  </li>
            <li>Search for better.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s definitely not the best option for my hair type.  </li>
            <li>This american crew product is truly a great styling product and it smells good.</li>
            <li>I love this stuff.</li>
            <li>Ive also tried the forming cream which works better and lasts longer.</li>
            <li>Better than the fiber.</li>
            <li>Axe&#x27;s Pomade is cheaper, holds better, smells better,</li>
            <li>has a better shine, and isn&#x27;t greasy.</li>
            <li>Been using this product for many years.</li>
            <li>I love this, and so does my wifey.</li>
            <li>Fortunately, I love the smell this product gives off.</li>
            <li>but I absolutely love it.</li>
            <li>But if you need some control and healthy shine, buy this.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t buy this product :)</li>
            <li>Love this stuff.  </li>
            <li>more lift and control than others.  </li>
            <li>smells better too.</li>
            <li>Now the pomade has much more</li>
            <li>Girls love this product.</li>

            <li>I&#x27;ve tried a lot of different pomades and this is easily the best.</li>
            <li>If you want some pretty good, medium hold, water based pomade, give Suavesito a shot.  </li>
            <li>It does re-comb pretty good though.</li>
            <li>This stuff works pretty good</li>

            <li>MY HAIR IS TOO FINE FOR THIS PRODUCT, PROBABLY OK</li>
            <li>Holds better, and lasts longer than cheap product.</li>
            <li>I bought this stuff from whoever cut my hair like 10 years ago because this girl I liked said the word &amp;#34;pomade,&amp;#34; and she was pretty stylish.  </li>
            <li>It works best for me after I shower and my hair is damp, but not soaking wet.  </li>
            <li>Love the smell, enjoy the look.</li>
            <li>And most importantly, it washes off his hair and hands easily and leaves no residue.</li>
            <li>Must have, light and easy to travel with makes it even better</li>
            <li>/&gt;First order: clear color - very nice fragrent smell&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I kind of wish I picked the redkin instead, but I remembered after doing much research online that this got some pretty fair reviews.</li>
            <li>Definitely recommend, and keep up the good work guys!</li>

            <li>Easy application and all day hold.  </li>
            <li>it washes out of your fingers really easily.</li>
            <li>well washes out easily.</li>
            <li>For one, it washes out easy.</li>

            <li>Easy to rinse out.</li>
            <li>easy to work into hair.</li>
            <li>easy to wash out.</li>
            <li>so far so good makes my hair nice and shiny no buildup washes out quickly.</li>
            <li>The smell of this pomade is too strong.</li>
            <li>A bit too strong of a scent for me.</li>
            <li>My son hairs are fine texture and easy to style</li>
            <li>Bought this because a friend with beautiful shiny short hair uses it.</li>
            <li>great product, using it for yrs, a bit pricey but well worth it as the others dont compare and its not worth the savings to show up at work with goopy hair, with this product you can be one of the cool kids with great hair</li>
            <li>But still smelled and worked fine.</li>
            <li>Stores charge way too much and these prices are great and exactly what they should be.</li>
            <li>When I stopped using, I am fine.</li>
            <li>It works best when my hair is still a little damp.  </li>
            <li>But it does make my hair shiny and is not stiff or brittle at all, seems good for the hair.</li>
            <li>I really like the Pomade because it gives my hair a nice shine with a light hold.</li>
            <li>Ok, not really, but it is a great product that pairs well with some hairspray.</li>
            <li>So even though I rarely use it and my stylish friend doesn&#x27;t notice anymore</li>
            <li>Crew pomade is certainly not cheap but it is the best.</li>
            <li>shine and a light hold</li>
            <li>It smells great according to a former lady friend.</li>
            <li>It is a fantastic product.</li>
            <li>They smell great, and they are relatively inexpensive.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s fantastic but the value just isn&#x27;t there.  </li>
            <li>Fantastic product.</li>
            <li>It keeps my hair so smooth and it doesn&#x27;t get sticky.</li>
            <li>I even enjoy the smell.</li>
            <li>Overall I am happy and would recommend.</li>
            <li>This is one fantastic product.</li>
            <li>This is the 2nd purchase of this item and happy with it.</li>
            <li>They smell great, and they are relatively inexpensive.</li>
            <li>Is fairly light, hair still has movement.</li>
            <li>It also allows my hair to be very moldable and has a nice smell.  </li>
            <li>The product listed as pomade in the store is a clear gel that provides good all day hold.</li>
            <li>This gives me a good bit of control, but it keeps my hair soft.</li>
            <li>Leaves it soft and the hold is really good.</li>
            <li>Good natural shine.</li>
            <li>He needed a little convincing but once he tried it, he loved it!</li>
            <li>If you need a pomade right away, this product is carried at many retail stores.</li>
            <li>The color, texture, and consistency are very distinct.</li>
            <li>For example, you can have your hair fairly damp with the stickier (ie high hold) products, and still be able to work it in really well.</li>
            <li>For example, you can have your hair fairly damp with the stickier (ie high hold) products, and still be able to work it in really well.</li>
            <li>cause the texture was nice and the smell is pretty good as well, but don&#x27;t expect this to keep your hair above your head</li>
            <li>This does the trick but if you are looking for super strong hold</li>
            <li>I gave the product four stars because of the accuracy of the label (medium hold and high shine) and because of the amazing scent.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this product for a long time and it&#x27;s great.</li>
            <li>Its original, no imposter.</li>
            <li>I was not disappointed.</li>
            <li>but I have a long beard and this stuff is great for my beard.</li>
            <li>The only hair styling i have ever liked!</li>
            <li>decided to leave the rest of my original review below.</li>
            <li>I had a lot more hair, and because it&#x27;s a \\&quot;higher hold,\\</li>
            <li>I absolutely love American Crew&#x27;s Pomade, it&#x27;s great for classic cuts.</li>
            <li>Has a clean fragrance scent</li>
            <li>It washes out clean, which is the biggest reason I keep coming to it.</li>
            <li>you are like me, with curly hair and haven&#x27;t found a happy solution to control the curls while avoiding using multiple products, this is definitely worth a try.</li>
            <li>Not a super strong hold but smells nice and keeps my hair looking shiny and nice.  </li>
            <li>For me it&#x27;s worth the added cost of buying genuine.</li>
            <li>It also washes out quickly and cleanly.</li>
            <li>It has good shine but low hold.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve got longer hair on top so it can go fast, fyi.  </li>
            <li>Not sticky and gives a good shine to my short hair.</li>
            <li>I heard only good things about this product from a number of friends and when I started using it</li>
            <li>Cloudy color, not as good scent, leaves your hair greasy later in the day.  </li>
            <li>Offers stong hold and nice shine.</li>
            <li>After utilizing the American Crew Pomade, I was fairly dissatisfied.</li>
            <li>This stuff goes on clear and puts a nice hold on my hair.</li>
            <li>I used to use this for a while, and it was not bad.</li>
            <li>Not bad.</li>
            <li>The smell is strong at first but will go away.</li>
            <li>This is a god send for hair- malleable enough to have fun with, shiny enough to look pretty, rinses out thoroughly, smells great, good product for the gym or going out on the town.</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t even come close to how nice this is during application - its silky smooth, doesn&#x27;t leave hair greasy or stiff, nice shine and really helps add body and an overall great look.</li>
            <li>Good as top coat, but little else.</li>
            <li>I love the way the defining paste smells, matte looks nice, and it&#x27;s super easy to get that messy but controlled look.</li>
            <li>There is a mild scent</li>
            <li>Also makes my hair look/feel super greasy.</li>
            <li>It is easily able to be manipulated throughout the day if need be and can be applied to achieve many different desired results.  </li>
            <li>shipped quickly</li>
            <li>Excellent product, was a different color than the last bit I bought, but it still worked!</li>
            <li>It showed up quickly.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to use too much in the front.</li>
            <li>I love this product, it smells so good has held my husbands hair in place for the past 7 years.</li>
            <li>Funny how the process changes over time!</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;ve got fine, straight hair....</li>
            <li>I finally found the sweetspot, a dab about a dime&#x27;s worth on my finger, rub it in my palms, warm it up, and apply to mildly damp hair.</li>
            <li>Its a great everyday hair styling product.</li>
            <li>you&#x27;re on the fence about this, try it; it&#x27;s worth every penny.</li>
            <li>Definitely worth it.</li>
            <li>Keeps that style lookin fresh af.</li>
            <li>Now something that is going to be on my body or hair that is not sealed honestly, is kinda gross.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Honestly I really would like to get this item directly from crew to give it an honest review.</li>
            <li>Definitely worth it for the price</li>
            <li>however it is a quality product and it is well worth a chance.</li>
            <li>Not great for when my hair gets longer and curly, but this is best pomade regardless.</li>
            <li>if you have money to spend, i&#x27;d say its worth it.</li>
            <li>Experiment and have fun,</li>
            <li>I guess it is worth the risk considering the price point.</li>
            <li>I use this every day and it seems to be the only product I can find that makes my hair look fuller, adds shine, and has a nice feel to it.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried some like Suavecito, which I think smells kind of funky personally, and this one just blows it right out of the water.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried other similar products but like this stuff the best</li>
            <li>It may be right for you, however.</li>
            <li>all day in the right shape, without the gel look</li>
            <li>Find it too be the right mixture of firmness and spreadablity.</li>
            <li>Price is right.</li>
            <li>Hopefully my experience will point you in the right direction.</li>
            <li>It is not sticky and washes right out with water in the shower.</li>
            <li>Has just the right amount of shine.</li>
            <li>Hopefully my experience will point you in the right direction.</li>
            <li>/&gt;UPDATE: Suavecito firm is amazing!</li>
            <li>The shine is also really nice, which is a big plus considering I have blonde hair, so it tends to make it &#x27;pop&#x27; more.  </li>
            <li>I wanted a little more spike and &amp;#34;verticalness&amp;#34; to my hair, so what I had to do was start drying it more.</li>
            <li>Personally, I think this product is best for dudes who need a little bit of control and some shine.</li>
            <li>I wanted a little more spike and \\&quot;verticalness\\&quot; to my hair, so what I had to do was start drying it more.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It will take me a while to learn to use it, but it looks pretty righteous when I get it right.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used four different American Crew wax/pomades, and they are all great.</li>
            <li>Overall, more than worth the price.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve used four different American Crew wax/pomades, and they are all great.</li>
            <li>The most critical review you&#x27;ll see here got it right.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very cheap compared to buying it from a store, and would definitely recommend it again!</li>
            <li>I was leaving my hair fairly damp, and putting the pomade into that didn&#x27;t give it much hold at all (though depending the style you want...like a more traditional mad men kind of look without a lot of spike, then that would be fine).</li>
            <li>I was leaving my hair fairly damp, and putting the pomade into that didn&#x27;t give it much hold at all (though depending the style you want...like a more traditional mad men kind of look without a lot of spike, then that would be fine).</li>
            <li>Seriously, the best hair product that I&#x27;ve bought so far.</li>
            <li>Water-based, goes on clean, washes out clean, has a nice subtle perfume to it, and it&#x27;s made from some pretty agreeable ingrediants.</li>
            <li>While expensive, Amazon has the best price I have found anywhere.</li>
            <li>Product works well and has a nice wet look when applied.</li>
            <li>Just don&#x27;t use too much at one time or your hair will look bullet proof!</li>
            <li>First time using a pomade.</li>
            <li>So glad I checked them out prior to handing them to my son.</li>
            <li>someone with hair like mine, the medium hold acts like more of a LOW hold.</li>
            <li>exactly what I was looking for in a pomade.</li>
            <li>First of all, the gel does not do what it is supposed to do well.</li>
            <li>and I wasn&#x27;t used to this at first.</li>
            <li>But before you give up on any one product, vary the dampness of your hair first.</li>
            <li>this was the first time i ordered this product online.</li>
            <li>If gets windy or hot it falls on you.</li>
            <li>Suave used to make a water based pomade similar to this one for $3 that smelled better and held about 4 times stronger.</li>
            <li>Barber used this on me for the first time a couple haircuts ago, it adds just a touch of hold and shine for my style.  </li>
            <li>The hold is only okay</li>
            <li>Could definitely be not as expensive.  </li>
            <li>I love the American Crew Pomade!!!</li>
            <li>Be aware:</li>
            <li>but when it&#x27;s in somewhere hot</li>
            <li>Do not leave open for more than a day or it hardens.</li>
            <li>Great Product, delivery was slow.</li>
            <li>It was the first pomade I ever used.</li>
            <li>I bought this product from Target for a much higher price than Amazon ($20).</li>
            <li>It is exactly what he likes to use in his hair.</li>
            <li>(tip for murray&#x27;s: run hot water into or over the tin to soften it.</li>
            <li>I was in and open top Jeep</li>
            <li>It gives a low hold(unless caked on), and a healthy, satin shine.</li>
            <li>This is my first time using this product.</li>
            <li>this is the same product sold in many mens haircut stores.</li>
            <li>I love this pomade, there are times where it feels a bit too greasy, but it&#x27;s because I put more in than usual as my hair gets longer.</li>
            <li>and I wasn&#x27;t used to this at first.</li>
            <li>But before you give up on any one product, vary the dampness of your hair first.</li>
            <li>It smells good, does not leave a greasy feeling and has a firm</li>
            <li>I like it more because it washes out much easier but still has the same hold.</li>
            <li>It has a really nice scent, not too strong but not too subtle either.  </li>
            <li>containers are pretty large</li>
            <li>I have tried so many gels, waxes, mousses,  and other products to keep my hair under control without making it too stiff, greasy, or crusty, and  American Crew is the perfect one.</li>
            <li>I end up using very little and get good results.  </li>
            <li>Moisture, ok smell, and seems to hide the grey in my brown hair as an additional benefit.</li>
            <li>If you have long and/or curly hair, this stuff will work well to give some control and make it look healthy.</li>
            <li>The scent is nice, but is not a real pomade in the classic sense.</li>
            <li>I especially like that it is water soluble, so is easy to  wash out.</li>
            <li>This product puts me nicely in the middle, and leaves my hair controlled throughout the day while retaining a nice finish (slight luster, but not wet) and without a feeling of residue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve also (intentionally) bought cheap knock-off versions in the past to see if the genuine product is really worth the price.</li>
            <li>It gives the hair some hold (hence the medium on the label), and does give a very high shine.</li>
            <li>That stuff is REALLY sticky...which is fine for short hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>That stuff is REALLY sticky...which is fine for short hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Fast shiiping</li>
            <li>This one help me to get away from that but still doing the job keeping my hair straight.</li>
            <li>Well, it worked great, and my hair was totally styled, and that girl thought I was pretty slick.  </li>
            <li>A pea sized amount of this product will hold his hair straight for his work day and into his work out at the gym.</li>
            <li>It really washes out like there is nothing in your hair at all, I don&#x27;t know how that works</li>
            <li>It doesnt really hold just gives your hair</li>
            <li>If you use too much your hair will become too greasy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and I don&#x27;t have to use much either.  </li>
            <li>It keeps the shape very well, without making the hair all crispy and dry.&lt;br /</li>
            <li>but if you don&#x27;t like the smell of old man, then this may not be worth it for you.</li>
            <li>The hold becomes even MORE pronounced, but it also becomes harder to work into the hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Fast shipping.</li>
            <li>He absolutely loves it.</li>
            <li>Shipment was fast and I ran into no problems.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It isn&#x27;t that much cheaper than at the grocery store, but I&#x27;ll keep buying online to save $5.</li>
            <li>It is also much cheaper in a 2-pack on Amazon than buying from target or elsewhere</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t hold very well</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the real deal.  </li>
            <li>So I dabble a bit in, comb, and I am ready to go.</li>
            <li>For some reason, it&#x27;s no longer available locally - Amazon Prime to the rescue.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Did I really just type that?</li>
            <li>He really likes it.</li>
            <li>use VERY sparingly.)</li>
            <li>Just don&#x27;t use too much.</li>
            <li>if your hair is straight like mine.</li>
            <li>Buyer ships lightening fast.</li>
            <li>The hold becomes even MORE pronounced, but it also becomes harder to work into the hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t tried many other products, but this does beat out Sauve Pomade and Crew Fiber.</li>
            <li>It claims to be a &amp;#34;pomade&amp;#34;, but this stuff is nothing more than solidified gel when compared to other waterbased pomades.</li>
            <li>Much much better than Axe or the other cheaper brands i&#x27;ve used over the years.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t get this expecting a super firm hold, but it&#x27;s great if you just need a little help</li>
            <li>long worked fine...</li>
            <li>Paid a couple dollars more than the usual discounts but they were worth it.</li>
            <li>long worked fine...</li>
            <li>much prefer the clear version I got on my first order.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very brand loyal to American Crew.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very brand loyal to American Crew.</li>
            <li>Better than average.</li>
            <li>My hair is wavy and this product certainly keeps the waves in the hair (which is something I usually do not like).</li>
            <li>Not great hold, probably good for people with straight hair.</li>
            <li>Decent product.</li>
            <li>Not any better than the Axe product, just way more expensive.</li>
            <li>It will even do a decent slickback if you have an undercut, but I would bring a comb to fix it.</li>
            <li>Haven&#x27;t used this particular jar yet</li>
            <li>but it always did a decent job.  </li>
            <li>This is a decent product.</li>
            <li>It even has decent hold</li>
            <li>Have been using Crew Pomade for past 6 years, hair looks fresh washed most of the day and the hair feels soft on touch.</li>
            <li>Good shine, but weak hold.</li>
            <li>Oh, and has a nice, fresh, subtle manly scent!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s pricey but high quality.  </li>
            <li>The product does what it says it will - medium hold, high shine.</li>
            <li>It does give your hair high shine like it</li>
            <li>HIGHLY RECOMMEND</li>
            <li>Not too greasy, doesnt melt down forehead, rinses out easily in the shower, very versatile.</li>
            <li>but it is being discontinued and getting harder to fine.</li>
            <li>a little too sticky for my taste, i tried the bedhead product and like it better</li>
            <li>I just use a little bit and it makes my hairs do hair things appropriately.</li>
            <li>a little better pricing.</li>
            <li>Now as my preferred style is a slickback I think I would like something with a little more hold</li>
            <li>/&gt;BUT -- I keep thinking that there SHOULD be something a little LIGHTER and better..</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re oil based which takes a little time to get used to, but after a week you&#x27;ll be glad you switched.</li>
            <li>Gives my hair a little shine, and it looks more &amp;#34;alive&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li>Clearly the the real deal.</li>
            <li>But the product is white instead of clear, most likely because it has been dehydrated.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s own however, because I have extremely thick hair</li>
            <li>Oh well, I will still try and look cool for as long as I can!</li>
            <li>The American Crew Pomade has just the right amount of hold and, used sparingly, lasts all day without being too shiny or feeling greasy.</li>
            <li>Now, I blow dry my hair bone dry, and then use the defining paste (matte, and holds good with just a tiny spritz of hairspray).</li>
            <li>didn&#x27;t buy on amazon and paid about $18 I think, but that is pretty much standard for any decent pomade product.&lt;br /&gt;Give</li>
            <li>It applies smoothly and doesn&#x27;t cause chunking like other pomade that I&#x27;ve used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The Sauve was nice, but didn&#x27;t last as long and didnt leave the same look..</li>
            <li>It has a medium hold with high shine which is cool if you want hair that looks wet all the time.</li>
            <li>, I bought a new can of this because it did whatever it is</li>
            <li>I had never used pomade until I started going to a new barber and got an undercut.</li>
            <li>almost gone containers rolled them together and placed into a new one.&lt;br /&gt;Now on to the quality of product I received.</li>
            <li>I have really thick coarse hair and the Pomade works perfect for keeping my hair in place with spiking the front and keeping the sides down.</li>
            <li>Even though this is considered a men&#x27;s product, I&#x27;ve been using it on my short pixie hair style for several years for just a bit of control and fantastic shine.  </li>
            <li>It had a weird color from what it should really look like, but still works good.</li>
            <li>not as much hold as you might think, your hair has to be pretty long for it to work.</li>
            <li>If you want just a natural hold with high shine</li>
            <li>I have longer curly hair (similar to Richard Madden for reference), and using this on ever so slightly damp hair mixed with a little argan oil has been perfect for my needs.</li>
            <li>but I personally think the Defining Paste is awesome for matte, and forming cream if you want a little bit of shine (but it&#x27;s harder to work into your bone dry hair, and doesn&#x27;t smell as good).&lt;br</li>
            <li>One of my favorite features is that it does not make you hair feel stiff, rather, hair feels natural while remaining as you styled it .</li>
            <li>Also, as with a lot of products, apply it in the back first.</li>
            <li>I started trying their Fiber product on that short hair, and it worked pretty well.</li>
            <li>I started trying their Fiber product on that short hair, and it worked pretty well.</li>
            <li>My hair is fairly manageable (Straight, short and thin).</li>
            <li>Also, when i allowed the product to return to a more leveled state, it seemed as if there was some product missing and that it was only partial filled.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been buying this exact Pomade for the last 7 years, and I know that it should be mostly clear with an ever-so-slight amber tint.  </li>
            <li>It goes well through dry hair and has a decent enough hold to pull into a clean bun or ponytail.</li>
            <li>I had a lot more hair, and because it&#x27;s a &amp;#34;higher hold,&amp;#34; it actually started to weigh my hair down.</li>
            <li>Actually will keep pretty much the style over night and into the next day without the sticky - glue feel.</li>
            <li>I have been using this product for several years, and will certainly continue to do so.</li>
            <li>product feels very thick when you scoop it out and rub it on your hands, but when run through damp hair, thins out nicely.</li>
            <li>Someone clearly opened them both and swiped them to test out the texture.</li>
            <li>The gel should be clear with a shade of gold.  </li>
            <li>I need to be clear about this.</li>
            <li>The clear pomade that made Crew.</li>
            <li>I miss the clear version</li>
            <li>Mine seems to be clear</li>
            <li>It was either way too much or not enough to hold my hair.  </li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t make hair appear greasy or stuck, but instead looks mostly natural.</li>
            <li>The product&#x27;s not heavy, never leaves my hair greasy or sticky feeling.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am a man with short straight hair</li>
            <li>/&gt;You will probably have to try a couple different products until you find the one you really like.</li>
            <li>Keeps your hair soft and natural feeling</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not spectacular, but it sure beats this stuff.</li>
            <li>I have been using this product since my early 20&#x27;s</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s really the only hair product that I like.  </li>
            <li>Leaves hair extremely soft when washed out.</li>
            <li>She says it makes her hair soft.</li>
            <li>Others argue that it is naturally a thicker paste as Pomade.</li>
            <li>Personally I prefer Axe&#x27;s Pomade which is much thicker and doesn&#x27;t clump.</li>
            <li>I also have some left over forming cream, and it works really well too, just gives the hair a shinier look.</li>
            <li>blow dry the hair in the front up, blow dry the rest totally dry, put some defining paste in my palm, rub my hands together vigorously and warm it up, and then work it into my hair.</li>
            <li>/&gt;You will probably have to try a couple different products until you find the one you really like.</li>
            <li>If you use pomade daily as I do the extra price is worth it.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re curious about it, it&#x27;s definitely worth trying it for the price.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Before I move onto the Pomade, the other thing to consider is...varying the dampness of your hair prior to the product will have a HUGE effect on how it works.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Before I move onto the Pomade,the other thing to consider is...varying the dampness of your hair prior to the product will have a HUGE effect on how it works.</li>
            <li>This Product came half full and didn&#x27;t look legit....</li>
            <li>However, I recently had a hair stylist tell me to try other products because my hair is very dense and boy was she right.  </li>
            <li>hold of the product last all day and has a nice subtle scent to it.</li>
            <li>No mess.</li>
            <li>The genuine American Crew pomade should be clear with a slight amber tint.</li>
            <li>Decent product overall.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m pretty sure this is fake and/or expired.</li>
            <li>does the job for a decent price, however leaves white residue in hair in the form of flakes.</li>
            <li>my hair really short, I was using their \\&quot;classic wax,\\&quot; which they no longer make.</li>
            <li>For short hair, use the high hold products with damp hair.</li>
            <li>Obviously doesn&#x27;t do well in high sunlight or heat.</li>
            <li>For short hair, use the high hold products with damp hair.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended product, It can cause acne if left on overnight</li>
            <li>Very dense, lasts a long time&lt;br</li>
            <li>It holds my hair really well considering my hair type, and I don&#x27;t have to mess with it throughout the whole day.  </li>
            <li>This is hands down the best smelling pomade for sure, the only thing is the hold is terrible.</li>
            <li>I used the normal amount that I would use with other pomades and even thought about adding more in even though that usually doesn&#x27;t help with pomades, but decided against it as it already made my hair look like it did coming out of a shower.</li>
            <li>If they stop making it I will probably just shave my head rather than try to find another hair product that can live up to the American Crew standard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The new stuff looks like lotion and leaves white residue on my hair.</li>
            <li>This is a new style of pomade that American Crew puts out.</li>
            <li>The cheaper versions are typically more sticky, have a different (less desirable) smell, and leave white traces in your hair, similar to what I received from this merchant.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve started using a blow dryer to &amp;#34;train&amp;#34; my hair in the direction I want, and to get it much drier (not 100% dry, but maybe 75%).</li>
            <li>&quot; my hair in the direction I want, and to get it much drier (not 100% dry, but maybe 75%).</li>
            <li>The price has really gone up in the stores over the last several years, so I turned to Amazon</li>
            <li>The yellow version does not last on my hair the whole day and dries out my hair.</li>
            <li>I have really thick hair, and I thought since this product said \\&quot;medium hold\\&quot;, it wouldn&#x27;t be strong</li>
            <li>After about 10 (or more) years of occasional use, it started to get these little white dots mixed in it.  </li>
            <li>Like many companies, small price increases and smaller portions makes for bigger profits.</li>
            <li>There is no other like it.</li>
            <li>My husband loves this pomade and will use no other.</li>
            <li>Was looking for the Mad Men Don Draper look, and this is the only stuff that has great hold all day.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used American Crew&#x27;s pomade for several years now and found it to be of high qualify which reflects the pricing.&lt;br</li>
            <li>At first it was hard getting used to applying the product and how much I should be applying.</li>
            <li>and it wasnt a bad color like some others experienced.</li>
            <li>White instead of clear.</li>
            <li>The same products were clear and fragrant.  </li>
            <li>very versatile (if your hair is long enough).</li>
            <li>I keep my hair short (&amp;#60;2&amp;#34;) but just long enough to need something in it.</li>
            <li>Since this stuff is very dense, you have to be careful with the amount you use, it may take some practice if you&#x27;ve never used it before.</li>
            <li>Have to be careful with how much you use based on your hair type.</li>
            <li>JV Beauty Supply apparently does &amp;#34;quality checks&amp;#34; on everything that they ship.</li>
            <li>By itself it provides moderate hold and sculpting ability with a soft and shiny touch.</li>
            <li>such a soft managable hold.</li>
            <li>have very curly hair, and to go without product would result in an undesirable poof of fluff.</li>
            <li>Like the old commercial - just a dab will do you.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t have any distinct smell like &amp;#34;American Crew Styling Gel Firm Hold&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>I have hair that wants to puff out -- this stuff gives me the ability to control my hair and give it a soft, slightly moist look.</li>
            <li>Most other products that I have used (hair spray, gels) have either not worked well, or have worked but have then damaged my hair a few months later.</li>
            <li>With my flat straight hair about 5 inches long, this thing can&#x27;t even my hair away from the front of my face.</li>
            <li>I usually take a small amount, warm it up by rubbing my hands together and applying it to my hair.</li>
            <li>It feels a little &amp;#34;sticky&amp;#34; at first, but after combing and brushing, it leaves my hair manageable.  </li>
            <li>Less hold than what I had expected from a pomade, but that&#x27;s not necessarily bad.</li>
            <li>It leaves my short-medium length hair soft to the touch with a hold that lasts all day long.</li>
            <li>Do ypurself a favpr and buy layrite, suavecito, or Teddy Boy Original ( my favorite water base)</li>
            <li>The price is also hard to swallow, I agree with a few other posters, a few dollars less and this would be even better, but for this price I&#x27;ll try something even better for my particular hair type.</li>
            <li>My hair is a bit longer (under chin) and it seems to weigh it down too much.</li>
            <li>I purchased this brand of pomade last year and it came in the same shaped container, except that the pomade itself looked clear -- kinda like hair gel -- and didn&#x27;t have this white, cloudy look of my recent order.</li>
            <li>I have slightly wavy hair, not stick straight or curly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not a huge fan of Axe either, but it&#x27;s about twice as strong and half the price of American Crew.</li>
            <li>Small amount goes a long way, a small amount gives a nice shiny look to hair</li>
            <li>Although the price was very reasonable and the shipment prompt, I was not pleased with how I received the product.</li>

            <li> However, it holds well and smells very nice.</li>
            <li> Smells great and makes hair feel and look good</li>
            <li> Not as great as I thought it would be, still good though.</li>
            <li> Best part is, amazon consistently has the best pricing!</li>
            <li> I guess when you&#x27;re the best you can justify charging the most.</li>
            <li> Great product, good hold.</li>
            <li> We love this - best price is always on amazon</li>
            <li> I helps to keep your hair in place and has a pleasant smell.&lt;br /&gt;For</li>
            <li> and it holds good and smell nice too!</li>
            <li> Zero hold doesn&#x27;t smell good at all, it reminds me of oven cleaner.  </li>
            <li> Good Product.</li>
            <li> Good deal, good product.</li>
            <li> Looks good but ....</li>
            <li> Good product.</li>
            <li> This is good product if you are looking for pomade.</li>
            <li> Good hold without the greasy look.  </li>
            <li> Good price also.</li>
            <li> smells good, and does the job.</li>
            <li> This product is good for hold that doesn&#x27;t make your hair rigid.</li>
            <li> Me to, honestly good product</li>
            <li> I loved this stuff.</li>
            <li> Good for the money.</li>
            <li> Shine makes hair looks good and holds it in position.  </li>
            <li> Once hair dries it looks good.</li>
            <li> what product is good for what hair?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Get my hair fairly damp, work the Fiber in, and it would give me good hold...</li>
            <li> And the Fiber is fairly sticky...</li>
            <li> so your hair needs to be fairly damp to work it in, but then it doesn&#x27;t want to stay</li>
            <li> Loved this product for years, good price on Amazon.</li>
            <li> this stuff looks about as good as a fat chick in a modeling photo.  </li>
            <li> It has a good scent.</li>
            <li> but I didn&#x27;t like it as good as the Crew Pomade.  </li>
            <li> Crew Pomade smells good</li>
            <li> As a guy, I like to style my fair but without the shine or stiffness of gel.</li>
            <li> good stuff to use to control your hair when combing.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a nice pomade with great shine and control, without being sticky.  </li>
            <li> good stuff.</li>
            <li> Good product.  </li>
            <li> but you do need to finish off with a good hair spray(that applies to ANY pomade).&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> You are good for about 6 hrs</li>
            <li> Surprisingly, my hair feels &amp;#34;softer&amp;#34; to the touch.  </li>
            <li> Good stuff, just a bit pricey.</li>
            <li> Great for keeping your hair nice and shiny</li>
            <li> My hair make good now</li>
            <li> It good</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s as good as it has always been.</li>
            <li> This pomade has a good hold without making your hair look &#x27;too gelled&#x27;.  </li>
            <li> Also smells good, which is a bonus.  </li>
            <li> A good choice</li>
            <li> but it was not as good.</li>
            <li> Good hold.</li>
            <li> It smells good, not greasy, and gives a good medium hold.</li>
            <li> Well I think good</li>
            <li> Moldable hair after applied, doesnt smell so good, oily smell</li>
            <li> what product is good for what hair?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Get my hair fairly damp, work the Fiber in, and it would give me good hold...</li>
            <li> And the Fiber is fairly sticky...</li>
            <li> so your hair needs to be fairly damp to work it in, but then it doesn&#x27;t want to stay</li>
            <li> Honestly, the Pomade is great.</li>
            <li> but it doesnt smells really good.</li>
            <li> It leaves my hair smelling delicious and looking super sleek..</li>
            <li> Very satisfied.</li>
            <li> has great hold and a somehow satisfying scent.</li>
            <li> Very Pleased.</li>
            <li> Love this product!  </li>
            <li> Love this product!</li>
            <li> love this!</li>
            <li> Great smell, easy to wash out, and holds all day.</li>
            <li> Smells great, works well, washes out easily.</li>
            <li> It is light and silky and it smells great.</li>
            <li> Good and better price.</li>
            <li> Smells good, work better.</li>
            <li> It is nice to find it on Amazon at a cheaper price.</li>
            <li> Has a nice hold.</li>
            <li> Worked well, gave my hair a nice shine.</li>
            <li> It also holds hair nicely without the use of hair spray.</li>
            <li> Gives a nice shine to the my hair</li>
            <li> nice product with nice smell...</li>
            <li> Product arrived as promised, nicely packed.</li>
            <li> Nice not too sticky.</li>
            <li> Never had this kind of experience when purchased from a retail store.</li>
            <li> just nice.</li>
            <li> nice guy</li>
            <li> Does not offer a good hold for more than 5 minutes</li>
            <li> Started using this and liked it.</li>
            <li> so it didn&#x27;t keep it up as I would have liked, but</li>
            <li> It gave it nice texture and if your looking for any pomade this is the one to shoot for.</li>
            <li> It smells really nice too.</li>
            <li> Nice pomade.</li>
            <li> Good and reputable company and site.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s kind of fro-y and frizzy.  </li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re looking for a pomade for a greaser-style look then stick with Layrite or Suavecito, but if you want a really nice product to style your hair that won&#x27;t leave flakes or clumps after then this is for you.</li>
            <li> For me, that shinier look is nice if I&#x27;m going to a wedding, or dressing up...that sort of thing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Works great, doesn&#x27;t stay in your hair for days, smells good, and the price is right.</li>
            <li> The first can of pomade I got had a nice opaque color that smelled really good and had a great hold in my hair.</li>
            <li> Best product I have found for my high humidity (Miami) environment with my wavy/curly hair that just waits for an opportunity to frizz out.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t take much to get a great hold and it has a good scent.</li>
            <li> holds well, smells good and washes out easy.</li>
            <li> Very easy to wash off.</li>
            <li> Love this and the price is better at amazon!</li>
            <li> Used it for years and still just as happy with Crew as I was the first time!</li>
            <li> Good product, very light, easy to wash from it,</li>
            <li> The best way I can describe the smell is like an old book or a library.</li>
            <li> The best part about this product is it washes out completely when shampooed.</li>
            <li> This pomade is pretty good, nice smell and changes the color of my brown hair a nice brighter color.</li>
            <li> it was more of a matte finish which might be nice for some, but too many flakes.</li>
            <li> Smell is mild and pleasant.</li>
            <li> I clean it up, then my hair is good to go the rest of the day.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s good for what it is and the price is right !</li>
            <li> Great Service and the item was exactly as described.</li>
            <li> Just how it&#x27;s described it&#x27;s a really great product first time using</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t stand up to sweat but other than that it is a good product that gets my hair to look and smell great!</li>
            <li> The best part of it is the smell, the smell is like a very manly, clean smell.</li>
            <li> Definitely a strong hold for the day and has a nice smell to it as well.</li>
            <li> Enjoy this, not greasy, easy to use once it&#x27;s in my hair, no scent, keeps my hair looking good throughout the day.</li>
            <li> Good For Straight Hair!!</li>
            <li> Crew pomade is very good, but complete ly overpriced;</li>
            <li> Shine goes away if u run comb through your hair more the 4 or 5 times.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This is my husband&#x27;s favorite hair styling product and over the years I&#x27;ve started using it as well.  </li>
            <li> What we like the most is it&#x27;s texture.</li>
            <li> Way better...</li>
            <li> I wish I could give this more than 5 stars.  </li>
            <li> I like the matte look better</li>
            <li> He has bought it in the salon for much more.</li>
            <li> But the price is what really is appealing to me.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff</li>
            <li> It is much more costly at Target or Wal-mart.</li>
            <li> over all its ok</li>
            <li> I love this stuff.</li>
            <li> But I love the smell of it, too.</li>
            <li> sure that is a health hazard to some degree?</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m sure there&#x27;s better stuff out there.</li>
            <li> Price wayyyyyyyyy better than anywhere else .</li>
            <li> but I sure do what my hair to look like I haven&#x27;t washed in 7 days and then parted it?</li>
            <li> Well not at all satisfying.</li>
            <li> So please make sure you are not allergic to it.</li>
            <li> Amazon price is better than Salon price.</li>
            <li> Best for male hair.  </li>
            <li> One issue I have noticed is the top and sides of mine look like they&#x27;re drying out.</li>
            <li> Now the pomade has much more</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve gotten more compliments with it in than not.</li>
            <li> Great price and fast delivery</li>
            <li> I love the smell too.</li>
            <li> how i love this product  </li>
            <li> If I try and it still mostly does not impress I may just leave it as is</li>
            <li> I PROBABLY should give this 5 stars -- since I haven&#x27;t had anything better...</li>
            <li> So I just sprinkle some water on my hair and I am able to recomb it.  </li>
            <li> and they have the nerve to charge up to 5 times more than some better pomades.</li>
            <li> The product is gel form which is much better than the paste type.  </li>
            <li> Overall excellent product.</li>
            <li> Holds for a couple days, always looks the best on the second day.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t know why I needed 10 more words.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite Pomade.</li>
            <li> I have tried many through the years</li>
            <li> I love this stuff.</li>
            <li> This product adds a shine to your hair that makes it look more healthy.  </li>
            <li> Search for better.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s definitely not the best option for my hair type.  </li>
            <li> This american crew product is truly a great styling product and it smells good.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff.</li>
            <li> Ive also tried the forming cream which works better and lasts longer.</li>
            <li> Better than the fiber.</li>
            <li> Axe&#x27;s Pomade is cheaper, holds better, smells better,</li>
            <li> has a better shine, and isn&#x27;t greasy.</li>
            <li> Been using this product for many years.</li>
            <li> I love this, and so does my wifey.</li>
            <li> Fortunately, I love the smell this product gives off.</li>
            <li> but I absolutely love it.</li>
            <li> But if you need some control and healthy shine, buy this.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t buy this product :)</li>
            <li> Love this stuff.  </li>
            <li> more lift and control than others.  </li>
            <li> smells better too.</li>
            <li> Now the pomade has much more</li>
            <li> Girls love this product.</li>
            <li> so make sure to wash your forehead.</li>
            <li> right and after that this stuff is good</li>
            <li> its great for a sleek and classic hairstyle.</li>
            <li> Great price for what I feel is high end hair product.  </li>
            <li> Not to mention it makes your hair more shiny and new looking, which is great.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried a lot of different pomades and this is easily the best.</li>
            <li> If you want some pretty good, medium hold, water based pomade, give Suavesito a shot.  </li>
            <li> It does re-comb pretty good though.</li>
            <li> This stuff works pretty good</li>
            <li> If I skip a day without showering it still holds my beard pretty good.</li>
            <li> Love the item, odorless, not greasy, easy to use.</li>
            <li> Works best if your hands are dry and your hair is damp to wet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> MY HAIR IS TOO FINE FOR THIS PRODUCT, PROBABLY OK</li>
            <li> Holds better, and lasts longer than cheap product.</li>
            <li> I bought this stuff from whoever cut my hair like 10 years ago because this girl I liked said the word &amp;#34;pomade,&amp;#34; and she was pretty stylish.  </li>
            <li> It works best for me after I shower and my hair is damp, but not soaking wet.  </li>
            <li> Love the smell, enjoy the look.</li>
            <li> And most importantly, it washes off his hair and hands easily and leaves no residue.</li>
            <li> Must have, light and easy to travel with makes it even better</li>
            <li> /&gt;First order: clear color - very nice fragrent smell&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I kind of wish I picked the redkin instead, but I remembered after doing much research online that this got some pretty fair reviews.</li>
            <li> Definitely recommend, and keep up the good work guys!</li>
            <li> Easy to apply, and lasts all day.</li>
            <li> Easy to use.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s water based so it washes out easily with no buildup.</li>
            <li> Easy to rinse out and apply to the hair.  </li>
            <li> The texture of the pomade is easy to handle.</li>
            <li> I find that it easily washes out as well.</li>
            <li> Easy application and all day hold.  </li>
            <li> it washes out of your fingers really easily.</li>
            <li> well washes out easily.</li>
            <li> For one, it washes out easy.</li>
            <li> It holds well, and remolds easily when my hair gets messed up.</li>
            <li> Easy to rinse out.</li>
            <li> easy to work into hair.</li>
            <li> easy to wash out.</li>
            <li> so far so good makes my hair nice and shiny no buildup washes out quickly.</li>
            <li> The smell of this pomade is too strong.</li>
            <li> A bit too strong of a scent for me.</li>
            <li> My son hairs are fine texture and easy to style</li>
            <li> Bought this because a friend with beautiful shiny short hair uses it.</li>
            <li> great product, using it for yrs, a bit pricey but well worth it as the others dont compare and its not worth the savings to show up at work with goopy hair, with this product you can be one of the cool kids with great hair</li>
            <li> But still smelled and worked fine.</li>
            <li> Stores charge way too much and these prices are great and exactly what they should be.</li>
            <li> When I stopped using, I am fine.</li>
            <li> It works best when my hair is still a little damp.  </li>
            <li> But it does make my hair shiny and is not stiff or brittle at all, seems good for the hair.</li>
            <li> I really like the Pomade because it gives my hair a nice shine with a light hold.</li>
            <li> Ok, not really, but it is a great product that pairs well with some hairspray.</li>
            <li> So even though I rarely use it and my stylish friend doesn&#x27;t notice anymore</li>
            <li> Crew pomade is certainly not cheap but it is the best.</li>
            <li> shine and a light hold</li>
            <li> It smells great according to a former lady friend.</li>
            <li> It is a fantastic product.</li>
            <li> They smell great, and they are relatively inexpensive.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s fantastic but the value just isn&#x27;t there.  </li>
            <li> Fantastic product.</li>
            <li> It keeps my hair so smooth and it doesn&#x27;t get sticky.</li>
            <li> I even enjoy the smell.</li>
            <li> Overall I am happy and would recommend.</li>
            <li> This is one fantastic product.</li>
            <li> This is the 2nd purchase of this item and happy with it.</li>
            <li> They smell great, and they are relatively inexpensive.</li>
            <li> Is fairly light, hair still has movement.</li>
            <li> It also allows my hair to be very moldable and has a nice smell.  </li>
            <li> The product listed as pomade in the store is a clear gel that provides good all day hold.</li>
            <li> This gives me a good bit of control, but it keeps my hair soft.</li>
            <li> Leaves it soft and the hold is really good.</li>
            <li> Good natural shine.</li>
            <li> He needed a little convincing but once he tried it, he loved it!</li>
            <li> If you need a pomade right away, this product is carried at many retail stores.</li>
            <li> The color, texture, and consistency are very distinct.</li>
            <li> For example, you can have your hair fairly damp with the stickier (ie high hold) products, and still be able to work it in really well.</li>

            <li> cause the texture was nice and the smell is pretty good as well, but don&#x27;t expect this to keep your hair above your head</li>
            <li> This does the trick but if you are looking for super strong hold</li>
            <li> I gave the product four stars because of the accuracy of the label (medium hold and high shine) and because of the amazing scent.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for a long time and it&#x27;s great.</li>
            <li> Its original, no imposter.</li>
            <li> I was not disappointed.</li>
            <li> but I have a long beard and this stuff is great for my beard.</li>
            <li> The only hair styling i have ever liked!</li>
            <li> decided to leave the rest of my original review below.</li>
            <li> I had a lot more hair, and because it&#x27;s a \\&quot;higher hold,\\</li>
            <li> I absolutely love American Crew&#x27;s Pomade, it&#x27;s great for classic cuts.</li>
            <li> Has a clean fragrance scent</li>
            <li> It washes out clean, which is the biggest reason I keep coming to it.</li>
            <li> you are like me, with curly hair and haven&#x27;t found a happy solution to control the curls while avoiding using multiple products, this is definitely worth a try.</li>
            <li> Not a super strong hold but smells nice and keeps my hair looking shiny and nice.  </li>
            <li> For me it&#x27;s worth the added cost of buying genuine.</li>
            <li> It also washes out quickly and cleanly.</li>
            <li> It has good shine but low hold.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve got longer hair on top so it can go fast, fyi.  </li>
            <li> Not sticky and gives a good shine to my short hair.</li>
            <li> I heard only good things about this product from a number of friends and when I started using it</li>
            <li> Cloudy color, not as good scent, leaves your hair greasy later in the day.  </li>
            <li> Offers stong hold and nice shine.</li>
            <li> After utilizing the American Crew Pomade, I was fairly dissatisfied.</li>
            <li> This stuff goes on clear and puts a nice hold on my hair.</li>
            <li> I used to use this for a while, and it was not bad.</li>
            <li> Not bad.</li>
            <li> The smell is strong at first but will go away.</li>
            <li> This is a god send for hair- malleable enough to have fun with, shiny enough to look pretty, rinses out thoroughly, smells great, good product for the gym or going out on the town.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t even come close to how nice this is during application - its silky smooth, doesn&#x27;t leave hair greasy or stiff, nice shine and really helps add body and an overall great look.</li>
            <li> Good as top coat, but little else.</li>
            <li> I love the way the defining paste smells, matte looks nice, and it&#x27;s super easy to get that messy but controlled look.</li>
            <li> There is a mild scent</li>
            <li> Also makes my hair look/feel super greasy.</li>
            <li> It is easily able to be manipulated throughout the day if need be and can be applied to achieve many different desired results.  </li>
            <li> shipped quickly</li>
            <li> Excellent product, was a different color than the last bit I bought, but it still worked!</li>
            <li> It showed up quickly.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to use too much in the front.</li>
            <li> I love this product, it smells so good has held my husbands hair in place for the past 7 years.</li>
            <li> Funny how the process changes over time!</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;ve got fine, straight hair....</li>
            <li> I finally found the sweetspot, a dab about a dime&#x27;s worth on my finger, rub it in my palms, warm it up, and apply to mildly damp hair.</li>
            <li> Its a great everyday hair styling product.</li>
            <li> you&#x27;re on the fence about this, try it; it&#x27;s worth every penny.</li>
            <li> Definitely worth it.</li>
            <li> Keeps that style lookin fresh af.</li>
            <li> Now something that is going to be on my body or hair that is not sealed honestly, is kinda gross.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Honestly I really would like to get this item directly from crew to give it an honest review.</li>
            <li> Definitely worth it for the price</li>
            <li> however it is a quality product and it is well worth a chance.</li>
            <li> Not great for when my hair gets longer and curly, but this is best pomade regardless.</li>
            <li> if you have money to spend, i&#x27;d say its worth it.</li>
            <li> Experiment and have fun,</li>
            <li> I guess it is worth the risk considering the price point.</li>
            <li> I use this every day and it seems to be the only product I can find that makes my hair look fuller, adds shine, and has a nice feel to it.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried some like Suavecito, which I think smells kind of funky personally, and this one just blows it right out of the water.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried other similar products but like this stuff the best</li>
            <li> It may be right for you, however.</li>
            <li> all day in the right shape, without the gel look</li>
            <li> Find it too be the right mixture of firmness and spreadablity.</li>
            <li> Price is right.</li>
            <li> Hopefully my experience will point you in the right direction.</li>
            <li> It is not sticky and washes right out with water in the shower.</li>
            <li> Has just the right amount of shine.</li>
            <li> Hopefully my experience will point you in the right direction.</li>
            <li> /&gt;UPDATE: Suavecito firm is amazing!</li>
            <li> The shine is also really nice, which is a big plus considering I have blonde hair, so it tends to make it &#x27;pop&#x27; more.  </li>
            <li> I wanted a little more spike and &amp;#34;verticalness&amp;#34; to my hair, so what I had to do was start drying it more.</li>
            <li> Personally, I think this product is best for dudes who need a little bit of control and some shine.</li>
            <li> I wanted a little more spike and \\&quot;verticalness\\&quot; to my hair, so what I had to do was start drying it more.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It will take me a while to learn to use it, but it looks pretty righteous when I get it right.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used four different American Crew wax/pomades, and they are all great.</li>
            <li> Overall, more than worth the price.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve used four different American Crew wax/pomades, and they are all great.</li>
            <li> The most critical review you&#x27;ll see here got it right.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very cheap compared to buying it from a store, and would definitely recommend it again!</li>
            <li> I was leaving my hair fairly damp, and putting the pomade into that didn&#x27;t give it much hold at all (though depending the style you want...like a more traditional mad men kind of look without a lot of spike, then that would be fine).</li>

            <li> Seriously, the best hair product that I&#x27;ve bought so far.</li>
            <li> Water-based, goes on clean, washes out clean, has a nice subtle perfume to it, and it&#x27;s made from some pretty agreeable ingrediants.</li>
            <li> While expensive, Amazon has the best price I have found anywhere.</li>
            <li> Product works well and has a nice wet look when applied.</li>
            <li> Just don&#x27;t use too much at one time or your hair will look bullet proof!</li>
            <li> First time using a pomade.</li>
            <li> So glad I checked them out prior to handing them to my son.</li>
            <li> someone with hair like mine, the medium hold acts like more of a LOW hold.</li>
            <li> exactly what I was looking for in a pomade.</li>
            <li> First of all, the gel does not do what it is supposed to do well.</li>
            <li> and I wasn&#x27;t used to this at first.</li>
            <li> But before you give up on any one product, vary the dampness of your hair first.</li>
            <li> this was the first time i ordered this product online.</li>
            <li> If gets windy or hot it falls on you.</li>
            <li> Suave used to make a water based pomade similar to this one for $3 that smelled better and held about 4 times stronger.</li>
            <li> Barber used this on me for the first time a couple haircuts ago, it adds just a touch of hold and shine for my style.  </li>
            <li> The hold is only okay</li>
            <li> Could definitely be not as expensive.  </li>
            <li> I love the American Crew Pomade!!!</li>
            <li> Be aware:</li>
            <li> but when it&#x27;s in somewhere hot</li>
            <li> Do not leave open for more than a day or it hardens.</li>
            <li> Great Product, delivery was slow.</li>
            <li> It was the first pomade I ever used.</li>
            <li> I bought this product from Target for a much higher price than Amazon ($20).</li>
            <li> It is exactly what he likes to use in his hair.</li>
            <li> (tip for murray&#x27;s: run hot water into or over the tin to soften it.</li>
            <li> I was in and open top Jeep</li>
            <li> It gives a low hold(unless caked on), and a healthy, satin shine.</li>
            <li> This is my first time using this product.</li>
            <li> this is the same product sold in many mens haircut stores.</li>
            <li> I love this pomade, there are times where it feels a bit too greasy, but it&#x27;s because I put more in than usual as my hair gets longer.</li>
            <li> and I wasn&#x27;t used to this at first.</li>
            <li> But before you give up on any one product, vary the dampness of your hair first.</li>
            <li> It smells good, does not leave a greasy feeling and has a firm</li>
            <li> I like it more because it washes out much easier but still has the same hold.</li>
            <li> It has a really nice scent, not too strong but not too subtle either.  </li>
            <li> containers are pretty large</li>
            <li> I have tried so many gels, waxes, mousses,  and other products to keep my hair under control without making it too stiff, greasy, or crusty, and  American Crew is the perfect one.</li>
            <li> I end up using very little and get good results.  </li>
            <li> Moisture, ok smell, and seems to hide the grey in my brown hair as an additional benefit.</li>
            <li> If you have long and/or curly hair, this stuff will work well to give some control and make it look healthy.</li>
            <li> The scent is nice, but is not a real pomade in the classic sense.</li>
            <li> I especially like that it is water soluble, so is easy to  wash out.</li>
            <li> This product puts me nicely in the middle, and leaves my hair controlled throughout the day while retaining a nice finish (slight luster, but not wet) and without a feeling of residue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve also (intentionally) bought cheap knock-off versions in the past to see if the genuine product is really worth the price.</li>
            <li> It gives the hair some hold (hence the medium on the label), and does give a very high shine.</li>
            <li> That stuff is REALLY sticky...which is fine for short hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> That stuff is REALLY sticky...which is fine for short hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Fast shiiping</li>
            <li> This one help me to get away from that but still doing the job keeping my hair straight.</li>
            <li> Well, it worked great, and my hair was totally styled, and that girl thought I was pretty slick.  </li>
            <li> A pea sized amount of this product will hold his hair straight for his work day and into his work out at the gym.</li>
            <li> It really washes out like there is nothing in your hair at all, I don&#x27;t know how that works</li>
            <li> It doesnt really hold just gives your hair</li>
            <li> If you use too much your hair will become too greasy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t have to use much either.  </li>
            <li> It keeps the shape very well, without making the hair all crispy and dry.&lt;br /</li>
            <li> but if you don&#x27;t like the smell of old man, then this may not be worth it for you.</li>
            <li> The hold becomes even MORE pronounced, but it also becomes harder to work into the hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Fast shipping.</li>
            <li> He absolutely loves it.</li>
            <li> Shipment was fast and I ran into no problems.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It isn&#x27;t that much cheaper than at the grocery store, but I&#x27;ll keep buying online to save $5.</li>
            <li> It is also much cheaper in a 2-pack on Amazon than buying from target or elsewhere</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t hold very well</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the real deal.  </li>
            <li> So I dabble a bit in, comb, and I am ready to go.</li>
            <li> For some reason, it&#x27;s no longer available locally - Amazon Prime to the rescue.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Did I really just type that?</li>
            <li> He really likes it.</li>
            <li> use VERY sparingly.)</li>
            <li> Just don&#x27;t use too much.</li>
            <li> if your hair is straight like mine.</li>
            <li> Buyer ships lightening fast.</li>
            <li> The hold becomes even MORE pronounced, but it also becomes harder to work into the hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t tried many other products, but this does beat out Sauve Pomade and Crew Fiber.</li>
            <li> It claims to be a &amp;#34;pomade&amp;#34;, but this stuff is nothing more than solidified gel when compared to other waterbased pomades.</li>
            <li> Much much better than Axe or the other cheaper brands i&#x27;ve used over the years.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t get this expecting a super firm hold, but it&#x27;s great if you just need a little help</li>
            <li> long worked fine...</li>
            <li> Paid a couple dollars more than the usual discounts but they were worth it.</li>
            <li> long worked fine...</li>
            <li> much prefer the clear version I got on my first order.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very brand loyal to American Crew.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very brand loyal to American Crew.</li>
            <li> Better than average.</li>
            <li> My hair is wavy and this product certainly keeps the waves in the hair (which is something I usually do not like).</li>
            <li> Not great hold, probably good for people with straight hair.</li>
            <li> Decent product.</li>
            <li> Not any better than the Axe product, just way more expensive.</li>
            <li> It will even do a decent slickback if you have an undercut, but I would bring a comb to fix it.</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t used this particular jar yet</li>
            <li> but it always did a decent job.  </li>
            <li> This is a decent product.</li>
            <li> It even has decent hold</li>
            <li> Have been using Crew Pomade for past 6 years, hair looks fresh washed most of the day and the hair feels soft on touch.</li>
            <li> Good shine, but weak hold.</li>
            <li> Oh, and has a nice, fresh, subtle manly scent!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s pricey but high quality.  </li>
            <li> The product does what it says it will - medium hold, high shine.</li>
            <li> It does give your hair high shine like it</li>
            <li> HIGHLY RECOMMEND</li>
            <li> Not too greasy, doesnt melt down forehead, rinses out easily in the shower, very versatile.</li>
            <li> but it is being discontinued and getting harder to fine.</li>
            <li> a little too sticky for my taste, i tried the bedhead product and like it better</li>
            <li> I just use a little bit and it makes my hairs do hair things appropriately.</li>
            <li> a little better pricing.</li>
            <li> Now as my preferred style is a slickback I think I would like something with a little more hold</li>
            <li> /&gt;BUT -- I keep thinking that there SHOULD be something a little LIGHTER and better..</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re oil based which takes a little time to get used to, but after a week you&#x27;ll be glad you switched.</li>
            <li> Gives my hair a little shine, and it looks more &amp;#34;alive&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li> Clearly the the real deal.</li>
            <li> But the product is white instead of clear, most likely because it has been dehydrated.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s own however, because I have extremely thick hair</li>
            <li> Oh well, I will still try and look cool for as long as I can!</li>
            <li> The American Crew Pomade has just the right amount of hold and, used sparingly, lasts all day without being too shiny or feeling greasy.</li>
            <li> Now, I blow dry my hair bone dry, and then use the defining paste (matte, and holds good with just a tiny spritz of hairspray).</li>
            <li> didn&#x27;t buy on amazon and paid about $18 I think, but that is pretty much standard for any decent pomade product.&lt;br /&gt;Give</li>
            <li> It applies smoothly and doesn&#x27;t cause chunking like other pomade that I&#x27;ve used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The Sauve was nice, but didn&#x27;t last as long and didnt leave the same look..</li>
            <li> It has a medium hold with high shine which is cool if you want hair that looks wet all the time.</li>
            <li> , I bought a new can of this because it did whatever it is</li>
            <li> I had never used pomade until I started going to a new barber and got an undercut.</li>
            <li> almost gone containers rolled them together and placed into a new one.&lt;br /&gt;Now on to the quality of product I received.</li>
            <li> I have really thick coarse hair and the Pomade works perfect for keeping my hair in place with spiking the front and keeping the sides down.</li>
            <li> Even though this is considered a men&#x27;s product, I&#x27;ve been using it on my short pixie hair style for several years for just a bit of control and fantastic shine.  </li>
            <li> It had a weird color from what it should really look like, but still works good.</li>
            <li> not as much hold as you might think, your hair has to be pretty long for it to work.</li>
            <li> If you want just a natural hold with high shine</li>
            <li> I have longer curly hair (similar to Richard Madden for reference), and using this on ever so slightly damp hair mixed with a little argan oil has been perfect for my needs.</li>
            <li> but I personally think the Defining Paste is awesome for matte, and forming cream if you want a little bit of shine (but it&#x27;s harder to work into your bone dry hair, and doesn&#x27;t smell as good).&lt;br</li>
            <li> One of my favorite features is that it does not make you hair feel stiff, rather, hair feels natural while remaining as you styled it .</li>
            <li> Also, as with a lot of products, apply it in the back first.</li>
            <li> I started trying their Fiber product on that short hair, and it worked pretty well.</li>
            <li> I started trying their Fiber product on that short hair, and it worked pretty well.</li>
            <li> My hair is fairly manageable (Straight, short and thin).</li>
            <li> Also, when i allowed the product to return to a more leveled state, it seemed as if there was some product missing and that it was only partial filled.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been buying this exact Pomade for the last 7 years, and I know that it should be mostly clear with an ever-so-slight amber tint.  </li>
            <li> It goes well through dry hair and has a decent enough hold to pull into a clean bun or ponytail.</li>
            <li> I had a lot more hair, and because it&#x27;s a &amp;#34;higher hold,&amp;#34; it actually started to weigh my hair down.</li>
            <li> Actually will keep pretty much the style over night and into the next day without the sticky - glue feel.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for several years, and will certainly continue to do so.</li>
            <li> product feels very thick when you scoop it out and rub it on your hands, but when run through damp hair, thins out nicely.</li>
            <li> Someone clearly opened them both and swiped them to test out the texture.</li>
            <li> The gel should be clear with a shade of gold.  </li>
            <li> I need to be clear about this.</li>
            <li> The clear pomade that made Crew.</li>
            <li> I miss the clear version</li>
            <li> Mine seems to be clear</li>
            <li> It was either way too much or not enough to hold my hair.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t make hair appear greasy or stuck, but instead looks mostly natural.</li>
            <li> The product&#x27;s not heavy, never leaves my hair greasy or sticky feeling.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am a man with short straight hair</li>
            <li> /&gt;You will probably have to try a couple different products until you find the one you really like.</li>
            <li> Keeps your hair soft and natural feeling</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not spectacular, but it sure beats this stuff.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product since my early 20&#x27;s</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s really the only hair product that I like.  </li>
            <li> Leaves hair extremely soft when washed out.</li>
            <li> She says it makes her hair soft.</li>
            <li> Others argue that it is naturally a thicker paste as Pomade.</li>
            <li> Personally I prefer Axe&#x27;s Pomade which is much thicker and doesn&#x27;t clump.</li>
            <li> I also have some left over forming cream, and it works really well too, just gives the hair a shinier look.</li>
            <li> blow dry the hair in the front up, blow dry the rest totally dry, put some defining paste in my palm, rub my hands together vigorously and warm it up, and then work it into my hair.</li>
            <li> /&gt;You will probably have to try a couple different products until you find the one you really like.</li>
            <li> If you use pomade daily as I do the extra price is worth it.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re curious about it, it&#x27;s definitely worth trying it for the price.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Before I move onto the Pomade, the other thing to consider is...varying the dampness of your hair prior to the product will have a HUGE effect on how it works.</li>

            <li> This Product came half full and didn&#x27;t look legit....</li>
            <li> However, I recently had a hair stylist tell me to try other products because my hair is very dense and boy was she right.  </li>
            <li> hold of the product last all day and has a nice subtle scent to it.</li>
            <li> No mess.</li>
            <li> The genuine American Crew pomade should be clear with a slight amber tint.</li>
            <li> Decent product overall.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pretty sure this is fake and/or expired.</li>
            <li> does the job for a decent price, however leaves white residue in hair in the form of flakes.</li>
            <li> my hair really short, I was using their \\&quot;classic wax,\\&quot; which they no longer make.</li>
            <li> For short hair, use the high hold products with damp hair.</li>
            <li> Obviously doesn&#x27;t do well in high sunlight or heat.</li>
            <li> For short hair, use the high hold products with damp hair.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended product, It can cause acne if left on overnight</li>
            <li> Very dense, lasts a long time&lt;br</li>
            <li> It holds my hair really well considering my hair type, and I don&#x27;t have to mess with it throughout the whole day.  </li>
            <li> This is hands down the best smelling pomade for sure, the only thing is the hold is terrible.</li>
            <li> I used the normal amount that I would use with other pomades and even thought about adding more in even though that usually doesn&#x27;t help with pomades, but decided against it as it already made my hair look like it did coming out of a shower.</li>
            <li> If they stop making it I will probably just shave my head rather than try to find another hair product that can live up to the American Crew standard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The new stuff looks like lotion and leaves white residue on my hair.</li>
            <li> This is a new style of pomade that American Crew puts out.</li>
            <li> The cheaper versions are typically more sticky, have a different (less desirable) smell, and leave white traces in your hair, similar to what I received from this merchant.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve started using a blow dryer to &amp;#34;train&amp;#34; my hair in the direction I want, and to get it much drier (not 100% dry, but maybe 75%).</li>
            <li> &quot; my hair in the direction I want, and to get it much drier (not 100% dry, but maybe 75%).</li>
            <li> The price has really gone up in the stores over the last several years, so I turned to Amazon</li>
            <li> The yellow version does not last on my hair the whole day and dries out my hair.</li>
            <li> I have really thick hair, and I thought since this product said \\&quot;medium hold\\&quot;, it wouldn&#x27;t be strong</li>
            <li> After about 10 (or more) years of occasional use, it started to get these little white dots mixed in it.  </li>
            <li> Like many companies, small price increases and smaller portions makes for bigger profits.</li>
            <li> There is no other like it.</li>
            <li> My husband loves this pomade and will use no other.</li>
            <li> Was looking for the Mad Men Don Draper look, and this is the only stuff that has great hold all day.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used American Crew&#x27;s pomade for several years now and found it to be of high qualify which reflects the pricing.&lt;br</li>
            <li> At first it was hard getting used to applying the product and how much I should be applying.</li>
            <li> and it wasnt a bad color like some others experienced.</li>
            <li> White instead of clear.</li>
            <li> The same products were clear and fragrant.  </li>
            <li> very versatile (if your hair is long enough).</li>
            <li> I keep my hair short (&amp;#60;2&amp;#34;) but just long enough to need something in it.</li>
            <li> Since this stuff is very dense, you have to be careful with the amount you use, it may take some practice if you&#x27;ve never used it before.</li>
            <li> Have to be careful with how much you use based on your hair type.</li>
            <li> JV Beauty Supply apparently does &amp;#34;quality checks&amp;#34; on everything that they ship.</li>
            <li> By itself it provides moderate hold and sculpting ability with a soft and shiny touch.</li>
            <li> such a soft managable hold.</li>
            <li> have very curly hair, and to go without product would result in an undesirable poof of fluff.</li>
            <li> Like the old commercial - just a dab will do you.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t have any distinct smell like &amp;#34;American Crew Styling Gel Firm Hold&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> I have hair that wants to puff out -- this stuff gives me the ability to control my hair and give it a soft, slightly moist look.</li>
            <li> Most other products that I have used (hair spray, gels) have either not worked well, or have worked but have then damaged my hair a few months later.</li>
            <li> With my flat straight hair about 5 inches long, this thing can&#x27;t even my hair away from the front of my face.</li>
            <li> I usually take a small amount, warm it up by rubbing my hands together and applying it to my hair.</li>
            <li> It feels a little &amp;#34;sticky&amp;#34; at first, but after combing and brushing, it leaves my hair manageable.  </li>
            <li> Less hold than what I had expected from a pomade, but that&#x27;s not necessarily bad.</li>
            <li> It leaves my short-medium length hair soft to the touch with a hold that lasts all day long.</li>
            <li> Do ypurself a favpr and buy layrite, suavecito, or Teddy Boy Original ( my favorite water base)</li>
            <li> The price is also hard to swallow, I agree with a few other posters, a few dollars less and this would be even better, but for this price I&#x27;ll try something even better for my particular hair type.</li>
            <li> My hair is a bit longer (under chin) and it seems to weigh it down too much.</li>
            <li> I purchased this brand of pomade last year and it came in the same shaped container, except that the pomade itself looked clear -- kinda like hair gel -- and didn&#x27;t have this white, cloudy look of my recent order.</li>
            <li> I have slightly wavy hair, not stick straight or curly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not a huge fan of Axe either, but it&#x27;s about twice as strong and half the price of American Crew.</li>
            <li> Small amount goes a long way, a small amount gives a nice shiny look to hair</li>
            <li> Although the price was very reasonable and the shipment prompt, I was not pleased with how I received the product.</li>
            <li> I have little experience using pomade but have had success using other Crew products.</li>
            <li> Maybe some strange new form of life unknown to science.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for 8 years, American crew has never changed the formula, it holds very well without being too greasy, too stiff or too waxy.</li>
            <li> The only issue I have is that my hair is starting to thin but that could be more due to that I am now in my 40s.  </li>
            <li> I only use a little because I like the low hold, high shine look.</li>
            <li> Hold the hair really well without being too sticky or stiff.</li>
            <li> It holds my hair in place very well, without making it stiff.  </li>
            <li> I received two pomades today and one was opaque, the other was clear.</li>
            <li> Both of them work fine, but it is just weird that I got two different looking and smelling products even though the label still has the same ingredients.</li>
            <li> In my many years of experience with all different types of pomades, American Crew is the most frustrating; not only because the price is outrageous but because it is actually a very inferior product.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Hella shiny&lt;br /&gt;Hella crap for thick wavy hair (best hair)&lt;br /&gt;America&#x27;s third place crew</li>
            <li> The shine factor was little less than expected, apply a little water to the hair after applying the product to make it look more shiny.</li>
            <li> (it&#x27;s not much, but it&#x27;s noticeable), I still will use this pomade as it isn&#x27;t too expensive and gives me most, if not all, of what I&#x27;m looking for.</li>
            <li> /&gt;This pomade holds my short hair cut / crew cut and doesn&#x27;t dry leaving a &amp;#34;flake&amp;#34; look on the air.  </li>
            <li> My only complaint is that I feel it is overpriced for how much you get.  </li>
            <li> Like other reviewers had said before me, there are actually two types of American Crew Pomade.</li>
            <li> Likewise, I have no desire to slick my hair into highly gelled wet-looking but hard-as-a-rock curls.</li>
            <li> Hard to find it at a reasonable price sometimes, but amazon is where to look.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for several years and what was delivered to my house was a cream/fiber inside the container and not the usual clear product</li>
            <li> I also like that my hair is still pliable, does not get flaky and lasts all day long.</li>
            <li> This product keeps my hair looking moist all day long.  </li>
            <li> If you have a lot of hair to work with I would recommend Murray&#x27;s or Royal Crown, as they are the last few pomade&#x27;s left that haven&#x27;t been put out of business by American Crew.</li>
            <li> Hair stays formed all day long.</li>
            <li> I tried American Crew&#x27;s Military Paste</li>
            <li> This is certainly not the same product sold in salons and stores.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve bought these in bulk before and stored them for over a year and never seen any discoloration or change in texture, so I&#x27;m not sure it&#x27;s possible for this product to &amp;#34;spoil&amp;#34;, but I list that as a possible cause only because out of civility I&#x27;m hesitant to accuse anyone of (intentionally or not) selling a fraudulent product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Now that it&#x27;s longer, it doesn&#x27;t seem to hold well enough, so I&#x27;ve been trying other manufacturers.</li>
            <li> My hair is dry dry dry.  </li>
            <li> Once it&#x27;s dry</li>
            <li> Let me tell how it will feels when you touch it and try to put it on your hair, it&#x27;s so dry that it pulls my hair.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way, and i foresee the product lasting quite a long time.</li>
            <li> As per other reviews, a ittle does go a long, long way.</li>
            <li> Small amount to hair keeps hair soft and in place to where you groomed it.</li>
            <li> &quot; it actually started to weigh my hair down.</li>
            <li> Generally you want to put it in while your hair is just a little wet still</li>
            <li> My hair is pretty thick and a little wavy\curly.</li>
            <li> This stuff is pretty expensive at a local shop</li>
            <li> This might work for a slick back or spikey style, but if you&#x27;re going for a traditional tall pompadour you will be upset.</li>
            <li> Got the bigger size for the price the salon charges for the little one.</li>
            <li> Apply a little water midway through the day to bring back some of the shine.</li>
            <li> Plus I only need a little bit.</li>
            <li> only need to use a little,</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very thick and holds hair very well.</li>
            <li> When applied to the hair, your hair remains soft and pliant as opposed to hard or brittle the way hairspray or mousse does.  </li>
            <li> Only small amounts are needed, so it lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> I expected hair stuff to do.  </li>
            <li> Not a real crew product.</li>
            <li> Not real.</li>
            <li> and I canput it on wet and finger comb and go if I&#x27;m in a hurry, too</li>
            <li> It worked as expected.  </li>
            <li> Not a very strong hold, and looks sopping wet for too long.</li>
            <li> , we use it to spike short hair, tame flyaways.  </li>
            <li> My girlfriend even smooths a tiny amount over her hair to tame fly-aways.</li>
            <li> My husband has used this product for several years and I even sneak some when I need to tame my often frizzy hair.</li>
            <li> I have short/medium, semi wavy- thin- dark brown hair and this product works very well.</li>
            <li> Admittedly, I have short hair, but I use way less of this stuff than I did of competitor&#x27;s products a few years ago when I was still trying to find something that i wanted to stick with.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Overtime, the consistency of the pomade does change (it hardens up) but other than that</li>
            <li> and I have a slick back pompadour.</li>
            <li> I keep trying other products</li>
            <li> other product I&#x27;ve been using is the Forming Cream.</li>
            <li> And by the way, I noticed some of the other reviews reported that they changed their product.  </li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re looking for an American Crew product that can slick your hair and hold well, invest in their Grooming Cream.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure what to say about the other reviewers who have claimed to get a substandard product (yellow, smelly).</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve also bought other Crew products since.</li>
            <li> other product I&#x27;ve been using is the Forming Cream.</li>
            <li> It gets a stiff hold if you use enough, but it can have a less crunchy lighter hold if you use less.</li>
            <li> I wet my head, work a small amount through my hair, then blow dry it</li>
            <li> and I think this product was just not right for me.</li>
            <li> I am a male in my early 30&#x27;s have very thick hair which can be hard to manage.  </li>
            <li> It is no fun repackaging and returning these products.  </li>
            <li> It works very well, but doesn&#x27;t do what I wanted it to do, then again perhaps I just ended up buying the wrong product.</li>
            <li> (it&#x27;s a dark container) and smells like a hair product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> There really is no hold whatsoever and my hair falls limp, it gives no thickness/body to it.</li>
            <li> Not as firm as it used to be, and went rancid sooner than expected.</li>
            <li> If you have stubborn hairs this stuff will tie it down.</li>
            <li> gray hair, it helps to keep your hair down instead of standing up all over.&lt;br /&gt;You</li>
            <li> I usually towel dry my hair, then apply and style.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried suavecito, layrite superhold, murray&#x27;s and a few other brands.</li>
            <li> Also it doesn&#x27;t have any noticeable smell for me unlike the previous brands I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> the Fiber began to work less well.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used many different brands of pomade - both waterbase and petro - and this stuff is probably the worst in my opinion.</li>
            <li> the size of half of a pea is sufficient.</li>
            <li> So I gave this a try to help control slightly unruly hair.</li>
            <li> the Fiber began to work less well.</li>
            <li> My biggest complaint with the American Crew Pomade is that even with a small amount, it makes your hair extremely greasy.</li>
            <li> and i can mess with my hair throughout the day</li>
            <li> but a little less shiny.</li>
            <li> but a little less shiny.</li>
            <li> of these little things lasts me about 6 months.  </li>
            <li> i used this when i was a little boy</li>
            <li> A little greasy</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m looking for something a little cheaper though.</li>
            <li> I dap a little bit after my morning shower.  </li>
            <li> little spike in the front.</li>
            <li> Just a little bit of shine and keeps my face moist.</li>
            <li> little spike in the front.</li>
            <li> A small amount goes a very long way, I rub a small amount between my fingers for a shiny look.</li>
            <li> I bought this product hoping that it would give me a nice slick look like gel would without the nasty hardness or extreme shine.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s either old af or fake.</li>
            <li> Prefer the Firm Holding Gel.</li>
            <li> He uses it everyday.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Best time to apply it is after you have towel dried your hair.  </li>
            <li> It controls his hair without leaving a sticky or heavy film in his hair.</li>
            <li> Been using this product for a few years.  </li>
            <li> a few years.</li>
            <li> + everyday.</li>
            <li> It never feels heavy or stiff.</li>
            <li> and I can get it shipped to my home for about $5 less than buying it from Walmart!  </li>
            <li> The color of the box is black too!</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t paid the $25 bucks to get it in a store, so not sure which one is typical of the pomade.</li>
            <li> Holds everything in place without feeling stiff.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s not strong.</li>
            <li> Absolutely no hold, the price is ridiculous, and it makes my hair look greasy.</li>
            <li> However, it is not right for my thick hair</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product nearly everyday for the past couple years.  </li>
            <li> It helps the curls stay together and not becoming frizzy.</li>
            <li> Personally, the smell is a little weird, and overpowers your cologne.</li>
            <li> I was running a little late this morning and didn&#x27;t have time to do my hair</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think you can go wrong with american crew products.  </li>
            <li> This product is not made for men with thick, heavy hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> trick is to take a small amount, size of a pea,  and heat activate the product  by rubbing two hands together before application.</li>
            <li> I have purchased this item in the past.  </li>
            <li> This is not the CREW that I have purchased in the past.  </li>
            <li> So I&#x27;m not sure what they are referring to.</li>
            <li> Wanted to try something besides the usual 20 dollar imperial pomeade I usually get.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m giving this 4 stars, just because of the small quantity you get.  </li>
            <li> You have to cake this stuff on to get it to slick your hair.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d kill to have the smell turned into a cologne.&lt;br /&gt;Overall, if you&#x27;re looking for pomade that will slick your hair, look elsewhere, in fact, check out Imperial.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s light so doesn&#x27;t weigh down your hair especially in muggy conditions.</li>
            <li> I couldnt use the really hard jell because it give me a headache when i wear them.</li>
            <li> The hard part is figuring out...</li>
            <li> The hard part is figuring out...</li>
            <li> but it doesn&#x27;t stop the waves in my thick hair even after I used thinning sheers to try to help it out.</li>
            <li> Pomade is like a thick gel.  </li>
            <li> I bought this product for my husband, he has thick curly hair.</li>
            <li> Too thick for my hair.</li>
            <li> I have thick medium length hair and one tub lasts about three months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> though (my hair is probably too thick.</li>
            <li> I have thick and curly hair.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s way too expensive for what you get compared to other waterbased pomades like Suavacito, Layrite, Sloan, Iron Society, Cock Grease and others.</li>
            <li> It has a different color and an unpleasant odor.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Of course, this stuff is almost always ridiculously priced, so I try to wait until someone&#x27;s selling it for $10-ish on Amazon.</li>
            <li> My second order was the yellow, odorless one and let me tell you the hold is terrible.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a clear base product</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know why this is happening as I keep the lid on tight and so its slightly disappointing.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, after 2 or 3 weeks you&#x27;ll be out and back to your ugly self.</li>
            <li> The color of the pomade is completely off and the hold is terrible.</li>
            <li> It also has a faintly stale smell to it.  </li>
            <li> I can see this relationship is going to get expensive  </li>
            <li> Just expensive.</li>
            <li> The bottom line is that this product is probably the worst and weakest pomade out there next to got2b&#x27;s brand</li>
            <li> I was wrong.</li>
            <li> it hurts white and nasty</li>
            <li> Here is the weird thing about ordering it from Amazon:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;Shame on Amazon for selling false products!</li>
            <li> My hair is thick and difficult for me to keep &amp;#34;clean and combed&amp;#34; but this product gets the job done!!</li>
            <li> I purchased a couple other pomades and was very disappointed with all of them.</li>
            <li> having said all of that, I still recommend the product if you&#x27;re desperate to manage your unmanageable hair and don&#x27;t want to spend a fortune on products.</li>
            <li> , just makes hair look dirty.</li>
            <li> Terrible product, don&#x27;t buy &amp; wasted your money.</li>
            <li> if you are going for the &#x27;dapper&#x27; Mad Men look.</li>
            <li> Very expensive for the amount of product received.</li>
            <li> This expensive crap is replacing it.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t want to say that this is a bad product</li>
            <li> The gel was smelling really bad.</li>
            <li> Every time I try another product, I&#x27;m disappointed.</li>
            <li> The worst part is that people buy into it because it&#x27;s expensive and is marketed well.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really annoying.</li>
            <li> Disgusting.</li>
            <li> This is horrible.</li>
            <li> Terrible product.</li>
            <li> It looks terrible.</li>
            <li> Opening it and seeing a finger print is uttlery disgusting.</li>

            <li> Only hair product I ever use, keeps it in place all day and night.</li>
            <li> This is either expired, or it&#x27;s a second.  I&#x27;ve been buying this exact Pomade for the last 7 years, and I know that it should be mostly clear with an ever-so-slight amber tint.  When this pomade arrived, it was whitish/yellow - like the color of Vaseline.  It also has a faintly stale smell to it.  The best way I can describe the smell is like an old book or a library.</li>
            <li> Good and better price.</li>
            <li> a little too sticky for my taste, i tried the bedhead product and like it better</li>
            <li> Smells great and makes hair feel and look good but it doesn&#x27;t stop the waves in my thick hair even after I used thinning sheers to try to help it out. Hold isn&#x27;t very good and it seems to take a lot of products that to cover my hair. Shine goes away if u run comb through your hair more the 4 or 5 times.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: Suavecito firm is amazing! Get it instead!</li>
            <li> This Product came half full and didn&#x27;t look legit....&lt;br /&gt;Never had this problem</li>
            <li> Got the bigger size for the price the salon charges for the little one.</li>
            <li> Great product no build up</li>
            <li> Not a very strong hold, and looks sopping wet for too long. I&#x27;ll stick with $4 murrays</li>
            <li> This is my husband&#x27;s favorite hair styling product and over the years I&#x27;ve started using it as well.  What we like the most is it&#x27;s texture. Pomade is like a thick gel.  When applied to the hair, your hair remains soft and pliant as opposed to hard or brittle the way hairspray or mousse does.  These 3 oz. containers are pretty large so we end up using 1 every 9 months or so.  Overtime, the consistency of the pomade does change (it hardens up) but other than that, we use it to spike short hair, tame flyaways.  I&#x27;ve even used tiny tabs on my eyebrows in lieu of brow gel.  There is a mild scent but it&#x27;s not strong.</li>
            <li> Great price, for a great product!</li>
            <li> Great product. Fast shiiping</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for about 8 years. Good quality pomade! I&#x27;m very brand loyal to American Crew.</li>
            <li> Zero hold doesn&#x27;t smell good at all, it reminds me of oven cleaner.  It was either way too much or not enough to hold my hair.  Do ypurself a favpr and buy layrite, suavecito, or Teddy Boy Original ( my favorite water base)</li>
            <li> Works well with my type of hair</li>
            <li> Good Product. Better than average. Way better...</li>
            <li> I have short/medium, semi wavy- thin- dark brown hair and this product works very well. It leaves my hair smelling delicious and looking super sleek.. no flakes and lasts all day. I haven&#x27;t tried many other products, but this does beat out Sauve Pomade and Crew Fiber. The Sauve was nice, but didn&#x27;t last as long and didnt leave the same look.. it was more of a matte finish which might be nice for some, but too many flakes. Crew Fiber was too greasy for my hair and although I used it all up, I definitely preferred Crew pomade.</li>
            <li> I wish I could give this more than 5 stars.  It&#x27;s the only hair product I will ever use.  If they stop making it I will probably just shave my head rather than try to find another hair product that can live up to the American Crew standard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One of these little things lasts me about 6 months.  Admittedly, I have short hair, but I use way less of this stuff than I did of competitor&#x27;s products a few years ago when I was still trying to find something that i wanted to stick with.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re on the fence about this, try it; it&#x27;s worth every penny.</li>
            <li> My hair product go to. Just started styling and this is a lifesaver.</li>
            <li> Awesome product! A definite must have!!</li>
            <li> It came on time and as described.  Very happy with the product and the delivery.</li>
            <li> Awesome pomade!  Holds style well and makes your hair shine!</li>
            <li> Works Great!! I have really thick coarse hair and the Pomade works perfect for keeping my hair in place with spiking the front and keeping the sides down. This is one of the product I keep using over and over. Definitely worth it.</li>
            <li> I couldnt use the really hard jell because it give me a headache when i wear them. This one help me to get away from that but still doing the job keeping my hair straight.</li>
            <li> If you like this product, might as well buy Vaseline for 2 dollars pre-much same thing.</li>
            <li> I used to use this for a while, and it was not bad. It has a medium hold with high shine which is cool if you want hair that looks wet all the time. It did not EVER hold my hair on it&#x27;s own however, because I have extremely thick hair and I have a slick back pompadour. I would always have to use hairspray to keep it in place. I switched to Baxter of California&#x27;s clay pomade and I am happy I switched! I like the matte look better and I think this product was just not right for me. It may be right for you, however.</li>
            <li> Bought this as a gift for my husband who has &amp;#34;poofy&amp;#34; hair. It came on time. He needed a little convincing but once he tried it, he loved it! As per other reviews, a ittle does go a long, long way. It smells good, does not leave a greasy feeling and has a firm hold.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We are very happy with our purchase.</li>
            <li> I use this product because it doesn&#x27;t flake.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love American Crew&#x27;s Pomade, it&#x27;s great for classic cuts. Smells good, work better. Easy to apply, and lasts all day. It does leave a glossier finish, this should be no surprise as it is pomade. Holds better, and lasts longer than cheap product. I have been using this product for several years, and will certainly continue to do so.</li>
            <li> Good deal, good product.</li>
            <li> Less hold than what I had expected from a pomade, but that&#x27;s not necessarily bad. Decent product overall. Some advice: try it with varying levels of hair dampness, since it works differently for different people. Also, as with a lot of products, apply it in the back first. It&#x27;s easy to use too much in the front.</li>
            <li> Burns my eyes. Looks good but ....</li>
            <li> My husband loves this brand and hair product. He has bought it in the salon for much more. It is nice to find it on Amazon at a cheaper price.</li>
            <li> Not recommended for people with curly hair. Not great hold, probably good for people with straight hair.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s either old af or fake. White instead of clear.</li>
            <li> Good shine, but weak hold. Good as top coat, but little else. Can&#x27;t sport a pomp with this product and expect it to last mor than a couple hours.</li>
            <li> This is a god send for hair- malleable enough to have fun with, shiny enough to look pretty, rinses out thoroughly, smells great, good product for the gym or going out on the town.</li>
            <li> The pomade I got looked milky and was not the same consistency as store bought American Crew.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pretty sure this is fake and/or expired. The color of the pomade is completely off and the hold is terrible. This is certainly not the same product sold in salons and stores. Do not buy this... spend the extra $1 and buy it in stores.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shame on Amazon for selling false products!</li>
            <li> Good For Straight Hair!!</li>
            <li> hubby loves this stuff&lt;br /&gt;have ordered several times</li>
            <li> Color was unclear and milky.  But still smelled and worked fine.</li>
            <li> I keep trying other products and I keep coming back to this. I keep my hair short (&amp;#60;2&amp;#34;) but just long enough to need something in it. This does the trick but if you are looking for super strong hold this is not what you want. Not sticky and I like the shine.</li>
            <li> My husband has been using this for years- the best.</li>
            <li> Although the price was very reasonable and the shipment prompt, I was not pleased with how I received the product. All of the hair pomade was misshapened within its container causing some of it to spill out as I opened it. Also, when i allowed the product to return to a more leveled state, it seemed as if there was some product missing and that it was only partial filled.</li>
            <li> Used regular gel forever. Had the chance to test it at my hair stylist and now I can&#x27;t go back. Keeps my hair(short) all day in the right shape, without the gel look</li>
            <li> Great product to have...</li>
            <li> Not as great as I thought it would be, still good though. 3.5 Stars</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know.  I bought this stuff from whoever cut my hair like 10 years ago because this girl I liked said the word &amp;#34;pomade,&amp;#34; and she was pretty stylish.  Well, it worked great, and my hair was totally styled, and that girl thought I was pretty slick.  And it lasted forever because I have short hair and I don&#x27;t often style it.  After about 10 (or more) years of occasional use, it started to get these little white dots mixed in it.  Who knows what they were.  Maybe some strange new form of life unknown to science.  Probably just deteriorating wax and whatever pomade is.  I think 10 years is an acceptable shelf life for this stuff.  So even though I rarely use it and my stylish friend doesn&#x27;t notice anymore, I bought a new can of this because it did whatever it is I expected hair stuff to do.  Oh, and I like that it is neither greasy nor crispy.  I just use a little bit and it makes my hairs do hair things appropriately.</li>
            <li> I bought this product for my husband, he has thick curly hair. A pea sized amount of this product will hold his hair straight for his work day and into his work out at the gym. It doesn&#x27;t make hair appear greasy or stuck, but instead looks mostly natural. And most importantly, it washes off his hair and hands easily and leaves no residue.</li>
            <li> Not quite the hold I thought it would give, but I like the sheen it gives my hair.</li>
            <li> Easy to use. Works all day. Smell is mild and pleasant. On my third jar now. I can see this relationship is going to get expensive  •__•</li>
            <li> I have been using American Crew pomade for a decade now. The color, texture, and consistency are very distinct. The genuine American Crew pomade should be clear with a slight amber tint. This was an opaque milky white.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve bought these in bulk before and stored them for over a year and never seen any discoloration or change in texture, so I&#x27;m not sure it&#x27;s possible for this product to &amp;#34;spoil&amp;#34;, but I list that as a possible cause only because out of civility I&#x27;m hesitant to accuse anyone of (intentionally or not) selling a fraudulent product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve also (intentionally) bought cheap knock-off versions in the past to see if the genuine product is really worth the price. The cheaper versions are typically more sticky, have a different (less desirable) smell, and leave white traces in your hair, similar to what I received from this merchant. For me it&#x27;s worth the added cost of buying genuine. Look elsewhere.</li>
            <li> Great service add promised will buy again</li>
            <li> Great buy. Is actually cheaper on here than getting in the stores. Bought it for my son as he loves this stuff.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have a lot of experience with pomades and hair gels.  This one doesn&#x27;t seem to make my forehead as waxy-shiny as hair gel tends to.  Has a nice hold.</li>
            <li> Crew pomade is certainly not cheap but it is the best. If you use pomade daily as I do the extra price is worth it. While expensive, Amazon has the best price I have found anywhere.</li>
            <li> Of all the pom styling gel out there, this is the BEST!</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t work for my hair. Prefer the Firm Holding Gel.</li>
            <li> Maybe this pomade works for some people - it didn&#x27;t work that well for me.  Too thick for my hair.</li>
            <li> Best product I have found for my high humidity (Miami) environment with my wavy/curly hair that just waits for an opportunity to frizz out.</li>
            <li> Good product. Find it too be the right mixture of firmness and spreadablity.</li>
            <li> Not a real crew product. I use this often. The &amp;#34;crew&amp;#34; from this seller couldn&#x27;t hold my hair for 6 min. Not real. Don&#x27;t buy from this seller.</li>
            <li> A great product! It smells good and hold perfectly. It&#x27;s water based so it washes out easily with no buildup.</li>
            <li> Has always been my go-to product and will continue to use. But the price is what really is appealing to me. Stores charge way too much and these prices are great and exactly what they should be.</li>
            <li> Product works well and has a nice wet look when applied. I also like that my hair is still pliable, does not get flaky and lasts all day long.</li>
            <li> The difference between this pomade and the fiber is that one has a more shiny but weak hold and the other has a stronger hold with a matte look.</li>
            <li> This is good product if you are looking for pomade. Check some review from Youtube if you are considering it.</li>
            <li> Even though this is considered a men&#x27;s product, I&#x27;ve been using it on my short pixie hair style for several years for just a bit of control and fantastic shine.  The product&#x27;s not heavy, never leaves my hair greasy or sticky feeling.  And I get loads of compliments on my hair.  I love this stuff and I canput it on wet and finger comb and go if I&#x27;m in a hurry, too</li>
            <li> This is a great hair styling product.  Good hold without the greasy look.  Just don&#x27;t use too much at one time or your hair will look bullet proof!</li>
            <li> best hair product ive bought in a while</li>
            <li> As advertised. The shine factor was little less than expected, apply a little water to the hair after applying the product to make it look more shiny.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for years and it does a great job.  Also has a great fragrance to it</li>
            <li> Works great.  I purchased after the lady who does my hair suggested it.  A little goes a long way, and i foresee the product lasting quite a long time.</li>
            <li> best stuff out there. onlyl 4 stars because of the price!</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t take much to get a great hold and it has a good scent.</li>
            <li> There really is no hold whatsoever and my hair falls limp, it gives no thickness/body to it. Also makes my hair look/feel super greasy. The search continues... ugh</li>
            <li> but the formulation seems to have changed.  Not as firm as it used to be, and went rancid sooner than expected.</li>
            <li> Not the same product that I have purchased in the store. The product listed as pomade in the store is a clear gel that provides good all day hold. This was a white cream that does its job for about 4-6 hours. After it dries out during the day it looses it&#x27;s hold.</li>
            <li> Small amount to hair keeps hair soft and in place to where you groomed it. Does not provide an altered hair sheen or chiseled layer look, just what you have and how it looks.</li>
            <li> Decent product. Way over priced. Not any better than the Axe product, just way more expensive.</li>
            <li> does the job for a decent price, however leaves white residue in hair in the form of flakes. my default hair product.</li>
            <li> It was about $8 cheaper. But the product is white instead of clear, most likely because it has been dehydrated.</li>
            <li> This gel is the best buy for the money on Amazon. It is much more costly at Target or Wal-mart. The Pomade is the perfect combination of hold and good-looking shine. I found this product by mistake and have not used anything else. It really washes out like there is nothing in your hair at all, I don&#x27;t know how that works but it does.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think you can go wrong with american crew products.  It&#x27;s pricey but high quality.  Definitely a strong hold for the day and has a nice smell to it as well.</li>
            <li> CREW pomade is a must have for men who care about their personal hygeine and grooming.  I know it is a staple in my collection and women constantly comment on shine and smell the product has.  I have been using this product for quite some time and have never been dissappointed on the texture and shine it leaves me with.  It is easily able to be manipulated throughout the day if need be and can be applied to achieve many different desired results.  Best part is, amazon consistently has the best pricing!</li>
            <li> First time using a pomade. At first it was hard getting used to applying the product and how much I should be applying. I finally found the sweetspot, a dab about a dime&#x27;s worth on my finger, rub it in my palms, warm it up, and apply to mildly damp hair. Keeps the hair looking as if nothing is there and can be restyled throughout the day. Apply a little water midway through the day to bring back some of the shine.</li>
            <li> Bought this for our Beatlemania-themed party and it works great! holds my hair in place and makes it shiny!</li>
            <li> Worked well, gave my hair a nice shine. I would recommend the forming gel if you want something lighter -- this one tends to leave a somewhat waxy feel in your hair after a while.</li>
            <li> It doesnt really hold just gives your hair shine and a light hold, i had to keep on combing my hair all day to keep it in place. over all its ok</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for 8 years, American crew has never changed the formula, it holds very well without being too greasy, too stiff or too waxy. A small amount goes a very long way, I rub a small amount between my fingers for a shiny look. I have thick medium length hair and one tub lasts about three months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PROS:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Small amount goes a long way, a small amount gives a nice shiny look to hair&lt;br /&gt;- Has great hold without being greasy&lt;br /&gt;- Has a clean fragrance scent&lt;br /&gt;- Very dense, lasts a long time&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Since this stuff is very dense, you have to be careful with the amount you use, it may take some practice if you&#x27;ve never used it before. If you use too much your hair will become too greasy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Country of Origin: USA</li>
            <li> I love this stuff. It smells great according to a former lady friend. But I love the smell of it, too. I had never used pomade until I started going to a new barber and got an undercut. If you&#x27;ve never used pomade, it&#x27;s way different from the gel you used in middle school. I just use about a fingertip amount. This gives me a good bit of control, but it keeps my hair soft. No helmet head. This is a buy.</li>
            <li> I received two pomades today and one was opaque, the other was clear. I have been purchasing it for years and the color of the pomade is always a clearish color with a goldish color to it. Not opaque like wax. Secondly, both had finger prints in them. Someone clearly opened them both and swiped them to test out the texture. One of the items even had a dust ball in it. Disgusting. So glad I checked them out prior to handing them to my son. I&amp;#34;m sure that is a health hazard to some degree? I took pictures with my mobile phone, but at the moment have no idea how to upload them.</li>
            <li> i used this when i was a little boy but now I&#x27;m 22 and understand how to use it. its great for a sleek and classic hairstyle. If you have stubborn hairs this stuff will tie it down.</li>
            <li> A really perfect product.  Use just a bit and you can spike wonderfully.  It also holds hair nicely without the use of hair spray.</li>
            <li> never disappoints. Solid, lasts all day, and not too greasy</li>
            <li> Recommended by my hair dresser.  Great hold and great shine.&lt;br /&gt;Bought both sizes for home and travel. Good price also.</li>
            <li> Style Points for days with this product. Price is right.</li>
            <li> Gotta get the gel/water combo right and after that this stuff is good but I&#x27;m sure there&#x27;s better stuff out there.</li>
            <li> I wanted to give this a try because I needed something for morning emergencies. I was running a little late this morning and didn&#x27;t have time to do my hair so I figured I&#x27;d pick up something at a local store and apply it in the office bathroom before anyone notices. This stuff is pretty expensive at a local shop so I wouldn&#x27;t recommend buying it there, but I needed a pomade and there were only two on the shelf, this and a redkin one. I kind of wish I picked the redkin instead, but I remembered after doing much research online that this got some pretty fair reviews. The most critical review you&#x27;ll see here got it right. With my flat straight hair about 5 inches long, this thing can&#x27;t even my hair away from the front of my face. I used the normal amount that I would use with other pomades and even thought about adding more in even though that usually doesn&#x27;t help with pomades, but decided against it as it already made my hair look like it did coming out of a shower. I don&#x27;t want to say that this is a bad product cause the texture was nice and the smell is pretty good as well, but don&#x27;t expect this to keep your hair above your head cause it won&#x27;t do that. I&#x27;m going to figure out a way to return this and try the redkin instead.</li>
            <li> This is the only pomade I use now.  Easy to rinse out and apply to the hair.  Gives a nice shine to the my hair and I don&#x27;t have to use much either.  Also it doesn&#x27;t have any noticeable smell for me unlike the previous brands I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried suavecito, layrite superhold, murray&#x27;s and a few other brands. This is horrible. Absolutely no hold, the price is ridiculous, and it makes my hair look greasy. Terrible product.</li>
            <li> This product is not made for men with thick, heavy hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For someone with hair like mine, the medium hold acts like more of a LOW hold.</li>
            <li> Fiber and defining paste are gems for the matte look. I wanted to change my look, the oil-slickback look, but this pomade is TOO oily! I get that pomades have shine, but this pomade isn&#x27;t even in the &amp;#34;shiny&amp;#34; category. It&#x27;s beyond that. You might as well dump corn oil on your head. It looks terrible.</li>
            <li> I was told about this product by a friend who is an actual model. It is a fantastic product. It keeps the shape very well, without making the hair all crispy and dry.&lt;br /&gt; No itchiness, dryness of scalp or oily feel of hair after. Very good for styling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The trick is to take a small amount, size of a pea,  and heat activate the product  by rubbing two hands together before application. Only small amounts are needed, so it lasts a long time. I use it every day. It lats about 4-6 months. Not bad.</li>
            <li> smells good, and does the job. I&#x27;d buy it again</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for a long time and it&#x27;s great. A little greasy but it doesn&#x27;t ruin your hair.</li>
            <li> i use this pomade to style my short hair... people tell me that it gives a splash of shine too...</li>
            <li> This product is good for hold that doesn&#x27;t make your hair rigid. My hair stay in place and goes back in place after running my hand through it.</li>
            <li> This stuff is the best. I&#x27;ve been using it for over a decade. Water-based, goes on clean, washes out clean, has a nice subtle perfume to it, and it&#x27;s made from some pretty agreeable ingrediants. Every time I try another product, I&#x27;m disappointed. Of course, this stuff is almost always ridiculously priced, so I try to wait until someone&#x27;s selling it for $10-ish on Amazon.</li>
            <li> Palmade is similar to moose. It&#x27;s very thick and holds hair very well. Doesn&#x27;t have any distinct smell like &amp;#34;American Crew Styling Gel Firm Hold&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> nice product with nice smell...&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m definitely buying this product again...&lt;br /&gt;MODERATE STRENGTH i THINK..&lt;br /&gt;THAT&#x27;S WHY I LIKE THIS PRODUCT</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this every day for close to 10 years now. It washes out clean, which is the biggest reason I keep coming to it. It holds my hair all day and leaves great shine.</li>
            <li> Great product just what I wanted</li>
            <li> I have purchased this item in the past.  The gel should be clear with a shade of gold.  I recently ordered three jars.  All had turned opaque with an &amp;#34;off&amp;#34; scent.  I returned them and reordered and received the product in the same opaque condition.  My wife went to a local beauty supply store.  The same products were clear and fragrant.  The clerk offered that what I had received was spoiled product.  That is the last time that I will ever order this product through  Amazon until quality control can be guaranteed.  It is no fun repackaging and returning these products.  No convenience, there!</li>
            <li> Great stuff. Keeps that style lookin fresh af. Get this guys to get all the women you could ever want.</li>
            <li> This is not the CREW that I have purchased in the past.  It has a different color and an unpleasant odor.&lt;br /&gt;I can not use it any longer.</li>
            <li> I like to brush my hair back, but with a shorter haircut, it tends to stand up and eventually curl over my forehead in the front or try to part. The American Crew Pomade has just the right amount of hold and, used sparingly, lasts all day without being too shiny or feeling greasy. It also washes out quickly and cleanly.</li>
            <li> This is a great product! With awesome pricing! The packaging was great! I would definitely recommend!!! I was  very pleased!</li>
            <li> Great price for what I feel is high end hair product.  I&#x27;ve been a fan of American crew for about 6 years now and will continue to use their hair products.</li>
            <li> Product arrived as promised, nicely packed. Love the item, odorless, not greasy, easy to use.</li>
            <li> I really like the Pomade because it gives my hair a nice shine with a light hold. It never feels heavy or stiff. Its a great everyday hair styling product.</li>
            <li> Best Pomade I have found.  Hard to find it at a reasonable price sometimes, but amazon is where to look.</li>
            <li> Best pomade ever. Price wayyyyyyyyy better than anywhere else .</li>
            <li> I have used this product for over a year.  It works throughout the day.  One of my favorite features is that it does not make you hair feel stiff, rather, hair feels natural while remaining as you styled it .</li>
            <li> all ok, thank you !!!!!</li>
            <li> I bought this product hoping that it would give me a nice slick look like gel would without the nasty hardness or extreme shine. It works very well, but doesn&#x27;t do what I wanted it to do, then again perhaps I just ended up buying the wrong product. It&#x27;s very cheap compared to buying it from a store, and would definitely recommend it again!</li>
            <li> Have you ever wanted to have that Madmen look, the one that says I can&#x27;t pull off the Don Draper but I sure do what my hair to look like I haven&#x27;t washed in 7 days and then parted it? Me to, honestly good product exactly what I was looking for in a pomade.</li>
            <li> Seriously, the best hair product that I&#x27;ve bought so far. Using this with pomade, allows you to put your hair in whatever style you like. Definitely recommend, and keep up the good work guys!</li>
            <li> I loved this stuff. Great smell, easy to wash out, and holds all day. Good for the money. I&#x27;m looking for something a little cheaper though.</li>
            <li> been using for a decade. Actually will keep pretty much the style over night and into the next day without the sticky - glue feel.</li>
            <li> Well not at all satisfying. First of all, the gel does not do what it is supposed to do well. Secondly I started getting pimples on my forehead after using this. May be I am allergic to it. So please make sure you are not allergic to it. When I stopped using, I am fine.</li>
            <li> Not a super strong hold but smells nice and keeps my hair looking shiny and nice.  It&#x27;s advertised as a medium hold but I think maybe I have a different definition of &amp;#34;medium.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> I have longer curly hair (similar to Richard Madden for reference), and using this on ever so slightly damp hair mixed with a little argan oil has been perfect for my needs.</li>
            <li> Best stuff for my hair period.  Was looking for the Mad Men Don Draper look, and this is the only stuff that has great hold all day.  Have to be careful with how much you use based on your hair type.</li>
            <li> The product does what it says it will - medium hold, high shine. However, it is not right for my thick hair and it gives me that shiny look that I don&#x27;t like. Just depends what you want!</li>
            <li> My hair is dry dry dry.  This product keeps my hair looking moist all day long.  Amazon price is better than Salon price.</li>
            <li> Best for male hair.  Nothing out there works as well.  Provides excellent hold and structure.  My son loves it too.</li>
            <li> It has good shine but low hold. If you want just a natural hold with high shine this is your stuff</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product nearly everyday for the past couple years.  Shine makes hair looks good and holds it in position.  I do a side part.  I dap a little bit after my morning shower.  Generally you want to put it in while your hair is just a little wet still, then work it in, and comb hair in position.  Once hair dries it looks good.</li>
            <li> Its original, no imposter. The item arrived promptly.  I love this product, it smells so good has held my husbands hair in place for the past 7 years.</li>
            <li> Hella hype&lt;br /&gt;Hella shiny&lt;br /&gt;Hella crap for thick wavy hair (best hair)&lt;br /&gt;America&#x27;s third place crew</li>
            <li> Keeps my hair lookin&#x27; fiiiine.</li>
            <li> Great pomade but if you don&#x27;t like the smell of old man, then this may not be worth it for you. The smell is strong at first but will go away.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s good for what it is and the price is right !</li>
            <li> a little better pricing. shipped quickly</li>
            <li> My husband loves this for his hair.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used American Crew&#x27;s pomade for several years now and found it to be of high qualify which reflects the pricing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am a man with short straight hair (approx. 3 inches) and use this product to comb my hair to the side. The texture of the pomade is easy to handle. I usually take a small amount, warm it up by rubbing my hands together and applying it to my hair. It applies smoothly and doesn&#x27;t cause chunking like other pomade that I&#x27;ve used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The hold of the product last all day and has a nice subtle scent to it. I find that it easily washes out as well.</li>
            <li> I like this pomade. It gets a stiff hold if you use enough, but it can have a less crunchy lighter hold if you use less. One issue I have noticed is the top and sides of mine look like they&#x27;re drying out. I don&#x27;t know why this is happening as I keep the lid on tight and so its slightly disappointing.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used four different American Crew wax/pomades, and they are all great. They smell great, and they are relatively inexpensive. The hard part is figuring out...what product is good for what hair?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve gone from very short guy hair, to longer guy hair...and as I&#x27;ve done that, the American Crew product that I prefer has changed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With my hair really short, I was using their &amp;#34;classic wax,&amp;#34; which they no longer make. I started trying their Fiber product on that short hair, and it worked pretty well. Get my hair fairly damp, work the Fiber in, and it would give me good hold...little spike in the front. Another product I was using with my short hair was TIGI Bed Head Men Matte Separation Wax. That stuff is REALLY sticky...which is fine for short hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Before I move onto the Pomade, the other thing to consider is...varying the dampness of your hair prior to the product will have a HUGE effect on how it works. For example, you can have your hair fairly damp with the stickier (ie high hold) products, and still be able to work it in really well. As your hair gets drier though, two things happen. The hold becomes even MORE pronounced, but it also becomes harder to work into the hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So as I grew my hair out...the Fiber began to work less well. I had a lot more hair, and because it&#x27;s a &amp;#34;higher hold,&amp;#34; it actually started to weigh my hair down. Spiking up hair that&#x27;s only an inch or two long worked fine...but as my hair got to 3+ inches, it would start to fall over. And the Fiber is fairly sticky...so your hair needs to be fairly damp to work it in, but then it doesn&#x27;t want to stay up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now I will FINALLY talk about the Pomade!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had to move to a &amp;#34;lower hold&amp;#34; product...and I wasn&#x27;t used to this at first. I was leaving my hair fairly damp, and putting the pomade into that didn&#x27;t give it much hold at all (though depending the style you want...like a more traditional mad men kind of look without a lot of spike, then that would be fine). I wanted a little more spike and &amp;#34;verticalness&amp;#34; to my hair, so what I had to do was start drying it more. I&#x27;ve started using a blow dryer to &amp;#34;train&amp;#34; my hair in the direction I want, and to get it much drier (not 100% dry, but maybe 75%). Now the pomade has much more hold!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The other product I&#x27;ve been using is the Forming Cream. It&#x27;s similar to the pomade...but a little less shiny. It has worked well in my longer hair, and like I said before...to get any hold, I need my hair drier.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You will probably have to try a couple different products until you find the one you really like. But before you give up on any one product, vary the dampness of your hair first. Hopefully my experience will point you in the right direction. For short hair, use the high hold products with damp hair. For longer hair, use the low hold products with drier hair.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s fantastic but the value just isn&#x27;t there.  I guess when you&#x27;re the best you can justify charging the most.</li>
            <li> Love this product!  It works best when my hair is still a little damp.  It&#x27;s the only pomade I&#x27;ll use now.</li>
            <li> Works great for my needs!!  I&#x27;ve gotten more compliments with it in than not. I&#x27;ve got longer hair on top so it can go fast, fyi.  Fast shipping.</li>
            <li> great product, using it for yrs, a bit pricey but well worth it as the others dont compare and its not worth the savings to show up at work with goopy hair, with this product you can be one of the cool kids with great hair</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for about 8 years. Good quality pomade! I&#x27;m very brand loyal to American Crew.</li>
            <li> Awesome! Great product</li>
            <li> Terrific hair product, would not use anything else. Must have, light and easy to travel with makes it even better</li>
            <li> Does what it is supposed to do.</li>
            <li> Great Service and the item was exactly as described.</li>
            <li> I bought this pomade for my husband.  He uses it everyday.  It does not cause any damage to his hair.  He absolutely loves it.</li>
            <li> Great price and fast delivery</li>
            <li> Love this product! Shipment was fast and I ran into no problems. Very satisfied.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t care for this cream</li>
            <li> Fantastic product. I have hair that wants to puff out -- this stuff gives me the ability to control my hair and give it a soft, slightly moist look.</li>
            <li> It claims to be a &amp;#34;pomade&amp;#34;, but this stuff is nothing more than solidified gel when compared to other waterbased pomades. The scent is nice, but is not a real pomade in the classic sense. It&#x27;s way too expensive for what you get compared to other waterbased pomades like Suavacito, Layrite, Sloan, Iron Society, Cock Grease and others. I would not recommend it even for a newbie to hair grease. I&#x27;ve used many different brands of pomade - both waterbase and petro - and this stuff is probably the worst in my opinion.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping. Very happy.</li>
            <li> Have been using this for years.  Like many companies, small price increases and smaller portions makes for bigger profits.</li>
            <li> Nice not too sticky. Just expensive.</li>
            <li> This stuff smells amazing!! Works great for my husband and I just want to eat him up every time he uses it!  Ladies, I&#x27;m telling you, buy this for your man.....you will love it!!</li>
            <li> Great hold. No mess. I love the smell too.</li>
            <li> Loved this product for years, good price on Amazon.</li>
            <li> Love this and the price is better at amazon!</li>
            <li> Always melts on my hair</li>
            <li> Used it for years and still just as happy with Crew as I was the first time!</li>
            <li> Crew pomade is very good, but complete ly overpriced; water soluble so it is never greasy or waxy.  Keeps your hair soft and natural feeling</li>
            <li> It had a weird color from what it should really look like, but still works good.</li>
            <li> The gel was smelling really bad. Never had this kind of experience when purchased from a retail store. this was the first time i ordered this product online.</li>
            <li> ohhh my god how i love this product  it forms my hair perfectly. its a must have.There is no comparison to the american crew pomade</li>
            <li> This&#x27;s the best pomade. It keeps my hair so smooth and it doesn&#x27;t get sticky. Very easy to wash off.</li>
            <li> so far so good makes my hair nice and shiny no buildup washes out quickly. and i can mess with my hair throughout the day and it will still look shiny</li>
            <li> I purchased this brand of pomade last year and it came in the same shaped container, except that the pomade itself looked clear -- kinda like hair gel -- and didn&#x27;t have this white, cloudy look of my recent order. The new stuff looks like lotion and leaves white residue on my hair. However, it holds well and smells very nice. Although, I do wish that it held that \\&quot;wet-hair\\&quot; look/shine all day and that it wouldn&#x27;t leave any residue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t know if the company, AC, has changed its ingredients or that I ordered a different \\&quot;kind\\&quot; before. All I know is that the product is not the same as before, even  though the packaging/label looks the same.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But having said all of that, I still recommend the product if you&#x27;re desperate to manage your unmanageable hair and don&#x27;t want to spend a fortune on products. Most other products that I have used (hair spray, gels) have either not worked well, or have worked but have then damaged my hair a few months later. For example, one brand of hair spray that gave my hair shine and control caused some hair loss. So, again, even with the residue on my hair (it&#x27;s not much, but it&#x27;s noticeable), I still will use this pomade as it isn&#x27;t too expensive and gives me most, if not all, of what I&#x27;m looking for.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;ve got fine, straight hair....this stuff looks about as good as a fat chick in a modeling photo.  The hold, for that hair type, is next to none, and it makes it look like I just woke up and headed out for the day.  If you want some pretty good, medium hold, water based pomade, give Suavesito a shot.  It&#x27;s not spectacular, but it sure beats this stuff.</li>
            <li> O.K. I need to be clear about this. This is a product review of what i received. I ordered from JV Beauty Supply through Amazon. JV Beauty Supply apparently does &amp;#34;quality checks&amp;#34; on everything that they ship. So expect what you get from them to be opened. Now something that is going to be on my body or hair that is not sealed honestly, is kinda gross. What I got looked like it was a crew pomade made up of lesser crew pomades. Like someone took 4 almost gone containers rolled them together and placed into a new one.&lt;br /&gt;Now on to the quality of product I received. It has a good scent. Not overly a perfume smell or musky, just nice. It goes well through dry hair and has a decent enough hold to pull into a clean bun or ponytail. It will even do a decent slickback if you have an undercut, but I would bring a comb to fix it. If gets windy or hot it falls on you. It does re-comb pretty good though. Now as my preferred style is a slickback I think I would like something with a little more hold&lt;br /&gt;Honestly I really would like to get this item directly from crew to give it an honest review. I just don&#x27;t know if what I received convinced me to want to give it another try. If I do and it warrants an update to this review, I will do so. If I try and it still mostly does not impress I may just leave it as is</li>
            <li> Not sticky and gives a good shine to my short hair. It&#x27;s light so doesn&#x27;t weigh down your hair especially in muggy conditions.</li>
            <li> Great for all hair types and styles.</li>
            <li> This is a new style of pomade that American Crew puts out. I like it more because it washes out much easier but still has the same hold.</li>
            <li> Hold the hair really well without being too sticky or stiff. I use this all the time</li>
            <li> I PROBABLY should give this 5 stars -- since I haven&#x27;t had anything better...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BUT -- I keep thinking that there SHOULD be something a little LIGHTER and better..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I just haven&#x27;t found it yet...</li>
            <li> I am a male in my early 30&#x27;s have very thick hair which can be hard to manage.  I have been using this product since my early 20&#x27;s and it&#x27;s really the only hair product that I like.  I bought a cheaper pomade once from Walmart; it worked but I didn&#x27;t like it as good as the Crew Pomade.  Crew Pomade smells good, it doesn&#x27;t make my hair feel grimy.  It holds my hair in place very well, without making it stiff.  There have been times I went to sleep without washing it out, and when I woke up my hair was messed up.  So I just sprinkle some water on my hair and I am able to recomb it.  It works best for me after I shower and my hair is damp, but not soaking wet.  I usually towel dry my hair, then apply and style.  Great product!  The price has really gone up in the stores over the last several years, so I turned to Amazon and I can get it shipped to my home for about $5 less than buying it from Walmart!  And by the way, I noticed some of the other reviews reported that they changed their product.  I have been using this product for years and haven&#x27;t noticed any change.  So I&#x27;m not sure what they are referring to.</li>
            <li> In my many years of experience with all different types of pomades, American Crew is the most frustrating; not only because the price is outrageous but because it is actually a very inferior product. If you have longer hair and are going for something like a pompadour or anything that requires hold, this stuff will not work. It lasts about 2 hours tops, and as soon as you&#x27;re in the sun, it melts out. The worst part is that people buy into it because it&#x27;s expensive and is marketed well. Suave used to make a water based pomade similar to this one for $3 that smelled better and held about 4 times stronger. If you have a lot of hair to work with I would recommend Murray&#x27;s or Royal Crown, as they are the last few pomade&#x27;s left that haven&#x27;t been put out of business by American Crew. They&#x27;re oil based which takes a little time to get used to, but after a week you&#x27;ll be glad you switched. If you need something water based, I&#x27;d say just go with Axe. I&#x27;m not a huge fan of Axe either, but it&#x27;s about twice as strong and half the price of American Crew. The bottom line is that this product is probably the worst and weakest pomade out there next to got2b&#x27;s brand and they have the nerve to charge up to 5 times more than some better pomades.</li>
            <li> This is great for men with curly hair. It helps the curls stay together and not becoming frizzy. Works best if your hands are dry and your hair is damp to wet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It isn&#x27;t that much cheaper than at the grocery store, but I&#x27;ll keep buying online to save $5.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve ordered these several times before from different sites and these were the quality I was used to. The clear pomade that made Crew. Paid a couple dollars more than the usual discounts but they were worth it.</li>
            <li> Best pomade out there. Medium-light hold with medium shine. I&#x27;ve tried a lot of different pomades and this is easily the best.</li>
            <li> Barber used this on me for the first time a couple haircuts ago, it adds just a touch of hold and shine for my style.  Don&#x27;t get this expecting a super firm hold, but it&#x27;s great if you just need a little help</li>
            <li> Great value! Cheaper than I can buy locally</li>
            <li> This stuff is great. As a guy, I like to style my fair but without the shine or stiffness of gel. I can run my hands through my hair without knowing their is product in it. Hair stays formed all day long. It is also much cheaper in a 2-pack on Amazon than buying from target or elsewhere</li>
            <li> I use this pomade only on my uncontrolled hair and it worked, it is not greasy and a regular shampoo will wash it off,&lt;br /&gt;pretty good stuff to use to control your hair when combing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  nice guy</li>
            <li> Have been using Crew Pomade for past 6 years, hair looks fresh washed most of the day and the hair feels soft on touch.</li>
            <li> Make you feel like James Dean.</li>
            <li> Item was delivered promptly and works as advertised</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t used this particular jar yet but I have had no problems with prior American Crew products/pomade.  The only issue I have is that my hair is starting to thin but that could be more due to that I am now in my 40s.  Oh well, I will still try and look cool for as long as I can!</li>
            <li> Been buying this one for the hubby for several years.  It&#x27;s a nice pomade with great shine and control, without being sticky.  Makes his sometimes-frizzy hair become manageable.  It&#x27;s a clear base product so you don&#x27;t have to worry about it leaving a white residue.  Will continue to repurchase this product.</li>
            <li> Excellent product.  The product is gel form which is much better than the paste type.  Easy application and all day hold.  Overall excellent product.</li>
            <li> Does not offer a good hold for more than 5 minutes</li>
            <li> This pomade is pretty good, nice smell and changes the color of my brown hair a nice brighter color. Holds for a couple days, always looks the best on the second day.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t hold very well, just makes hair look dirty.</li>
            <li> Very expensive for the amount of product received.</li>
            <li> Wanted to try something besides the usual 20 dollar imperial pomeade I usually get. Definitely worth it for the price and it wasnt a bad color like some others experienced. I even enjoy the smell. The hold is only okay though (my hair is probably too thick. Overall, more than worth the price.</li>
            <li> Started using this and liked it. Moisture, ok smell, and seems to hide the grey in my brown hair as an additional benefit. Now that it&#x27;s longer, it doesn&#x27;t seem to hold well enough, so I&#x27;ve been trying other manufacturers.</li>
            <li> NOT for curly or coiled hair! Excellent product, was a different color than the last bit I bought, but it still worked! Oh, and has a nice, fresh, subtle manly scent!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the real deal.  good stuff.</li>
            <li> Works great, doesn&#x27;t stay in your hair for days, smells good, and the price is right. Good buy!</li>
            <li> The smell of this pomade is too strong. Couldn&#x27;t wait to wash it out of my hair. Have been using Suave pomade but it is being discontinued and getting harder to fine. This expensive crap is replacing it.</li>
            <li> This pomade is great! It feels great also. At the time I had longer hair so it didn&#x27;t keep it up as I would have liked, but that&#x27;s not what it&#x27;s made for. It gave it nice texture and if your looking for any pomade this is the one to shoot for.</li>
            <li> had never used pomade before, so took a chance on it. I like that it washes out of your fingers really easily. It seems to wear off after awhile so you might need to reapply it. Personally, the smell is a little weird, and overpowers your cologne.</li>
            <li> Like other reviewers had said before me, there are actually two types of American Crew Pomade. The first can of pomade I got had a nice opaque color that smelled really good and had a great hold in my hair. My second order was the yellow, odorless one and let me tell you the hold is terrible. The yellow version does not last on my hair the whole day and dries out my hair. I miss the clear version and I don&#x27;t know why they would switch it up. My hair is fairly manageable (Straight, short and thin). I will never buy this product again.</li>
            <li> Good product.  Works well washes out easily.</li>
            <li> I have really thick hair, and I thought since this product said \\&quot;medium hold\\&quot;, it wouldn&#x27;t be strong enough- I was wrong. You don&#x27;t have to use a ton of it either. It does give your hair high shine like it says- but you do need to finish off with a good hair spray(that applies to ANY pomade).&lt;br /&gt;I used to use hair gel- and it does hold your hair in place, but it makes your hair scrunchy, which I don&#x27;t like.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t buy on amazon and paid about $18 I think, but that is pretty much standard for any decent pomade product.&lt;br /&gt;Give it a shot- I think you will like this product!</li>
            <li> Just how it&#x27;s described it&#x27;s a really great product first time using American crew product would recommend to anyone out there.</li>
            <li> Great product. Will buy again.</li>
            <li> Works well, smells great.  Could definitely be not as expensive.  Don&#x27;t know why I needed 10 more words. I was done.</li>
            <li> received as ordered...no issues.</li>
            <li> Love the smell, enjoy the look. Only reason for 4 stars is the Longevity of the hold. You are good for about 6 hrs then it will start to lose integrity. Not to say I won&#x27;t  order it again, I do like it.</li>
            <li> This is hands down the best smelling pomade for sure, the only thing is the hold is terrible. This might work for a slick back or spikey style, but if you&#x27;re going for a traditional tall pompadour you will be upset.</li>
            <li> I love the American Crew Pomade!!! There is no other like it. It is light and silky and it smells great.</li>
            <li> It worked as expected.  I don&#x27;t use it daily, just when I feel my hair is having a &amp;#34;bad hair day&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Best time to apply it is after you have towel dried your hair.  Rubbing it into your hands and applying evenly.  It feels a little &amp;#34;sticky&amp;#34; at first, but after combing and brushing, it leaves my hair manageable.  My hair doesn&#x27;t look &amp;#34;dried out&amp;#34;. Gives my hair a little shine, and it looks more &amp;#34;alive&amp;#34;.  Surprisingly, my hair feels &amp;#34;softer&amp;#34; to the touch.  Not sticky.</li>
            <li> I had doubts about this product, but after using I have seen results and I am amazed. Overall I am happy and would recommend.</li>
            <li> I heard only good things about this product from a number of friends and when I started using it I was not disappointed. I would encourage you to try it out.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite Pomade. I have tried many through the years and I always come back to this. For one, it washes out easy. I only use a little because I like the low hold, high shine look. So I dabble a bit in, comb, and I am ready to go. There is enough hold that my hair isn&#x27;t all over the place. But enough freedom that I don&#x27;t have &#x27;helmet hair&#x27;. The shine is great. Plus I only need a little bit. Everyone is different, maybe you are different from me however it is a quality product and it is well worth a chance.</li>
            <li> This is all I use now. Lasted me about a year. Have had compliments on the look and smell.</li>
            <li> Great product, good hold. Obviously doesn&#x27;t do well in high sunlight or heat. I also wish they would put plastic around it to prevent people from opening it and using it before it&#x27;s sold. Opening it and seeing a finger print is uttlery disgusting.</li>
            <li> We love this - best price is always on amazon</li>
            <li> It holds well, and remolds easily when my hair gets messed up. Leaves hair extremely soft when washed out.</li>
            <li> Good stuff, just a bit pricey.</li>
            <li> Great for keeping your hair nice and shiny and it holds good and smell nice too!</li>
            <li> Enjoy this, not greasy, easy to use once it&#x27;s in my hair, no scent, keeps my hair looking good throughout the day.</li>
            <li> Terrible product, don&#x27;t buy &amp; wasted your money. My son hairs are fine texture and easy to style but this product can&#x27;t even hold his hair up. Be aware: *NO RETURN*!</li>
            <li> No fuss hair taming in a minute. Easy to rinse out.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff. Been using it for years. I also use their pomade in the silver can, forgot the name, sometimes I use them both together. I wish the price was lower.</li>
            <li> Works just as advertised,</li>
            <li> This stuff smells great, holds well, and doesn&#x27;t make your hair crispy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It will take me a while to learn to use it, but it looks pretty righteous when I get it right.</li>
            <li> My husband loves this pomade and will use no other. It controls his hair without leaving a sticky or heavy film in his hair. The best part about this product is it washes out completely when shampooed. There&#x27;s is no residue or build up.  This is one fantastic product.</li>
            <li> MY HAIR IS TOO FINE FOR THIS PRODUCT, PROBABLY OK FOR THICKER HAIR</li>
            <li> This product adds a shine to your hair that makes it look more healthy.  I helps to keep your hair in place and has a pleasant smell.&lt;br /&gt;For gray hair, it helps to keep your hair down instead of standing up all over.&lt;br /&gt;You only need to use a little, the size of half of a pea is sufficient.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m giving this 4 stars, just because of the small quantity you get.  Works great,  you&#x27;ll be looking like Brad Pitt in Fury, before you know it. Unfortunately, after 2 or 3 weeks you&#x27;ll be out and back to your ugly self.</li>
            <li> Cloudy color, not as good scent, leaves your hair greasy later in the day.  Clearly the the real deal. Search for better.</li>
            <li> Been using this product for a few years.  For some reason, it&#x27;s no longer available locally - Amazon Prime to the rescue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This pomade holds my short hair cut / crew cut and doesn&#x27;t dry leaving a &amp;#34;flake&amp;#34; look on the air.  My wife likes the smell.</li>
            <li> I like this stuff, been using it for several years now.  However, I recently had a hair stylist tell me to try other products because my hair is very dense and boy was she right.  This stuff works pretty good but it&#x27;s definitely not the best option for my hair type.  I&#x27;ve finally given up using this stuff but it always did a decent job.  The price is also hard to swallow, I agree with a few other posters, a few dollars less and this would be even better, but for this price I&#x27;ll try something even better for my particular hair type.</li>
            <li> Ok, not really, but it is a great product that pairs well with some hairspray. By itself it provides moderate hold and sculpting ability with a soft and shiny touch. Did I really just type that? Time to do something manly to redeem myself!</li>
            <li> This pomade is the best. I have tried so many gels, waxes, mousses,  and other products to keep my hair under control without making it too stiff, greasy, or crusty, and  American Crew is the perfect one. It washes out well, it lasts all day and doesn&#x27;t cause build up. It smells really nice too. My girlfriend even smooths a tiny amount over her hair to tame fly-aways. She says it makes her hair soft.</li>
            <li> My hair make good now</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like it on my hair but I have a long beard and this stuff is great for my beard. Leaves it soft and the hold is really good. Just a little bit of shine and keeps my face moist. It is not sticky and washes right out with water in the shower. If I skip a day without showering it still holds my beard pretty good.</li>
            <li> Being an Amazon Prime member items arrived when promised. Quality same as hair salon but at a cheaper price. This is the 2nd purchase of this item and happy with it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried every brand of pomade that I could find and keep returning back to this.  Simply put, it does the job it&#x27;s supposed to, without any stickiness or shinyness.</li>
            <li> It good but when it&#x27;s in somewhere hot it hurts white and nasty</li>
            <li> Before trying American Crew I had used axe styling pomade but it cant be compared to this. This american crew product is truly a great styling product and it smells good. I have a combover haircut and it works well for me, can style my bair throughout the day.</li>
            <li> Great styling porduct. Offers stong hold and nice shine.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff. Not too greasy, doesnt melt down forehead, rinses out easily in the shower, very versatile. Always quality mens hair products from American Crew.</li>
            <li> Been switching between this and American Crew&#x27;s Fiber for years. Holds everything in place without feeling stiff. Has just the right amount of shine. Smells great. Not great for when my hair gets longer and curly, but this is best pomade regardless.</li>
            <li> [[VIDEOID:3f289aa36b698288bc165ba86afa81da]] This is a review for the kbkrisp YouTube channel.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s as good as it has always been.</li>
            <li> This pomade has a good hold without making your hair look &#x27;too gelled&#x27;.  Also smells good, which is a bonus.  A good choice if you are going for the &#x27;dapper&#x27; Mad Men look.</li>
            <li> One of the best hair products I have ever used!</li>
            <li> has great hold and a somehow satisfying scent.</li>
            <li> My husband has used this product for several years and I even sneak some when I need to tame my often frizzy hair. He has a pompadour and gets the control he needs with AC but can still wash it out.</li>
            <li> Works well for my medium length hair. would order again. Ive also tried the forming cream which works better and lasts longer.</li>
            <li> This was for my husband who&#x27;s been using it&lt;br /&gt;for a few years. He really likes it.</li>
            <li> Better than the fiber. Do not leave open for more than a day or it hardens.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t get this in my country but Amazon always comes through.  A great product.</li>
            <li> After utilizing the American Crew Pomade, I was fairly dissatisfied. My biggest complaint with the American Crew Pomade is that even with a small amount, it makes your hair extremely greasy. It also has a tendency to run and clump in your hair. Despite the clumping, it doesn&#x27;t hold well. Others argue that it is naturally a thicker paste as Pomade. Personally I prefer Axe&#x27;s Pomade which is much thicker and doesn&#x27;t clump. Axe&#x27;s Pomade is cheaper, holds better, smells better, has a better shine, and isn&#x27;t greasy.</li>
            <li> Great Product, delivery was slow.</li>
            <li> The only hair styling i have ever liked! Just ordered from amazon because my local grocery store was out of stock, while I was waiting for the product to arrive I purchased a couple other pomades and was very disappointed with all of them. Didn&#x27;t even come close to how nice this is during application - its silky smooth, doesn&#x27;t leave hair greasy or stiff, nice shine and really helps add body and an overall great look. HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS PRODUCT! Been using this product for many years. 5+ everyday.</li>
            <li> I love this, and so does my wifey. It leaves my short-medium length hair soft to the touch with a hold that lasts all day long. I tried American Crew&#x27;s Military Paste but it was not as good. My wifey says she will leave me if I discontinue wearing this product in my hair.</li>
            <li> A bit too strong of a scent for me.</li>
            <li> Great price.  Great product.</li>
            <li> love this! such a soft managable hold.</li>
            <li> Bought this because a friend with beautiful shiny short hair uses it. My hair is a bit longer (under chin) and it seems to weigh it down too much. But it does make my hair shiny and is not stiff or brittle at all, seems good for the hair.</li>
            <li> This is a decent product. It was the first pomade I ever used. It gives the hair some hold (hence the medium on the label), and does give a very high shine. My hair is wavy and this product certainly keeps the waves in the hair (which is something I usually do not like). Fortunately, I love the smell this product gives off. The scent smells like a hair product (I do not know how else to describe it) but I absolutely love it. I bought this product from Target for a much higher price than Amazon ($20). If you need a pomade right away, this product is carried at many retail stores. I gave the product four stars because of the accuracy of the label (medium hold and high shine) and because of the amazing scent.</li>
            <li> My husband loves using this, it smells great, it&#x27;s non-flakey, and his style lasts all day. I would definitely recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I have shorter hair and this is the best stuff I have found. I&#x27;ve tried everything too. I wet my head, work a small amount through my hair, then blow dry it however I feel like having it that day. Once it&#x27;s dry I clean it up, then my hair is good to go the rest of the day. Much much better than Axe or the other cheaper brands i&#x27;ve used over the years.</li>
            <li> Item arrived on time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product is definitely great for holding your hairstyle, although is it pricey.  So, when you can find it on a low price, buy them on a bunch (2-4) or something like that.</li>
            <li> It showed up quickly. And was what I ordered. It is exactly what he likes to use in his hair.</li>
            <li> My husband loves this product</li>
            <li> amazon has it for the best price. it smells great. easy to work into hair. easy to wash out. very versatile (if your hair is long enough). great texture. the shine looks great. not as much hold as you might think, your hair has to be pretty long for it to work. maybe its just me though. if you have money to spend, i&#x27;d say its worth it. but if not, try murray&#x27;s. (tip for murray&#x27;s: run hot water into or over the tin to soften it. use VERY sparingly.)</li>
            <li> This pomade is legit! I didn&#x27;t want anything to greasy or unnatural looking and this achieved the look I wanted. It even has decent hold I was in and open top Jeep and when I got to my destination all I had to do was touch my hair but with my hands and I was good to go! My hair is pretty thick and a little wavy\curly.</li>
            <li> Personally, I think this product is best for dudes who need a little bit of control and some shine. If you&#x27;re looking for an American Crew product that can slick your hair and hold well, invest in their Grooming Cream. You have to cake this stuff on to get it to slick your hair. It gives a low hold(unless caked on), and a healthy, satin shine. If you have long and/or curly hair, this stuff will work well to give some control and make it look healthy. The best part of it is the smell, the smell is like a very manly, clean smell. I&#x27;d kill to have the smell turned into a cologne.&lt;br /&gt;Overall, if you&#x27;re looking for pomade that will slick your hair, look elsewhere, in fact, check out Imperial. But if you need some control and healthy shine, buy this.</li>
            <li> I have little experience using pomade but have had success using other Crew products. So I gave this a try to help control slightly unruly hair. It works well. I especially like that it is water soluble, so is easy to  wash out.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure what to say about the other reviewers who have claimed to get a substandard product (yellow, smelly). This is my first time using this product. Mine seems to be clear (it&#x27;s a dark container) and smells like a hair product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have very curly hair, and to go without product would result in an undesirable poof of fluff. Likewise, I have no desire to slick my hair into highly gelled wet-looking but hard-as-a-rock curls. This product puts me nicely in the middle, and leaves my hair controlled throughout the day while retaining a nice finish (slight luster, but not wet) and without a feeling of residue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product feels very thick when you scoop it out and rub it on your hands, but when run through damp hair, thins out nicely. I only use my fingers (rather than a comb) because I like to keep the curls and avoid the potential for frizz / fluff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are like me, with curly hair and haven&#x27;t found a happy solution to control the curls while avoiding using multiple products, this is definitely worth a try.</li>
            <li> Nice pomade. Good hold. Good natural shine. Just don&#x27;t use too much.</li>
            <li> This product its miracle for the hair</li>
            <li> This is my only choice for pomade. It smells good, not greasy, and gives a good medium hold. Not to mention it makes your hair more shiny and new looking, which is great.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t stand up to sweat but other than that it is a good product that gets my hair to look and smell great!</li>
            <li> Sold as advertised and delivery was as promised. Good and reputable company and site. Very Pleased.</li>
            <li> This is the best product I have been able to find! My hair is thick and difficult for me to keep &amp;#34;clean and combed&amp;#34; but this product gets the job done!! It holds almost all day even when I have to put hats and helmats on for work reasons. All I have to do is swing by the bathroom and damp it to fix it!</li>
            <li> EXCELLENT STYLING POMADE WILL BUY AGAIN</li>
            <li> Like the old commercial - just a dab will do you. holds well, smells good and washes out easy.</li>
            <li> Anybody who is looking to buy this product! Let me tell how it will feels when you touch it and try to put it on your hair, it&#x27;s so dry that it pulls my hair. It&#x27;s not liquid enough to spread it between the hair. It&#x27;s really annoying. My barber recommend it but it looks like it&#x27;s not the same one!! The color of the box is black too! Simple tip if your hair is straight like mine. Don&#x27;t buy this product :)</li>
            <li> This stuff goes on clear and puts a nice hold on my hair. I&#x27;ve tried other similar products but like this stuff the best</li>
            <li> Best hair product I&#x27;ve ever used. Smells great, works well, washes out easily.</li>
            <li> this is the same product sold in many mens haircut stores. Great quality and price</li>
            <li> Love this stuff.  I end up using very little and get good results.  Well I think good results!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Was introduced to this at my regular haircut place.  I&#x27;ve bought this repeatedly since.  I&#x27;ve also bought other Crew products since.</li>
            <li> Moldable hair after applied, doesnt smell so good, oily smell</li>
            <li> Good price, good delivery and very good gel for a perfect hold. This is the best gel I have ever used in 30 years.</li>
            <li> I have thick and curly hair.  It&#x27;s kind of fro-y and frizzy.  I&#x27;ve been experimenting a lot with pomades trying to find the best one for my hair type.  I&#x27;ve tried some like Suavecito, which I think smells kind of funky personally, and this one just blows it right out of the water.  It has a really nice scent, not too strong but not too subtle either.  It holds my hair really well considering my hair type, and I don&#x27;t have to mess with it throughout the whole day.  The shine is also really nice, which is a big plus considering I have blonde hair, so it tends to make it &#x27;pop&#x27; more.  All-in-all, I&#x27;d say this is the best pomade out there.  If you&#x27;re curious about it, it&#x27;s definitely worth trying it for the price.  If you&#x27;re looking for a pomade for a greaser-style look then stick with Layrite or Suavecito, but if you want a really nice product to style your hair that won&#x27;t leave flakes or clumps after then this is for you.</li>
            <li> i have been buying this for years.  more lift and control than others.  smells better too.</li>
            <li> Great product.  Buyer ships lightening fast.</li>
            <li> I love this pomade, there are times where it feels a bit too greasy, but it&#x27;s because I put more in than usual as my hair gets longer. The problem is-is it gives your hair no lift.</li>
            <li> Update: Since I wrote this, I&#x27;ve changed how I do things. Now, I blow dry my hair bone dry, and then use the defining paste (matte, and holds good with just a tiny spritz of hairspray). I also have some left over forming cream, and it works really well too, just gives the hair a shinier look. For me, that shinier look is nice if I&#x27;m going to a wedding, or dressing up...that sort of thing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I blow dry the hair in the front up, blow dry the rest totally dry, put some defining paste in my palm, rub my hands together vigorously and warm it up, and then work it into my hair. I love the way the defining paste smells, matte looks nice, and it&#x27;s super easy to get that messy but controlled look. I have slightly wavy hair, not stick straight or curly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I decided to leave the rest of my original review below. Funny how the process changes over time! Experiment and have fun, but I personally think the Defining Paste is awesome for matte, and forming cream if you want a little bit of shine (but it&#x27;s harder to work into your bone dry hair, and doesn&#x27;t smell as good).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;********************************************&lt;br /&gt;Original Review&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used four different American Crew wax/pomades, and they are all great. They smell great, and they are relatively inexpensive. The hard part is figuring out...what product is good for what hair?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve gone from very short guy hair, to longer guy hair...and as I&#x27;ve done that, the American Crew product that I prefer has changed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With my hair really short, I was using their \\&quot;classic wax,\\&quot; which they no longer make. I started trying their Fiber product on that short hair, and it worked pretty well. Get my hair fairly damp, work the Fiber in, and it would give me good hold...little spike in the front. Another product I was using with my short hair was TIGI Bed Head Men Matte Separation Wax. That stuff is REALLY sticky...which is fine for short hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Before I move onto the Pomade,the other thing to consider is...varying the dampness of your hair prior to the product will have a HUGE effect on how it works. For example, you can have your hair fairly damp with the stickier (ie high hold) products, and still be able to work it in really well. As your hair gets drier though, two things happen. The hold becomes even MORE pronounced, but it also becomes harder to work into the hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So as I grew my hair out...the Fiber began to work less well. I had a lot more hair, and because it&#x27;s a \\&quot;higher hold,\\&quot; it actually started to weigh my hair down. Spiking up hair that&#x27;s only an inch or two long worked fine...but as my hair got to 3+ inches, it would start to fall over. And the Fiber is fairly sticky...so your hair needs to be fairly damp to work it in, but then it doesn&#x27;t want to stay up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now I will FINALLY talk about the Pomade!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had to move to a \\&quot;lower hold\\&quot; product...and I wasn&#x27;t used to this at first. I was leaving my hair fairly damp, and putting the pomade into that didn&#x27;t give it much hold at all (though depending the style you want...like a more traditional mad men kind of look without a lot of spike, then that would be fine). I wanted a little more spike and \\&quot;verticalness\\&quot; to my hair, so what I had to do was start drying it more. I&#x27;ve started using a blow dryer to \\&quot;train\\&quot; my hair in the direction I want, and to get it much drier (not 100% dry, but maybe 75%). Now the pomade has much more hold!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The other product I&#x27;ve been using is the Forming Cream. It&#x27;s similar to the pomade...but a little less shiny. It has worked well in my longer hair, and like I said before...to get any hold, I need my hair drier.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You will probably have to try a couple different products until you find the one you really like. But before you give up on any one product, vary the dampness of your hair first. Hopefully my experience will point you in the right direction. For short hair, use the high hold products with damp hair. For longer hair, use the low hold products with drier hair.</li>
            <li> Girls love this product. Is fairly light, hair still has movement. Highly recommended product, It can cause acne if left on overnight so make sure to wash your forehead.</li>
            <li> If you like spiky hair but not too spiky this is it</li>
            <li> Honestly, the Pomade is great. The best stuff you can get. Here is the weird thing about ordering it from Amazon:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First order: clear color - very nice fragrent smell&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Second order: yellow color - no fragrance pungent \\&quot;oil\\&quot; smell&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I much prefer the clear version I got on my first order. Both of them work fine, but it is just weird that I got two different looking and smelling products even though the label still has the same ingredients. I guess it is worth the risk considering the price point. I haven&#x27;t paid the $25 bucks to get it in a store, so not sure which one is typical of the pomade. Here is to hoping my third jar is the nicer version!</li>
            <li> Good product, very light, easy to wash from it, but it doesnt smells really good.</li>
            <li> This is NOT Pomade.  I have been using this product for several years and what was delivered to my house was a cream/fiber inside the container and not the usual clear product</li>
            <li> I use this every day and it seems to be the only product I can find that makes my hair look fuller, adds shine, and has a nice feel to it.  It also allows my hair to be very moldable and has a nice smell.  My only complaint is that I feel it is overpriced for how much you get.  If they were to knock off a couple of bucks I would give it 5 stars.</li>
