            <li>This cologne smells amazing.</li>
            <li>I got a sample that didn&#x27;t say for men, and it smelt amazing.</li>
            <li>We had searched for a scent that we both liked and I found this in a scratch and sniff in a People Magazine ad.</li>
            <li>Really nice smell.</li>
            <li>loved this product... smells just rite....:)</li>
            <li>Okay let me start by saying the Colonge my husband gets are good.</li>
            <li>MMMMmmm, nice..</li>
            <li>If sprayed on clothes it smells wonderful as well and lingers much longer (I can still smell it on my shirts after days).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>However I wish he liked it.</li>
            <li>When I&#x27;m in a crowd people often say \\&quot;what&#x27;s that nice smell\\&quot;</li>
            <li>Smells soooo good :)</li>
            <li>(I&#x27;m very anal about my colognes), I bought this scent based on the comments from Sephora.com buyers, and this is also one of Sephora&#x27;s best of 2008.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Nice gift, It is nice for the price I paid.</li>
            <li>Really nice fragrance.  </li>
            <li>This YSL kind of reminds me of wine, the way it smells.</li>
            <li>I also own this cologne</li>
            <li>my fiance was thrilled</li>
            <li>Smells nice</li>
            <li>but honestly I feel it&#x27;s a bit feminine.</li>
            <li>This is the absolute best cologne I have ever owned in my life.</li>
            <li>Bought one from Sephora for my husband and he liked it and finished it.</li>
            <li>Really nice stuff.</li>
            <li>Outstanding cologne at a good value.</li>
            <li>I have sampled this cologne at Sephora and liked the scent before buying it on Amazon.</li>
            <li>I got it for my husband as a Father&#x27;s Day gift and he liked it</li>
            <li>and i was reminded again why i liked this cologne.  </li>
            <li>Nice fragrance.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve gotten nothing but compliments on the La Nuit which is spectacular cologne, but haven&#x27;t gotten any compliments on L&#x27;Homme.</li>
            <li>This is absolutely the best cologne ever.</li>
            <li>Great smell be this is the real thing!!!</li>
            <li>Smells like the original !!</li>
            <li>This was a great bargain compared to full retail.</li>
            <li>I must say this is the best cologne for men, it has this unforgettable scent and its neither strong or weak just perfect.</li>
            <li>..shipped very quick as described, good quality perfume..</li>
            <li>it  perfect!&lt;br /&gt;One of my top 10 favorite perfume for good mood any season.</li>
            <li>The seller was great and the shipment was quick.  </li>
            <li>Product came in quickly, well packaged and smells great.</li>
            <li>Wow ! Smells amazing !!!!</li>
            <li>When you walk in a room people totally love the smell and they love you!</li>
            <li>nice Light essence!</li>
            <li>It has a really nice smell and I have received many complements about it.</li>
            <li>To top it all off Amazon does not allow you to return the item because federal regulations do not allow the return of hazardous or flammable materials.</li>
            <li>And equally importantly, the wife loved it.</li>
            <li>I must have been living in a cave all these years, because this is by far one of the best colognes I have ever used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;Either Yves Saint Laurent is trying to sell a more cost effective version of their L&#x27;homme cologne, or this is truly a faked</li>
            <li>Great fresh smell.</li>
            <li>It has a nice longevity to it, and I find it lasts longer than most colognes on me.</li>
            <li>It was an easy purchase and I am very pleased with it.</li>
            <li>However, if you&#x27;re a person who likes a scent that seemingly disappears but pleasantly reminds you from time to time that you are indeed wearing a sweet scent - L&#x27;homme is for you.</li>
            <li>Great product, for a great price, in stores this same bottle costs 75.00 plus shipping.</li>
            <li>that&#x27;s the right parfum very nice</li>
            <li>Great fast shipping!</li>
            <li>Great to wear to work or on a hot day.</li>
            <li>This fragrance has a delightfully sweet smell that doesn&#x27;t overpower, but has good projection and longevity.</li>
            <li>super bien !!</li>
            <li>This is a very smooth scent.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also very light and won&#x27;t be smelled by someone more than 3 ft away from you which I like.</li>
            <li>Very refreshing and original scent, love it.</li>
            <li>I love this cologne n</li>

            <li>My husband&#x27;s favorite.</li>
            <li>This is my boyfriend&#x27;s favorite cologne.  </li>
            <li>We ended up settling on this, and judging by the number of compliments I received leaving the mall, and from some of her friends once we were back at my place, I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s safe to say this cologne is an excellent choice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This has been my husbands favorite perfume for many years and the moment he put it on we knew.</li>
            <li>So this is probably one of my most favorite fragrances that I have tested out.</li>
            <li>I get many compliments on it.</li>
            <li>Love the fragrant.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>tried this from sample and love it so much&lt;br</li>
            <li>Yes it was everything and more</li>
            <li>I went to Nordstrom to pick out my scent then bought it online since the price is so much better on Amazon.</li>
            <li>Better than La Nuit because it is more versatile.</li>
            <li>I love this scent.</li>
            <li>For me 1 or 2 sprays before going out, and it stays with me most of the day.</li>
            <li>I love the way it smells on him.</li>
            <li>The REAL fragrance is great</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s inoffensive, but not boring.</li>
            <li>The scent is, for lack of a better word, enticing.</li>
            <li>I love L&#x27;homme Yves Saint Laurent By Yves Saint Laurent For Men.</li>
            <li>Girls absolutely love it.</li>
            <li>which is why I wanted more.</li>
            <li>Women LOVE this scent.  </li>
            <li>Absolutely love this smell.</li>
            <li>It makes your sweat smell better.</li>
            <li>Love the bottle too.</li>
            <li>/&gt;UPDATE: I absolutely love this.</li>
            <li>Love the smell of this.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>I would say it is a safe and versatile fragrance.&lt;br</li>
            <li>This cologne smells so sexy on my boyfriend.</li>
            <li>Love this fragrance.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t know what to expect ordering off of amazon since this is my first time, but my expectations were greatly exceeded, I ordered some cologne for my boyfriend&#x27;s birthday, and chose to have it gift wrapped so i wouldn&#x27;t have to since I&#x27;m not so crafty :-)</li>
            <li>so I am very familiar.</li>
            <li>30 yr old son loved it!</li>
            <li>I absolutely loved it and so did my husband ;)</li>
            <li>Smells soooo darn good and so much cheaper here!</li>
            <li>it is pretty good...</li>
            <li>It sweet and nice.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s been excellent (not to say flawlessly), but it&#x27;s kind of a disapointment that my first perfume coming from  Amazon turns to be a fake.</li>
            <li>he was not disappointed, he loves it!</li>
            <li>Great new cologne to try.</li>
            <li>Nice fresh scent that women love.</li>
            <li>Light and fresh scent, and at a really good price.</li>
            <li>most importantly, the &#x27;girls&#x27; love it.......</li>
            <li>It is a nice, fresh, warm-scented smell that anyone is bound to love.</li>
            <li>I love this cologne because it is elegant yet light and summery.  </li>
            <li>Unlike many colognes out there, this has a woody, fine wine scent without any synthetic overtones or undertones.  </li>
            <li>Not too high end of a price and smells nice!</li>
            <li>Its like a combo of smooth, sexy, clean and manly!</li>
            <li>This wonderful product came in the mail faster than I expected.</li>
            <li>A full, long-lasting, warm yet light fragrance.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s extremely rare that I want to repeatedly inhale my own cologne/parfum, but it happens.  </li>
            <li>The most revealing and significant  issue is the box...</li>
            <li>The nozzle looks more like a off-the-shelf design, and not the unique diameter of the Nordstrom&#x27;s.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve smelled the other YSL&#x27;s at the department stores, and La Nuit is the best.</li>
            <li>I have tried a LOT of different colognes, mostly from Amazon which received great reviews.</li>
            <li>Smells great when you put in on, even better two hours later.  </li>
            <li>, i bought it on the spot, L&#x27;homme is my go to cologne for fall/winter, the reason is because my skin gets too itchy with stronger colognes, this cologne is not so strong but it does have a kick too it.</li>
            <li>The musk is not too strong.</li>
            <li>I strongly recommend it.</li>
            <li>It is not too strong, which is why I gave this a 4.</li>
            <li>the price was good as well for a classic scent</li>
            <li>I am grateful they were able to do a full refund for me.</li>
            <li>Sweet, with a hint of ginger in the top note.</li>
            <li>Hands down the best smelling cologne ever.</li>
            <li>It smells heavenly through all the notes and dies down to a perfect amount of sweetness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>In the end this still won&#x27;t replace my Armani Code Black, but it will be a great addition to my colognes!  </li>
            <li>Great for church and social events.  </li>
            <li>Since my husband likes it and thinks it is fine, I am not complaining.</li>
            <li>This has quickly moved up to being my favorite scent.</li>
            <li>I love the scent, but it seems to wear off rather quickly.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Delivery was quick !</li>
            <li>pleasant and soft fall and winter fragrance.  </li>
            <li>Order was processed quickly with no glitches!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s super affordable on amazon compared to department stores!</li>
            <li>Very nice smell, for about 5-10 min, and after that you can barely smell it.</li>
            <li>The scent is absolutely fantastic, perfect for having guests over or cuddling with your significant other.</li>
            <li>Love it, exactly what I wanted!</li>
            <li>It smells fantastic.</li>
            <li>if you like light colonge.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not that strong and it&#x27;s clean.  </li>

            <li>you like light fragrant</li>

            <li>Got here safe and sound and right on time.</li>
            <li>Fragrance is genuine but too light than original I tried in Macy&#x27;s</li>
            <li>Still happy with it just like the other better.</li>
            <li>First of all, its Yves saint!!</li>
            <li>an older but elegant scent, you will love L&#x27;homme.</li>
            <li>then, when it dries its a wonderful FRESH fragrance, with notes light high notes of ginger but with some masculine clean and out of the shower freshness.</li>
            <li>Nice high quality fragrance</li>
            <li>This cologne is a sweet yet lightly musky smelling.</li>
            <li>Once again I was not disappointed.</li>
            <li>I originally discovered this scent through a sample tester.</li>
            <li>It was so worth it!  </li>
            <li>well worth the price!</li>
            <li>I first smelled this on my dad and immediately fell in love with it.</li>
            <li>This was a birthday present for my husband and he love love loves it!</li>
            <li>;) this is one of my favorite colognes .</li>
            <li>I am no expert in describing scents, but to me this feels fresh!</li>
            <li>The Top flap actually had another piece of cardboard glued to it so as to make the top seem more sturdy...</li>
            <li>and it takes more sprays because it does not shoot anything out when I first start to spray.</li>
            <li>We are both very pleased with the vibrant, fresh scent.</li>
            <li>It has a lighter / clean scent to it that has a hint of citrus.</li>
            <li>Can be used for any season and is not too clean or too musky.</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s a clean, clean clothes like smell -</li>
            <li>he&#x27;s such a great guy and was running low on his cologne already :D. Very pleased and thankful</li>
            <li>I was pleasantly surprised to have received my product safely packaged and gift wrapped in 2 days!</li>
            <li>very good cologne, but a little too floral and perfume-like for my taste.</li>
            <li>Even though i had read some of the claims other people said about it not being 100% authentic i decided to buy it anyways because it was a good price.</li>
            <li>It was really a good thing that I purchased this perfume from amazon, i got it for lesser price and still the original product.</li>
            <li>I am not using it often (save it for special occasions)</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s not like the original one i just finish (also fades way to quick).</li>
            <li>the immediate scent is of alcohol with a mild scent of the original essence of the cologne.</li>
            <li>Just a beautiful and well-formulated scent, it&#x27;s hard to say more.</li>
            <li>I am not a babe magnet when I wear this - just to be clear to folks who think thats what they will turn into with perfumes, but its a pretty damn good allround fragrance - day and night, winter and summer.</li>
            <li>I am thrilled that Amazon offers this product.</li>
            <li>YSL L&#x27;Homme is a cool sweet scent.</li>
            <li>Surprisingly, I received my package 2 days earlier than schedule</li>
            <li>Girls say that it smells too sweet.</li>
            <li>Got full refund for product.  </li>
            <li>Ladies definitely order this for your man if you want a good smelling cologne.</li>
            <li>And its so sweet.</li>
            <li>It smells good - but does not last long.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Size is good enough to be carried in hand carry on airplanes.</li>
            <li>Every 1-Star review I read before purchasing this was true.</li>
            <li>I am hoping to receive a full refund for my purchase since you can not return cologne but have not yet.</li>
            <li>But, if I had to do it all over again, I&#x27;d gladly spend an additional $20 for the real deal at Nordstroms.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Sweet.</li>
            <li>I purchased this cologne because I was given a sample of it the last time I was at the mall and instantly loved it.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;dont think you should hold this to a specific amount of words......not a good idea .....</li>
            <li>I got it after smelling it originally at Sephora, it was much cheaper on amazon!!</li>
            <li>Also the smell is strong at first but fades away.  </li>
            <li>It came in original packaging and smells as good and lasts as long as every bottle I&#x27;ve bought from brick and mortar.</li>
            <li>Very stylish, simple and clean.</li>
            <li>Fresh clean and citrus mix make this fragrance one of the kind!&lt;br /&gt;Very</li>
            <li>The smell is a fresh clean smell.</li>
            <li>Bought ten frangrances in the last year and this is the best of all.  </li>
            <li>The value of the product, however, is exceptional considering I almost paid twice the price for a smaller container.</li>
            <li>Amazon got it to me quickly and for cheaper than I could find at a store (i.e. Perfumania, Macy&#x27;s, Nordstrom, etc.).</li>
            <li>Definitely recommend this for any guy of any age, its very elegant for the price.</li>
            <li>Most definitely got my moneys worth!!</li>
            <li>Luckily, although these items were non-refundable, Amazon was kind enough to refund my full purchase.</li>
            <li>my new favorite cologne.</li>
            <li>I would definitely recommend this it really smells amazing!</li>
            <li>This cologne has a wonderful long lasting fragrance without being overpowering.</li>
            <li>I bought this for my son and he and his fiancee really love the masculine, not too sweet scent that it is</li>
            <li>Smell real good and it last a long time</li>
            <li>If you are unsure about buying, buy the smallest size and I guarantee you will come back for more!</li>
            <li>This overall is my favorite scent in the Universe!</li>
            <li>Regular user, and love it!</li>
            <li>Not a strong, attention getting scent that would bother others noses, a great scent that would be definitely work and church appropriate while fresh and attractive enough to wear out with friends or snuggle up close with.</li>
            <li>The smell is crisp and clean.</li>
            <li>It smells amazing and last for like 4-5 hours....</li>
            <li>was fast and accurate</li>
            <li>/&gt;It doesn&#x27;t project amazingly, but you can definitely smell it.</li>
            <li>but I didn&#x27;t get that amazing feel from the 2nd.</li>
            <li>Like France on cool, pretty day</li>
            <li>Well worth the price.  </li>
            <li>I constantly get people asking me why kind of cologne</li>
            <li>I honestly can&#x27;t remember the last time someone DIDN&#x27;T say &amp;#34;Wow, you smell good.&amp;#34; to me while wearing it.</li>
            <li>Definitely the kind of scent you wear while cuddling.  </li>
            <li>fresh and not very storng smells good...</li>
            <li>It is a versatile, fresh smelling cologne that I can say with 100% certainty is</li>
            <li>This is by far my favorite fragrance I&#x27;ve owned.</li>
            <li>Worth every penny.</li>
            <li>Not too powerful</li>
            <li>I own about a dozen different colognes, and have about 5 that I wear with regularity.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m most frequently complimented on by strangers and friends alike.</li>
            <li>makes my son smile</li>
            <li>Highly recommended, Speedy delivery, Fragrance last and smells good.</li>
            <li>It was not even the right scent.  </li>
            <li>Ive been searching for the right colognr for my biyfriend for xmas.</li>
            <li>I got a sample of this in the mail and knew right away</li>
            <li>but this one just feels right for anytime of the day.</li>
            <li>the original bottle nicely packaged and fully loaded with the authentic and long lasting &#x27;juice&#x27; of L&#x27;homme YSL.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The lid removal is a pain and sometimes pulls the spray nozzle off but is easy to fit back into place.  </li>
            <li>As I have a less-sensitive nose than most, I get used to a scent quite quickly and can&#x27;t smell it myself, so I like to alternate.</li>
            <li>this product was ok not what I expected was a bit strong for my taste.</li>
            <li>This cologne is great and I wear it everyday!</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t get me wrong, this is a top notch cologne and smells great, but in regard to my own personal taste, it just isn&#x27;t exactly my thing.</li>
            <li>All good strong long lasting Manly Colonges.</li>
            <li>Lots of compliments from the ladies, is not heavy or strong.  </li>
            <li>Fragrance is very nice on sweeter side and very subtle, just as i want my perfume to be, as i dont like strong smell.</li>
            <li>Not much to say other than one of the best colognes out there, espically for the price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It is such a nice smell and it isn&#x27;t too strong like the JAZZ cologne from the same company.</li>
            <li>, I have a nice collection of colognes and this is up there with the best in my collection, like Armani Code, Polo Double Black and Kenneth Cole Black,</li>
            <li>We buy it online now because the price is 25% higher in Nordstrom or Macy&#x27;s.</li>
            <li>Thanks Amazon!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried SO many colognes and this is only one of 2 that work with my body chemistry</li>
            <li>The One, my second favorite.  </li>
            <li>Shame on me, as I feel that this version is not the exact one that I am used to buying at dept stores.</li>
            <li>(there are many reviews complaining of such).</li>
            <li>Fits my chemistry and seems to last most of the day.  </li>
            <li>First impression: Distinctive scent.</li>
            <li>Amazon only charged $52 with free delivery and confirmation!</li>
            <li>This same cologne was being sold at a department store that rhymes with \\&quot;Lacey&#x27;s\\&quot; for 25% more than what it was being sold for on Amazon.</li>
            <li>Im sure this is different from the one I tested in the shopping mall.</li>
            <li>The perfume scent and bottle seem OK, but the inside perfume box had cutouts in the same shape and size of a department store&#x27;s security tag.</li>
            <li>THIS IS THE REAL DEAL!</li>
            <li>I will definitely buy it again but after try more products in my mind.</li>
            <li>I first came about this fragrance by way of a sample scent on a page of an Esquire Magazine.  </li>
            <li>Exactly as I hoped it would be.</li>
            <li>fell in love with L&#x27;homme YSL, so I purchased it for his birthday present.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know if that&#x27;s just the build of the package but the hot glue seal is just not the work of a brand like Yves Saint Laurent.</li>
            <li>I gave my dad a sample packet that I had received when I bought my cologne at Bloomingdales, which my dad tried out and knew exactly what he wanted.  </li>
            <li>People always comment when I wear this one (and I wear it quite often ;-))</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the same authentic cologne.</li>
            <li>It might seem to cost a lot but this bottle should last you about 6+ months; i love it and my gf does too.</li>
            <li>Just received my bottle yesterday and wore it today for the first time.</li>
            <li>Bought this one from Amazon since they said their supplier only sells authentic products.</li>
            <li>Hmm, not too sure about that as I think the smell is different from the one I bought from Sephora.</li>
            <li>The first time my husband bought this was in Paris, and he&#x27;s worn it for years.  </li>
            <li>so i know exactly how it smells.</li>
            <li>I am pleased with my purchase and especially with the price.  </li>
            <li>Not over-powering, but potent enough for the ladies to wonder what you&#x27;re wearing.</li>
            <li>I love this product especially on my husband</li>
            <li>It was as much a gift to me as it was for my fiance because I get to smell it on him every day!</li>
            <li>Do not worry about it being a knockoff, this is the real stuff!</li>
            <li>The same goes for the tabs that fold over to close the box on the top.  </li>
            <li>everything came in fast an no problems!</li>
            <li>Thank you, exactly what I was looking for at the time.</li>
            <li>So when I saw it here on Amazon at a much discounted price, I jumped on the deal!</li>
            <li>Good, but not long lasting.</li>
            <li>Great long lasting cologne, and a really good deal on such a big bottle.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a nice mix to use this with other musky colognes.</li>
            <li>It frangrance is very good, however the quality and smell goes away after only a few hours even if I spray alot.</li>
            <li>The scent is great and it&#x27;s subtle.</li>
            <li>Has a great, subtle scent that lasts.</li>
            <li>The packaging was smart and the cologne did not fail to impress.</li>
            <li>Additionally, I would offer L’Homme works across many age groups, and while many masculine notes are present, it is “soft” enough for those who enjoy fragrances that are closer to unisex.  </li>
            <li>whenever I use this product i always get positive feedback.</li>
            <li>If you like a long lasting, very pleasant floral scent, yet not over-powering, similar to Boucheron Jaipur....</li>
            <li>bought this after spending twice as much in store on my first bottle..</li>
            <li>It take awhile to wear off, and lasts pretty much all day.</li>
            <li>I was surprised how sweet smelling this cologne is.</li>
            <li>Amazing unique, masculine scent that works year round.</li>
            <li>and it has various of cool notes that you smell through out the day!</li>
            <li>The smell is not too overwhelming either (as long as you don&#x27;t spray too much).</li>
            <li>Gift for my BF who is VERY particular about his fragrances.  </li>
            <li>IT does smell so good as i know , but doesnt last long</li>
            <li>When I opened the shipping box not only was the cologne securely packaged in postal packing, there was also bubble wrap on top of the gift wrapped box of cologne for protection, I opened the gift paper a little bit to make sure the cologne was right, and it was, I would definitely recommend buying from this seller, thank you!</li>
            <li>Whatever the case, it seems that you&#x27;d be better off paying the extra money to get a new, legitimate bottle from places like Nordstrom or Sephora.</li>
            <li>A fragrance nearly 10 years old and still going strong.  </li>
            <li>The outside of the box looked fine with no damage.</li>
            <li>but it is still a very high quality product that I&#x27;d recommend.</li>
            <li>Some reviewers have stated that they think this isn&#x27;t the real YSL product, but we&#x27;re certain it is.  </li>
            <li>I was a little concerned about ordering cologne in a glass bottle online, but Amazon had such a great deal on it.  </li>
            <li>The smell is so great and refreshing that I was actually shocked to sense it after tiring meetings in the afternoon.</li>
            <li>Greeat price and fast shippping.</li>
            <li>This is the real deal not a knock off.</li>
            <li>Oh, my very kool.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping.</li>
            <li>I really has to get used to the smelling</li>
            <li>thank you so much...</li>
            <li>Not overpowering like L&#x27;Eau D&#x27;Issey for Men which made me struggle to breathe after accidentally spraying a bit too much on my coat.</li>
            <li>It saved me so much money.</li>
            <li>My family goes into my bathroom all the time just to smell it haha.</li>
            <li>hahahaha.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very selective because some scents give me headaches.</li>
            <li>It looks very suspicious to me.</li>
            <li>I do not believe this is the real product.</li>
            <li>I really like how suttle this scent is.</li>
            <li>They really knocked it out of the park with this one.</li>
            <li>A real touch of class.</li>
            <li>really like the scent, got it out of a magazine.</li>
            <li>service was very prompt.  </li>
            <li>really reliable when you say when you are going to get it.</li>
            <li>For all of the reviewers saying that this isn&#x27;t real or is \\&quot;fake\\&quot;- you need to get your head examined.</li>
            <li>and it smells absolutely nothing like the cologne we purchased from Macys.</li>
            <li>I found the 3.3 ounce here I was not hesitant to purchase it, for only 54 dollars, plus FREE shipping.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended!</li>
            <li>I can say until now, my whole Amazon experience</li>
            <li>:l I really like it.</li>
            <li>haha.</li>
            <li>The scent is classy and evokes a sense of success and accomplishment.  </li>
            <li>is the real deal.</li>
            <li>THIS VERSION ITS CHEAPER AND TEH REAL DEAL.</li>
            <li>Not the real deal, scent vanishes after 1-2 hours.</li>
            <li>we purchased it thinking it was the real thing.</li>
            <li>However, it is very non-offensive and women will like this a lot.  </li>
            <li>Its like an all-around winner.</li>
            <li>It is a very passive aggressive.</li>
            <li>I found it in a magazine and he absolutely loves it.</li>
            <li>Real thing.</li>
            <li>thanks</li>
            <li>Do I really need to say anything else about it....</li>
            <li>My girlfriend absolutely loves it.</li>
            <li>This is either: 1) a cheap knockoff, or 2) an expired bottle of the cologne because it&#x27;s been sitting in a warehouse for several years.  </li>
            <li>really?</li>
            <li>Sensual &amp; alluring, a must-have for every modern man.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>and I was introduced to YSL thanks to La Nuit and some recommendations from others.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li>, it was fast and I would recommend it to everyone</li>
            <li>If performance were better in the current formulation, this fragrance would be near perfection.  </li>
            <li>This is a great cologne with a very soft subtle scent.</li>
            <li>I love this product so much that I will continue to buy but just be more aware if its the fake or real.</li>
            <li>It has alright silage but an overall fantastic scent with decent longevity.</li>
            <li>More subtle and unique than D &amp; G</li>
            <li>This cologne is of an extremely high quality, while also being very affordable.</li>
            <li>Save yourself the hassle and purchase it at full price from your local dept store.</li>
            <li>The first spray out of the Sephora bottle was like reuniting with an old friend.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not bad, it doesn&#x27;t smell like water, but it smells like you&#x27;re a human...</li>
            <li>a Perfumania store thats why I wasn&#x27;t able to resist getting one.&lt;br /&gt;I ordered it from Amazon for almost half the price at Macys</li>
            <li>I have worn several colognes but this is definitely my all time favorite.</li>
            <li>I plan to stick with Yves Saint Laurent as my main cologne to use.</li>
            <li>Regardless, I remain committed to a solid recommendation adding L’Homme to any collection and a “Love” for the Fragrantica following.</li>
            <li>But at last I found one, and they (macys*) was willing to charge me 80 dollars (including items that I didn&#x27;t care about but they were giving it as a \\&quot;free\\&quot; offer).&lt;br /&gt;Boom</li>
            <li>It wasn&#x27;t until so many years later that I finally ordered it.</li>
            <li>I have found that L’Homme will work during any season and for most events – from formal to more casual outings.  </li>
            <li>Cologne is very personal, but I would say that of the many choices available this one would generally speaking be a people-pleaser due to its characteristics.</li>
            <li>Classic, highly recommend.</li>
            <li>At first I was a bit skeptical to purchase this product, since I have purchased this before from DUTY free stores and Macy&#x27;s for a lot more money.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend it.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend.</li>
            <li>The product came factory sealed, and is of just as high of a quality as it is when purchased from the department store.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I highly recomend it for men of all ages.</li>
            <li>this speaks highly of it.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t speculate on how this might happen in a warehouse, but it&#x27;s possible Amazon did not buy these directly from the original seller either.</li>
            <li>Just go to your local Department store and buy the real thing!!</li>
            <li>Due to concerns about a &amp;#34;knockoff&amp;#34; version, I wondered whether this would arrive in its original packaging, and it certainly did.  </li>
            <li>felt a bit off paying $60 for what is essentially a bottle of good-smelling alcohol, spices, and water, but I have to say that this stuff is worth it.</li>
            <li>I love the scent and it seems to last a long time.</li>
            <li>Worth the extra wait for shipping</li>
            <li>Hugo 212 Sexy to name a few</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried many and few compare to YSL L&#x27;homme.  </li>
            <li>After being unable to locate any more of the old YSL Pour Homme, I was afraid my husband would have to test drive some new scents, but this new one is very close to the original and smells just wonderful</li>
            <li>First I ordered the 2.5oz bottle of D&amp;G Light Blue and it was original as can be, same refreshing smell as the expensive one I bought from Macys</li>
            <li>The Amazon cologne only lasted about 20 minutes where as the Macy&#x27;s cologne is still going strong, 3+ hours later.</li>
            <li>Its a light, airier perfume scent, it first comes off as slightly feminine, like a light perfume with a little but of flower scent</li>
            <li>Long lasting, smells fantastic and without a doubt the real thing.</li>
            <li>This is new, but I do not think so.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The bottle had fingerprints on it, when it&#x27;s supposed to be brand new, smell goes away after minutes ...</li>
            <li>New sealed in box.</li>
            <li>This is my new scent.  </li>
            <li>Not only does it have a lasting smell that changes as it sits, but it&#x27;s just strong enough for other people to be able to smell it without it being &amp;#34;in-your-face&amp;#34; about it.  </li>
            <li>My favorite just doesn&#x27;t last as long as I would like!!!</li>
            <li>The fragance is soft but masculine and mature...and very elegant.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Cologne is all about personal preference so a real review really serves no purpose here.</li>
            <li>Not overpowering and yet strong and long lasting.</li>
            <li>Because clearly women are drawn to it!</li>
            <li>but this is a different one from the first I order.</li>
            <li>I have been wearing it for the last 1 week but the smell definitely is not like the original one.</li>
            <li>This YSL product was the first one that lasted the entire day.</li>
            <li>The exact same product was on sale for fathers day at macys and nordstroms for $75</li>
            <li>This is the favorite scent of a male friend, however I was looking for 2 other gift items for him.</li>
            <li>So far this and Rive Gauche are a must have in your arsenal!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not a bad smell but somewhat sweeter than I expected.</li>
            <li>NOPE it just is really light and not very strong as I would hope.</li>
            <li>The difference in the product I was sent v. the products that i previously received from Sephora and available at Macy&#x27;s is night and day.  </li>
            <li>but may be a bit strong for everyday use &amp;</li>
            <li>52.00 plus tax, it dosent last more than 5 and a half hours on my skin.</li>
            <li>Although it smells a little bit girlier than my other colognes, i love this smell and my lady agrees!  </li>
            <li>It works just fine as a signature scent, it can be worn everyday and the 3.3 ounces bottle can last for a whole year.</li>
            <li>was pleasantly surprised that it wasn&#x27;t leaking,</li>
            <li>I got this cologne for my husband--in his early 30s--for Christmas.</li>
            <li>Its for people whose noses are sensitive to smell as well</li>
            <li>After applying this in the morning, it&#x27;s completely gone by lunch time.</li>
            <li>laugh if you want, I know it&#x27;s silly, but if you really care how you smell and want to get the best quality for your money, you can&#x27;t go wrong with this cologne</li>
            <li>This rocks as far as cologne goes.</li>
            <li>Its too subtle..have to really sprinkle a lot for it to actually make me smell good..lasts about two hours.</li>
            <li>#34;if people at your work are sensitive to smell&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;use</li>
            <li>I was iffy about ordering this through Amazon after reading a few of the 1-Star reviews, but because of the lack of free time I have to go to a department store to buy it in person, I had to settle for this.</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s enough for me to be very suspicious about what I&#x27;ve just received and the authenticity of the product.</li>
            <li>I am completely embarrassed I bought this as a gift.</li>
            <li>I finally found a cheap option through Amazon, because buying it in stores is more expensive.</li>
            <li>Light or heavy?</li>
            <li>The knockoff version does smell very very similar to the real version</li>
            <li>Got this for my son as a Christmas present, &amp; he really likes the way it smells.  </li>
            <li>The scent, in my opinion is mature but subdued.</li>
            <li>It has a very unique aroma, and it not sweet like other modern perfumes.</li>
            <li>Smells amazing but the smell does not last long after using half a bottle or so (lasts may be 1 hr) .</li>
            <li>Colognes are full of essential oils and other scented chemicals that can be subject to leak, evaporation, and chemical changes over time when exposed to excess heat, light, and so forth.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m always sniffing my hubby when he wears this slightly floral sweet but musky.</li>
            <li>one of the best perfumes ever, specially for people who hate heavy perfumes.</li>
            <li>this is the only cologne of YSL that i own, i first smelled this cologne when a person randomly just walked by</li>
            <li>Originally purchased for my partner, but after wearing it a few times I just couldn&#x27;t ignore all the compliments.. From men and women alike.</li>
            <li>/&gt;This is understandable given the low price point that this is slightly older stock.</li>
            <li>This fragrance of for the man who wants to smell fresh but not necessarily sexy.  </li>
            <li>What first alarmed me was that the two boxes I received from Amazon had different style barcodes, Where as the style of the barcodes on the Macy&#x27;s boxes matched (and were also different than both of the Amazon</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s sweet with a little bit of spice.  </li>
            <li>The only downside is this will take more sprays than you&#x27;re used to and the staying power is not spectacular; it becomes very close to the skin after only about 4 hours.  </li>
            <li>To YSL: the cologne is a phenomenal product, but this business model for lesser-grade Amazon products is not good.</li>
            <li>the other one lasts very long but isn&#x27;t as smooth as this one</li>
            <li>The scent is hard to describe (maybe modern, fresh and sweet/woody?)</li>
            <li>/&gt;Finally, I ordered a new bottle from Sephora, which I know like Nordstrom sells only legitimate bottles.</li>
            <li>recently went to Macy&#x27;s with my girl to find a new signature cologne.</li>
            <li>The sprayer is larger, along with the whole bottle which is noticably larger.</li>
            <li>The product that I received from Macy&#x27;s seemed very legit, especially when compared to the product I received from Amazon (and yes, the seller of my 3.3 oz bottle was Amazon and not a third party).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Notice the major difference in color w/</li>
            <li>but the bottle i bought was new, never opened, and the real thing..smelled great..and was half price..</li>
            <li>Hard to argue a light, pleasing scent that stays with you without competing for attention.</li>
            <li>But to my surprise, this product came in the original packaging and smells and looks like all my previous, more expensive purchases.</li>
            <li>I ordered from Amazon, because they were listed as the seller and they are generally trustworthy.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very alcoholy smelling and the smell doesn&#x27;t last long.</li>
            <li>The no return policy on colgne does not help, but I am extremely disappointed with the product and more importantly the lack of quality control by amazon.</li>
            <li>amazon, saved nearly 30 bucks for the same thing.</li>
            <li>This is my second bottle so far.</li>
            <li>Be careful as this is not returnable, so if you want something that lasts, pay more and get it at the department store, it will cost less over the long run.</li>
            <li>I tried one spray of the &amp;#34;real&amp;#34; bottle on one wrist and one from the Amazon one on the other, and the Amazon one felt much weaker, more watery, and in general just a poor competitor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve owned this cologne previously plenty of times and first time purchasing it from Amazon.</li>
            <li>This bottle is exactly the same as each other</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used quite a few different brands in the last few years and have liked some of them.</li>
            <li>there are big scratches inside and even some cuts of the black paint (removed with a scalpel), you can tell for sure the box is not original.</li>
            <li>I believe my 2nd bottle was a fake because my 1st bottle was so amazing</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never gotten so many random compliments on it from complete strangers...</li>
            <li>I got my first bottle from Nordstrom, and I used it down to the last drop.</li>
            <li>the real version being much darker (yellow/gold) and the fake version being much lighter (white).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This colonge doesnt last and you can barely even smell it.</li>
            <li>He spray himself multiple times and we barely smelled it.</li>
            <li>Very subtle, almost floral bouquet on top of a solid woody smell.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had a few colognes in the past but this is my favorite.</li>
            <li>I bought this and other 5 perfumes and colognes and I couldn&#x27;t be happier about my products, all of them are originals and new and sealed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One very shady and suspicious thing is, and I wish I could show a picture, but the part of the back inside of the box (where it gives Flammable warnings)is missing part of the directions and the right corner of the box has been opened and resealed with HOT GLUE.</li>
            <li>I was very concerned to say the least about buying this cologne from Amazon, well, I emailed Amazon with my concern and they replied within 2 hours and assured me that all of their colognes and perfumes are bought directly from the manufacturers and 100% authentic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li> I got a sample that didn&#x27;t say for men, and it smelt amazing.</li>
            <li> We had searched for a scent that we both liked and I found this in a scratch and sniff in a People Magazine ad.</li>

            <li> Okay let me start by saying the Colonge my husband gets are good.</li>
            <li> MMMMmmm, nice..</li>
            <li> If sprayed on clothes it smells wonderful as well and lingers much longer (I can still smell it on my shirts after days).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> However I wish he liked it.</li>

            <li> Outstanding cologne at a good value.</li>
            <li> I have sampled this cologne at Sephora and liked the scent before buying it on Amazon.</li>
            <li> I got it for my husband as a Father&#x27;s Day gift and he liked it</li>
            <li> and i was reminded again why i liked this cologne.  </li>
            <li> Nice fragrance.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve gotten nothing but compliments on the La Nuit which is spectacular cologne, but haven&#x27;t gotten any compliments on L&#x27;Homme.</li>
            <li> This is absolutely the best cologne ever.</li>
            <li> Great smell be this is the real thing!!!</li>
            <li> Smells like the original !!</li>
            <li> This was a great bargain compared to full retail.</li>
            <li> I must say this is the best cologne for men, it has this unforgettable scent and its neither strong or weak just perfect.</li>
            <li> ..shipped very quick as described, good quality perfume..</li>
            <li> it  perfect!&lt;br /&gt;One of my top 10 favorite perfume for good mood any season.</li>
            <li> The seller was great and the shipment was quick.  </li>
            <li> Product came in quickly, well packaged and smells great.</li>
            <li> Wow ! Smells amazing !!!!</li>
            <li> When you walk in a room people totally love the smell and they love you!</li>
            <li> nice Light essence!</li>
            <li> It has a really nice smell and I have received many complements about it.</li>
            <li> To top it all off Amazon does not allow you to return the item because federal regulations do not allow the return of hazardous or flammable materials.</li>
            <li> And equally importantly, the wife loved it.</li>
            <li> I must have been living in a cave all these years, because this is by far one of the best colognes I have ever used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;Either Yves Saint Laurent is trying to sell a more cost effective version of their L&#x27;homme cologne, or this is truly a faked</li>
            <li> Great fresh smell.</li>
            <li> It has a nice longevity to it, and I find it lasts longer than most colognes on me.</li>
            <li> It was an easy purchase and I am very pleased with it.</li>
            <li> However, if you&#x27;re a person who likes a scent that seemingly disappears but pleasantly reminds you from time to time that you are indeed wearing a sweet scent - L&#x27;homme is for you.</li>
            <li> Great product, for a great price, in stores this same bottle costs 75.00 plus shipping.</li>
            <li> that&#x27;s the right parfum very nice</li>
            <li> Great fast shipping!</li>
            <li> Great to wear to work or on a hot day.</li>
            <li> This fragrance has a delightfully sweet smell that doesn&#x27;t overpower, but has good projection and longevity.</li>
            <li> super bien !!</li>
            <li> This is a very smooth scent.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also very light and won&#x27;t be smelled by someone more than 3 ft away from you which I like.</li>
            <li> Very refreshing and original scent, love it.</li>

            <li> A department store had this for $20 more than I paid for it here.  </li>
            <li> All time favorite scent.</li>
            <li> Couldn&#x27;t ask for more.</li>
            <li> Axe who? :)</li>
            <li> I get lots of compliments and many requests for the name of the product.</li>
            <li> I bought this fragrance for my husband&#x27;s birthday because this is his favorite one</li>
            <li> My husband&#x27;s favorite.</li>
            <li> This is my boyfriend&#x27;s favorite cologne.  </li>
            <li> We ended up settling on this, and judging by the number of compliments I received leaving the mall, and from some of her friends once we were back at my place, I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s safe to say this cologne is an excellent choice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This has been my husbands favorite perfume for many years and the moment he put it on we knew.</li>
            <li> So this is probably one of my most favorite fragrances that I have tested out.</li>
            <li> I get many compliments on it.</li>
            <li> Love the fragrant.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> tried this from sample and love it so much&lt;br</li>
            <li> Yes it was everything and more</li>
            <li> I went to Nordstrom to pick out my scent then bought it online since the price is so much better on Amazon.</li>
            <li> Better than La Nuit because it is more versatile.</li>
            <li> I love this scent.</li>
            <li> For me 1 or 2 sprays before going out, and it stays with me most of the day.</li>
            <li> I love the way it smells on him.</li>
            <li> The REAL fragrance is great</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s inoffensive, but not boring.</li>
            <li> The scent is, for lack of a better word, enticing.</li>
            <li> I love L&#x27;homme Yves Saint Laurent By Yves Saint Laurent For Men.</li>
            <li> Girls absolutely love it.</li>
            <li> which is why I wanted more.</li>
            <li> Women LOVE this scent.  </li>
            <li> Absolutely love this smell.</li>
            <li> It makes your sweat smell better.</li>
            <li> Love the bottle too.</li>
            <li> /&gt;UPDATE: I absolutely love this.</li>
            <li> Love the smell of this.</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> I would say it is a safe and versatile fragrance.&lt;br</li>
            <li> This cologne smells so sexy on my boyfriend.</li>
            <li> Love this fragrance.</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t know what to expect ordering off of amazon since this is my first time, but my expectations were greatly exceeded, I ordered some cologne for my boyfriend&#x27;s birthday, and chose to have it gift wrapped so i wouldn&#x27;t have to since I&#x27;m not so crafty :-)</li>
            <li> so I am very familiar.</li>
            <li> 30 yr old son loved it!</li>
            <li> I absolutely loved it and so did my husband ;)</li>
            <li> Smells soooo darn good and so much cheaper here!</li>
            <li> it is pretty good...</li>
            <li> It sweet and nice.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s been excellent (not to say flawlessly), but it&#x27;s kind of a disapointment that my first perfume coming from  Amazon turns to be a fake.</li>
            <li> he was not disappointed, he loves it!</li>
            <li> Great new cologne to try.</li>
            <li> Nice fresh scent that women love.</li>
            <li> Light and fresh scent, and at a really good price.</li>
            <li> most importantly, the &#x27;girls&#x27; love it.......</li>
            <li> It is a nice, fresh, warm-scented smell that anyone is bound to love.</li>
            <li> I love this cologne because it is elegant yet light and summery.  </li>
            <li> Unlike many colognes out there, this has a woody, fine wine scent without any synthetic overtones or undertones.  </li>
            <li> Not too high end of a price and smells nice!</li>
            <li> Its like a combo of smooth, sexy, clean and manly!</li>
            <li> This wonderful product came in the mail faster than I expected.</li>
            <li> A full, long-lasting, warm yet light fragrance.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s extremely rare that I want to repeatedly inhale my own cologne/parfum, but it happens.  </li>
            <li> The most revealing and significant  issue is the box...</li>
            <li> The nozzle looks more like a off-the-shelf design, and not the unique diameter of the Nordstrom&#x27;s.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve smelled the other YSL&#x27;s at the department stores, and La Nuit is the best.</li>
            <li> I have tried a LOT of different colognes, mostly from Amazon which received great reviews.</li>
            <li> Smells great when you put in on, even better two hours later.  </li>
            <li> , i bought it on the spot, L&#x27;homme is my go to cologne for fall/winter, the reason is because my skin gets too itchy with stronger colognes, this cologne is not so strong but it does have a kick too it.</li>
            <li> The musk is not too strong.</li>
            <li> I strongly recommend it.</li>
            <li> It is not too strong, which is why I gave this a 4.</li>
            <li> the price was good as well for a classic scent</li>
            <li> I am grateful they were able to do a full refund for me.</li>
            <li> Sweet, with a hint of ginger in the top note.</li>
            <li> Hands down the best smelling cologne ever.</li>
            <li> It smells heavenly through all the notes and dies down to a perfect amount of sweetness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> In the end this still won&#x27;t replace my Armani Code Black, but it will be a great addition to my colognes!  </li>
            <li> Great for church and social events.  </li>
            <li> Since my husband likes it and thinks it is fine, I am not complaining.</li>
            <li> This has quickly moved up to being my favorite scent.</li>
            <li> I love the scent, but it seems to wear off rather quickly.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Delivery was quick !</li>
            <li> pleasant and soft fall and winter fragrance.  </li>
            <li> Order was processed quickly with no glitches!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s super affordable on amazon compared to department stores!</li>
            <li> Very nice smell, for about 5-10 min, and after that you can barely smell it.</li>
            <li> The scent is absolutely fantastic, perfect for having guests over or cuddling with your significant other.</li>
            <li> Love it, exactly what I wanted!</li>
            <li> It smells fantastic.</li>
            <li> if you like light colonge.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not that strong and it&#x27;s clean.  </li>
            <li> Not over powering or too light.  </li>
            <li> This is the absolute real deal, shipped fast and smells AWESOME.</li>
            <li> and it arrived in the same great packaging.  </li>
            <li> Real clean and crisp smell but does not smell like a soap.</li>
            <li> Light.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a fabulous scent.</li>
            <li> Shipment arrived on time and free of charge</li>
            <li> I have worn plenty of cologne in my day and I must say, this stuff is fantastic.</li>
            <li> Next up in this great line of frags.....</li>
            <li> you like light fragrant</li>
            <li> This perfume smells great, but don&#x27;t expect it to last for 8 hours.</li>
            <li> Got here safe and sound and right on time.</li>
            <li> Fragrance is genuine but too light than original I tried in Macy&#x27;s</li>
            <li> Still happy with it just like the other better.</li>
            <li> First of all, its Yves saint!!</li>
            <li> an older but elegant scent, you will love L&#x27;homme.</li>
            <li> then, when it dries its a wonderful FRESH fragrance, with notes light high notes of ginger but with some masculine clean and out of the shower freshness.</li>
            <li> Nice high quality fragrance</li>
            <li> This cologne is a sweet yet lightly musky smelling.</li>
            <li> Once again I was not disappointed.</li>
            <li> I originally discovered this scent through a sample tester.</li>
            <li> It was so worth it!  </li>
            <li> well worth the price!</li>
            <li> I first smelled this on my dad and immediately fell in love with it.</li>
            <li> This was a birthday present for my husband and he love love loves it!</li>
            <li> ;) this is one of my favorite colognes .</li>
            <li> I am no expert in describing scents, but to me this feels fresh!</li>
            <li> The Top flap actually had another piece of cardboard glued to it so as to make the top seem more sturdy...</li>
            <li> and it takes more sprays because it does not shoot anything out when I first start to spray.</li>
            <li> We are both very pleased with the vibrant, fresh scent.</li>
            <li> It has a lighter / clean scent to it that has a hint of citrus.</li>
            <li> Can be used for any season and is not too clean or too musky.</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s a clean, clean clothes like smell -</li>
            <li> he&#x27;s such a great guy and was running low on his cologne already :D. Very pleased and thankful</li>
            <li> I was pleasantly surprised to have received my product safely packaged and gift wrapped in 2 days!</li>
            <li> very good cologne, but a little too floral and perfume-like for my taste.</li>
            <li> Even though i had read some of the claims other people said about it not being 100% authentic i decided to buy it anyways because it was a good price.</li>
            <li> It was really a good thing that I purchased this perfume from amazon, i got it for lesser price and still the original product.</li>
            <li> I am not using it often (save it for special occasions)</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s not like the original one i just finish (also fades way to quick).</li>
            <li> the immediate scent is of alcohol with a mild scent of the original essence of the cologne.</li>
            <li> Just a beautiful and well-formulated scent, it&#x27;s hard to say more.</li>
            <li> I am not a babe magnet when I wear this - just to be clear to folks who think thats what they will turn into with perfumes, but its a pretty damn good allround fragrance - day and night, winter and summer.</li>
            <li> I am thrilled that Amazon offers this product.</li>
            <li> YSL L&#x27;Homme is a cool sweet scent.</li>
            <li> Surprisingly, I received my package 2 days earlier than schedule</li>
            <li> Girls say that it smells too sweet.</li>
            <li> Got full refund for product.  </li>
            <li> Ladies definitely order this for your man if you want a good smelling cologne.</li>
            <li> And its so sweet.</li>
            <li> It smells good - but does not last long.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Size is good enough to be carried in hand carry on airplanes.</li>
            <li> Every 1-Star review I read before purchasing this was true.</li>
            <li> I am hoping to receive a full refund for my purchase since you can not return cologne but have not yet.</li>
            <li> But, if I had to do it all over again, I&#x27;d gladly spend an additional $20 for the real deal at Nordstroms.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Sweet.</li>
            <li> I purchased this cologne because I was given a sample of it the last time I was at the mall and instantly loved it.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;dont think you should hold this to a specific amount of words......not a good idea .....</li>
            <li> I got it after smelling it originally at Sephora, it was much cheaper on amazon!!</li>
            <li> Also the smell is strong at first but fades away.  </li>
            <li> It came in original packaging and smells as good and lasts as long as every bottle I&#x27;ve bought from brick and mortar.</li>
            <li> Very stylish, simple and clean.</li>
            <li> Fresh clean and citrus mix make this fragrance one of the kind!&lt;br /&gt;Very</li>
            <li> The smell is a fresh clean smell.</li>
            <li> Bought ten frangrances in the last year and this is the best of all.  </li>
            <li> The value of the product, however, is exceptional considering I almost paid twice the price for a smaller container.</li>
            <li> Amazon got it to me quickly and for cheaper than I could find at a store (i.e. Perfumania, Macy&#x27;s, Nordstrom, etc.).</li>
            <li> Definitely recommend this for any guy of any age, its very elegant for the price.</li>
            <li> Most definitely got my moneys worth!!</li>
            <li> Luckily, although these items were non-refundable, Amazon was kind enough to refund my full purchase.</li>
            <li> my new favorite cologne.</li>
            <li> I would definitely recommend this it really smells amazing!</li>
            <li> This cologne has a wonderful long lasting fragrance without being overpowering.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my son and he and his fiancee really love the masculine, not too sweet scent that it is</li>
            <li> Smell real good and it last a long time</li>
            <li> If you are unsure about buying, buy the smallest size and I guarantee you will come back for more!</li>
            <li> This overall is my favorite scent in the Universe!</li>
            <li> Regular user, and love it!</li>
            <li> Not a strong, attention getting scent that would bother others noses, a great scent that would be definitely work and church appropriate while fresh and attractive enough to wear out with friends or snuggle up close with.</li>
            <li> The smell is crisp and clean.</li>
            <li> It smells amazing and last for like 4-5 hours....</li>
            <li> was fast and accurate</li>
            <li> /&gt;It doesn&#x27;t project amazingly, but you can definitely smell it.</li>
            <li> but I didn&#x27;t get that amazing feel from the 2nd.</li>
            <li> Like France on cool, pretty day</li>
            <li> Well worth the price.  </li>
            <li> I constantly get people asking me why kind of cologne</li>
            <li> I honestly can&#x27;t remember the last time someone DIDN&#x27;T say &amp;#34;Wow, you smell good.&amp;#34; to me while wearing it.</li>
            <li> Definitely the kind of scent you wear while cuddling.  </li>
            <li> fresh and not very storng smells good...</li>
            <li> It is a versatile, fresh smelling cologne that I can say with 100% certainty is</li>
            <li> This is by far my favorite fragrance I&#x27;ve owned.</li>
            <li> Worth every penny.</li>
            <li> Not too powerful</li>
            <li> I own about a dozen different colognes, and have about 5 that I wear with regularity.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m most frequently complimented on by strangers and friends alike.</li>
            <li> makes my son smile</li>
            <li> Highly recommended, Speedy delivery, Fragrance last and smells good.</li>
            <li> It was not even the right scent.  </li>
            <li> Ive been searching for the right colognr for my biyfriend for xmas.</li>
            <li> I got a sample of this in the mail and knew right away</li>
            <li> but this one just feels right for anytime of the day.</li>
            <li> the original bottle nicely packaged and fully loaded with the authentic and long lasting &#x27;juice&#x27; of L&#x27;homme YSL.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The lid removal is a pain and sometimes pulls the spray nozzle off but is easy to fit back into place.  </li>
            <li> As I have a less-sensitive nose than most, I get used to a scent quite quickly and can&#x27;t smell it myself, so I like to alternate.</li>
            <li> this product was ok not what I expected was a bit strong for my taste.</li>
            <li> This cologne is great and I wear it everyday!</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t get me wrong, this is a top notch cologne and smells great, but in regard to my own personal taste, it just isn&#x27;t exactly my thing.</li>
            <li> All good strong long lasting Manly Colonges.</li>
            <li> Lots of compliments from the ladies, is not heavy or strong.  </li>
            <li> Fragrance is very nice on sweeter side and very subtle, just as i want my perfume to be, as i dont like strong smell.</li>
            <li> Not much to say other than one of the best colognes out there, espically for the price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It is such a nice smell and it isn&#x27;t too strong like the JAZZ cologne from the same company.</li>
            <li> , I have a nice collection of colognes and this is up there with the best in my collection, like Armani Code, Polo Double Black and Kenneth Cole Black,</li>
            <li> We buy it online now because the price is 25% higher in Nordstrom or Macy&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> Thanks Amazon!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried SO many colognes and this is only one of 2 that work with my body chemistry</li>
            <li> The One, my second favorite.  </li>
            <li> Shame on me, as I feel that this version is not the exact one that I am used to buying at dept stores.</li>
            <li> (there are many reviews complaining of such).</li>
            <li> Fits my chemistry and seems to last most of the day.  </li>
            <li> First impression: Distinctive scent.</li>
            <li> Amazon only charged $52 with free delivery and confirmation!</li>
            <li> This same cologne was being sold at a department store that rhymes with \\&quot;Lacey&#x27;s\\&quot; for 25% more than what it was being sold for on Amazon.</li>
            <li> Im sure this is different from the one I tested in the shopping mall.</li>
            <li> The perfume scent and bottle seem OK, but the inside perfume box had cutouts in the same shape and size of a department store&#x27;s security tag.</li>
            <li> THIS IS THE REAL DEAL!</li>
            <li> I will definitely buy it again but after try more products in my mind.</li>
            <li> I first came about this fragrance by way of a sample scent on a page of an Esquire Magazine.  </li>
            <li> Exactly as I hoped it would be.</li>
            <li> fell in love with L&#x27;homme YSL, so I purchased it for his birthday present.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if that&#x27;s just the build of the package but the hot glue seal is just not the work of a brand like Yves Saint Laurent.</li>
            <li> I gave my dad a sample packet that I had received when I bought my cologne at Bloomingdales, which my dad tried out and knew exactly what he wanted.  </li>
            <li> People always comment when I wear this one (and I wear it quite often ;-))</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the same authentic cologne.</li>
            <li> It might seem to cost a lot but this bottle should last you about 6+ months; i love it and my gf does too.</li>
            <li> Just received my bottle yesterday and wore it today for the first time.</li>
            <li> Bought this one from Amazon since they said their supplier only sells authentic products.</li>
            <li> Hmm, not too sure about that as I think the smell is different from the one I bought from Sephora.</li>
            <li> The first time my husband bought this was in Paris, and he&#x27;s worn it for years.  </li>
            <li> so i know exactly how it smells.</li>
            <li> I am pleased with my purchase and especially with the price.  </li>
            <li> Not over-powering, but potent enough for the ladies to wonder what you&#x27;re wearing.</li>
            <li> I love this product especially on my husband</li>
            <li> It was as much a gift to me as it was for my fiance because I get to smell it on him every day!</li>
            <li> Do not worry about it being a knockoff, this is the real stuff!</li>
            <li> The same goes for the tabs that fold over to close the box on the top.  </li>
            <li> everything came in fast an no problems!</li>
            <li> Thank you, exactly what I was looking for at the time.</li>
            <li> So when I saw it here on Amazon at a much discounted price, I jumped on the deal!</li>
            <li> Good, but not long lasting.</li>
            <li> Great long lasting cologne, and a really good deal on such a big bottle.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a nice mix to use this with other musky colognes.</li>
            <li> It frangrance is very good, however the quality and smell goes away after only a few hours even if I spray alot.</li>
            <li> The scent is great and it&#x27;s subtle.</li>
            <li> Has a great, subtle scent that lasts.</li>
            <li> The packaging was smart and the cologne did not fail to impress.</li>
            <li> Additionally, I would offer L’Homme works across many age groups, and while many masculine notes are present, it is “soft” enough for those who enjoy fragrances that are closer to unisex.  </li>
            <li> whenever I use this product i always get positive feedback.</li>
            <li> If you like a long lasting, very pleasant floral scent, yet not over-powering, similar to Boucheron Jaipur....</li>
            <li> bought this after spending twice as much in store on my first bottle..</li>
            <li> It take awhile to wear off, and lasts pretty much all day.</li>
            <li> I was surprised how sweet smelling this cologne is.</li>
            <li> Amazing unique, masculine scent that works year round.</li>
            <li> and it has various of cool notes that you smell through out the day!</li>
            <li> The smell is not too overwhelming either (as long as you don&#x27;t spray too much).</li>
            <li> Gift for my BF who is VERY particular about his fragrances.  </li>
            <li> IT does smell so good as i know , but doesnt last long</li>
            <li> When I opened the shipping box not only was the cologne securely packaged in postal packing, there was also bubble wrap on top of the gift wrapped box of cologne for protection, I opened the gift paper a little bit to make sure the cologne was right, and it was, I would definitely recommend buying from this seller, thank you!</li>
            <li> Whatever the case, it seems that you&#x27;d be better off paying the extra money to get a new, legitimate bottle from places like Nordstrom or Sephora.</li>
            <li> A fragrance nearly 10 years old and still going strong.  </li>
            <li> The outside of the box looked fine with no damage.</li>
            <li> but it is still a very high quality product that I&#x27;d recommend.</li>
            <li> Some reviewers have stated that they think this isn&#x27;t the real YSL product, but we&#x27;re certain it is.  </li>
            <li> I was a little concerned about ordering cologne in a glass bottle online, but Amazon had such a great deal on it.  </li>
            <li> The smell is so great and refreshing that I was actually shocked to sense it after tiring meetings in the afternoon.</li>
            <li> Greeat price and fast shippping.</li>
            <li> This is the real deal not a knock off.</li>
            <li> Oh, my very kool.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping.</li>
            <li> I really has to get used to the smelling</li>
            <li> thank you so much...</li>
            <li> Not overpowering like L&#x27;Eau D&#x27;Issey for Men which made me struggle to breathe after accidentally spraying a bit too much on my coat.</li>
            <li> It saved me so much money.</li>
            <li> My family goes into my bathroom all the time just to smell it haha.</li>
            <li> hahahaha.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very selective because some scents give me headaches.</li>
            <li> It looks very suspicious to me.</li>
            <li> I do not believe this is the real product.</li>
            <li> I really like how suttle this scent is.</li>
            <li> They really knocked it out of the park with this one.</li>
            <li> A real touch of class.</li>
            <li> really like the scent, got it out of a magazine.</li>
            <li> service was very prompt.  </li>
            <li> really reliable when you say when you are going to get it.</li>
            <li> For all of the reviewers saying that this isn&#x27;t real or is \\&quot;fake\\&quot;- you need to get your head examined.</li>
            <li> and it smells absolutely nothing like the cologne we purchased from Macys.</li>
            <li> I found the 3.3 ounce here I was not hesitant to purchase it, for only 54 dollars, plus FREE shipping.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> I can say until now, my whole Amazon experience</li>
            <li> :l I really like it.</li>
            <li> haha.</li>
            <li> The scent is classy and evokes a sense of success and accomplishment.  </li>
            <li> is the real deal.</li>
            <li> THIS VERSION ITS CHEAPER AND TEH REAL DEAL.</li>
            <li> Not the real deal, scent vanishes after 1-2 hours.</li>
            <li> we purchased it thinking it was the real thing.</li>
            <li> However, it is very non-offensive and women will like this a lot.  </li>
            <li> Its like an all-around winner.</li>
            <li> It is a very passive aggressive.</li>
            <li> I found it in a magazine and he absolutely loves it.</li>
            <li> Real thing.</li>
            <li> thanks</li>
            <li> Do I really need to say anything else about it....</li>
            <li> My girlfriend absolutely loves it.</li>
            <li> This is either: 1) a cheap knockoff, or 2) an expired bottle of the cologne because it&#x27;s been sitting in a warehouse for several years.  </li>
            <li> really?</li>
            <li> Sensual &amp; alluring, a must-have for every modern man.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> and I was introduced to YSL thanks to La Nuit and some recommendations from others.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> , it was fast and I would recommend it to everyone</li>
            <li> If performance were better in the current formulation, this fragrance would be near perfection.  </li>
            <li> This is a great cologne with a very soft subtle scent.</li>
            <li> I love this product so much that I will continue to buy but just be more aware if its the fake or real.</li>
            <li> It has alright silage but an overall fantastic scent with decent longevity.</li>
            <li> More subtle and unique than D &amp; G</li>
            <li> This cologne is of an extremely high quality, while also being very affordable.</li>
            <li> Save yourself the hassle and purchase it at full price from your local dept store.</li>
            <li> The first spray out of the Sephora bottle was like reuniting with an old friend.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not bad, it doesn&#x27;t smell like water, but it smells like you&#x27;re a human...</li>
            <li> a Perfumania store thats why I wasn&#x27;t able to resist getting one.&lt;br /&gt;I ordered it from Amazon for almost half the price at Macys</li>
            <li> I have worn several colognes but this is definitely my all time favorite.</li>
            <li> I plan to stick with Yves Saint Laurent as my main cologne to use.</li>
            <li> Regardless, I remain committed to a solid recommendation adding L’Homme to any collection and a “Love” for the Fragrantica following.</li>
            <li> But at last I found one, and they (macys*) was willing to charge me 80 dollars (including items that I didn&#x27;t care about but they were giving it as a \\&quot;free\\&quot; offer).&lt;br /&gt;Boom</li>
            <li> It wasn&#x27;t until so many years later that I finally ordered it.</li>
            <li> I have found that L’Homme will work during any season and for most events – from formal to more casual outings.  </li>
            <li> Cologne is very personal, but I would say that of the many choices available this one would generally speaking be a people-pleaser due to its characteristics.</li>
            <li> Classic, highly recommend.</li>
            <li> At first I was a bit skeptical to purchase this product, since I have purchased this before from DUTY free stores and Macy&#x27;s for a lot more money.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend it.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend.</li>
            <li> The product came factory sealed, and is of just as high of a quality as it is when purchased from the department store.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I highly recomend it for men of all ages.</li>
            <li> this speaks highly of it.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t speculate on how this might happen in a warehouse, but it&#x27;s possible Amazon did not buy these directly from the original seller either.</li>
            <li> Just go to your local Department store and buy the real thing!!</li>
            <li> Due to concerns about a &amp;#34;knockoff&amp;#34; version, I wondered whether this would arrive in its original packaging, and it certainly did.  </li>
            <li> felt a bit off paying $60 for what is essentially a bottle of good-smelling alcohol, spices, and water, but I have to say that this stuff is worth it.</li>
            <li> I love the scent and it seems to last a long time.</li>
            <li> Worth the extra wait for shipping</li>
            <li> Hugo 212 Sexy to name a few</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried many and few compare to YSL L&#x27;homme.  </li>
            <li> After being unable to locate any more of the old YSL Pour Homme, I was afraid my husband would have to test drive some new scents, but this new one is very close to the original and smells just wonderful</li>
            <li> First I ordered the 2.5oz bottle of D&amp;G Light Blue and it was original as can be, same refreshing smell as the expensive one I bought from Macys</li>
            <li> The Amazon cologne only lasted about 20 minutes where as the Macy&#x27;s cologne is still going strong, 3+ hours later.</li>
            <li> Its a light, airier perfume scent, it first comes off as slightly feminine, like a light perfume with a little but of flower scent</li>
            <li> Long lasting, smells fantastic and without a doubt the real thing.</li>
            <li> This is new, but I do not think so.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The bottle had fingerprints on it, when it&#x27;s supposed to be brand new, smell goes away after minutes ...</li>
            <li> New sealed in box.</li>
            <li> This is my new scent.  </li>
            <li> Not only does it have a lasting smell that changes as it sits, but it&#x27;s just strong enough for other people to be able to smell it without it being &amp;#34;in-your-face&amp;#34; about it.  </li>
            <li> My favorite just doesn&#x27;t last as long as I would like!!!</li>
            <li> The fragance is soft but masculine and mature...and very elegant.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Cologne is all about personal preference so a real review really serves no purpose here.</li>
            <li> Not overpowering and yet strong and long lasting.</li>
            <li> Because clearly women are drawn to it!</li>
            <li> but this is a different one from the first I order.</li>
            <li> I have been wearing it for the last 1 week but the smell definitely is not like the original one.</li>
            <li> This YSL product was the first one that lasted the entire day.</li>
            <li> The exact same product was on sale for fathers day at macys and nordstroms for $75</li>
            <li> This is the favorite scent of a male friend, however I was looking for 2 other gift items for him.</li>
            <li> So far this and Rive Gauche are a must have in your arsenal!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not a bad smell but somewhat sweeter than I expected.</li>
            <li> NOPE it just is really light and not very strong as I would hope.</li>
            <li> The difference in the product I was sent v. the products that i previously received from Sephora and available at Macy&#x27;s is night and day.  </li>
            <li> but may be a bit strong for everyday use &amp;</li>
            <li> 52.00 plus tax, it dosent last more than 5 and a half hours on my skin.</li>
            <li> Although it smells a little bit girlier than my other colognes, i love this smell and my lady agrees!  </li>
            <li> It works just fine as a signature scent, it can be worn everyday and the 3.3 ounces bottle can last for a whole year.</li>
            <li> was pleasantly surprised that it wasn&#x27;t leaking,</li>
            <li> I got this cologne for my husband--in his early 30s--for Christmas.</li>
            <li> Its for people whose noses are sensitive to smell as well</li>
            <li> After applying this in the morning, it&#x27;s completely gone by lunch time.</li>
            <li> laugh if you want, I know it&#x27;s silly, but if you really care how you smell and want to get the best quality for your money, you can&#x27;t go wrong with this cologne</li>
            <li> This rocks as far as cologne goes.</li>
            <li> Its too subtle..have to really sprinkle a lot for it to actually make me smell good..lasts about two hours.</li>
            <li> #34;if people at your work are sensitive to smell&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;use</li>
            <li> I was iffy about ordering this through Amazon after reading a few of the 1-Star reviews, but because of the lack of free time I have to go to a department store to buy it in person, I had to settle for this.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s enough for me to be very suspicious about what I&#x27;ve just received and the authenticity of the product.</li>
            <li> I am completely embarrassed I bought this as a gift.</li>
            <li> I finally found a cheap option through Amazon, because buying it in stores is more expensive.</li>
            <li> Light or heavy?</li>
            <li> The knockoff version does smell very very similar to the real version</li>
            <li> Got this for my son as a Christmas present, &amp; he really likes the way it smells.  </li>
            <li> The scent, in my opinion is mature but subdued.</li>
            <li> It has a very unique aroma, and it not sweet like other modern perfumes.</li>
            <li> Smells amazing but the smell does not last long after using half a bottle or so (lasts may be 1 hr) .</li>
            <li> Colognes are full of essential oils and other scented chemicals that can be subject to leak, evaporation, and chemical changes over time when exposed to excess heat, light, and so forth.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m always sniffing my hubby when he wears this slightly floral sweet but musky.</li>
            <li> one of the best perfumes ever, specially for people who hate heavy perfumes.</li>
            <li> this is the only cologne of YSL that i own, i first smelled this cologne when a person randomly just walked by</li>
            <li> Originally purchased for my partner, but after wearing it a few times I just couldn&#x27;t ignore all the compliments.. From men and women alike.</li>
            <li> /&gt;This is understandable given the low price point that this is slightly older stock.</li>
            <li> This fragrance of for the man who wants to smell fresh but not necessarily sexy.  </li>
            <li> What first alarmed me was that the two boxes I received from Amazon had different style barcodes, Where as the style of the barcodes on the Macy&#x27;s boxes matched (and were also different than both of the Amazon</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s sweet with a little bit of spice.  </li>
            <li> The only downside is this will take more sprays than you&#x27;re used to and the staying power is not spectacular; it becomes very close to the skin after only about 4 hours.  </li>
            <li> To YSL: the cologne is a phenomenal product, but this business model for lesser-grade Amazon products is not good.</li>
            <li> the other one lasts very long but isn&#x27;t as smooth as this one</li>
            <li> The scent is hard to describe (maybe modern, fresh and sweet/woody?)</li>
            <li> /&gt;Finally, I ordered a new bottle from Sephora, which I know like Nordstrom sells only legitimate bottles.</li>
            <li> recently went to Macy&#x27;s with my girl to find a new signature cologne.</li>
            <li> The sprayer is larger, along with the whole bottle which is noticably larger.</li>
            <li> The product that I received from Macy&#x27;s seemed very legit, especially when compared to the product I received from Amazon (and yes, the seller of my 3.3 oz bottle was Amazon and not a third party).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Notice the major difference in color w/</li>
            <li> but the bottle i bought was new, never opened, and the real thing..smelled great..and was half price..</li>
            <li> Hard to argue a light, pleasing scent that stays with you without competing for attention.</li>
            <li> But to my surprise, this product came in the original packaging and smells and looks like all my previous, more expensive purchases.</li>
            <li> I ordered from Amazon, because they were listed as the seller and they are generally trustworthy.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very alcoholy smelling and the smell doesn&#x27;t last long.</li>
            <li> The no return policy on colgne does not help, but I am extremely disappointed with the product and more importantly the lack of quality control by amazon.</li>
            <li> amazon, saved nearly 30 bucks for the same thing.</li>
            <li> This is my second bottle so far.</li>
            <li> Be careful as this is not returnable, so if you want something that lasts, pay more and get it at the department store, it will cost less over the long run.</li>
            <li> I tried one spray of the &amp;#34;real&amp;#34; bottle on one wrist and one from the Amazon one on the other, and the Amazon one felt much weaker, more watery, and in general just a poor competitor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve owned this cologne previously plenty of times and first time purchasing it from Amazon.</li>
            <li> This bottle is exactly the same as each other</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used quite a few different brands in the last few years and have liked some of them.</li>
            <li> there are big scratches inside and even some cuts of the black paint (removed with a scalpel), you can tell for sure the box is not original.</li>
            <li> I believe my 2nd bottle was a fake because my 1st bottle was so amazing</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never gotten so many random compliments on it from complete strangers...</li>
            <li> I got my first bottle from Nordstrom, and I used it down to the last drop.</li>
            <li> the real version being much darker (yellow/gold) and the fake version being much lighter (white).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This colonge doesnt last and you can barely even smell it.</li>
            <li> He spray himself multiple times and we barely smelled it.</li>
            <li> Very subtle, almost floral bouquet on top of a solid woody smell.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had a few colognes in the past but this is my favorite.</li>
            <li> I bought this and other 5 perfumes and colognes and I couldn&#x27;t be happier about my products, all of them are originals and new and sealed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One very shady and suspicious thing is, and I wish I could show a picture, but the part of the back inside of the box (where it gives Flammable warnings)is missing part of the directions and the right corner of the box has been opened and resealed with HOT GLUE.</li>
            <li> I was very concerned to say the least about buying this cologne from Amazon, well, I emailed Amazon with my concern and they replied within 2 hours and assured me that all of their colognes and perfumes are bought directly from the manufacturers and 100% authentic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> If you take a look at the picture attached, you will see the version from Amazon on the left (real) and the version from Macy&#x27;s on the right (fake).</li>
            <li> The sweetest part of it all is the unbelievably low prices, and I made sure i bought each and everyone of them from AMAZON, don&#x27;t get confused, there are a lot of other sellers @</li>
            <li> The colors were completely different, the knockoff version was dark yellow where as the real cologne was clear with a small tint of yellow.</li>
            <li> very classic, not overwhelming.</li>
            <li> Like the scent on the magazine, this fragrance is extremely fresh smelling, subtle and non-intrusive.  </li>
            <li> But although I really like the smell, it just doesn&#x27;t get the attention of other females the way other colognes do.</li>
            <li> The ONLY reason I didnot give ita 5 star rating because I had to agree that the scent was fainter and did not last as long as the 2 oz.</li>
            <li> Usually with colognes the smell would stick on a shirt for a certain amount of days</li>
            <li> The fragrance is very long lasting – noticeable even the following morning.</li>
            <li> This is unusual for me because i have relied on Amazon for cologne purchases in the past with no complaints which I thought I could trust.</li>
            <li> Bottle last long.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s long lasting.</li>
            <li> Smell does not last too long.</li>
            <li> It last long</li>
            <li> The biggest problem I have had with them was that the smell didn&#x27;t last long.</li>
            <li> Long lasting and refined.  </li>
            <li> The scent didn&#x27;t seem to last as long on my skin, and for a while I thought it was just my nose getting too used to the scent.</li>
            <li> Smells great.......and long lasting..........</li>
            <li> The scent seem to not last so long</li>
            <li> Simply put, excuse my language but this cologne is the s</li>
            <li> It also last all day long.</li>
            <li> The scent last a very long time.  </li>
            <li> but it doesn&#x27;t last very long.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s an easy blind buy...</li>
            <li> So I was curious and thought id read more reviews on here and it turns out that I guess Amazon sometimes might sell you a fake one...</li>
            <li> /&gt;This is one of those scents that works with any situation and attire, is not offensive to anyone at all and the sillage is just right in my opinion -- people will smell you only a little past arms length.</li>
            <li> The clear packaging was opened a little, so I decided to take the box out and check the cologne out just in case.</li>
            <li> Girlfriend told me this was a good scent, ordered it and wondered why it was such a weak scent and read the reviews someone else mentioned it being fake.</li>
            <li> Well its so obvious that its not real.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I found a lot of strange things.</li>
            <li> I had this cologne back when I was in the military</li>
            <li> /&gt;Yes, if sprayed a long the pulse points,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> And when you&#x27;ve been using it that long, it becomes your scent.</li>
            <li> it lasts a long time.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know how I&#x27;ve gone this long without it.</li>
            <li> The best....love the scent and how long it lasts.</li>
            <li> Not much silage and doesn&#x27;t last a long time, but it will never offend.</li>
            <li> I was buying a new bottle for my husband for Christmas and still had a little left from the previous bottle I bought from a Macy&#x27;s store.</li>
            <li> That was when my &#x27;better&#x27; half started calling me selfish</li>
            <li> same as if had I bought it retail but only half the cost of deparment store.</li>
            <li> The smell is much sweeter and profound while the fake one from Macy&#x27;s is alcoholy and wears off almost completely within half an hour.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> (English Laundry-Riviera is the other).  </li>
            <li> Second of all its cheaper on Amazon than at Macy&#x27;s or Belk and other places</li>
            <li> And several other family members smelt it and all said I should get myself a bottle...</li>
            <li> if you&#x27;re ordering cologne/parfum on Amazon I&#x27;d only recommend ordering from Amazon themselves or Sephora; any other third party merchants usually have a low 90s% feedback</li>
            <li> Today’s L’Homme manages average longevity and projection/sillage, lasting 4 to 6 hours on me, longer on clothing, all at arm’s length distance.  </li>
            <li> but this one last maybe less then 24hrs</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t last more than 2 hours:( we bought the prevoius ones from stores</li>
            <li> It was a terrific value costing $30 less than at department stores.</li>
            <li> Make sure you buy directly from Amazon since third-party sellers of colognes is generally a bad idea!  </li>
            <li> Regarding longevity and projection/sillage, I am certain L’Homme has gone through the reformulation process, and the product of today is a faint memory of historical versions.  </li>
            <li> but, I figured if it smelled like wet garbage, I could always return it.</li>
            <li> The order came before than I expected, which was before Christmas</li>
            <li> This is a counterfeit product plain and simple!!!!</li>
            <li> and it dies down quite nicely...and lasts very long....</li>
            <li> /&gt;Another thing that was off, was on my La Nuit box, the serial number stamped on the bottom of the box was way off center, which also differed from the other</li>
            <li> I will never buy this again from amazon or any other discount website for that matter.</li>
            <li> I was walking the town with my wife and her friends the other night.  </li>
            <li> I walked into a store the other day and</li>
            <li> I will also say that I have bought other colognes from Amazon and have not had this problem.</li>
            <li> but as with any other cologne, try a sample to see how it smells on your skin.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if I got a fake product as I bought this for the first time.</li>
            <li> but I sprayed one bottle on one hand, and one on the other.</li>
            <li> but then we all dont what to smell like each other.</li>
            <li> The cologne fragrance itself smells a little like the sample they give in the ads in magazines (though that&#x27;s not much to compare).</li>
            <li> I was a little bit skeptical at first</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been wearing YSL L&#x27;homme for years and this is an absolute fake.</li>
            <li> I see another review that had the same complaint as mine.</li>
            <li> So I suggest everyone do their research on how to spot a fake one thanks to these reviews.</li>
            <li> The glass is not as thick and has a much different nozzle design.</li>
            <li> So I wrote down the name of the cologne and bought it for myself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and I myself must say that yes I to have a problem with it&#x27;s scent dying down after about an hour or so.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know what is it just weak or light cologne or water down fake version.</li>
            <li> You put it on and after half an hour you wouldn&#x27;t even know that you were wearing it.</li>
            <li> like the 1 @ dillards for 30 less dollars</li>
            <li> However, similar to other reviews the scent was extremely weak.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know what happened to the previous reviewers but based on their reviews</li>
            <li> Amazon counts one of the most integral services in the market, but seems  to fails in quality control searching for fake products before sending it.</li>
            <li> never left my chair, seriously, 15 minutes</li>
            <li> and I received twice the product for half the price.</li>
            <li> Also, there was a piece of the black cardboard inside the cologne box that was cut out...</li>
            <li> It looks like someone took a razor blade and peeled some black pieces off.  </li>
            <li> I purchased previously</li>
            <li> I hope they&#x27;re not true.</li>
            <li> 1 bottle lasts for a little over 1 year.</li>
            <li> I had a few compliments that night alone.</li>
            <li> I was not comfortable buying cologne here till I decided to test them a few weeks ago.</li>
            <li> A waste of $70.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t get compliments everyday, but have gotten a few.</li>
            <li> Saved a few bucks and didn&#x27;t have to leave the house.</li>
            <li> Totally waste</li>
            <li> /&gt;Longevity is few hours.&lt;br</li>
            <li> My only issue was when I opened the box and took off the cap, the inside of the cap was broken so there is no secure lid.</li>
            <li> I was excited when my cologne arrived only to realize I had received a counterfeit cologne, very disappointed -</li>
            <li> For someone who takes body fragrances very seriously, i have tried countless colognes.</li>
            <li> i preffer for daily use... but price is a little expensive...</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to see in a picture, but the gold lettering is a little flaky.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> For example, the plastic covering the box has been opened, the sticker under the bottom is torn, and there is some paper (I am not sure if it is paper) inside the bottle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Some people call it boring because it doesn&#x27;t attack everyone the minute you walk into a room and doesn&#x27;t make a statement, but that&#x27;s what I love about</li>
            <li> I wear about 9-10 different colognes, so nothing gets too stale.</li>
            <li> I can assure you that the scent is not overwhelming.</li>
            <li> a small amount</li>
            <li> Shame on Amazon to sell such fake products.</li>
            <li> Not sure why that is</li>
            <li> Then I ordered one from Amazon about a year ago, and I&#x27;ve been noticing that the compliments that usually come rolling in basically stopped.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, I think for the first time Amazon has failed me.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if I&#x27;ll even order through Amazon itself.</li>
            <li> His mother has usually bought him cologne in the past and I thought it was time for me to pick something out</li>
            <li> I purchased the yves saint laurent l&#x27;homme for christmas and by the time I actually opened it and compared it to the \\&quot;real\\&quot; 100 ml bottle I realized it was a fake.</li>
            <li> , IT&#x27;S A WASTE OF MONEY!</li>
            <li> purchased both YSL L&#x27;Homme and YSL La Nuit De L&#x27;Homme - 1 of each from Amazon and due to other reviews saying this might be fake, I also purchased 1 of each from Macy&#x27;s.  </li>
            <li> I knew the scent because I&#x27;ve owned it in the past.</li>
            <li> I have been wearing this cologne for the past 2 years, and this is not the YSL L&#x27;homme scent.  </li>
            <li> The scent is not overwhelming and everyone always compliments me on it.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m not sure why.</li>
            <li> I went hunting for cologne at the department stores, assuming I looked like a complete weirdo trying on sprays madly.</li>
            <li> The bottles Amazon are selling may not be fake, just old and poorly stored.</li>
            <li> very upset :(</li>
            <li> so every time I put it on it feels like brand new.&lt;br /&gt;I find hard to describe a scent</li>
            <li> (sadly I&#x27;m a late shopper).&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Nothing negative about the size of bottle, price, and smell.</li>
            <li> The product is likely fake, possibly diluted...Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> Please don&#x27;t waste your time or money!!</li>
            <li> If you want a versatile, everyday cologne, this is it!!</li>
            <li> I believe it&#x27;s one of those subtle scents where one must be close to you to smell it.  </li>
            <li> Their are no lingering tones or a subtle smell.</li>
            <li> feel really bad with this one, so I bought another one (the same thing) at the Macy&#x27;s store.</li>
            <li> At the end of a long work day when you take your shirt off and smell it, the shirt doesn&#x27;t smell like water, but it smells like sweat (not in a bad way, but like you were productive)</li>
            <li> This cologne is weak as all get out.</li>
            <li> It is just way too weak.</li>
            <li> Disappointed comes to mind, under-performer (DOESN&#x27;T LAST).  </li>
            <li> The bottle itself isnt that poor looking but the smell is horrible.its a waste of money!!!</li>
            <li> (unlike that horrendous Drakar-Noir crap that I now notice a lot of douche bags wear), and I can&#x27;t get enough of</li>
            <li> Not THAT big of a deal, but definitely annoying when capping it and always thinking it will come off.</li>
            <li> i know they are some bad reviews about some stores selling imitation fragrance on here..</li>
            <li> nothing bad to say just a little strong.&lt;br /&gt;thanks</li>
            <li> not sure what that&#x27;s all about but seems very weird.</li>
            <li> people wouldn&#x27;t notice it when they put the fake bottle inside instead.</li>
            <li> I was hesitant to buy an expensive and recognized brand cologne online, sorry amazon.</li>
            <li> I read these 1 star reviews but was skeptical that there was anything wrong with the product so ordered anyway.</li>
            <li> and you never know if you are getting a fake or dilution</li>
            <li> I went to Macys and found that it was so expensive.</li>
            <li> Like, there&#x27;s no trace of it - not even a faint hint of it still lingers.</li>
            <li> I read the reviews and some people said that they were getting the wrong cologne, a knockoff brand or something.</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t go wrong with this one....</li>
            <li> Unless you want to put on 8 sprays, at which point this stuff becomes really expensive.</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t go wrong..</li>
            <li> Sorry...</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just sad...</li>
            <li> The cologne I got is fake because the scent goes away in 1 hour instead of</li>
            <li> in regard&#x27;s to the fake version being sold my Macy&#x27;s...</li>
            <li> Unfortunately for me, it says this item is non returnable.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It sounds like a fake perfume.</li>
            <li> and I would rate that 5 stars, however, this review is on my order and what I received, which I believe to be fake.  </li>
            <li> It smells like you&#x27;re an alpha leader, and you fought difficult office battles all day, and won.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I am obsessed with this scent.  </li>
            <li> It holds and draws attention - I&#x27;d buy that before trying L&#x27;Homme if anyone is doing a blind buy.</li>
            <li> I try not to wear it all the time because I&#x27;m afraid I&#x27;ll get bored of it.</li>
            <li> Not too crazy about this scent</li>
            <li> Within 15 minutes, I found all 3 items at crazy incredible&lt;br</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t go wrong wearing this!</li>
            <li> Sorry Im a cologne freak!</li>
            <li> I have been wanting this cologne for months now but every where I see it it is so expensive!</li>
            <li> But this is fake!</li>
            <li> This is a fake cologne!</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t smell bad</li>
            <li> No matter how bad I feel at times this smell will make my day.</li>
            <li> That is what every girl including my mom has said to me after 2 sprays of this bad boy.</li>
            <li> My husband wanted this so bad snd</li>
            <li> Whatever it is ,didn&#x27;t work for mt husband.&lt;br /&gt;First time that I am disappointed with amazon fragrance purchase.</li>
            <li> You will not be disappointed..  </li>
            <li> ( but now i am so disappointed :(</li>

            <li> Even though i had read some of the claims other people said about it not being 100% authentic i decided to buy it anyways because it was a good price.Well its so obvious that its not real.The smell is not the same AT ALL..The box seemed to have been opened from the bottom thinking people wouldn&#x27;t notice it when they put the fake bottle inside instead.The bottle itself isnt that poor looking but the smell is horrible.its a waste of money!!! Just go to your local Department store and buy the real thing!!</li>
            <li> Cheaper than in store and my man always smells so good!</li>
            <li> Great smell be this is the real thing!!!</li>
            <li> I was hesitant to buy an expensive and recognized brand cologne online, sorry amazon. I love this cologne n went to my local macys n they were sold out. Came home and found it on amazon cheaper. I went ahead and bought here since I was already waiting for macys to restock n was pleasantly surprised that it wasn&#x27;t leaking, well package and of course authentic.</li>
            <li> Bottle last long. Good scent</li>
            <li> This cologne smells wonderful on my husband. We had searched for a scent that we both liked and I found this in a scratch and sniff in a People Magazine ad. We buy it online now because the price is 25% higher in Nordstrom or Macy&#x27;s. Now I just purchase it on Amazon and we save money and he smells great all the time!</li>
            <li> My husband&#x27;s favorite.</li>
            <li> Although it smells a little bit girlier than my other colognes, i love this smell and my lady agrees!  I am glad i found it here on Amazon!  This is one where you look at all the good reviews so you try it and it smells great.  Make sure you buy directly from Amazon since third-party sellers of colognes is generally a bad idea!  Also the smell is strong at first but fades away.  In the end this still won&#x27;t replace my Armani Code Black, but it will be a great addition to my colognes!  Thanks Amazon!</li>
            <li> Very nice smell, for about 5-10 min, and after that you can barely smell it. I don&#x27;t know what is it just weak or light cologne or water down fake version.Whatever it is ,didn&#x27;t work for mt husband.&lt;br /&gt;First time that I am disappointed with amazon fragrance purchase.</li>
            <li> Great transaction, great product!! I had no problems and got a way better deal then I could have got in the department stores. I would definitely recommend this it really smells amazing!</li>
            <li> I have tried a LOT of different colognes, mostly from Amazon which received great reviews. I found that some of the reviews were way off, however this one is spot on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I initially got a whiff of this stuff from a buddy of mine on a ski trip. It smells fantastic. I had a few compliments that night alone. So I wrote down the name of the cologne and bought it for myself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I felt a bit off paying $60 for what is essentially a bottle of good-smelling alcohol, spices, and water, but I have to say that this stuff is worth it. My girlfriend loves it (unlike that horrendous Drakar-Noir crap that I now notice a lot of douche bags wear), and I can&#x27;t get enough of it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, good purchase, this stuff smells great. It has a lighter / clean scent to it that has a hint of citrus. It seems to last the entire day as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the fence? Go to a department store and try this stuff out. Do it.</li>
            <li> Due to concerns about a &amp;#34;knockoff&amp;#34; version, I wondered whether this would arrive in its original packaging, and it certainly did.  I&#x27;ve tried SO many colognes and this is only one of 2 that work with my body chemistry (English Laundry-Riviera is the other).  And the bottle is much bigger in person than it appears on the photo.</li>
            <li> Get cologne, I am very impressed with the compliments I receive when wearing it.</li>
            <li> i love the smell of this cologne. I&#x27;m also happy to find it at $57 as opposed to $85</li>
            <li> Smells wonderful. Really love it</li>
            <li> bought this after spending twice as much in store on my first bottle..i know they are some bad reviews about some stores selling imitation fragrance on here..but the bottle i bought was new, never opened, and the real thing..smelled great..and was half price..</li>
            <li> I have worn several colognes but this is definitely my all time favorite. Potent without being overpowering and I have yet to meet a woman who didn&#x27;t like it.</li>
            <li> Bought ten frangrances in the last year and this is the best of all.  Smells great when you put in on, even better two hours later.  More subtle and unique than D &amp; G The One, my second favorite.  Completely gorgeous.</li>
            <li> Great product, for a great price, in stores this same bottle costs 75.00 plus shipping.</li>
            <li> Greeat price and fast shippping. Smells like the original !! Would purchase again from this seller.</li>
            <li> I love this cologne. I bought it for my boyfriend for Christmas after we both decided it smelled the best. He loves wearing it. It has a manly delicious smell to it. Needless to say I LOVE when he wears it.</li>
            <li> Hands down the best smelling cologne ever. 1 bottle lasts for a little over 1 year.</li>
            <li> I got this cologne for my husband--in his early 30s--for Christmas. He loved it! and so did I. The fragance is soft but masculine and mature...and very elegant.&lt;br /&gt;The service at Amazon: excellent like always.</li>
            <li> YSL L&#x27;homme is my go to cologne. After finding it online at a better price, I jumped at the offer. Shame on me, as I feel that this version is not the exact one that I am used to buying at dept stores. I will never buy this again from amazon or any other discount website for that matter. Save yourself the hassle and purchase it at full price from your local dept store.</li>
            <li> This cologne is weak as all get out. Lasts about 2 hours.</li>
            <li> product arrived in perfect condition, thanks!</li>
            <li> Came as advertised. Smells great. A big hit! No issues at all.</li>
            <li> Smells great! This is the real deal not a knock off. I always been a fan of this cologne. Fellas this cologne is a panties dropper. Lol!!</li>
            <li> Really nice smell. Like France on cool, pretty day</li>
            <li> Excellent scent.  Well worth the price.  Unlike many colognes out there, this has a woody, fine wine scent without any synthetic overtones or undertones.  One of the best out there.</li>
            <li> L&#x27;Homme by Yves Saint Laurent is the best cologne I have ever used. I have tried many before but none have gotten me as many compliements as this one. I plan to stick with Yves Saint Laurent as my main cologne to use.</li>
            <li> Not too crazy about this scent but it&#x27;s OK.  Not as welcoming as its Libre version.</li>
            <li> loved this product... smells just rite....:) Fragrance is very nice on sweeter side and very subtle, just as i want my perfume to be, as i dont like strong smell.</li>
            <li> Oh, my very kool. and the women love it...</li>
            <li> Great  product  smells  wonderful  perfect gift for that special  someone</li>
            <li> My husband love it!! Fresh clean and citrus mix make this fragrance one of the kind!&lt;br /&gt;Very nice Light essence!</li>
            <li> Great product. Fast shipping.</li>
            <li> this is the only cologne of YSL that i own, i first smelled this cologne when a person randomly just walked by and i immediately fell in love with it, i wanted to jump the woman that had it on her immediately ( i kid you not ), when i asked she said it was a mens cologne and wondered if she was a... but she assured me she is a woman that just like mens cologne, so i asked her what it was and she brought me to the sales rep that was holding it her in hand, i bought it on the spot, L&#x27;homme is my go to cologne for fall/winter, the reason is because my skin gets too itchy with stronger colognes, this cologne is not so strong but it does have a kick too it. since i have started using L&#x27;homme i have been getting compliments and been asked what it was and where they can purchase it, it is a great scent and should be owned by everyone that loves a great smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;colognes i own:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Acqua di Gio&lt;br /&gt;Lacoste Pure&lt;br /&gt;CK free/one&lt;br /&gt;YSL L&#x27;homme&lt;br /&gt;Chrome by Azzaro</li>
            <li> I am thrilled that Amazon offers this product. It was an easy purchase and I am very pleased with it. I love the scent and it seems to last a long time.</li>
            <li> My husband loves this product. It smell really good. I recommend it</li>
            <li> This cologne is a sweet yet lightly musky smelling. The musk is not too strong. I wear this almost daily to work, so it&#x27;s not too over powering but it&#x27;s long lasting.</li>
            <li> No complaints at all.</li>
            <li> It has a really nice smell and I have received many complements about it. I would buy it again</li>
            <li> Okay let me start by saying the Colonge my husband gets are good. He gets gucci, Versace, armani ,etc. All good strong long lasting Manly Colonges. This colonge doesnt last and you can barely even smell it. He spray himself multiple times and we barely smelled it. Its for people whose noses are sensitive to smell as well if you like light colonge.</li>
            <li> I read these 1 star reviews but was skeptical that there was anything wrong with the product so ordered anyway. I have to say that I agree with the 1 star reviews though. This L&#x27;homme just isn&#x27;t as \\&quot;strong\\&quot; as the stuff you get in the department stores. You put it on and after half an hour you wouldn&#x27;t even know that you were wearing it.</li>
            <li> This scent is amazing! My wife loves it and it lasts throughout the day. I can&#x27;t go wrong wearing this!</li>
            <li> This is as authentic as it gets.  Box has a stamped serial number that matches a printed serial number on the bottle label (bottom).  Checking an online serial database revealed that my product (ordered March 2015) was made in June 2013 with a shelf life of 3 years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is understandable given the low price point that this is slightly older stock. Changed from 4 to 5 stars.</li>
            <li> I have to spray a thousand times for the smell to stick. Smell does not last too long. Usually with colognes the smell would stick on a shirt for a certain amount of days but this one last maybe less then 24hrs</li>
            <li> I was walking the town with my wife and her friends the other night.  One of her girlfriends asked what I was wearing.  I told her \\&quot;La Homme,\\&quot; to which she replied, \\&quot;No, You&#x27;re wearing Sex!\\&quot; It&#x27;s as simple as that.....great cologne.</li>
            <li> The cologne is awesome. My only issue was when I opened the box and took off the cap, the inside of the cap was broken so there is no secure lid. Not THAT big of a deal, but definitely annoying when capping it and always thinking it will come off.</li>
            <li> I used to buy all my cologne from Macys or Perfumania for the sake of authenticity, even though I do a lot of shopping @ Amazon I was not comfortable buying cologne here till I decided to test them a few weeks ago. Once again I was not disappointed. First I ordered the 2.5oz bottle of D&amp;G Light Blue and it was original as can be, same refreshing smell as the expensive one I bought from Macys last year.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then after reading some very nice reviews I jumped on the this YSL L&#x27;homme...MMMMmmm, nice..YSL L&#x27;Homme is a cool sweet scent. It got me when I took a sniff test @ a Perfumania store thats why I wasn&#x27;t able to resist getting one.&lt;br /&gt;I ordered it from Amazon for almost half the price at Macys so I thought this was going to be a \\&quot;knock off\\&quot; for sure. Surprisingly, I received my package 2 days earlier than schedule and, lo and behold, there it was, the original bottle nicely packaged and fully loaded with the authentic and long lasting &#x27;juice&#x27; of L&#x27;homme YSL.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then I went ahead and ordered Emporio Armani for men. That was when my &#x27;better&#x27; half started calling me selfish so I had to jump back online and order Prada Tendre and Vera Wang Flower Princess for her, yes she loves &#x27;em both. The sweetest part of it all is the unbelievably low prices, and I made sure i bought each and everyone of them from AMAZON, don&#x27;t get confused, there are a lot of other sellers @ Amazon dot com, so know who you&#x27;re buying from.</li>
            <li> Get it.  It&#x27;s literally the best warm-scented men&#x27;s cologne on the planet.  Highly recommend it.  I&#x27;ve bought two 3.3 ounce bottles and I can&#x27;t get enough of it.  I get compliments all of the time.</li>
            <li> Great product!! Worth the extra wait for shipping</li>
            <li> Smell good, but doesn&#x27;t amazed me. I really has to get used to the smelling</li>
            <li> This is new, but I do not think so.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I found a lot of strange things. For example, the plastic covering the box has been opened, the sticker under the bottom is torn, and there is some paper (I am not sure if it is paper) inside the bottle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I feel really bad with this one, so I bought another one (the same thing) at the Macy&#x27;s store.</li>
            <li> Maybe it&#x27;s just the way this reacts with my skin, but this is one of the best scents I&#x27;ve ever smelled.  Even the residual smell it leaves on my clothes makes me stop and inhale when I&#x27;m putting my shirt on in the morning.  It&#x27;s extremely rare that I want to repeatedly inhale my own cologne/parfum, but it happens.  It smells heavenly through all the notes and dies down to a perfect amount of sweetness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is one of those scents that works with any situation and attire, is not offensive to anyone at all and the sillage is just right in my opinion -- people will smell you only a little past arms length. The only downside is this will take more sprays than you&#x27;re used to and the staying power is not spectacular; it becomes very close to the skin after only about 4 hours.  If sprayed on clothes it smells wonderful as well and lingers much longer (I can still smell it on my shirts after days).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I cannot recommend this enough.  Some people call it boring because it doesn&#x27;t attack everyone the minute you walk into a room and doesn&#x27;t make a statement, but that&#x27;s what I love about it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also if you&#x27;re ordering cologne/parfum on Amazon I&#x27;d only recommend ordering from Amazon themselves or Sephora; any other third party merchants usually have a low 90s% feedback and you never know if you are getting a fake or dilution (there are many reviews complaining of such).</li>
            <li> At first I was a bit skeptical to purchase this product, since I have purchased this before from DUTY free stores and Macy&#x27;s for a lot more money. But to my surprise, this product came in the original packaging and smells and looks like all my previous, more expensive purchases. Will purchase again from Amazon. BTW...women love the smell of this cologne.</li>
            <li> I have recieved so many compliments on this coglone.  I walked into a store the other day and 4 women asked me what I was wearing!!  It only takes a couple of sprays and you are set all day.  The scent last a very long time.  I have enven put the coglone on in the morning and could still smell the scent the next morning before I took a shower!  Now they only need to make a soap with the same scent and Im SOLD!!!</li>
            <li> I like it though does not last like Macy&#x27;s bought</li>
            <li> The fragance smell delicious, my son gets a lot of complement every time he wears it.....thank you so much...love it</li>
            <li> I bought this for my husband and I loved the smell..... However I wish he liked it. Hes picky so you cant judge it by him not liking it... Woman will LOVE you and wont be able to stop smelling you</li>
            <li> Lots of compliments from the ladies, is not heavy or strong.  Fits my chemistry and seems to last most of the day.  The lid removal is a pain and sometimes pulls the spray nozzle off but is easy to fit back into place.  (just leave the lid off)  enjoy!</li>
            <li> I just bought this at bloomingdales last night after the sales lady insisted this would be just what i was looking for.  I was looking for a sexy seductive scent and i believe this is it.  It&#x27;s delicious sweet and manly.  It does remind me of escape a bit and burberry for men.  It&#x27;s not that strong and it&#x27;s clean.  So you maybe inticed to put a ton of it on.  Don&#x27;t..  I believe it&#x27;s one of those subtle scents where one must be close to you to smell it.  Will be this from amazon for cheaper next time...</li>
            <li> i purchased a bottle of this cologne from target after christmas. i bought the 2 oz bottle&lt;br /&gt;for 52.00 plus tax, it dosent last more than 5 and a half hours on my skin.</li>
            <li> I originally discovered this scent through a sample tester. Wife and I both loved it. Amazing unique, masculine scent that works year round. Happy wife, happy life. Definitely go out and try this scent out from a department store tester and you&#x27;ll be hooked.</li>
            <li> First impression: Distinctive scent. Not overpowering like L&#x27;Eau D&#x27;Issey for Men which made me struggle to breathe after accidentally spraying a bit too much on my coat.</li>
            <li> I was a little concerned about ordering cologne in a glass bottle online, but Amazon had such a great deal on it.  It was so worth it!  It arrived perfectly, and my husband is in love with this scent!</li>
            <li> Been using this perfume since i don&#x27;t know when, and always get compliments from the ladies.</li>
            <li> i have been using this cologne since 2006 and it smells really good. and many girls on streets, classes, restaurants... said that they like my cologne. Also, many men asked me about it. I strongly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I bought this item for my dear husband. I had smelled it in the Maxium magazine and fell in love with it. I went to Macys and found that it was so expensive. I bought a perfume on Amazon (Amazon fulfilled) and it was authentic, so I decided to give Amazon a try with this frangrance as well. It saved me so much money. Amazon only charged $52 with free delivery and confirmation! The bottle looked authentic and the smell is just like the department store one. I absolutely loved it and so did my husband ;)</li>
            <li> I got the best compliments.</li>
            <li> very good cologne, but a little too floral and perfume-like for my taste. Girls say that it smells too sweet.</li>
            <li> This wonderful product came in the mail faster than I expected. I gift wrapped it myself to give to my beau just in time bc he&#x27;s such a great guy and was running low on his cologne already :D. Very pleased and thankful</li>
            <li> Great smelling stuff!!</li>
            <li> This cologne has a wonderful long lasting fragrance without being overpowering. My wife and I are very happy with it... well worth the price!</li>
            <li> this is the best cologne you can buy&lt;br /&gt;smells great&lt;br /&gt;stays with you&lt;br /&gt;classic and sensual&lt;br /&gt;recommend this cologne to buy</li>
            <li> I wear about 9-10 different colognes, so nothing gets too stale. As I have a less-sensitive nose than most, I get used to a scent quite quickly and can&#x27;t smell it myself, so I like to alternate. I bought this to add to the mix, but I find that I&#x27;m wearing it more and more often. I just love it. And out of all the ones I wear, this is the one that people notice the most. I get so many compliments on this scent. So glad I bought it!</li>
            <li> favorite scent on a guy</li>
            <li> Very good scent. It has a very unique aroma, and it not sweet like other modern perfumes. It works just fine as a signature scent, it can be worn everyday and the 3.3 ounces bottle can last for a whole year.</li>
            <li> Awesome smelling.  Good deal, came in a timely manner.</li>
            <li> After applying this in the morning, it&#x27;s completely gone by lunch time. Like, there&#x27;s no trace of it - not even a faint hint of it still lingers.</li>
            <li> My signature scent.. Originally purchased for my partner, but after wearing it a few times I just couldn&#x27;t ignore all the compliments.. From men and women alike. Hard to argue a light, pleasing scent that stays with you without competing for attention.</li>
            <li> super bien !! gracias</li>
            <li> This cologne is great and I wear it everyday! It is such a nice smell and it isn&#x27;t too strong like the JAZZ cologne from the same company. My family goes into my bathroom all the time just to smell it haha. When I&#x27;m in a crowd people often say \\&quot;what&#x27;s that nice smell\\&quot; hahahaha. The biggest pro is gurls love it! If you are unsure about buying, buy the smallest size and I guarantee you will come back for more!</li>
            <li> I was pleasantly surprised to have received my product safely packaged and gift wrapped in 2 days! I didn&#x27;t know what to expect ordering off of amazon since this is my first time, but my expectations were greatly exceeded, I ordered some cologne for my boyfriend&#x27;s birthday, and chose to have it gift wrapped so i wouldn&#x27;t have to since I&#x27;m not so crafty :-) When I opened the shipping box not only was the cologne securely packaged in postal packing, there was also bubble wrap on top of the gift wrapped box of cologne for protection, I opened the gift paper a little bit to make sure the cologne was right, and it was, I would definitely recommend buying from this seller, thank you!</li>
            <li> Girlfriend told me this was a good scent, ordered it and wondered why it was such a weak scent and read the reviews someone else mentioned it being fake. Buy with caution..</li>
            <li> Arrived on time smells.just like the 1 @ dillards for 30 less dollars</li>
            <li> This has quickly moved up to being my favorite scent. Very clean, and is especially enjoyable when the vendor expedites the shipping. Will purchase from this vendor again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been wearing L&#x27;homme Yves Saint Laurent since 2006-ish. I love it. The scent is hard to describe (maybe modern, fresh and sweet/woody?) I can assure you that the scent is not overwhelming. I&#x27;m very selective because some scents give me headaches. I always receive compliments from both men and women. Go smell it at the store, and then purchase it from Amazon (cheaper).</li>
            <li> My husband loved this!</li>
            <li> It smells great, but i still can&#x27;t get women(they compliment me on my cologne). I think its a personal problem unrelated to the product.</li>
            <li> My hubby loved it and it smells very nice. Good price, quick delivery, happy customer.</li>
            <li> that&#x27;s the right parfum very nice</li>
            <li> Saved over $40 by not going to Sephora.</li>
            <li> This was a great bargain compared to full retail.</li>
            <li> Not over powering or too light.  My wife enjoys the smell and it lasts all through the day.  Very nice.</li>
            <li> I love this scent but do not purchase this online. I did not read the reviews before purchasing this so i went ahead and bought it. However, similar to other reviews the scent was extremely weak. My wife was sitting beside me in the car and asked me if i was wearing cologne. It is just way too weak.</li>
            <li> Bought this as a gift for my boyfriend. Product arrived on time and smells great!&lt;br /&gt;Definitely recommend this cologne, its one of my favorites.</li>
            <li> Smells soooo darn good and so much cheaper here!</li>
            <li> The cologne had been tampered with.  It was not even the right scent.  There was glue around the top of bottle.  Got full refund for product.  Will not by cologne on Amazon again.</li>
            <li> I had this cologne back when I was in the military and I loved it. I got out and left it at my buddies house before I moved. I forgot the name of it and then saw an ad for it and had to get it again. I read the reviews and some people said that they were getting the wrong cologne, a knockoff brand or something. This was not the case for me, I got the same cologne as was advertised and it is still one of the best colognes I&#x27;ve worn.</li>
            <li> Oh how I love the smell of this cologne! Its like a combo of smooth, sexy, clean and manly! Sorry Im a cologne freak! Nothing but the best for the man of my life.</li>
            <li> I first smelled this on my dad and immediately fell in love with it. I decided to buy it for myself. This fragrance has a delightfully sweet smell that doesn&#x27;t overpower, but has good projection and longevity. I get a lot of compliments and I find myself constantly smelling it on my wrists. On top of the great smell, it is very versatile and I recommend it for any time of year.</li>
            <li> This same cologne was being sold at a department store that rhymes with \\&quot;Lacey&#x27;s\\&quot; for 25% more than what it was being sold for on Amazon. Sales rep wouldn&#x27;t budge on price. So... I bought it from Amazon and guess what? It smells just like the one from the store. I was a little bit skeptical at first but, I figured if it smelled like wet garbage, I could always return it. Thankfully, it smells great and I&#x27;m very pleased with this purchase.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my brother as a Christmas gift. He really enjoyed this fragrance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I sampled the cologne I felt that it was spot on the chords</li>
            <li> Good, but not long lasting.</li>
            <li> Absolutely love this scent! Smells soooo good :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Packaging came just as it was pictured. Factory sealed, with cellophane around the box. 3.3 ounces is a bit larger in person than I was expecting. It should last quite awhile.</li>
            <li> First of all, its Yves saint!! Second of all its cheaper on Amazon than at Macy&#x27;s or Belk and other places i looked at. I must say this is the best cologne for men, it has this unforgettable scent and its neither strong or weak just perfect.</li>
            <li> Great long lasting cologne, and a really good deal on such a big bottle.</li>
            <li> It had been good. I like it. I was a bit skeptical while ordering , but now I am glad I did.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know what happened to the previous reviewers but based on their reviews I was very concerned to say the least about buying this cologne from Amazon, well, I emailed Amazon with my concern and they replied within 2 hours and assured me that all of their colognes and perfumes are bought directly from the manufacturers and 100% authentic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I bought this and other 5 perfumes and colognes and I couldn&#x27;t be happier about my products, all of them are originals and new and sealed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now about this cologne, it is INCREDIBLE!!!, I have a nice collection of colognes and this is up there with the best in my collection, like Armani Code, Polo Double Black and Kenneth Cole Black, Hugo 212 Sexy to name a few (I&#x27;m very anal about my colognes), I bought this scent based on the comments from Sephora.com buyers, and this is also one of Sephora&#x27;s best of 2008.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t know how to describe this scent with another word but Sexy!, I know it&#x27;s kinda corny to say that, but I kid you not!, this is one of those scents than once you put it on, you feel like you are Daniel Craig&#x27;s James Bond, laugh if you want, I know it&#x27;s silly, but if you really care how you smell and want to get the best quality for your money, you can&#x27;t go wrong with this cologne, it&#x27;s on another level I promise you.</li>
            <li> Fragrance is genuine but too light than original I tried in Macy&#x27;s</li>
            <li> No issues, seemed to be legit. I didn&#x27;t review the product until after I bought it, so I was nervous when it arrived. I went to the dept store to buy the same stuff, so I could compare them sideby side, seems to be the same.</li>
            <li> It was really a good thing that I purchased this perfume from amazon, i got it for lesser price and still the original product.</li>
            <li> A++ all the way around</li>
            <li> Everything was &#x27;kosher&#x27;!  Product was just like the one I sampled in the mall.  Now &#x27;I&#x27;m smelling good like I knew I would&#x27;!  Saved about $[...] buck too!! Do the &#x27;dang thang mane&#x27;!</li>
            <li> Love it, exactly what I wanted!</li>
            <li> I constantly get people asking me why kind of cologne I&#x27;m wearing because they love the smell. Been using this for 3 years now and don&#x27;t know when I&#x27;ll ever stop.</li>
            <li> Nice gift, It is nice for the price I paid. great deal for the price, you have to buy it, trust me</li>
            <li> great scent but it doesn&#x27;t last very long. the other one lasts very long but isn&#x27;t as smooth as this one</li>
            <li> I love love love this cologne. I have bought so many bottles as gifts before. It last long and it has various of cool notes that you smell through out the day!</li>
            <li> OK, so I went for the brand name, encouraged by the reviews.  However, this one&#x27;s not for me baby. Disappointed comes to mind, under-performer (DOESN&#x27;T LAST).  Will not buy it again, not even as a gift for someone I am not fond of.</li>
            <li> Love it.  A full, long-lasting, warm yet light fragrance.  I&#x27;ve been through two bottles in the last four years -- I miss it when it runs out and wait for the next b-day or holiday and hope to receive it as a gift!  When I visit Nordstrom&#x27;s I always swing by to get a bit.  Really nice fragrance.  Seems others like it too!</li>
            <li> Smells good and way cheaper than buying from a retail outlet.</li>
            <li> It was a very good gift! .. y will buy it again. . The best&#x27;s Yves San Laurent for men!</li>
            <li> This is not my favorite fragrance but it is still a very high quality product that I&#x27;d recommend. It won&#x27;t offend anyone. Everyone enjoys this fragrance. It is great in any season and any work environment. Projection is moderate. The smell is crisp and clean. This is great for daily wear and works if you dress up or if you are just wearing a t shirt and want to smell good: 8 out of 10</li>
            <li> This was a birthday present for my husband and he love love loves it!</li>
            <li> I purchased this from amazon.com as the seller, hoping to make sure it&#x27;s quality. It frangrance is very good, however the quality and smell goes away after only a few hours even if I spray alot. Purchasing this in department stores or at the airport, one spray lasts several days. Be careful as this is not returnable, so if you want something that lasts, pay more and get it at the department store, it will cost less over the long run.</li>
            <li> loved it. my new favorite cologne.</li>
            <li> This rocks as far as cologne goes. I get so many compliments from ladies wondering what I&#x27;m wearing that it sells itself. Ladies definitely order this for your man if you want a good smelling cologne.</li>
            <li> This stuff smells great.</li>
            <li> This is a counterfeit product plain and simple!!!!</li>
            <li> All the reviews I read said there was something off when buying this online. I went ahead and rolled the dice and glad I did. It came in original packaging and smells as good and lasts as long as every bottle I&#x27;ve bought from brick and mortar.</li>
            <li> my 5th bottle since 2009.  sexy smell  :)</li>
            <li> I have been using this cologne for almost 10 years now and still enjoy the great fragrance.  A great buy!</li>
            <li> Great cologne and the wife likes it too.</li>
            <li> The bottle had fingerprints on it, when it&#x27;s supposed to be brand new, smell goes away after minutes ...do me a favor do not spend  50$ dollars for a bottle of water...</li>
            <li> Very refreshing and original scent, love it.</li>
            <li> Nice fresh scent that women love. It take awhile to wear off, and lasts pretty much all day. Body heat reactivates the scent. Good choice.</li>
            <li> Its too subtle..have to really sprinkle a lot for it to actually make me smell good..lasts about two hours. Im sure this is different from the one I tested in the shopping mall.</li>
            <li> Just an incredibly diverse cologne for any occasion whether suiting up or hanging out. It&#x27;s also very light and won&#x27;t be smelled by someone more than 3 ft away from you which I like. I honestly can&#x27;t remember the last time someone DIDN&#x27;T say &amp;#34;Wow, you smell good.&amp;#34; to me while wearing it.</li>
            <li> Smell very good &amp; the women love it!</li>
            <li> love this scent on my husband. very classic, not overwhelming. he gets compliments all the time when he&#x27;s wearing it</li>
            <li> I regularly buy this cologne from department stores, and the scent from Amazon seems the same.  However, while the outside of the packaging looked properly sealed, the inside had a cutout in the same shape and size of a department store&#x27;s security tag.  It looks very suspicious to me.</li>
            <li> Ok you all sold me!! Ive been searching for the right colognr for my biyfriend for xmas. This is not one yiu here of all the timr: sounds unique.thanks</li>
            <li> but may be a bit strong for everyday use &amp;#34;if people at your work are sensitive to smell&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;use a small amount and it is very good!</li>
            <li> EVERYONE LOVES THE SCENT, WILL BUY AGAIN</li>
            <li> The scent is great and it&#x27;s subtle. I get compliments on it from men and women.</li>
            <li> I do not believe this is the real product. It does not last an hour before the scent is gone. Also does not seem to smell the same as the last time I purchased this from Macy&#x27;s. Amazon will not accept returns on this product either. so beware!</li>
            <li> The perfume scent and bottle seem OK, but the inside perfume box had cutouts in the same shape and size of a department store&#x27;s security tag. It looks suspicious to me.</li>
            <li> This overall is my favorite scent in the Universe! It goes well with anything, any type of day...any age....well more for the grown and sexy. It&#x27;s a sexy scent! I&#x27;m already on my 3rd bottle lol. You buy this and people will swoon!</li>
            <li> I am a woman....and I LOVE wearing this cologne...I have an infatuation with cool...crisp...clean scents...(can&#x27;t stand flowery women&#x27;s perfumes)...so I wear this..It has a unisex scent in my opinion....It&#x27;s not overpowering...and it dies down quite nicely...and lasts very long....And when worn on a man..its delicious...You can&#x27;t go wrong with this one....on either sex....A must have....</li>
            <li> THIS IS THE REAL DEAL! This is 100% the authentic YSL L&#x27;homme ! Smells phenomenal bought it for myself and GOING TO BUY ANOTHER!</li>
            <li> Nice high quality fragrance</li>
            <li> My husband wears this all the time and gets so many compliments.;) this is one of my favorite colognes . Smells great!</li>
            <li> I LIKE THIS PERFUME EXCELLENT,&lt;br /&gt;I LIKE THIS PERFUME EXCELLENT, AND COULD BE A&lt;br /&gt;VERY GOOD GIFT&lt;br /&gt;VERY GOOD GIFT</li>
            <li> I love the scent, but it seems to wear off rather quickly. Unless you want to put on 8 sprays, at which point this stuff becomes really expensive. I would NOT recommend.</li>
            <li> I use when i go out night times and always get compliments. I will definitely buy it again but after try more products in my mind.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been wearing YSL L&#x27;homme for years and this is an absolute fake. It smelled like rubbing alcohol, but don&#x27;t worry because after 5 minutes you can&#x27;t smell anything at all. To top it all off Amazon does not allow you to return the item because federal regulations do not allow the return of hazardous or flammable materials. A waste of $70. Amazon should be ashamed to sell this product, especially without allowing returns. Save your money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: I contacted Amazon by phone and they refunded me the money for this product. I will also say that I have bought other colognes from Amazon and have not had this problem.</li>
            <li> It is a great perfume and smells amazing.  I got it for my boyfriend for Christmas and he wears it daily now.</li>
            <li> bought it for our son and he likes it so we are happy! will buy again if he want it.</li>
            <li> This fragrance of for the man who wants to smell fresh but not necessarily sexy.  Great for church and social events.  If you want to go home with someone,  use Drakkar.</li>
            <li> New sealed in box. same as if had I bought it retail but only half the cost of deparment store. I will buy it again and again.</li>
            <li> I first came about this fragrance by way of a sample scent on a page of an Esquire Magazine.  Like the scent on the magazine, this fragrance is extremely fresh smelling, subtle and non-intrusive.  If you&#x27;re a person who likes to smell over-powering fragrances from dawn to dusk, this is not for you.  However, if you&#x27;re a person who likes a scent that seemingly disappears but pleasantly reminds you from time to time that you are indeed wearing a sweet scent - L&#x27;homme is for you.</li>
            <li> I like it but this is a different one from the first I order. Still happy with it just like the other better.</li>
            <li> After being unable to locate any more of the old YSL Pour Homme, I was afraid my husband would have to test drive some new scents, but this new one is very close to the original and smells just wonderful</li>
            <li> I really like how suttle this scent is. And its so sweet. Definitely the kind of scent you wear while cuddling.  But although I really like the smell, it just doesn&#x27;t get the attention of other females the way other colognes do.</li>
            <li> Good value! But the smell is alright.... I still prefer Ralph Polo on my man....</li>
            <li> Exactly as I hoped it would be. Kudos to Amazon for cleaning up and verifying these products.</li>
            <li> Very nice for my taste. I am no expert in describing scents, but to me this feels fresh! I wear it to work daily and have also worn it for a night out or a dinner party. I don&#x27;t get compliments everyday, but have gotten a few. I am not a babe magnet when I wear this - just to be clear to folks who think thats what they will turn into with perfumes, but its a pretty damn good allround fragrance - day and night, winter and summer.</li>
            <li> My son heard about this fragrance so we went to a local store so he could have a &amp;#34;test spray.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;We both fell in love with L&#x27;homme YSL, so I purchased it for his birthday present.</li>
            <li> I have been wearing it for the last 1 week but the smell definitely is not like the original one. It doesn&#x27;t smell like L&#x27;Homme at all.I dont think i will wear buy perfume from Amazon ever again.Shame on Amazon to sell such fake products.</li>
            <li> this stuff is the best smelling  cologne. I  love it for me and it smells amazing on my man!!!  You can&#x27;t go wrong..</li>
            <li> this is a wonderful fragrant and it smell good on my husband. thank you</li>
            <li> Who ever says this cologne doesn&#x27;t last has a problem.  To test it, I sprayed it on my wrists amd went to work.  After seven hours of running a grill at a seafood restaurant, my wrists still smelled delicious.  This YSL kind of reminds me of wine, the way it smells.</li>
            <li> Wow ! Smells amazing !!!!</li>
            <li> Best cologne I have ever used. Ladies love it!</li>
            <li> I was reminded this morning of the beauty of YSL’s L’Homme… A fragrance nearly 10 years old and still going strong.  This blend of citrus, spicy, and tonka bean notes remains a staple go-to fragrance in my collection.  I have found that L’Homme will work during any season and for most events – from formal to more casual outings.  Additionally, I would offer L’Homme works across many age groups, and while many masculine notes are present, it is “soft” enough for those who enjoy fragrances that are closer to unisex.  Regarding longevity and projection/sillage, I am certain L’Homme has gone through the reformulation process, and the product of today is a faint memory of historical versions.  Be that as it may, the memories remain fond..!!  Today’s L’Homme manages average longevity and projection/sillage, lasting 4 to 6 hours on me, longer on clothing, all at arm’s length distance.  YSL is well known to create Rock-Star fragrances and L’Homme is the “big brother in the band” in this lineup.  All said, my final tally for L’Homme is 4.2 stars out of 5 stars.  If performance were better in the current formulation, this fragrance would be near perfection.  Regardless, I remain committed to a solid recommendation adding L’Homme to any collection and a “Love” for the Fragrantica following. You will not be disappointed..  Enjoy your day and happy fragrance hunting…</li>
            <li> It smells good - but does not last long.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Delivery was quick !</li>
            <li> I received a counterfeit and had to return it.</li>
            <li> I also own this cologne and I myself must say that yes I to have a problem with it&#x27;s scent dying down after about an hour or so. It smell great, not too strong but just doesn&#x27;t last..</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used quite a few different brands in the last few years and have liked some of them. Armani Mania, Burberry Brit, Issey Miyake. The biggest problem I have had with them was that the smell didn&#x27;t last long. This YSL product was the first one that lasted the entire day. The smell is so great and refreshing that I was actually shocked to sense it after tiring meetings in the afternoon. I know that I will be buying this again. And again. And equally importantly, the wife loved it.</li>
            <li> Y.S.L delivers.  They really knocked it out of the park with this one. Long lasting and refined.  A real touch of class. Stops women in their tracks, and gets all kinds of attention(Trust me,the good kind!!!)</li>
            <li> This stuff smells REALLY good..........for 32 seconds.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve seen conspiracy theories floating around in reviews about getting knock-off cologne from Amazon. I hope they&#x27;re not true. Although cheaper than you&#x27;d get it from a department store, $60 is still a lot of money to spend on a bottle of smell-goodz.</li>
            <li> smells amazing!!! such a big bottle of cologne! my fiance was thrilled</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t believe this is authentic. I went to Macy&#x27;s and the smell is completely different from what I bought on Amazon. Not sure why that is and I don&#x27;t believe I will take that gamble again...</li>
            <li> it is pretty good... fresh and not very storng smells good... i preffer for daily use... but price is a little expensive...</li>
            <li> really like the scent, got it out of a magazine. service was very prompt.  really reliable when you say when you are going to get it.</li>
            <li> this product is just amazing!! everyone I meet compliments the smell. I would buy this product over and over again</li>
            <li> this product was ok not what I expected was a bit strong for my taste. nothing bad to say just a little strong.&lt;br /&gt;thanks&lt;br /&gt;Ron chubbs</li>
            <li> Smells nice but honestly I feel it&#x27;s a bit feminine. If anyone can explain why they don&#x27;t agree I&#x27;d love to hear it</li>
            <li> Please note: I did not give this item a 1-star review because the scent itself is amazing, but BUY FROM AMAZON WITH CAUTION. Details below.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is one of my favorite scents of all time. I got my first bottle from Nordstrom, and I used it down to the last drop. Then I ordered one from Amazon about a year ago, and I&#x27;ve been noticing that the compliments that usually come rolling in basically stopped. The scent didn&#x27;t seem to last as long on my skin, and for a while I thought it was just my nose getting too used to the scent. I began to up the sprays I used from around 3 to 5-6, but still the same issue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Finally, I ordered a new bottle from Sephora, which I know like Nordstrom sells only legitimate bottles. Unfortunately, I think for the first time Amazon has failed me. The first spray out of the Sephora bottle was like reuniting with an old friend. I tried one spray of the &amp;#34;real&amp;#34; bottle on one wrist and one from the Amazon one on the other, and the Amazon one felt much weaker, more watery, and in general just a poor competitor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Why might this happen? The bottles Amazon are selling may not be fake, just old and poorly stored. Colognes are full of essential oils and other scented chemicals that can be subject to leak, evaporation, and chemical changes over time when exposed to excess heat, light, and so forth. I can&#x27;t speculate on how this might happen in a warehouse, but it&#x27;s possible Amazon did not buy these directly from the original seller either. Whatever the case, it seems that you&#x27;d be better off paying the extra money to get a new, legitimate bottle from places like Nordstrom or Sephora.</li>
            <li> Amaazing cologne. Size is good enough to be carried in hand carry on airplanes. Regular user, and love it! Wont regret!</li>
            <li> I bought this cologne for my husband, and it smells so good. Light and fresh scent, and at a really good price.</li>
            <li> I was iffy about ordering this through Amazon after reading a few of the 1-Star reviews, but because of the lack of free time I have to go to a department store to buy it in person, I had to settle for this. Thankfully the package came and it didn&#x27;t seem tampered with. The plastic wrap around the box was intact and had no rips. The outside of the box looked fine with no damage. The cologne fragrance itself smells a little like the sample they give in the ads in magazines (though that&#x27;s not much to compare). I haven&#x27;t had a second opinion on the smell itself so I hesitate to comment on it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One very shady and suspicious thing is, and I wish I could show a picture, but the part of the back inside of the box (where it gives Flammable warnings)is missing part of the directions and the right corner of the box has been opened and resealed with HOT GLUE. That&#x27;s enough for me to be very suspicious about what I&#x27;ve just received and the authenticity of the product. I don&#x27;t know if that&#x27;s just the build of the package but the hot glue seal is just not the work of a brand like Yves Saint Laurent. Or maybe it is, I&#x27;m not expert, I&#x27;m just telling it like how it is.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With that said, I won&#x27;t be ordering colognes/perfumes from third-party dealers through Amazon again. I&#x27;m not sure if I&#x27;ll even order through Amazon itself. Oh well, there&#x27;s just some things you don&#x27;t buy online. But that&#x27;s just me.</li>
            <li> I love it!!!!!!  Highly recommended, Speedy delivery, Fragrance last and smells good.</li>
            <li> I must have been living in a cave all these years, because this is by far one of the best colognes I have ever used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yes, if sprayed a long the pulse points,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Women will respond.</li>
            <li> Absolutely incredible! I received this item as a gift and have been getting compliments since the day one.</li>
            <li> I just received this in the mail in time for my man for Valentines Day. For all of the reviewers saying that this isn&#x27;t real or is \\&quot;fake\\&quot;- you need to get your head examined. This is the absolute real deal, shipped fast and smells AWESOME. Saved a few bucks and didn&#x27;t have to leave the house. I highly recommend.</li>
            <li> This is a great smelling cologne</li>
            <li> Smells outstanding.  My favorite cologne.  The ladies&#x27; too.</li>
            <li> Great smelling!!  Most definitely got my moneys worth!! No complaints here!!!! Got here safe and sound and right on time.</li>
            <li> Just opened the box and it smells absolutely nothing like the cologne we purchased from Macys. It&#x27;s very alcoholy smelling and the smell doesn&#x27;t last long. I am completely embarrassed I bought this as a gift. My boyfriend has been wearing this for years, he immediately noticed that something was off. I WILL NEVER BUY IT AGAIN. Totally waste</li>
            <li> Smells great.......and long lasting..........most importantly, the &#x27;girls&#x27; love it.......I use it &#x27;all over&#x27; if you get my drift! If you like a long lasting, very pleasant floral scent, yet not over-powering, similar to Boucheron Jaipur....an older but elegant scent, you will love L&#x27;homme.</li>
            <li> pleasant and soft fall and winter fragrance.  Not much silage and doesn&#x27;t last a long time, but it will never offend.</li>
            <li> This cologne is awesome. I lost track of all the compliments I&#x27;ve received. THAT&#x27;S how great this stuff is.</li>
            <li> This cologne is of an extremely high quality, while also being very affordable. It is a versatile, fresh smelling cologne that I can say with 100% certainty is G E N U I N E, assuming you buy it from Amazon.com. The product came factory sealed, and is of just as high of a quality as it is when purchased from the department store.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s an easy blind buy...but as with any other cologne, try a sample to see how it smells on your skin.</li>
            <li> I actually purchased this product for my dad.  I haven&#x27;t heard any complaints about its smell.  I gave my dad a sample packet that I had received when I bought my cologne at Bloomingdales, which my dad tried out and knew exactly what he wanted.  The cologne I purchased was Lacoste (white bottle).  I tried to look for it using the link feature of this review, but I couldn&#x27;t.  Sorry...</li>
            <li> This is my favorite EDT and my friends love it too. People always comment when I wear this one (and I wear it quite often ;-)) Try it out and you&#x27;ll see why! I finally found a cheap option through Amazon, because buying it in stores is more expensive. Order was processed quickly with no glitches!</li>
            <li> smells great! It was way cheaper than at macy&#x27;s and it arrived in the same great packaging.  The exact same product was on sale for fathers day at macys and nordstroms for $75</li>
            <li> One of my favs. LOVE it. Thank YOU!</li>
            <li> I have been wanting this cologne for months now but every where I see it it is so expensive! 3.3 ounce for almost 70 dollars!&lt;br /&gt;Once I found the 3.3 ounce here I was not hesitant to purchase it, for only 54 dollars, plus FREE shipping. This is by far my favorite fragrance I&#x27;ve owned. Can be used for any season and is not too clean or too musky. Sticks all day and smells even better on the skin. Definitely recommend this for any guy of any age, its very elegant for the price.</li>
            <li> Smells like the wealthy. Very stylish, simple and clean.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in love with this scent. I put it on about 8 a.m when I was heading off to work. Now at 8:35 p.m, I still smell it on my skin. I got amazing compliments wearing this. Great purchase! Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> Every 1-Star review I read before purchasing this was true. It was opened when it arrived. The product is likely fake, possibly diluted...Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> I got a sample of this in the mail and knew right away I wanted to buy it for my husband. His mother has usually bought him cologne in the past and I thought it was time for me to pick something out that I like (and he likes of course). The big bottle lasts him about a year, and he sprays it maybe 2-3 times a day. It smells amazing and the price is excellent.</li>
            <li> It smells amazing and last for like 4-5 hours.... Great product! It was a great Christmas product for my husband and I would definitely get it again!</li>
            <li> I was worried that the cologne would not be the same as store-bought, but it was.</li>
            <li> My favorite just doesn&#x27;t last as long as I would like!!!</li>
            <li> Love the scent of this cologne!! Great price for what you&#x27;re getting. Have gotten many compliments on this scent since I ordered and began using it.</li>
            <li> For anyone wondering if this is a knock off...IT&#x27;S NOT. I&#x27;ve owned this cologne previously plenty of times and first time purchasing it from Amazon. It&#x27;s the same authentic cologne.</li>
            <li> I can say until now, my whole Amazon experience it&#x27;s been excellent (not to say flawlessly), but it&#x27;s kind of a disapointment that my first perfume coming from  Amazon turns to be a fake. The most revealing and significant  issue is the box... there are big scratches inside and even some cuts of the black paint (removed with a scalpel), you can tell for sure the box is not original. The bottle looks good but the spray have leaks, not well made at all.  About the cologne itself,  i have been wearing it for the last 15 days but the smell definetly it&#x27;s not like the original one i just finish (also fades way to quick). It&#x27;s just sad... Amazon counts one of the most integral services in the market, but seems  to fails in quality control searching for fake products before sending it. I can&#x27;t tell if i&#x27;ll ever buy a cologne from Amazon again.</li>
            <li> I purchased the yves saint laurent l&#x27;homme for christmas and by the time I actually opened it and compared it to the \\&quot;real\\&quot; 100 ml bottle I realized it was a fake. The sprayer is larger, along with the whole bottle which is noticably larger. This is not a fragrance at all, just rubbing alcohol in a spray bottle. DO NOT buy anything from this seller, it will most likely be a fake. I am hoping to receive a full refund for my purchase since you can not return cologne but have not yet.</li>
            <li> This is the favorite scent of a male friend, however I was looking for 2 other gift items for him. I did not have time to run to 3 different places so I thought of Amazon!! Within 15 minutes, I found all 3 items at crazy incredible&lt;br /&gt;prices that I thought I was queen shopper!!&lt;br /&gt;I never left my chair, seriously, 15 minutes &amp; I was thoroughly pleased!!!</li>
            <li> The order came before than I expected, which was before Christmas (sadly I&#x27;m a late shopper).&lt;br /&gt;I got this for my s.o, who responded... \\&quot;You have good taste *Chheeesy smile*\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;Even though its a mens... taste? :l I really like it. I went hunting for cologne at the department stores, assuming I looked like a complete weirdo trying on sprays madly. But at last I found one, and they (macys*) was willing to charge me 80 dollars (including items that I didn&#x27;t care about but they were giving it as a \\&quot;free\\&quot; offer).&lt;br /&gt;Boom amazon, saved nearly 30 bucks for the same thing.</li>
            <li> I love this and so does every person who smells it. It&#x27;s great for going out to dinner or to party. Real clean and crisp smell but does not smell like a soap.</li>
            <li> Este producto era exactamente lo que andaba buscando, es de muy buena calidad y y a un valor bastante aceptable</li>
            <li> Makes him smell evn yummier</li>
            <li> Years ago I was looking at a magazine and they were advertising this cologne, it had the side strip with the scent. I loved the smell. It wasn&#x27;t until so many years later that I finally ordered it. This is my second bottle so far. I&#x27;ve had a few colognes in the past but this is my favorite. Sometimes I even spray a shot in my pillow before bed haha. I try not to wear it all the time because I&#x27;m afraid I&#x27;ll get bored of it. Plus girls love it B^)</li>
            <li> The scent is absolutely fantastic, perfect for having guests over or cuddling with your significant other. It has alright silage but an overall fantastic scent with decent longevity. Perfect for being worn during the day and then switching to La&#x27;Nuit Del&#x27;Homme at night. Great fast shipping!</li>
            <li> one of the best perfumes ever, specially for people who hate heavy perfumes. it has a lite but beautiful smell</li>
            <li> Smells great, I get many compliments</li>
            <li> I did not buy this on Amazon, but I rely on these product reviews when making purchases so I thought I would write one here. I bought this cologne for my husband and he and I both love it. He prefers a musky cologne while I like a fresh, sporty scent and this cologne is the best of both worlds. He has gotten many compliments on it and the scent lasts all day without being too overpowering. Worth every penny.</li>
            <li> This fragrance smells great on my husband.  We knew what it smelled like from a magazine sample.  Remember, not everything smells good on every body.  It&#x27;s a total chemical thing.</li>
            <li> Every time i walk into a room the first thing i get told is how wonderful I smell. It might seem to cost a lot but this bottle should last you about 6+ months; i love it and my gf does too.</li>
            <li> Love it on my husband&#x27;s neckline...brings out the manhood of every man. It should be part of all men toiletry case.</li>
            <li> Just received my bottle yesterday and wore it today for the first time. It smells nothing like it should. Doesn&#x27;t smell bad but it&#x27;s not it.</li>
            <li> I smelled this at my friends house and it was amazing. The cologne I got is fake because the scent goes away in 1 hour instead of 6hours very upset :(. I wish I could&#x27;ve got another cologne instead like bleu de chanel.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product, because the 3.3 oz bottle I bought from Nordstroms was running out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Either Yves Saint Laurent is trying to sell a more cost effective version of their L&#x27;homme cologne, or this is truly a faked product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3.3 oz bottles can last you a couple of years. And when you&#x27;ve been using it that long, it becomes your scent. This doesn&#x27;t have that same deep smell that the Nordstrom&#x27;s version has.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bottle is also \\&quot;cheaper\\&quot; than the Nordstrom&#x27;s version. The glass is not as thick and has a much different nozzle design. This means that the top-cap that goes onto it is not swapable. The nozzle looks more like a off-the-shelf design, and not the unique diameter of the Nordstrom&#x27;s.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The labeling on the bottom of the bottle is also different, although they still carry the same information. The box however, does match in code with the bottle. And the box looks like it was a legitimate print.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since this seller is supposed to be thee Yves Saint Laurent, I can only imagine that this is the lesser, value driven product and not the luxury version you would get at Nordstrom&#x27;s. Perhaps all the L&#x27;homme colognes returns are collected to be resold here on Amazon at a cheaper price?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I got this off Amazon Prime for $53.47, thinking it was a deal. But, if I had to do it all over again, I&#x27;d gladly spend an additional $20 for the real deal at Nordstroms.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;EDIT 3/2/13 - Just spoke with Amazon Customer Service about returning this item. I am grateful they were able to do a full refund for me. My experience in the consumer industry makes me think that this refund will be billed directly back to the vendor: Yves Saint Laurent. To YSL: the cologne is a phenomenal product, but this business model for lesser-grade Amazon products is not good. Selling the official department store-quality product makes for a better customer experience. I hope you read this.</li>
            <li> Bought this for the boyfriend for Valentine&#x27;s Day. He wanted to &amp;#34;graduate&amp;#34; to a more grown up cologne (he was wearing Curve) and this fit the bill perfectly. Not too overpowering or spicy. Very warm and sexy.</li>
            <li> good scent and it lasts a long time.  i would buy this again.  chicks dig the manly yet sophisticated odor.</li>
            <li> This is the absolute best cologne I have ever owned in my life. I get so many compliments every time I wear it. Ladies love it...the fellas always ask what I&#x27;m wearing! I recommend every one to spend every penny on it. It&#x27;s super affordable on amazon compared to department stores!</li>
            <li> One of my ex gf&#x27;s purchased this as a bday gift and it smells really good...it&#x27;s not to overwhelming i always get asked what cologne am wearing</li>
            <li> Women keep asking me what I&#x27;m swearing because they think it smells good. Do I have to say anything more?</li>
            <li> This is product was amazing&lt;br /&gt;I smelled it at sephora and thought it was a mist have&lt;br /&gt;So I checked here and the price here compared to in sephora is a big difference&lt;br /&gt;Glad I bought it here</li>
            <li> whenever I use this product i always get positive feedback. Everyone asks me what cologne I am wearing. I will buy this again.</li>
            <li> very nice packed..shipped very quick as described, good quality perfume.. i ll buy again, price is more cheaper than sephora</li>
            <li> Bought one from Sephora for my husband and he liked it and finished it. Bought this one from Amazon since they said their supplier only sells authentic products. Hmm, not too sure about that as I think the smell is different from the one I bought from Sephora. Since my husband likes it and thinks it is fine, I am not complaining.</li>
            <li> A department store had this for $20 more than I paid for it here.  The scent is classy and evokes a sense of success and accomplishment.  Very nice.</li>
            <li> All time favorite scent. Just arrived. I don&#x27;t know how I&#x27;ve gone this long without it. I can&#x27;t stop smelling my wrist. Heavenly. Light. Sweet. Never overbearing. Always complimented. Couldn&#x27;t ask for more. Axe who? :)</li>
            <li> Some reviewers have stated that they think this isn&#x27;t the real YSL product, but we&#x27;re certain it is.  The first time my husband bought this was in Paris, and he&#x27;s worn it for years.  This bottle is exactly the same as each other he&#x27;s bought.  It&#x27;s a fabulous scent.</li>
            <li> This is probably the best smelling men&#x27;s cologne on the market - No Joke. I&#x27;ve tried many and few compare to YSL L&#x27;homme.  I&#x27;ve never gotten so many random compliments on it from complete strangers... it&#x27;s a daily occurrence.</li>
            <li> Great shipping and product.</li>
            <li> It costs a lot but is my favorite!</li>
            <li> Not overpowering and the scent lasts all day. I get lots of compliments and many requests for the name of the product.</li>
            <li> I got this for my husband and I love it! It smells good. Not too powerful but you can still smell it.</li>
            <li> SWOOOOOOOON! One of the best selling colognes out there right now.</li>
            <li> This cologne is probably the best every. Nothing negative about the size of bottle, price, and smell. Great fresh smell.</li>
            <li> Very sexy.  I purchased this for my fiancee and I&#x27;ll just say that when we get close, I can smell it on me the rest of the day and I can&#x27;t wait to see him again.  Love it!!</li>
            <li> I bought this fragrance for my husband&#x27;s birthday because this is his favorite one so i know exactly how it smells. But this is fake! It doesn&#x27;t last more than 2 hours:( we bought the prevoius ones from stores but this time i decided to order it from amazon:( but now i am so disappointed :(</li>
            <li> My husband&#x27;s favorite.</li>
            <li> This is my boyfriend&#x27;s favorite cologne.  I am pleased with my purchase and especially with the price.  The box was damaged when it arrived, but I think it may have been damaged in transit.</li>
            <li> Light or heavy? that&#x27;s your choice, but it  perfect!&lt;br /&gt;One of my top 10 favorite perfume for good mood any season. Best in L&#x27;homme family.</li>
            <li> This is my new scent.  Really nice stuff.</li>
            <li> Outstanding cologne at a good value.</li>
            <li> Hello potential buyer,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recently went to Macy&#x27;s with my girl to find a new signature cologne. We ended up settling on this, and judging by the number of compliments I received leaving the mall, and from some of her friends once we were back at my place, I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s safe to say this cologne is an excellent choice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now in regard&#x27;s to the fake version being sold my Macy&#x27;s... If you take a look at the picture attached, you will see the version from Amazon on the left (real) and the version from Macy&#x27;s on the right (fake). Notice the major difference in color w/ the real version being much darker (yellow/gold) and the fake version being much lighter (white).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve compared both by spraying them on me, and this is where you can tell the one from Amazon is the real deal. The smell is much sweeter and profound while the fake one from Macy&#x27;s is alcoholy and wears off almost completely within half an hour.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will be taking this to the attention of the store manager and hopefully Yves Saint Laurent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BUY THIS VERSION ITS CHEAPER AND TEH REAL DEAL.</li>
            <li> I have sampled this cologne at Sephora and liked the scent before buying it on Amazon. Not over-powering, but potent enough for the ladies to wonder what you&#x27;re wearing.</li>
            <li> Cologne is all about personal preference so a real review really serves no purpose here. The value of the product, however, is exceptional considering I almost paid twice the price for a smaller container. Shipment arrived on time and free of charge and I received twice the product for half the price.</li>
            <li> Smells amazing but the smell does not last long after using half a bottle or so (lasts may be 1 hr) . I don&#x27;t know if I got a fake product as I bought this for the first time. But, anyways, I am not buying this again.</li>
            <li> It smells amazing on my husband. Bought it before. With one use per day the bottle size lasts about a year.</li>
            <li> Not the real deal, scent vanishes after 1-2 hours.</li>
            <li> Smells really good, my wife loves it and the smell stays on for along time. It isn&#x27;t musky it&#x27;s a softer smell. Classic, highly recommend.</li>
            <li> The seller was great and the shipment was quick.  The price was excellent!  The ONLY reason I didnot give ita 5 star rating because I had to agree that the scent was fainter and did not last as long as the 2 oz. bottle I had purchased at the dept. store the last year.  I just put 4 sprays on instead of 2.</li>
            <li> I love this product especially on my husband I buy it for him every year for his birthday. I would definitely recommend this to everyone.</li>
            <li> Knockoff!!! Beware and do NOT purchase this! I was buying a new bottle for my husband for Christmas and still had a little left from the previous bottle I bought from a Macy&#x27;s store. The clear packaging was opened a little, so I decided to take the box out and check the cologne out just in case. The knockoff version does smell very very similar to the real version but I sprayed one bottle on one hand, and one on the other. The Amazon cologne only lasted about 20 minutes where as the Macy&#x27;s cologne is still going strong, 3+ hours later. The colors were completely different, the knockoff version was dark yellow where as the real cologne was clear with a small tint of yellow. Also, there was a piece of the black cardboard inside the cologne box that was cut out...not sure what that&#x27;s all about but seems very weird. Unfortunately for me, it says this item is non returnable. I am trying to get refunded! Please don&#x27;t waste your time or money!!</li>
            <li> I purchased this cologne because I was given a sample of it the last time I was at the mall and instantly loved it.  After purchasing it, I sprayed some on and went about my day and let me say the results were amazing.  Not only does it have a lasting smell that changes as it sits, but it&#x27;s just strong enough for other people to be able to smell it without it being &amp;#34;in-your-face&amp;#34; about it.  I had several different women I&#x27;d never met stop me just to compliment my cologne.  This is absolutely an amazing product and I can&#x27;t recommend it enough</li>
            <li> This was given as a gift. The person I gave this to had been wanting this cologne. He loved it.</li>
            <li> This is a fake cologne! we purchased it thinking it was the real thing. It is not. This has been my husbands favorite perfume for many years and the moment he put it on we knew. They don&#x27;t accept returns/exchanges so don&#x27;t take the chance!</li>
            <li> great product&amp;#62;&amp;#62;.</li>
            <li> I had never smelled this scent before buying for my husband. We are both very pleased with the vibrant, fresh scent. It does last after applying spray for several hours. I will continue to purchase this cologne for my husband,. I use it sometimes too. It is not overpowering at all.</li>
            <li> So this is probably one of my most favorite fragrances that I have tested out. I tried this once in the store and it was AMAZING!  Let me describe it to you: Its a light, airier perfume scent, it first comes off as slightly feminine, like a light perfume with a little but of flower scent then, when it dries its a wonderful FRESH fragrance, with notes light high notes of ginger but with some masculine clean and out of the shower freshness. It is not too strong, which is why I gave this a 4. I was leery purchasing it online and when I got it, I even thought it was passed its shelf life, so I drove to sephora then next day and tried there, and NOPE it just is really light and not very strong as I would hope. However, it is very non-offensive and women will like this a lot.  Not a strong, attention getting scent that would bother others noses, a great scent that would be definitely work and church appropriate while fresh and attractive enough to wear out with friends or snuggle up close with. Its like an all-around winner.</li>
            <li> Very good blend of aromas. Manly. Not overpowering and yet strong and long lasting. I highly recomend it for men of all ages.</li>
            <li> I was excited when my cologne arrived only to realize I had received a counterfeit cologne, very disappointed - DO NOT BUY THIS, IT&#x27;S A WASTE OF MONEY!</li>
            <li> I have worn plenty of cologne in my day and I must say, this stuff is fantastic. It lasts for about 10 hours on me, if not longer. The smell is not too overwhelming either (as long as you don&#x27;t spray too much). It is a nice, fresh, warm-scented smell that anyone is bound to love.</li>
            <li> I love this cologne because it is elegant yet light and summery.  It&#x27;s sweet with a little bit of spice.  My girl digs it!</li>
            <li> The smell is a fresh clean smell. I get many compliments on it. Great to wear to work or on a hot day.</li>
            <li> Next up in this great line of frags.....Nuit L&#x27;Homme. So far this and Rive Gauche are a must have in your arsenal!</li>
            <li> Love the fragrant.&lt;br /&gt;I tried this from sample and love it so much&lt;br /&gt;that I had to buy this.&lt;br /&gt;If you like light fragrant, you might want to try this.&lt;br /&gt;It would be great when purchase product to get&lt;br /&gt;some samples from YSL.</li>
            <li> Yes it was everything and more</li>
            <li> This product turns head! It is a very passive aggressive. When you walk in a room people totally love the smell and they love you!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so in love with this cologne! It was as much a gift to me as it was for my fiance because I get to smell it on him every day! A very sexy scent, I must say!</li>
            <li> This YSL cologne smells amazing. Nice pleasant scent that lasts most of the day and is not overpowering.  Perfect for evenings or a day at the office.  I get complimented everytime I wear it.</li>
            <li> This cologne smells amazing. Do not worry about it being a knockoff, this is the real stuff! I went to Nordstrom to pick out my scent then bought it online since the price is so much better on Amazon. The price did make me worry about knockoffs, but I received it and it smells just as good as the one in the store. If you want a versatile, everyday cologne, this is it!!</li>
            <li> Great all around scent. Proper for day or night, work or play. Better than La Nuit because it is more versatile.</li>
            <li> terrific product,  will continue doing business. was fast and accurate</li>
            <li> I was surprised how sweet smelling this cologne is. It&#x27;s not a bad smell but somewhat sweeter than I expected. It&#x27;s a nice mix to use this with other musky colognes. I recommend it!</li>
            <li> This perfume smells great, but don&#x27;t expect it to last for 8 hours.I bought it as a gift for hubby and he loves it. I wish the smell stays longer.</li>
            <li> The best....love the scent and how long it lasts. I have been using this cologne for about 5 years and it is timeless.</li>
            <li> Had compliments on it at work...don&#x27;t tell the gf!! Not too high end of a price and smells nice! good buy</li>
            <li> Every woman that has leaned in to give me a hug compliments me on how good I smell.  You can&#x27;t ask for more than that! Well, you could, but then this would just be an Ax commercial.</li>
            <li> I regret buying this perfume.&lt;br /&gt;Longevity is few hours.&lt;br /&gt;It sounds like a fake perfume. I would not recommend it.</li>
            <li> My husband loves this cologne. I think it smells, nice, but may not be the best I&#x27;ve ever smelled so I took a star off.</li>
            <li> I love this scent. It can be worn at work, during the day and out at night.  For me 1 or 2 sprays before going out, and it stays with me most of the day.</li>
            <li> I love the way it smells on him. I found it in a magazine and he absolutely loves it. Great new cologne to try.</li>
            <li> The REAL fragrance is great and I would rate that 5 stars, however, this review is on my order and what I received, which I believe to be fake.  Please read below and see attached pictures!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I purchased both YSL L&#x27;Homme and YSL La Nuit De L&#x27;Homme - 1 of each from Amazon and due to other reviews saying this might be fake, I also purchased 1 of each from Macy&#x27;s.  The product that I received from Macy&#x27;s seemed very legit, especially when compared to the product I received from Amazon (and yes, the seller of my 3.3 oz bottle was Amazon and not a third party).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I opened the boxes and removed the cardboard inserts that surround the bottles, the inside of the boxes had pieces cut out. It looks like someone took a razor blade and peeled some black pieces off.  The same goes for the tabs that fold over to close the box on the top.  The Top flap actually had another piece of cardboard glued to it so as to make the top seem more sturdy...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another thing that was different, was the barcode on the side of the box.  What first alarmed me was that the two boxes I received from Amazon had different style barcodes, Where as the style of the barcodes on the Macy&#x27;s boxes matched (and were also different than both of the Amazon products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another thing that was off, was on my La Nuit box, the serial number stamped on the bottom of the box was way off center, which also differed from the other boxes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Finally, on my L&#x27;Homme bottle, the lettering was a bit smudged.  It&#x27;s hard to see in a picture, but the gold lettering is a little flaky.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please see all of my pictures.  In all pictures, the Macy&#x27;s boxes are on the left, and the Amazon boxes are on the right.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I ordered the 3.3oz size of both L&#x27;Homme and La Nuit De L&#x27;Homme.  Luckily, although these items were non-refundable, Amazon was kind enough to refund my full purchase.</li>
            <li> Got this for my son as a Christmas present, &amp; he really likes the way it smells.  Will definitely buy again -</li>
            <li> Real thing. Came well packaged. Thank u.</li>
            <li> everything came in fast an no problems! the product was exactly what I wanted and at a great price! a</li>
            <li> Gift for my BF who is VERY particular about his fragrances.  He LOVED it.  Has a great, subtle scent that lasts.</li>
            <li> I own about a dozen different colognes, and have about 5 that I wear with regularity. YSL l&#x27;Homme is one of them, and it&#x27;s the cologne I&#x27;m most frequently complimented on by strangers and friends alike. The scent, in my opinion is mature but subdued. It&#x27;s inoffensive, but not boring. To me, this is a fresher scent, but not soapy or powdery which I tend to avoid in colognes. It has a nice longevity to it, and I find it lasts longer than most colognes on me. The scent is, for lack of a better word, enticing. The fact that I have a lot to choose from and continue coming back to this speaks highly of it. It also has the versatility to go from daytime to evening and seem well-suited for both. Just a beautiful and well-formulated scent, it&#x27;s hard to say more. Cologne is very personal, but I would say that of the many choices available this one would generally speaking be a people-pleaser due to its characteristics.</li>
            <li> Not too strong, a tad feminine, but it smells great!</li>
            <li> great my wife love it</li>
            <li> IT does smell so good as i know , but doesnt last long</li>
            <li> Thank you, exactly what I was looking for at the time.</li>
            <li> My lady won&#x27;t stop sniffing me</li>
            <li> It was a gift and he loves it....thanks</li>
            <li> I love L&#x27;homme Yves Saint Laurent By Yves Saint Laurent For Men. Eau De Toilette......I purchased previously and I always wanted more!</li>
            <li> Sweet, with a hint of ginger in the top note. Fairly linear, and doesn&#x27;t have great longevity, but by far one of the best smelling designer fragrances you can buy. Girls absolutely love it.</li>
            <li> I knew the scent because I&#x27;ve owned it in the past. I wanted to restock since I was out. Amazon got it to me quickly and for cheaper than I could find at a store (i.e. Perfumania, Macy&#x27;s, Nordstrom, etc.). I&#x27;ve very happy with my purchase, it&#x27;s my favorite cologne I&#x27;ve worn yet - which is why I wanted more. Yes, I recommend</li>
            <li> Because I want all the ladies to myself. Do I really need to say anything else about it.... no I didnt think so.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my brother &amp; he loves it!</li>
            <li> Attracts noses!!!  Great scent!!!  Good for jeans and a sweater to slacks and a tie (with a vest of course)!!!</li>
            <li> Women LOVE this scent.  The fragrance is very long lasting – noticeable even the following morning.</li>
            <li> I am noticing several men saying they have been complimented on their smell while wearing this... There is a reason for that... It smells like a female perfume! I got a sample that didn&#x27;t say for men, and it smelt amazing. And several other family members smelt it and all said I should get myself a bottle... I go into the store to get it and they said it&#x27;s a perfume for men... I was in shock. It isn&#x27;t a manly perfume. It sweet and nice. I only gave 3 stars because this should be made for men and women. Because clearly women are drawn to it!</li>
            <li> Great deal for an authentic product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a big fan of this cologne.... It&#x27;s one of the best scents that I think I&#x27;ve ever used.  I&#x27;ve always received a lot of compliments from the people around me when I use it.  So when I saw it here on Amazon at a much discounted price, I jumped on the deal! Excellent service too; I received it about 3 or 4 days after I ordered it.</li>
            <li> I got it for my husband as a Father&#x27;s Day gift and he liked it</li>
            <li> I have been wearing this cologne for @3 years and it is my signature colgne so I am very familiar. I ordered from Amazon, because they were listed as the seller and they are generally trustworthy. Now unless, YSL has changed the product, the EDT that i received applies and fades like an aftershave. Their are no lingering tones or a subtle smell. TO test i sprayed three spritzes on my wrist the immediate scent is of alcohol with a mild scent of the original essence of the cologne. Went to the mall same product one squirt and i was reminded again why i liked this cologne.  The difference in the product I was sent v. the products that i previously received from Sephora and available at Macy&#x27;s is night and day.  The no return policy on colgne does not help, but I am extremely disappointed with the product and more importantly the lack of quality control by amazon.</li>
            <li> Absolutely love this smell. The packaging was smart and the cologne did not fail to impress.</li>
            <li> Do you ever have one of those moments when you can smell your sweat. When you get nervous and you don&#x27;t break into a sweat, but you can smell the sweat. It&#x27;s not bad, it doesn&#x27;t smell like water, but it smells like you&#x27;re a human...At the end of a long work day when you take your shirt off and smell it, the shirt doesn&#x27;t smell like water, but it smells like sweat (not in a bad way, but like you were productive)...This cologne makes that smell/mixes into it. It makes your sweat smell better. It smells like you&#x27;re an alpha leader, and you fought difficult office battles all day, and won.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It doesn&#x27;t project amazingly, but you can definitely smell it. And you smell like a leader.</li>
            <li> Nice fragrance. Love the bottle too.</li>
            <li> Very subtle, almost floral bouquet on top of a solid woody smell.  My girlfriend absolutely loves it.</li>
            <li> I am obsessed with this scent.  I got it after smelling it originally at Sephora, it was much cheaper on amazon!! I got it for my boyfriend and now his friends have asked his permission to buy it themselves!</li>
            <li> Not much to say other than one of the best colognes out there, espically for the price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend that every man should have this, but then we all dont what to smell like each other.</li>
            <li> I see another review that had the same complaint as mine. I have been wearing this cologne for the past 2 years, and this is not the YSL L&#x27;homme scent.  This is either: 1) a cheap knockoff, or 2) an expired bottle of the cologne because it&#x27;s been sitting in a warehouse for several years.  This is unusual for me because i have relied on Amazon for cologne purchases in the past with no complaints which I thought I could trust. All I will say is buyer beware.  I&#x27;d recommend going somewhere else to buy it in the off chance you run into the same problem I and others have had here.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*EDIT* - I just want to note that I called Amazon about a month after the cologne was delivered (about the time I opened the product), and they refunded me.  So if people experience the same problem, call Amazon and you will be taken care of.</li>
            <li> As advertised , good quality</li>
            <li> I bought this for my son and he and his fiancee really love the masculine, not too sweet scent that it is</li>
            <li> The wife loves it and that&#x27;s all that matters. Great scent, not too strong. I get a lot of compliments. Purchased on amazon for $56. Department Store had it for $80</li>
            <li> We like to call this scent get naked</li>
            <li> makes my son smile&lt;br /&gt;dont think you should hold this to a specific amount of words......not a good idea .....really?</li>
            <li> Sensual &amp; alluring, a must-have for every modern man.&lt;br /&gt;I simply cannot get enough of this scent!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great price / value!</li>
            <li> Smells Awesome! Definitely recommened!</li>
            <li> Long lasting, smells fantastic and without a doubt the real thing.</li>
            <li> The scent is not overwhelming and everyone always compliments me on it. I will definitely be buying another bottle when my 1st one is done.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: I absolutely love this. My 2nd bottle is now finished but I noticed something different. The scent seem to not last so long and it takes more sprays because it does not shoot anything out when I first start to spray. So I was curious and thought id read more reviews on here and it turns out that I guess Amazon sometimes might sell you a fake one... I believe my 2nd bottle was a fake because my 1st bottle was so amazing but I didn&#x27;t get that amazing feel from the 2nd. I love this product so much that I will continue to buy but just be more aware if its the fake or real. So I suggest everyone do their research on how to spot a fake one thanks to these reviews.</li>
            <li> Product came in quickly, well packaged and smells great. It wa a gift for my fiance, he loved it.</li>
            <li> If you want your man to smell great, then this is the one for him and you.  He will smell great all day.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a bit of a cologne junky and I was introduced to YSL thanks to La Nuit and some recommendations from others. I&#x27;ve gotten nothing but compliments on the La Nuit which is spectacular cologne, but haven&#x27;t gotten any compliments on L&#x27;Homme. I have about five colognes that I switch between including this one, but I almost never use L&#x27;Homme and I&#x27;m not sure why. It smells great, it&#x27;s a clean, clean clothes like smell - but I don&#x27;t find myself coming back to it. I ordered it almost four months ago and still have 90% of the bottle. I&#x27;ve smelled the other YSL&#x27;s at the department stores, and La Nuit is the best. It holds and draws attention - I&#x27;d buy that before trying L&#x27;Homme if anyone is doing a blind buy. Don&#x27;t get me wrong, this is a top notch cologne and smells great, but in regard to my own personal taste, it just isn&#x27;t exactly my thing. However, YSL never ceases to deliver with their quality products and the price here on Amazon is the best.</li>
            <li> This scent is such a mood change. No matter how bad I feel at times this smell will make my day. I discover it on one of my magazines and the moment I smelled it, on the paper, I had to have it. I am not using it often (save it for special occasions) so every time I put it on it feels like brand new.&lt;br /&gt;I find hard to describe a scent but this one just feels right for anytime of the day.</li>
            <li> Smells great and my husband loves it...It was a b-day gift!</li>
            <li> My lady loves this on me!!!  Nuff said!</li>
            <li> Love the smell of this. I&#x27;m always sniffing my hubby when he wears this slightly floral sweet but musky. Love it. If you like Amen by Thierry Mugler tou will like this.</li>
            <li> This is a very smooth scent. I would say it is a safe and versatile fragrance.&lt;br /&gt;Some of the negatives are projection and longevity. Definitely closer to the skin and maybe 4 hours tops for longevity.</li>
            <li> This cologne smells so sexy on my boyfriend. I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> a gift...wonderful aroma</li>
            <li> The Best Perfume I ever had!!!!!</li>
            <li> Love this fragrance. Although for men, women like to wear it, too.</li>
            <li> MAKES ME SMELL LIKE THE BABY JESUS.</li>
            <li> 30 yr old son loved it!</li>
            <li> I love it. It&#x27;s was very nice and feels nice, it was fast and I would recommend it to everyone</li>
            <li> Excelente producto!!!</li>
            <li> That is what every girl including my mom has said to me after 2 sprays of this bad boy. This cologne is one of my personal favorites!!! Simply put, excuse my language but this cologne is the s***.</li>
            <li> Smell real good and it last a long time</li>
            <li> This is a great cologne with a very soft subtle scent. It was a terrific value costing $30 less than at department stores.</li>
            <li> This was purchased as a gift and he loved it!!!  the price was good as well for a classic scent</li>
            <li> My husband wanted this so bad snd he was not disappointed, he loves it!</li>
            <li> This is a great product with a nice pleasant fragrance that is not to strong. It also last all day long.</li>
            <li> Perfect for the office, inoffensive and pleasant. Longevity isn’t the best but works for me because I switch to a nighttime fragrance after the workday.</li>
            <li> Been using this since it came out. For someone who takes body fragrances very seriously, i have tried countless colognes. This is absolutely the best cologne ever.</li>
