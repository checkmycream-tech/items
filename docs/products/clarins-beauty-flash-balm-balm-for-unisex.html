    <ol>
            <li>Between the smell and the clogged pores, I don&#x27;t think this product is the best for me.</li>
            <li>so this is perfect for me.  </li>
            <li>My face looks flawless every time.</li>
            <li>Best primer there is!</li>
            <li>Great as moisturizer/brightener under makeup.</li>
            <li>It does work at improving radiance and making my skin glow, so for that I&#x27;m happy to have it.</li>

            <li>and I love it!</li>
            <li>It gives your skin this amazing glow that I can&#x27;t explain.</li>
            <li>It also has a luxurious texture that just feels nice going on your skin.  </li>
            <li>This gives you a vibrant flush and helps you look as though you have slept a good 8 hours!!</li>
            <li>Love it, love it, love it!</li>
            <li>Have used this off and on for many years, think it is a great product, goes on easily, light scent, smooth texture.</li>
            <li>;) just placed an order for more!!</li>
            <li>This product is wonderful, and if you use it as directed, it makes your makeup look great and fresh all day long, and it also diminishes the appearance of wrinkles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love all Clarins products.  </li>
            <li>It makes my skin glow and look healthy.</li>
            <li>and I have to make sure I use overnight cream to give my skin some moisture because this balm is not moisturizer at all.</li>
            <li>I have used this product for many years</li>
            <li>This is an amazing product - just make sure it is the genuine article</li>
            <li>Love this product.  </li>
            <li>Upon finishing, was going to buy more but seems too pricey.  </li>
            <li>Very lightweight, great by itself or under makeup..</li>
            <li>There are just better things out there for me at my age.</li>
            <li>Love this cream, now founded cheaper through walmart</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m sure Clarins just changed it</li>
            <li>you&#x27;re better off going for a BB cream or a tinted moisturizer.</li>
            <li>so there are much BETTER primer/hydrator hybrids that do a better job.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Love clarins products.</li>
            <li>Finally able to find one without color in it.</li>
            <li>love it used it for years</li>
            <li>It helps to give your skin a nice smooth surface to apply tinted moisturizers or sunscreens ( or foundations if that is your thing) and could not be easier to use.</li>
            <li>I love this product.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am not so sure about this, maybe this batch of products just comes like this.</li>
            <li>Just bought an another authentic balm from Clarins...</li>
            <li>I needed something that would make me look more awake on nights that I don&#x27;t get my required beauty sleep.</li>
            <li>You can follow it up with your favorite foundation or BB creme.</li>
            <li>free to ask any questions regarding the product or my review and leave me feedback !&lt;br /&gt;Thanks</li>
            <li>I was so excited to try this, considering what a cult favorite it is.</li>
            <li>its fine for a couple of hours</li>
            <li>However, after getting over that I&#x27;ve found it really adds a nice dewiness and glow to my skin when I put it on before applying my BB cream.</li>
            <li>this product leaves a smooth surface and foundation seems to stay on skin longer.</li>
            <li>This cream goes on easy, non-greasy and leaves a fresh dewy feel and look to the face.</li>
            <li>and you really, really do need moisturizer over the top.  </li>
            <li>You have to press this product into your skin, rubbing makes it roll up, and it absorbs quickly.</li>
            <li>I love using this with Philosophy&#x27;s Supernatural Superbeautiful Makeup.  </li>
            <li>I can also be a bit sallow, so using radiance boosters helps correct the tone and makes my skin look more vibrant.</li>
            <li>Luckily this version did not do any harm to me, so I use it as mask now, put on and rinse after 10 min.</li>
            <li>Clarins is by far the best face cream I have ever used, and I&#x27;ve used a few.</li>
            <li>Worth every penny.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s worth</li>
            <li>so I noticed right away the the smell wasn&#x27;t right</li>
            <li>and if you are uncertain, give the seller a chance to make it right.</li>
            <li>The lady is always right</li>
            <li>Feels a bit sticky at first</li>
            <li>Make sure you are buying the 1.7 ounce and the price matches as some companies are selling the lesser amount for the price of the 1.7 - that&#x27;s a con.&lt;br /&gt;Fantastic product.</li>
            <li>( it&#x27;s a peachy color) in the lotion that causes the skin to look flushed and glowing , but it really works!</li>
            <li>It smells like cheap potpourri or old play makeup my grandma gave me as a kid.</li>
            <li>It takes 10-15 mins to get the full benefits, which isn&#x27;t really practical time-wise to use before work (which is when I would personally really like to use it).</li>
            <li>I really looked fresh and recharged.  </li>
            <li>First of all,I know this product, and I like it.&lt;br</li>
            <li>this one came pretty fast.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks</li>
            <li>I am fair skinned and spent too much time as a kid outside in the sun ( but it was worth it!)</li>
            <li>However, it didn&#x27;t really happen.</li>
            <li>This stuff smooths my skin a bit, and just imparts a gentle glow.</li>
            <li>Very youthful.</li>
            <li>Thanks Clarins</li>
            <li>But so much skincare technology has happened since --</li>
            <li>and it really works.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve been using this for a few months now and 1 tube has lasted me quite a while, which is also nice.</li>
            <li>With so many other products on the market though, once I&#x27;m done with this tube I&#x27;ll be searching for something else.</li>
            <li>Originally was free at major dept. store when purchasing other cosmetics.  </li>
            <li>I blend the two for a sheer effect, then just powder the T zone with a little rice powder, some blush, and I am good to go.</li>
            <li>Brightens the whole face , I feel like a completely new person....</li>
            <li>would also highly recommend this seller because there was an error on the advertisement, and this seller immediately corrected it to my advantage.  </li>
            <li>I put it on over a light moisturizer being careful to smooth on carefully vs. rubbing on</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t expect to put this on and have it behave like a normal moisturizer.</li>
            <li>Believe it or not, a friend in New Zealand recommended this beauty product to me</li>
            <li>Ok, I admit , I was a bit skeptical at first , but this stuff  really works!</li>
            <li>/&gt;Unfortunately I had to make  a second order, because the first one I never received.&lt;br</li>
            <li>A small amount goes a long way and put your own moisturizer over the top once it has dried.  </li>
            <li>It is the only thing that really tightens my face.</li>
            <li>This is by far my biggest issue with the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>,  so this helps to soothe my way too sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>Right off, the tube looked different and was hard, like it was filled with air.</li>
            <li>Finding this on Amazon at a much lower cost than other beauty stores was a real treat.</li>
            <li>Usually buy directly from Clarins when there are free gift with purchase</li>
            <li>the parcel arrived, I found that the tube design is a bit different from those I purchased before: new package, I thought.</li>
            <li>There is no other product like it.</li>
            <li>I was nervous to use it since it looked different but it smells the same and works exactly the same.</li>
            <li>The only downside sometimes is that I have sensitive skin</li>
            <li>Additionally, even though I rubbed it in completely it still left my skin tacky and made me look shiny (not glowing,</li>
            <li>It can even be used as just a moisturizer for those lazy days where you can&#x27;t be bothered to put on a full face of makeup.</li>
            <li>At first I was a little weirded out by this product, because you don&#x27;t rub it in to your face.</li>

            <li> It can even be used as just a moisturizer for those lazy days where you can&#x27;t be bothered to put on a full face of makeup.</li>
            <li> At first I was a little weirded out by this product, because you don&#x27;t rub it in to your face.</li>
            <li> Then I found the balm comes in slightly lighter color: new formula, I thought.</li>
            <li> This product never soaked in no matter how long I pressed.</li>
            <li> Will use it for date night, and going out after a long day.</li>
            <li> I have been using this balm for long.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t wait too long or the foundation will flake.</li>
            <li> It is thick and really coats your face.</li>
            <li> However, the packaging is still the old style so not sure if there is expiration on the product.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not bad, it&#x27;s just not wonderful either.</li>
            <li> Gives you that little extra brightness and youthful glow.</li>
            <li> And next I applied the balm on my face and noticed that even the texture changes, it feels a little watery, like diluted.</li>
            <li> The directions said you can wear without makeup, but for me it ends up looking like dried up egg whites left on my skin.</li>
            <li> but this is actually a bitter price than the one on their website.  </li>
            <li> I bought this product to experience the awakening effect other reviewers felt.</li>
            <li> also absolutely hate the smell...and its strong!</li>
            <li> and this product has a thick, sticky texture which caused a small breakout after only one use as a primer.</li>
            <li> I pat a little on my face then immediately put on my foundation.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t blend well, and just felt like a really heavy moisturizer.</li>
            <li> I did.&lt;br /&gt;But it always leaves a white residue behind.</li>

            <li> I love all Clarins products.  This product tightens and brightens your face.  I don&#x27;t use anything else over it.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know why this product works, but it does work well. I pat a little on my face then immediately put on my foundation. It makes my skin glow and look healthy. I use it off/on throughout the day. I&#x27;m hooked! Now it&#x27;s time to try the beauty flash balm for eyes.</li>
            <li> I have been using this for years. There is no other product like it. It is the only thing that really tightens my face. It also works really well as a base under powder mineral foundation. I also like that is it no greasy at all. It is thick and really coats your face. The only downside sometimes is that I have sensitive skin and I have to make sure I use overnight cream to give my skin some moisture because this balm is not moisturizer at all.</li>
            <li> In all fairness there is always a possibility that this was a bad tube and I did not contact the seller with my issues but I don&#x27;t believe that the product that I received was actually Clarins Beauty Flash Balm. Right off, the tube looked different and was hard, like it was filled with air. I have used this product for many years so I noticed right away the the smell wasn&#x27;t right (I compared it with the tube I was using up) and the color was off as well. Nervously, I applied some to my face and it definitely did not act like it was supposed to. You have to press this product into your skin, rubbing makes it roll up, and it absorbs quickly. This product never soaked in no matter how long I pressed. This is an amazing product - just make sure it is the genuine article and if you are uncertain, give the seller a chance to make it right.</li>
            <li> I bought this product to experience the awakening effect other reviewers felt. However, it didn&#x27;t really happen. I have relatively sensitive/fair skin and this made my skin break out and look like I have rosacea..not the look I was looking for. The directions said you can wear without makeup, but for me it ends up looking like dried up egg whites left on my skin. Also, a male friend of mine inquired about the layer of something? on my face, in a negative manner. I give it try every now and then, but sadly I see no beauty flash in my future.</li>
            <li> Want to have younger looking, firmer skin?  Buy this!  A small amount goes a long way and put your own moisturizer over the top once it has dried.  Feels a bit sticky at first but it dries in and you really, really do need moisturizer over the top.  Make sure you are buying the 1.7 ounce and the price matches as some companies are selling the lesser amount for the price of the 1.7 - that&#x27;s a con.&lt;br /&gt;Fantastic product.</li>
            <li> This product is wonderful, and if you use it as directed, it makes your makeup look great and fresh all day long, and it also diminishes the appearance of wrinkles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would also highly recommend this seller because there was an error on the advertisement, and this seller immediately corrected it to my advantage.  They credited my account the money that was in dispute (in my opinion) when they could have simply told me \\&quot;tuff luck.\\&quot;</li>
            <li> Love this product.  Originally was free at major dept. store when purchasing other cosmetics.  Upon finishing, was going to buy more but seems too pricey.  Looked at Amazon and found it for 1/2 the cost.  Great as moisturizer/brightener under makeup.</li>
            <li> Clarins is by far the best face cream I have ever used, and I&#x27;ve used a few. ;) just placed an order for more!!</li>
            <li> I love this stuff! Wear it every day although it is a bit pricey.. Very lightweight, great by itself or under makeup..</li>
            <li> This is a MUST HAVE if you wake up tired, haven&#x27;t slept or your skin needs help. This gives you a vibrant flush and helps you look as though you have slept a good 8 hours!! This and Guerlain&#x27;s Midnight Secret should be in every woman&#x27;s beauty aresenal.</li>
            <li> I am 55, and meticulous with my skin care.  I love using this with Philosophy&#x27;s Supernatural Superbeautiful Makeup.  It goes on sheer, and evens out the skin tone.  I blend the two for a sheer effect, then just powder the T zone with a little rice powder, some blush, and I am good to go. This stuff smooths my skin a bit, and just imparts a gentle glow. Love it, love it, love it!</li>
            <li> This cream goes on easy, non-greasy and leaves a fresh dewy feel and look to the face. Very youthful. Thanks Clarins</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not bad, it&#x27;s just not wonderful either. There are just better things out there for me at my age.</li>
            <li> Love this cream, now founded cheaper through walmart</li>
            <li> I love this product! It makes my skin look amazing! I put it on before I put on my makeup or before I go to sleep and it instantly smooths everything out. The bottle it came in was different from the bottle in the picture (which is what I am used to) but I&#x27;m sure Clarins just changed it and it is the legitimate product. I was nervous to use it since it looked different but it smells the same and works exactly the same.</li>
            <li> Ok, I admit , I was a bit skeptical at first , but this stuff  really works! Not sure if it has some form of pigment ( it&#x27;s a peachy color) in the lotion that causes the skin to look flushed and glowing , but it really works! It gives your skin this amazing glow that I can&#x27;t explain. Worth every penny.</li>
            <li> I was so excited to try this, considering what a cult favorite it is. This didn&#x27;t do anything for my skin. Didn&#x27;t blend well, and just felt like a really heavy moisturizer. I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s worth the price- you&#x27;re better off going for a BB cream or a tinted moisturizer.</li>
            <li> its fine for a couple of hours but then fades away</li>
            <li> Gives you that little extra brightness and youthful glow. Love it! Apply after moisturizer. Hope the results continue with use.</li>
            <li> I bought it because my skin often looks tired and dull. I can also be a bit sallow, so using radiance boosters helps correct the tone and makes my skin look more vibrant. You can use this as either a facial mask or as a type of primer underneath your makeup. Personally, I will NEVER use this underneath my makeup again. I have oily problem skin and this product has a thick, sticky texture which caused a small breakout after only one use as a primer. Additionally, even though I rubbed it in completely it still left my skin tacky and made me look shiny (not glowing, mind you, but greasy). My skin felt like there was a film over it all day and by the time I got home my skin looked so greasy I looked like I never washed my face. Not good all around.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also absolutely hate the smell...and its strong! It smells like cheap potpourri or old play makeup my grandma gave me as a kid. This is by far my biggest issue with the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Aside from that, I like to use this as a mask in the morning. It takes 10-15 mins to get the full benefits, which isn&#x27;t really practical time-wise to use before work (which is when I would personally really like to use it). Still, I&#x27;ve used it before going out on weekends or after work to look refreshed. It does work at improving radiance and making my skin glow, so for that I&#x27;m happy to have it. I just can&#x27;t get passed the smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using this for a few months now and 1 tube has lasted me quite a while, which is also nice. With so many other products on the market though, once I&#x27;m done with this tube I&#x27;ll be searching for something else. Between the smell and the clogged pores, I don&#x27;t think this product is the best for me. I also feel its over-priced.</li>
            <li> The lady is always right and she likes this stuff, so it works for me. It was delivered timely and without deffect.</li>
            <li> This product used to be the cult-status item of the 90s. But so much skincare technology has happened since -- so there are much BETTER primer/hydrator hybrids that do a better job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t expect to put this on and have it behave like a normal moisturizer. Due to the polymers that act as film formers to maintain hydration, the film eventually peels off into plasticized bits that coagulate, peeling off and making your skin look worse. If you touch your face, it will get worse because you are disturbing the &amp;#34;film&amp;#34; that has set.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As a rinse-off masque, it does its job. As a moisturizer/primer, it just doesn&#x27;t perform for all day wear.</li>
            <li> Have used this off and on for many years, think it is a great product, goes on easily, light scent, smooth texture. I really looked fresh and recharged.  Will use it for date night, and going out after a long day.</li>
            <li> Foul smell, I don&#x27;t like it at all. Want my money back.</li>
            <li> An amazing primer, moisturizer, or even a mask! This multitask balm is a great pick me up on those days where you want to add an oomph to your makeup routine. It can even be used as just a moisturizer for those lazy days where you can&#x27;t be bothered to put on a full face of makeup. Love it!</li>
            <li> Love clarins products. Finally able to find one without color in it. Will definatley order again. It&#x27; a great product</li>
            <li> This is the only product my wife will use.</li>
            <li> To begin with you have to pat and not rub this product on your face. I did.&lt;br /&gt;But it always leaves a white residue behind. In the middle of the day if I accidently touch my face the product is on my fingers. I am definitely not wearing all day.&lt;br /&gt;May be use it as a mask and finish the rest of the product.&lt;br /&gt;Not buying it again.</li>
            <li> Excellent product....feels so nice and smooth... Brightens the whole face , I feel like a completely new person.... Use it sparingly so that your face does not get used to it..</li>
            <li> love it used it for years</li>
            <li> I like this balm a lot.  It feels great on my skin and makes my skin look healthy and glowing.</li>
            <li> Makes my skin tighter and brighter. I put it on over a light moisturizer being careful to smooth on carefully vs. rubbing on and then I wait 10 minutes before putting on foundation.</li>
            <li> Believe it or not, a friend in New Zealand recommended this beauty product to me so I bought two and I love it!</li>
            <li> I am not a make up type of gal so this is perfect for me.  It helps to give your skin a nice smooth surface to apply tinted moisturizers or sunscreens ( or foundations if that is your thing) and could not be easier to use. It also has a luxurious texture that just feels nice going on your skin.  I am fair skinned and spent too much time as a kid outside in the sun ( but it was worth it!),  so this helps to soothe my way too sensitive skin.  Finding this on Amazon at a much lower cost than other beauty stores was a real treat.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know how I ever wore make up before discovering this stuff. My face looks flawless every time. I don&#x27;t know how to explain it, but this is a must have.  I feel late for just getting up on the hype...and boy do I understand the hype. Buy it. You won&#x27;t regret it.</li>
            <li> I love this product.  Usually buy directly from Clarins when there are free gift with purchase but this is actually a bitter price than the one on their website.  However, the packaging is still the old style so not sure if there is expiration on the product.</li>
            <li> I have been using this balm for long. I used to place orders from Clarins official site when they offer some discount. This year I missed it so I turned to some Amazon seller.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When the parcel arrived, I found that the tube design is a bit different from those I purchased before: new package, I thought. Then I found the balm comes in slightly lighter color: new formula, I thought. And next I applied the balm on my face and noticed that even the texture changes, it feels a little watery, like diluted. Later I also detected the scent differs in a very subtle way...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am not so sure about this, maybe this batch of products just comes like this. Luckily this version did not do any harm to me, so I use it as mask now, put on and rinse after 10 min. Just bought an another authentic balm from Clarins...</li>
            <li> I needed something that would make me look more awake on nights that I don&#x27;t get my required beauty sleep.I tried this and it really works. The trick is it use it as recommended. A thin layer is all you and it needs to be applied in long strokes. You can follow it up with your favorite foundation or BB creme. Don&#x27;t wait too long or the foundation will flake.You can follow it up with some blush and it will give you the \\&quot;glow \\&quot; you need!&lt;br /&gt;Feel free to ask any questions regarding the product or my review and leave me feedback !&lt;br /&gt;Thanks</li>
            <li> At first I was a little weirded out by this product, because you don&#x27;t rub it in to your face. However, after getting over that I&#x27;ve found it really adds a nice dewiness and glow to my skin when I put it on before applying my BB cream.</li>
            <li> Best primer there is!</li>
            <li> First of all,I know this product, and I like it.&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately I had to make  a second order, because the first one I never received.&lt;br /&gt;But this one came pretty fast.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks</li>
            <li> This came actually works as a base for foundation.  I have used several...this product leaves a smooth surface and foundation seems to stay on skin longer.</li>
