            <li>I love this product!</li>
            <li>I feel much better after using it!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a really light serum that&#x27;s a great moisturizer for summer.  </li>
            <li>Smells great and my skin feels so smooth.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a but thicker than water but still runny and smells amazing</li>
            <li>Amazing.</li>
            <li>Plus it smells amazing.</li>
            <li>Nice experience</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve heard soo many good things about this line of theirs and thought to give it a try.</li>
            <li>This is a good serum in that it maintains my pimple free skin.</li>
            <li>Smell is great, texture is slightly thinner than some serums (Eclos Cellular Activating Serum and Lancome Genifique are a bit thicker than this), and my skin feels wonderfully hydrated after use.</li>
            <li>It soaks in to my skin very quickly though!</li>
            <li>It absorbs quickly into the skin and smells good leaving my skin feeling moisturized.</li>
            <li>Smells like hairspray and made my pores huge!</li>
            <li>After I stopped using this I noticed more bumps on face</li>
            <li>Nowadays I use this after toner and sometimes I apply a sheet mask after wards and it helps to absorbs more of the product into my skin.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Korean serums have an incredible feel-good factor, and Innisfree&#x27;s has a nice cocktail of botanical extracts, but personally, i found no difference in my skin, which needs more actives.</li>
            <li>Love this.</li>
            <li>I had already heard about this serum before, so I decided to research more on this.</li>
            <li>My skin feels more hydrated, and has a better complexion.</li>
            <li>Combined with Bikram yoga - my skin has never looked better.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>I love using this under my moisturizer.  </li>
            <li>Love it...</li>
            <li>I love this serum.</li>
            <li>Love this stuff.</li>
            <li>Skin has become slightly more radiant after repeated use, as well.</li>
            <li>This $20 serum is about twice the size and amazingly as potent as many more expensive/premium serums.</li>
            <li>Love it .</li>
            <li>and I absolutely love the product.</li>
            <li>Will buy more products soon &amp;#60;3</li>
            <li>Not too sure about the smell...</li>
            <li>I really like this serum and also price is good.</li>
            <li>It does have alcohol (and you can smell it), so I wouldn&#x27;t over use this, and would use a strong moisturizer with it.  </li>
            <li>Experience the Divine Scent of a Lush Rose Garden, While Rose Oils and Hyaluronic Acid Plump up Fine Lines , Boosts Elasticity and Restore &amp;#34;Bounce&amp;#34; to Skin.]]</li>
            <li>But that&#x27;s fine.</li>
            <li>but it hydrates very well on its own.</li>
            <li>Guess, my light bulb decided to work</li>
            <li>Beautifully composed to absorb quickly into the skin, with the help of alcohol as the third ingredient.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used it for 3 days and my skin feels better and much softer!</li>
            <li>Item was brand new, unopened, in its own box.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s light, non-sticky and absorbs into the skin quickly.</li>
            <li>my skin needs, i use a &amp;#34;serum spray&amp;#34; (also a cool concept)</li>
            <li>I have the oiliest skin imaginable and this doesn&#x27;t clog my pores and it leaves my face feeling super refreshed and hydrated.</li>
            <li>It absorbs almost immediately and adequately moisturises the skin.</li>
            <li>I was shopping around for a good light weight serum that wouldn&#x27;t be too heavy or irritate my acne prone skin.</li>
            <li>I have extremely sensitive skin and this product was perfect for me - fully moisturizing without any trouble.</li>
            <li>It feels fresh and minimizes pores.</li>
            <li>I needed a moisturizing serum to use right after I wash my face.</li>
            <li>Spreads easily and makes my skin soft!</li>
            <li>right after you cleanse your first to block the moisture on your face from evaporating.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m slowly making my way through the more popular Korean skincare brands.</li>
            <li>The serum is light enough to go on smoothly on my face.</li>
            <li>My skin feels better, it&#x27;s not dry anymore.</li>
            <li>It shipps very fast from South Korea to U.S.</li>
            <li>It does work very well!</li>
            <li>that is alcohol-free and has higher levels of actives:</li>
            <li>I use this in place of a moisturiser sometimes if the weather is too hot.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Worth a try if it&#x27;s your first time buying a serum from Innisfree, but it&#x27;s pricey for repurchase.</li>
            <li>First time I used it, I broke out around my Uzone (around my mouth) and along my jaw line.</li>
            <li>I will definitely order more.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never really used any kind of skin product or routine before, but I can tell these products work.</li>
            <li>So happy with purchase ;D Arived way earlier then expected date.</li>
            <li>This serum is gentle and do not cause me any irritations by now, and it can be absorbed quite fast.</li>
            <li>For more mature skins, this may not be powerful enough to make a difference.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It took me 2 weeks to get most of my irritated rashy skin back to almost normal.</li>
            <li>thanks.</li>
            <li>I was trying to overcompensate by slathering layers of moisturizer, which actually really clogged my pores, since I have oily skin.</li>
            <li>: I find this brighten up my skin tone and hydrates it very well.</li>
            <li>However, it is very watery, too watery for my taste</li>
            <li>Shipping was fast.</li>
            <li>It feels very well produced</li>
            <li>When I use it on a regular basis, sometimes I become &amp;#34;lazy&amp;#34;, after cleansing my face night/morning, my skin feels so silky smooth and refreshed.</li>
            <li>I eventually found what my skin wants.</li>
            <li>My skin is very oily, but since I&#x27;ve been using these products, the oils is not in excess.</li>
            <li>I can see my skin is so much healthier after using this product.</li>
            <li>It has a scent, which concerned me at first seeing as I have eczema and am sensitive to certain smells at times.</li>
            <li>Individuals sensitive to alcohol may want to be aware -- but despite this, the feel, fragrance, and finish of the serum is a pleasure to experience.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I notice a more even skin tone all around and less acne</li>
            <li>/&gt;Since I&#x27;ve purchased this, I&#x27;ve ordered the Green Tea Balancing Skin, and love it as well.</li>
            <li>If you have normal skin</li>
            <li>Love the green tea smell</li>
            <li>The smell is lovely and not strong.</li>
            <li>Item is brand new and well packed.</li>
            <li>I let it pass because it&#x27;s bound to happen...breaking out when trying a new product out.</li>
            <li>and I came to a very clear conclusion this product was NOT for me.</li>
            <li>One full pump (which is tiny) covers my entire face (though not my neck line).</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d recommend this for young skin in their 20s to early 30s.</li>
            <li>Makes my skin soft and glowy, and you get a lot for what you pay for.</li>
            <li>It worked very well, if you have properly cleaned your skin.</li>
            <li>My complexion seems so much smoother and deeply moisturized.</li>
            <li>It is totally worth the price, I thought it would be bigger, but it is pretty small.</li>
            <li>I put it on right after I cleanse my face and when it is slightly damp, and I can feel my skin drink it all up.</li>
            <li>The smell is a little different, but it&#x27;s not bad and fades soon after you put it on.</li>
            <li>The smell is really fresh and the serum is pretty thin.</li>
            <li>Since this serum is suitable for all skin types, I decided to try it first, and have not be disappointed.</li>
            <li>The innisfree products are the only ones I found where green tea is the FIRST ingredient.  </li>
            <li>A pump is enough for my whole face, but I always do an extra half pump for my neck.</li>

            <li> and I came to a very clear conclusion this product was NOT for me.</li>
            <li> One full pump (which is tiny) covers my entire face (though not my neck line).</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d recommend this for young skin in their 20s to early 30s.</li>
            <li> Makes my skin soft and glowy, and you get a lot for what you pay for.</li>
            <li> It worked very well, if you have properly cleaned your skin.</li>
            <li> My complexion seems so much smoother and deeply moisturized.</li>
            <li> It is totally worth the price, I thought it would be bigger, but it is pretty small.</li>
            <li> I put it on right after I cleanse my face and when it is slightly damp, and I can feel my skin drink it all up.</li>
            <li> The smell is a little different, but it&#x27;s not bad and fades soon after you put it on.</li>
            <li> The smell is really fresh and the serum is pretty thin.</li>
            <li> Since this serum is suitable for all skin types, I decided to try it first, and have not be disappointed.</li>
            <li> The innisfree products are the only ones I found where green tea is the FIRST ingredient.  </li>
            <li> A pump is enough for my whole face, but I always do an extra half pump for my neck.</li>
            <li> I gave this product only four stars because it is not moisturizing enough for my dry skin.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m not sure if it was this because I was using multiple new products on my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Orders from this seller came earlier than expected.</li>
            <li> Product does take a long time to arrive, but it&#x27;s shipped from Korea</li>
            <li> its smaller than expected but its hydrating</li>
            <li> However, this product is quite drying due to the alcohol content that I was previously unaware of.</li>
            <li> I won&#x27;t repurchase since I have extremely dry skin.</li>
            <li> Well, I tried a 2nd time and my face got slightly itchy.</li>
            <li> Still looking for a topical with 2% to 3% green tea, but until then this should do.  </li>
            <li> so that&#x27;s expected.</li>
            <li> It has the same scent as the rest of the green tea line.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> I just want to say it came before the due date</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this along with other Innisfree products for about a week now and my skin quality has been improving.</li>
            <li> The consistency is sticky and takes a little while to dry after application.</li>
            <li> and maybe even less oily.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m still dealing with some slight itching.  </li>
            <li> My skin doesn&#x27;t feel tight anymore.</li>
            <li> The product was well-wrapped with another 2 little samples.</li>
            <li> Just apply a little spot of the serum on your face, about 3ml, and that&#x27;s sufficient.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d yet to try Innisfree, and when I learned of their Green Tea line, I knew where to start.</li>
            <li> Also, like my title says, I&#x27;m also awaiting the mineral mist in the mail, and am planning to purchase the Green Tea Seed Oil.</li>
            <li> I have alot of acne, pit scaring, and uneven skin tone.</li>
            <li> I read on some review site that the Innisfree green tea seed serum treats dehydrated skin.</li>
            <li> Everything else claiming to be &amp;#34;green tea,&amp;#34; whether lotions or cleansers, if you read the ingredients, green tea is like the 7th on the list.  </li>
            <li> I use this product under my make up everyday.</li>
            <li> All their green tea skin care product line.</li>
            <li> Non sticky and heavy</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never noticed how dried out my skin was until I started using their products.</li>
            <li> The dramatic difference isn&#x27;t as noticable with regular use, but I do continue to use this.  </li>
            <li> Pretty disappointed with this product.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m not sure if it has done anything with my skin yet.</li>
            <li> and I broke out with cluster bumps around my mouth and my skin turned rough in that area and mad itching followed.</li>
            <li> I was guilty of washing my face and letting all the moisture evaporate, which explains why my face became so dehydrated.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t have paraben, which N7 and Olay fail to do.</li>
            <li> Very thin and leave your skin refreshed and nutrient.</li>
            <li> However, what I didn&#x27;t care for is that the serum is very thin.</li>

            <li> Love this! It does work very well! I feel my skin is getting better!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m slowly making my way through the more popular Korean skincare brands. I&#x27;d yet to try Innisfree, and when I learned of their Green Tea line, I knew where to start. Since this serum is suitable for all skin types, I decided to try it first, and have not be disappointed. A pump is enough for my whole face, but I always do an extra half pump for my neck. It has a scent, which concerned me at first seeing as I have eczema and am sensitive to certain smells at times. It hasn&#x27;t affected me at all, and I&#x27;ve come to like it now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since I&#x27;ve purchased this, I&#x27;ve ordered the Green Tea Balancing Skin, and love it as well. Also, like my title says, I&#x27;m also awaiting the mineral mist in the mail, and am planning to purchase the Green Tea Seed Oil.</li>
            <li> It is totally worth the price, I thought it would be bigger, but it is pretty small. It feels very refreshing to the skin.</li>
            <li> I discovered this product on a recent visit to Korea.  It is the best moisturizer/ face conditioner I have ever used.</li>
            <li> I have the oiliest skin imaginable and this doesn&#x27;t clog my pores and it leaves my face feeling super refreshed and hydrated. I was shopping around for a good light weight serum that wouldn&#x27;t be too heavy or irritate my acne prone skin. I feel like this has done wonders for my skin since I&#x27;ve started using it. I have alot of acne, pit scaring, and uneven skin tone. I notice a more even skin tone all around and less acne and maybe even less oily. After I stopped using this I noticed more bumps on face so whatever is in this is my savior because before this I would break out constantly. Nowadays I use this after toner and sometimes I apply a sheet mask after wards and it helps to absorbs more of the product into my skin.</li>
            <li> Beautifully composed to absorb quickly into the skin, with the help of alcohol as the third ingredient. Alcohol flashes off as a volatile, leaving a weightless texture as it evaporates. Individuals sensitive to alcohol may want to be aware -- but despite this, the feel, fragrance, and finish of the serum is a pleasure to experience.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Korean serums have an incredible feel-good factor, and Innisfree&#x27;s has a nice cocktail of botanical extracts, but personally, i found no difference in my skin, which needs more actives. I&#x27;d recommend this for young skin in their 20s to early 30s. For more mature skins, this may not be powerful enough to make a difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For my skin needs, i use a &amp;#34;serum spray&amp;#34; (also a cool concept) that is alcohol-free and has higher levels of actives: [[ASIN:B007Z5XDPC By Celebrity Facialist Cecilia Wong.

            <li> Good serum. It feels fresh and minimizes pores.</li>
            <li> thanks. good product, excellent seller.!</li>
            <li> very good product. keeps moisturizing</li>
            <li> Makes my skin soft and glowy, and you get a lot for what you pay for. The smell is a little different, but it&#x27;s not bad and fades soon after you put it on. Would definitely buy this again!</li>
            <li> Great product! Very thin and leave your skin refreshed and nutrient.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like the ordor.</li>
            <li> Great on my combination skin. Love this.</li>
            <li> My face has been severely dehydrated lately...due to overwashing and acne medication. I was trying to overcompensate by slathering layers of moisturizer, which actually really clogged my pores, since I have oily skin. So, I realized nothing I was doing was working, and that it was because my skin was dehydrated. I was watching some beauty show that said you must put on moisturizing toner/serum/essence right after you cleanse your first to block the moisture on your face from evaporating. I was guilty of washing my face and letting all the moisture evaporate, which explains why my face became so dehydrated. Then, I looked up a good serum to use just for this. I needed a moisturizing serum to use right after I wash my face. I had already heard about this serum before, so I decided to research more on this. I read on some review site that the Innisfree green tea seed serum treats dehydrated skin. I have been using for about two weeks. My skin feels more hydrated, and has a better complexion. It smells really good and soothing, and it feels really nice to put on. I can tell that it moisturizes really deep. I put it on right after I cleanse my face and when it is slightly damp, and I can feel my skin drink it all up. My skin doesn&#x27;t feel tight anymore. I love it!</li>
            <li> Orders from this seller came earlier than expected. Items are fresh and smells wonderful. Serum works very nice on my skin.&lt;br /&gt;I will purchase this again.</li>
            <li> This is a good serum in that it maintains my pimple free skin. However, this product is quite drying due to the alcohol content that I was previously unaware of. Nice experience but I will refrain from repurchasing this serum.</li>
            <li> Item was brand new, unopened, in its own box.  (Sometimes when you order something you can tell a bottle was opened and put back but this one wasn&#x27;t).  It&#x27;s a really light serum that&#x27;s a great moisturizer for summer.  Still looking for a topical with 2% to 3% green tea, but until then this should do.  The innisfree products are the only ones I found where green tea is the FIRST ingredient.  Everything else claiming to be &amp;#34;green tea,&amp;#34; whether lotions or cleansers, if you read the ingredients, green tea is like the 7th on the list.  Product does take a long time to arrive, but it&#x27;s shipped from Korea so that&#x27;s expected.</li>
            <li> I use this product under my make up everyday. Smells great and my skin feels so smooth.</li>
            <li> Wonderful... lightly hydrating for combination skin. I use this after Obagi wash and Obagi toner before application of Obagi 15% Vitamin C Serum and sunblock. Great light-weight addition to my skincare regime.</li>
            <li> I just want to say it came before the due date and I was very pleased. It is smaller than I thought, but then I wasn&#x27;t reading the label correctly. Any how, I only needed one pump to spread throughout the face so I imagine it&#x27;ll last me awhile. However, what I didn&#x27;t care for is that the serum is very thin. I&#x27;ve just applied it once today and will update in 10 days to see if my skin has improved. It has the same scent as the rest of the green tea line. In addition, I&#x27;d like the mention the seller is very kind. I accidently ordered 2 bottles and they have refunded me the money after I said I didn&#x27;t want two. Update: I find this brighten up my skin tone and hydrates it very well. However, it is very watery, too watery for my taste I won&#x27;t repurchase since I have extremely dry skin.</li>
            <li> My skin improves a lot after 3 weeks</li>
            <li> I really like this serum and also price is good.</li>
            <li> Smells like hairspray and made my pores huge! The consistency is sticky and takes a little while to dry after application. Pretty disappointed with this product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it for 3 days and my skin feels better and much softer! I love this product! It also even out my skin tone.</li>
            <li> The product was well-wrapped with another 2 little samples. That was so nice! This serum is gentle and do not cause me any irritations by now, and it can be absorbed quite fast.</li>
            <li> It worked very well, if you have properly cleaned your skin. Just apply a little spot of the serum on your face, about 3ml, and that&#x27;s sufficient. I think it works for every skin type. Because I have combined skin, and it didn&#x27;t cause acnes.</li>
            <li> Amazing! I have extremely sensitive skin and this product was perfect for me - fully moisturizing without any trouble. I would definitely recommend this to my friends!</li>
            <li> I use this in place of a moisturiser sometimes if the weather is too hot. It&#x27;s a but thicker than water but still runny and smells amazing (I wish there was a perfume with this fragrance!) It absorbs almost immediately and adequately moisturises the skin.</li>
            <li> I love it !! All their green tea skin care product line.</li>
            <li> Shipping was fast. Item is brand new and well packed. Will order again.</li>
            <li> its smaller than expected but its hydrating</li>
            <li> I use this after cleansing - no toner, no anything else. I have oily problem skin and this is the perfect layer before makeup. It&#x27;s absorbs but doesn&#x27;t make my skin oily. Combined with Bikram yoga - my skin has never looked better.</li>
            <li> The smell is really fresh and the serum is pretty thin. It feels very well produced but I&#x27;m not sure if it has done anything with my skin yet. I stopped using it after I started getting pimples but I&#x27;m not sure if it was this because I was using multiple new products on my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Worth a try if it&#x27;s your first time buying a serum from Innisfree, but it&#x27;s pricey for repurchase.</li>
            <li> I began using this serum about a year ago. I love it. When I use it on a regular basis, sometimes I become &amp;#34;lazy&amp;#34;, after cleansing my face night/morning, my skin feels so silky smooth and refreshed. My complexion seems so much smoother and deeply moisturized.</li>
            <li> I use it after cleansing. It absorbs quickly into the skin and smells good leaving my skin feeling moisturized.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.  I love using this under my moisturizer.  Spreads easily and makes my skin soft!</li>
            <li> It shipps very fast from South Korea to U.S. So much love this product!!</li>
            <li> Love it...my skin is hydrated now</li>
            <li> I love this serum. I eventually found what my skin wants. It doesn&#x27;t have paraben, which N7 and Olay fail to do. The serum is light enough to go on smoothly on my face. The smell is lovely and not strong. The serum makes my skin lighter, softer, and the pores become smaller. The product was shipped from Japan, so it took 3 weeks to reach my home. But that&#x27;s fine. I&#x27;m happy with this serum and will buy it again</li>
            <li> Amazing. Love this stuff. Smell is great, texture is slightly thinner than some serums (Eclos Cellular Activating Serum and Lancome Genifique are a bit thicker than this), and my skin feels wonderfully hydrated after use. One full pump (which is tiny) covers my entire face (though not my neck line). Skin has become slightly more radiant after repeated use, as well. I will repurchase. This $20 serum is about twice the size and amazingly as potent as many more expensive/premium serums.</li>
            <li> This product is awesome.</li>
            <li> This serum is the best I&#x27;ve tried. Non sticky and heavy so you can apply the rest of your skincare perfectly but it hydrates very well on its own. Definitely repurchasing. Plus it smells amazing.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve heard soo many good things about this line of theirs and thought to give it a try. First time I used it, I broke out around my Uzone (around my mouth) and along my jaw line. I let it pass because it&#x27;s bound to happen...breaking out when trying a new product out. Well, I tried a 2nd time and my face got slightly itchy. That made me pause for a day then the following day I tried it again and I broke out with cluster bumps around my mouth and my skin turned rough in that area and mad itching followed. Guess, my light bulb decided to work and I came to a very clear conclusion this product was NOT for me. It took me 2 weeks to get most of my irritated rashy skin back to almost normal. I&#x27;m still dealing with some slight itching.  FYI...I have sensitive/combo skin. And, I talked to someone else that deals with this line and it&#x27;s a hit or miss with people with my skin type.</li>
            <li> Smells great! I gave this product only four stars because it is not moisturizing enough for my dry skin. It soaks in to my skin very quickly though! If you have normal skin this product is great for you..</li>
            <li> Will buy it again! I feel much better after using it!</li>
            <li> I could tell a difference in the brightness and &amp;#34;glowiness&amp;#34; of my skin after 1 use.  The dramatic difference isn&#x27;t as noticable with regular use, but I do continue to use this.  It does have alcohol (and you can smell it), so I wouldn&#x27;t over use this, and would use a strong moisturizer with it.  It&#x27;s also not going to reverse wrinkles - I still have to use Retins for that.</li>
            <li> Love it . Smalls nice and smooths the skin beautiful . I will definitely order more.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this along with other Innisfree products for about a week now and my skin quality has been improving. I&#x27;ve never noticed how dried out my skin was until I started using their products. I&#x27;ve never really used any kind of skin product or routine before, but I can tell these products work. My skin feels better, it&#x27;s not dry anymore. My skin is very oily, but since I&#x27;ve been using these products, the oils is not in excess. It&#x27;s just enough to keep my skin from drying out. It&#x27;s light, non-sticky and absorbs into the skin quickly.</li>
            <li> So happy with purchase ;D Arived way earlier then expected date. Used it on my skin and I absolutely love the product. I can see my skin is so much healthier after using this product. Will buy more products soon &amp;#60;3</li>
            <li> Not too sure about the smell...</li>
            <li> Love the green tea smell</li>
