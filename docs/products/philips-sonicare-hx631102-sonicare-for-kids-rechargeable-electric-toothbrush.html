            <li>I was thinking a UV light disinfecting chamber would be great)    </li>
            <li>This brush is AMAZING</li>
            <li>These toothbrushes are amazing.</li>
            <li>Really amazing results.</li>
            <li>She always used my soni care (with her own brush) when she visited me.  </li>
            <li>The end tune is a nice touch.</li>
            <li>You don&#x27;t have to worry about spinning heads catching your childs cheeks.</li>
            <li>They each have their own tip.</li>
            <li>maybe my kids aren&#x27;t really brushing their teeth, LOL!!!</li>
            <li>From my own experience, I know that it is getting her teeth even cleaner.  </li>
            <li>Nice brush system for kids.</li>
            <li>This is a nice feature if it becomes a hand-me-down</li>
            <li>This looks nice but there is a problem.  </li>
            <li>I had to get him his own Sonicare.  </li>
            <li>Just in case someone is wondering, I am not an employee of Oral B nor its subsidiaries nor do I own stocks in the company.  </li>
            <li>and they are up there on their own brushing their teeth.  </li>
            <li>Having had great checkups after using my own Sonicare, I immediately picked up the Kids Sonicare model when it became available.</li>
            <li>It helps to remind them to brush all areas and they liked picking out their own decorative panel from the 3 provided.</li>
            <li>kid\\&quot; one on my own teeth.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve has a Sonicare toothebrush for many years and it has always done a good job on my teeth.</li>
            <li>i own two of these toothbrushes.  </li>
            <li>Having had great checkups after using my own Sonicare, I immediately picked up the Kids Sonicare model when it became available.</li>
            <li>so they have their own.</li>
            <li>nice design.</li>
            <li>Really nice toothbrush.</li>
            <li>The toothbrush is good and cleans my son&#x27;s teeth better than the manual one we had.</li>
            <li>Excellent yet gentle cleaning results.  </li>
            <li>இ Fuzzy Wuzzy&#x27;s Summary:&lt;br /&gt;ѾѾѾѾ Recommended with warm fuzzies.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Once you pry off the glued-on faceplate, to reuse it again, you would have to supply your own adhesive to reattach it to the brush.  </li>
            <li>Once you pry off the glued-on faceplate, to reuse it again, you would have to supply your own adhesive to reattach it to the brush.  </li>
            <li>My husband and I both use Sonicare for our own toothbrushes, and have for years, and thought we&#x27;d give this a try for our son.</li>
            <li>So, it&#x27;s just kind of tacky and unstable.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Well designed, works perfectly and the acoustic signals guide the children very well when brushing the teeth.</li>
            <li>She also liked picking which decorating plate to put on the front of the toothbrush.  </li>
            <li>She would do and say anything to get out of brushing even put herself on time out lmao.</li>
            <li>Good toothbrush for a guy as well as kids - more rugged.</li>
            <li>He is thrilled with this toothbrush and uses it every day.</li>
            <li>Also, it&#x27;s nice having the interval timer</li>
            <li>On time delivery, great price, my kids (5 &amp; 8) love them.  </li>
            <li>The grandchildren liked our Sonicare toothbrushes</li>
            <li>so I thought I&#x27;d get them their own.  </li>
            <li>She missed the vibration though and we have our own sonicare toothbrush</li>
            <li>/&gt;She likes that you can take the face off and select on of a couple designs to make it like your own setup.</li>
            <li>He can even manage on his own whilst I supervise.</li>
            <li>Thanks for the wonderful item!</li>
            <li>I let them brush their own teeth in the morning and they seem to have no problems.</li>
            <li>Loving my own sonic toothbrush, I wanted one for my child.  </li>
            <li>asking what kind of toothbrush my kids were using.  </li>
            <li>My boy is loving bruhing his teeth now.  </li>
            <li>She even enjoys (ineffectively) brushing her own teeth with it.  </li>
            <li>If we didn&#x27;t plan on using the 4+ one I probably wouldn&#x27;t have liked this, however, we made the choice to go ahead and let her do it too.  </li>
            <li>Nice kids toothbrush, recommended by my son&#x27;s dentist.</li>
            <li>He&#x27;s loving it and feels like a grown up.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s perfect for a 6 year old!!!  </li>
            <li>Originally I gave this brush 5 stars, I loved how it worked, my son loved using it</li>
            <li>/&gt;These are great and worth EVERY PENNY!</li>
            <li>But now he is happy to let me brush his teeth, and excited to try it out himself.  </li>
            <li>Well worth the money!!!</li>
            <li>Loved it, child friendly!</li>
            <li>It also seems to be doing a great job keeping his teeth clean.  </li>
            <li>It works great and the music to indicate switching to a new area is great.  </li>
            <li>An easy way to get kids to brush their teeth while knowing that it their teeth will be clean too!!!</li>
            <li>And that&#x27;s when I&#x27;m doing the brushing--he&#x27;s still not that adept at brushing his own teeth, so I still do most of the brushing.</li>
            <li>Have seen a lot of improvement in his teeth and his dentist is super happy with the results.</li>
            <li>on/off button is very easy to operate for both of our children.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Very easy to use and music</li>
            <li>We love them, but the heads are more than $7 each!  </li>
            <li>Our children needed more than our standing over them and telling them to brush more, brush longer!  </li>
            <li>I am very happy that he could get his mouth so clean and fresh.  </li>
            <li>she absolutely loves this toothbrush it cleans her teeths very good</li>
            <li>To be honest, manual brushing and manual brushes are cheaper, cheaper to replace, and do a better job.</li>
            <li>My four year old can handle this toothbrush wonderful.</li>
            <li>I have the adult version of the Sonicare and have been very happy with it.  </li>
            <li>The timing buzzer is a nice feature, reminding her to brush all 4 quadrants for the appropriate amount of time.</li>
            <li>Except for that problem, think it does a good job cleaning my daughter&#x27;s teeth and sound effects get her to brush longer.</li>
            <li>The kids also enjoyed picking out their own interchangeable face plate.</li>
            <li>It came with a set of brushes, one for 7years and up, one for 4 years old, so it was a perfect set for my 8yo and 5yo.</li>
            <li>Loves being able to brush his teeth on his own.  </li>
            <li>and it does a great job well worth the purchase</li>
            <li>This toothbrush is great fun for my daughter.  </li>
            <li>I love that after about a week of instructing her, she now can effectively brush her teeth</li>
            <li>own and love my Philips Sonicare toothbrushes, and this one doesn&#x27;t disappoint either&lt;</li>
            <li>Well this design is perfect for any adult.  </li>
            <li>Quality is great and worth the price.  </li>
            <li>kids do great and like them and rarely here any complaints when time to brush.</li>
            <li>Brushing teeth made easy!</li>
            <li>easy and quicker teeth-brushing experience every night!</li>
            <li>my kids love this toothbrush and I love knowing that it helps them achieve better brushings!</li>
            <li>As kids got older they wanted to brush themselves but weren&#x27;t very good at it.</li>
            <li>The functionality is very good and the musical chimes keep them in a good pattern.    </li>
            <li>Our kids (2 and 4 year old) love brushing their teeth with it and it has an awesome built in function that teaches them to brush their teeth longer without them even noticing it.</li>
            <li>Great toothbrush Kids love it worth the money.</li>
            <li>far we have been very happy with our purchase and the kids love them.</li>
            <li>and it is amazing how clean this sonicare gets your teeth!  </li>
            <li>What a surprising product--to have a child who wouldn&#x27;t brush his teeth more than 30 seconds is incredible; now he waits until he hears the musical notes after brushing each section &amp; the longer tune at the end to then know he&#x27;s done--as it automatically builds up to 2 minutes!  </li>
            <li>The colorful design along with the perfect ergonomics and of course the musical changing pacer / timer makes it a great addition to the bathroom for the children.</li>
            <li>This is very important piece of information.</li>
            <li>Iits a nice size and easy for kids to operate..  </li>
            <li>Or, get a drool cup  :-)  </li>
            <li>Love the product.  </li>
            <li>Or, get a drool cup  :-)  </li>
            <li>Love the product.  </li>
            <li>Thank you Sonicare for making a kids&#x27; version of a product I already love.</li>
            <li>The toothbrush does work up more foam/spit than a manual or spinning toothbrush, so we just have our son stand on a stool over the bathroom sink.  </li>
            <li>and they&#x27;re able to brush by themselves.  </li>
            <li>More plaque</li>
            <li>What more could you want than for a child to want to brush their teeth.</li>
            <li>They use them and do wait for the congratulatory tune at the end of 2 minutes of brushing, well most of the time.</li>
            <li>My child love it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using a Sonicare for a number of years and LOVE it</li>
            <li>The two different size brushes were perfect for my 8 &amp; 6 year olds.  </li>
            <li>I would NOT recommend this for anyone using it for more than one child.</li>
            <li>my son loves it and he even tells me that this  toothbrush does a better job.   </li>
            <li>it has CUTE music to let my son   know the amount of time to brush every section.</li>
            <li>The kids love it --</li>
            <li>One charge lasts more than 2 weeks.</li>
            <li>I love the size of the brush head</li>
            <li>And all my checkups have been outstanding.</li>
            <li>Love the beeping cycles that are timed.</li>
            <li>- Wave shaped brush heads seemed more efficient at cleaning the teeth.  </li>
            <li>Perhaps magnets would work better.  </li>
            <li>I did purchase the Philips kids sonicare after contemplating the purchase for some time, and I am glad I did.  </li>
            <li>We are TOTALLY pleased with this toothbrush.</li>
            <li>/o, 8y/o, love using their toothbrushes.  </li>
            <li>They had no problem using the Oral B, but I thought they&#x27;d like the timer, cute colors</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t matter how cute it is if you kids</li>
            <li>Ive had an oral b tooth brush for years that I love, so I knew I&#x27;d like this product for my son.  </li>
            <li>(for example, moving from brushing the outer surface of bottom teeth to the top surface of the bottom teeth).  </li>
            <li>That aside, the brush takes no effort to work way more effectivley then a manual method.  </li>
            <li>It makes teeth brushing easier and more efficient.</li>
            <li>The two minute mode for \\&quot;more experienced\\&quot; brushers plays a note every 30 seconds.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Their brushing is much, much better using this brush.   </li>
            <li>We use it twice every night and we&#x27;re certainly glad we purchased it.</li>
            <li>I have been using an Orab B electric brush for the last 15 years and they are all awesome</li>
            <li>Love these sonicare brushes.  </li>
            <li>So I was pleased to be able to try this model out and see how my daughter would like it, and whether it would encourage \\&quot;longer\\&quot; brushing.     </li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t sure if my son would like it.  </li>
            <li>Just a person who has used both products and find the Oral B a bit more robust given it has lasted over eight times longer.</li>
            <li>I have enjoyed using this with my two girls, 3 and 4.</li>
            <li>I love the timing feature.</li>
            <li>The girls are enjoying brushing</li>
            <li>and I hope for an excellent visit to the dentist next time.</li>
            <li>He said that it does a better job than manual brushing and works for kids under two.  </li>
            <li>So glad I bought it for her.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s been 100x better since getting this toothbrush.  </li>
            <li>Now we just purchase the appropriate sized refills.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Enjoy!</li>
            <li>And I love it, too.</li>
            <li>She is 7, so I&#x27;m glad that we can trust her to brush her teeth and know that they&#x27;re all being reached.  </li>
            <li>You&#x27;d better see it yourself after you get this toothbrush, which comes with both the 4-7 and 7-10 sizes.</li>
            <li>but she has been getting better after we bought this brush 6</li>
            <li>No complaints from my dentist at my latest checkup...</li>
            <li>Safe if you have veneers, implants, etc.</li>
            <li>Kids love them.</li>
            <li>The changeable plates on front help if you have more that one child.</li>
            <li>We really enjoyed this electric toothbrush.</li>
            <li>This toothbrush does a much better job than a regular/manual one.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s encouraged my child to brush their teeth more often and for longer periods.</li>
            <li>We really love the 2 minute shut off feature and alarm every 30 seconds to change locations.</li>
            <li>but they refuse to use it, even on the most gentile setting.</li>
            <li>My child&#x27;s dentist was also pleased when I told him I made the purchase.</li>
            <li>This seems to do a better job and more importantly gets them brushing morning and before bed!</li>
            <li>and I think I&#x27;ve gotten more used to it over time.</li>
            <li>time.&lt;br /&gt;Because the electric century adjustable, it is a better product.</li>
            <li>I was getting concerned with how many teeth</li>
            <li>The kids and the parents love them.</li>
            <li>Plan to buy 2 more for my oldest son&#x27;s boys.</li>
            <li>I love this toothbrush.</li>
            <li>I love my sonicare so decided to get one for my son.</li>
            <li>The timer makes sure that he brushes the recommended period of time.</li>
            <li>He love the &amp;#34;your done&amp;#34; tune.</li>
            <li>Miles better than your disposable electric toothbrush you find at Wal-Mart.  </li>
            <li>Both of my two sons love to using it .</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s been okay</li>
            <li>Purchased this for my Kids and it has been better for them too.</li>
            <li>He also was able to customize his toothbrush by choosing his face plate.</li>
            <li>They love it</li>
            <li>I have a sonicare myself that I love, so I thought I would get him the one made for kids.</li>
            <li>Overall, the unit is of excellent design and quality.&lt;br</li>
            <li>and everyone is satisfied.  </li>
            <li>The set was perfect for my family because it comes with 2 different sized brush heads.  </li>
            <li>What we love about this:  The boys like that</li>
            <li>and she uses the smaller one and is perfect.</li>
            <li>With so many vibrating kids toothbrushes on the market for under $10, I question who would pay this much?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>They, and their parents love them.</li>
            <li>Think it makes them feel more grown up since they have a toothbrush like mom and dad now.  </li>
            <li>likes it a lot better than the &amp;#34;cute&amp;#34</li>
            <li>The age appropriate brushes are a plus.</li>
            <li>I called Philips and gave them appropriate information</li>
            <li>I love Sonicare.  </li>
            <li>I love the built in timer.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;d like to love this product</li>
            <li>If you don&#x27;t like it or you think your child won&#x27;t love it this toothbrush not for you.&lt;br /&gt;There are lots of satisfied customer</li>
            <li>It seems most of them are okay with the vibration some of them aren&#x27;t.</li>
            <li>Perhaps a calculated move on Sonicare&#x27;s part to sell more front plate</li>
            <li>) Cute kids colors and interchangeable face plate.  </li>
            <li>The charger could be better constructed.  </li>
            <li>I love that it is rechargeable</li>
            <li>It has 2 speeds which is perfect for the younger ones.</li>
            <li>and I feel that it works so much better than the $5 kid brushes you can buy at the store.</li>
            <li>look cute.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m so glad we did.  </li>
            <li>so I am confident he is too.</li>
            <li>It cleans her teeth very well, doc is happy with them too.</li>
            <li>My dentist said it was ok to use on my 2 and 3 year olds.</li>
            <li>I love Sonicare for adults.  </li>
            <li>Love the music notification to change areas and to notify completion.</li>
            <li>Using the &amp;#34;regular&amp;#34; toothbrush was not an enjoyable experience for me or my son.</li>
            <li>Love this toothbrush.  </li>
            <li>:)  </li>
            <li>My kids love it, use it regularlly.  </li>
            <li>My daughter loves the toothbrush and I love the timer in it.  </li>
            <li>this toothbrush has made a difference in brushing habits and teeth are cleaner, better check-up-</li>
            <li>Love this product</li>
            <li>This is fabulous!</li>
            <li>My kids teeth are definitely in better shape.</li>
            <li>love it</li>
            <li>finishing with a grand finale of music when they are all done.</li>
            <li>So I was sure that I needed my son to be using one as well...</li>
            <li>I love Sonicare products and have been using them for many years.  </li>
            <li>sure what is going on Sonicare.  </li>
            <li>really glad we purchased these.  </li>
            <li>My kids love brushing their teeth and that has NEVER been the case in our household.</li>
            <li>We love the chime that reminds you to switch spots and the automatic timer that keeps them brushing until time runs out.</li>
            <li>By flossing and using this toothbrush, you&#x27;ll be doing what most dentists&#x27; kids are doing and safeguarding them from cavities.</li>
            <li>My kids are 10 and 8 and they LOVE these tooth brushes.</li>
            <li>Definetly makes brushing time more desireable &amp; enjoyable.</li>
            <li>Makes brushing more palatable for her</li>
            <li>I like that this toothbrush does most of the work</li>
            <li>My son is much better about brushing his teeth</li>
            <li>My kids have had many battery operated toothbrushes that die in a couple months.  </li>
            <li>They love the sonic toothbrush.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>My kids LIKE to brush their teeth and remain cavity free!</li>
            <li>You could get 4 disposable spinbrushes for that amount (although I think the Sonicare cleans better).</li>
            <li>The dentist was very proud of him on his last checkup.  </li>
            <li>my son should use the same and it is the best.  </li>
            <li>My daughter didn&#x27;t like this, but I&#x27;m using it and love it.  </li>
            <li>Better dental check ups.  </li>
            <li>okay.  </li>
            <li>Kids love to use it nothing more to say how many times do I have to do this for you</li>
            <li>I purchased this tooth brush for my grand as a Christmas gift and both she and her parents absolutely love it.</li>
            <li>Great gift at a reasonable price.</li>
            <li>That is why we love it</li>
            <li>Love this toothbrush.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m wondering if he would do better with a circle/round bristle head electronic brush.  </li>
            <li>The brushes work much better for my kids than manual toothbrushes.</li>
            <li>However, their teeth are getting brighter and two minutes on the Sonicare is better than the four or five they were spending with a manual brush.</li>
            <li>Love the brush.</li>
            <li>Cleaner results and better office visits.</li>
            <li>Love that there is a timer</li>
            <li>Once they got this one the love to brush their teeth.  </li>
            <li>kids love them.</li>
            <li>This is an awesome tooth brush for children becuase it has a 2 timer with 30 second intervals.  </li>
            <li>bought these brushes for my grandchildren, youngest being 3, and they all love them.  </li>
            <li>I rate it as 5 stars because I am pleased with it.&lt;br</li>
            <li>tried using it again when she was 5, and she was more receptive to it.</li>
            <li>They love them.  </li>
            <li>Even better priced than walmart.</li>
            <li>LOVE the timer feature and love</li>
            <li>It is more convenient and save me more time.</li>
            <li>Recommend this to your lovely kid.</li>
            <li>It makes her want to brush more.</li>
            <li>He used to brush his teeth at lease once a day (most of the times twice a day) and also floss every night without any exception.&lt;br /&gt;But</li>
            <li>I am so satisfied with this toothbrush.</li>
            <li>We are a family of Sonicare and love what it does to our teeth...</li>
            <li>We love this for our child.</li>
            <li>They LOVE it..  </li>
            <li>My kids love it.</li>
            <li>Expect that to stop the more they use it.</li>
            <li>do not hesitate, your kids will love them......</li>
            <li>It took him a while to get used to this, but he is better off using this instead of a manual brush.  </li>
            <li>I love the noise notification every 15 seconds.</li>
            <li>We LOVE this toothbrush!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Outside of that, perfect brush!</li>
            <li>The HX6311/02 comes with interchangeable plates the kids love switching</li>
            <li>my dentist recommended this for my children and they love their tooth brushes.</li>
            <li>Fantastic product!  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know :)</li>
            <li>so it forces her to brush for the entire 2 minutes which is great!</li>
            <li>Its a great buy, I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li>/&gt;Update: They replaced it for free!  </li>
            <li>My kids love brushing with this electric toothbrush.</li>
            <li>But once you get them used to it, the kids will love it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>It help your child clean better!</li>
            <li>They were excited to have their own and one that&#x27;s more geared toward kids, which perhaps helps with solidifying the brushing habit.  </li>
            <li>My five year old son loved this!</li>
            <li>This works perfectly because it is gentler for little ones, yet still cleans great quickly.  </li>
            <li>The timer is great because we have bought timers for she and her older sister before to get them to brush for two minutes with their manual brushes.  </li>
            <li>You should be able to buy new brush heads and keep on charging for quite some time, but our luck hasn&#x27;t been great with the kid&#x27;s versions.</li>
            <li>I love that it does a great job cleaning my son&#x27;s teeth and the two minute timer beeps when it is time to move the brush to move the brush to a new quadrant.</li>
            <li>I can agree that I have seen significant stain removal after a week of using the brush, and it is a great investment for anyone who is interested in whitening their teeth.</li>
            <li>I am sure the novelty will wear off, but for now I think its more exciting for them that they have their own rechargeable electric toothbrush.  </li>
            <li>Cleans her teeth pretty good.</li>
            <li>I honestly don&#x27;t find this brush to be significantly different than the Sonicare I already own, which is a good thing.  </li>
            <li>the best part is that it tells the kids know how long to brush and when to stop..</li>
            <li>My kids love it and super easy to use and so cute!</li>
            <li>Great for kids, easy to use if used properly really ensures clean teeth!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m hoping getting my child started right will make dental care simpler and more effective for her--so far so good!</li>
            <li>I returned to Target and happily exchanged for a new one.  </li>
            <li>The ramp up speed is great for them to get used to this new way of brushing.  </li>
            <li>And there is an easy recharging bay which he was able to set up himself.  </li>
            <li>The timer and tunes makes it easy to pace brushing time on all surfaces and entertaining for her too.</li>
            <li>Before this was buying and electric toothbrush at $4 every 3 or 4 weeks, but this toothbrush fits in her mouth better and bristles don&#x27;t wear out so easily</li>
            <li>It is really easy to use, I love the time factor.</li>
            <li>My kids love it; its easy to use</li>
            <li>like I said, it made brushing time easy and enjoyable, so</li>
            <li>like my review title says i love this toothbrush i bought this for my 7 year old son i no longer need to remind him to brush his teeth as soon as his feet hit the floor he is brushing and the timer is great</li>
            <li>The &#x27;age&#x27;appropriate heads make this toothbrush the best money I spent in years.  </li>
            <li>loved it, good present as well ..</li>
            <li>There are two brushing modes that allow for gentler brushing for the young ones and the two head sizes available are ideal for growing mouths, too.</li>
            <li>There are two brushing modes that allow for gentler brushing for the young ones and the two head sizes available are ideal for growing mouths, too.</li>
            <li>I love my grand children but didn&#x27;t enjoy brushing their teeth for them when caring for them!&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li>We figured it would be good to invest in good toothbrushes after going through several the \\&quot;disposable\\&quot; spin brush styles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The color of the toothbrush is vivid and attractive.</li>
            <li>I am so happy with this purchase and plan on getting an adult version for myself!</li>
            <li>This has the right timer, is soft and perfect for he duration the brush needs to be done.</li>
            <li>This is perfect because it is easy to use and will remain charged for a long period of time.  </li>
            <li>Your teeth will feel dentist clean!  </li>
            <li>I think they are great- very effective and worth the cost in the long run.  </li>
            <li>The best part is that now I don&#x27;t have to tell them to clean the brushes (like in the non-electric) ones after brushing as a simple swipe (while its still vibrating) in the water from the tap</li>
            <li>Overall, very good.</li>
            <li>Here&#x27;s what he has to say: &amp;#34;It works so good, and the time - two minutes - is just right to make your teeth feel clean.</li>
            <li>/&gt;As most parents know, getting your child to brush can be a huge chore.  </li>
            <li>Time will tell how they hold up, but they have been great for my boys so far.  </li>
            <li>All in all a great experience so far</li>
            <li>This electric toothbrush has been great at helping my kids to brush better and more independently.</li>
            <li>old son after reading all the great reviews.</li>
            <li>Great product mirroring what my wife and I get from the adult versions.</li>
            <li>With a manual brush, my 4 year old would brush for anout 30 seconds and say he did a great job brushing his teeth.</li>
            <li>I bought one a month ago for my 4 year old and it&#x27;s been great.  </li>
            <li>Brushing everywhere though strengthens the gums which is healthy and important too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Last</li>
            <li>This was a great purchase for my 8 year old son, he loves it</li>
            <li>This is a great buy for my 11 year old son.  </li>
            <li>The adult Sonicare is great too.</li>
            <li>Timer is ideal as it beeps ever 30 seconds for a total time of two minutes.  </li>
            <li>The brush does an excellent job, requiring minimal effort from the child.</li>
            <li>Really gets the kids&#x27; to do a good job brushing.  </li>
            <li>This one makes it so much easier for them to give their teeth a good once over.</li>
            <li>I would recommend this to any parent who wants good, diligent teeth brushing that their kids are eager to do for themselves.</li>
            <li>The product is good, the kids have transitioned well to using them and really like them.</li>
            <li>It Works very well and she loves the way her teeth feel after she brushes and she gets good dental reports.</li>
            <li>Although he loved the concept, he felt it was too intense and wouldn&#x27;t let me use it.  </li>
            <li>Really helpful in teaching my daughter good practices for brushing her teeth.  </li>
            <li>I bought this because I loved my Sonicare toothbrush so much.  </li>
            <li>It is very helpful in engendering good oral hygiene in tots.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It is really good and works really well.&lt;br /&gt;Just</li>
            <li>But other then that fact, the brush is awesome!!!!!!</li>
            <li>The novelty of it and the built-in timer will get kids excited about brushing and make sure they brush thoroughly.  </li>

            <li>It is so easy for them to use and because it has a set timer</li>
            <li>The timer on it makes it easy to know when to move to another part of your mouth.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s still going strong.</li>
            <li>They know how to use it, and it&#x27;s not too strong for them.</li>
            <li>Months Later-&lt;br /&gt;Still going strong.</li>
            <li>and she strongly prefers the Sonicare.</li>
            <li>It is not too strong for him.  </li>
            <li>I think because the vibration is strong however I always choose the lowest level.</li>
            <li>(Making a choice and sticking to it is not any preschooler&#x27;s strong point.)</li>
            <li>I strongly recommend these for kids.</li>
            <li>Almost two years and still working strong.</li>
            <li>It is still going strong.</li>
            <li>It highly encourages longer brushing time and that is good.</li>
            <li>My kids teeth are getting whiter by the day and they are able to brush by them self (age 5 and 7) for the right amount of time (because has a timer!)</li>
            <li>All of these are great improvements, not just for child usage, but also for an electric toothbrush in general.  </li>
            <li>beauty of the Philips Sonicare is that the timer makes sure that they do brush for 2 full minutes</li>
            <li>for our 6 year old - and he&#x27;s LOVING brushing his teeth now!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s cool and cute, and cleans well (I think).</li>
            <li>We have the adult versions and the 2 kids successfully share one of these.  </li>
            <li>The kids brush takes this wonderful brush down to the kids level.  </li>
            <li>The seven-year-old is doing fine with it, and he uses the \\&quot;left\\&quot; side for a gentler brushing.  </li>
            <li>This toothbrush costs less than a visit to the dentist here in Singapore and is an excellent investment!</li>
            <li>Otherwise a perfectly fine toothbrush</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, this is another fine high-quality brush from Philips.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, this is another fine high-quality brush from Philips.  </li>
            <li>Both of my kids CAN hold it just fine</li>
            <li>This suited me fine because I had a 5 and 7yr</li>
            <li>It brushes fine.</li>
            <li>They get a clean feeling after using their tooth brush and I feel happy that this product is doing a better job than a regular tooth brush.  </li>
            <li>The best part about the brush is that it keeps them bushing for the appropriate amount of time, and ends the brushing cycle with a gentle kid friendly tone (I kind of like it better than some of the adult models, which simply stops - no</li>
            <li>It comes with two brushes so makes it even more economical if you have two children or two adults using it.&lt;br /&gt;Reccommend to anyone who wants better check ups at their dentist!</li>
            <li>Having a toothbrush that your child likes is a huge help in overcoming this problem.  </li>
            <li>We have noticed a huge improvement since we bought him this toothbrush.</li>
            <li>I never had a huge struggle with the kids about brushing, but they were a bit too lax on the length of brushing and the quality of the scrubbing.    </li>
            <li>We are a huge sonic care family.  </li>

            <li>/&gt;Another great feature is the three included different faceplates so that a user may personalize the toothbrush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Since she is the only one that will use this toothbrush, it would have been great to get two of the toothbrush heads she would use.</li>
            <li>wants one of his own.</li>
            <li>I filled out a rebate form and mailed it.</li>
            <li>My kids appear to really enjoy using the product.  </li>
            <li>so how can you make it more exciting.  </li>
            <li>This brush has allowed her to brush effectively without *much* intervention by us.  </li>
            <li>Love this product and well worth it.</li>
            <li>They enjoy this Sonicare and use without and prompting from me!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s worth not having the &amp;#34;Brush Your Teeth Battle!&amp;#34;  :)</li>
            <li>If you have sonic are toothbrushes you&#x27;ll know that they are great - same applies to the kids version.  </li>
            <li>he could get used to the sound it makes to let you know to change sections of his mouth.</li>
            <li>He moves it over his teeth in one section of his mouth until the sound lets him know the change.</li>
            <li>The 30 second timer on each quadrant of the mouth works great for him.  </li>
            <li>I bought 2 cheap electric teeth brush and they wore out.</li>
            <li>It does a great job of keeping a charge, we probably only recharge once every two months.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s got all of their advanced features in terms of the guts of the brush</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s got all of their advanced features in terms of the guts of the brush</li>
            <li>great for kids because it chimes  when it&#x27;s time to move to the next section.  </li>
            <li>They are ALL such great products.</li>
            <li>This toothbrush really encourages the kids to brush their own teeth.</li>
            <li>These are great with noises to tell the kids when to move to a different part of their mouth, and it keeps them brushing for 2 minutes.</li>
            <li>The musical timer is great and has him running for his toothbrush when we announce that it is time to brush his teeth.  </li>
            <li>Great tool for kids to learn the proper brushing time.</li>
            <li>I do as well and the sound reminders are</li>
            <li>I like that the musical sounds are not obnoxious and are great indicators regarding brushing time.    </li>
            <li>sound will guide change position and finish.&lt;br /&gt;Brush</li>
            <li>Unsure where or if replacement heads are available?</li>
            <li>If need be the head on her toothbrush fits our sonicare brushes just as ours will even fit hers.</li>
            <li>2 kids ages 5 and 8 use this brush and enjoy it.</li>
            <li>and I know it does a fantastic job cleaning your teeth.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a great product and when the time comes we will be getting one for our younger son.</li>
            <li>I am happy that the kids actually brush their teeth until it turns off - mission</li>
            <li>After spending lots of money on not so cheap imitations I bought this toothbrush.  </li>
            <li>It makes it more fun for him to brush with the music intervals in between.  </li>
            <li>You can change the singing sound and you can change the color of the tooth brush😍&lt;br /&gt;Review by 8-year-old</li>
            <li>Brushing the kids teeth was always a nightmare, even with the cheap electric brushes.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s quicker and more effective than using a regular toothbrush, so I&#x27;m glad we got it.</li>
            <li>They both enjoy the ease of using this product and my wife and I have the piece of mind that their teeth are being cleaned the way they should.</li>
            <li>It has a sound that beeps 5 times.</li>
            <li>in a sugar filled world, can&#x27;t hurt.  </li>
            <li>He uses it as a backup tootbrush, when his primary brush needs a charge.  </li>
            <li>The &amp;#34;timed tones&amp;#34; are a great addition to this product to signal when its time to move on to a different &amp;#34;quadrant&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>This is a good size for my 4 yr old.</li>
            <li>Its a good size for my 6 year old to work with</li>
            <li>I love it so much that I ended up ordering 6 more to give to all my nieces and nephews for Christmas.</li>
            <li>My 7 yr old loved that she could choose the decorative face plate.</li>
            <li>3 &amp; 4 year old can use their own tooth brush, although I do make sure we get all sugarbugs out.    </li>
            <li>it helps the 4 year old do a good job.  </li>
            <li>You can&#x27;t start good dental habits to young.</li>
            <li>good product, both parents use adult sonic are.</li>
            <li>My youngest grand daughter loved this gift last Christmas.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know what magically changed, maybe it tickles, who knows, but whatever it is, I&#x27;m happy and it was money well spent.</li>
            <li>My kids get board quickly with brushing their teeth, so I love that their sonicare brushes keep them brushing for the 2 full minutes with the auto-timer.  </li>
            <li>I am so glad that I made a right choice this time.</li>
            <li>My grand daughter said they could not wait to charge it up and used it right away.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this toothbrush for the challenging toddler!</li>
            <li>With this kid friendly version, it&#x27;s a series of a happy 1-2 second beep and the &#x27;beeps&#x27; that tell them they are finished with brushing</li>
            <li>They say to replace them more frequently, but I mainly remember to replace them each time we go for their 6 month cleanings, which have been great check ups since they are using these brushes!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>BTW, the Oral B stand provides a covered storage space for four brush heads which is also very useful.      </li>
            <li>This this is very powerful and does not bother or tickle my child&#x27;s mouth when using it on them.</li>
            <li>And I am more calm about her teeth getting clean.</li>
            <li>This kind is much easier to clean.</li>
            <li>A children&#x27;s hygenist recommended this toothbrush and said it really helps the kids clean their teeth effectively.</li>
            <li>The unit does have 2 settings though which allows for a lesser vibration to start with and makes it easier to transition into the high setting which works best for dental care.</li>
            <li>I can tell a huge difference in how clean his teeth are compared to manual brushing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Leaves teeth really clean and smooth</li>
            <li>My boys share the main body and have their own brush heads.</li>
            <li>Overall a great product and more effective than standard brushes.</li>
            <li>used to manually brush their teeth for them, (just to be sure they were brushing correctly), but switched them to these electronic models (via professional samples) since he believes they do a more thorough job, and the kids really enjoy using them.  </li>
            <li>Lacking that, I&#x27;d suggest that you keep a manual brush available for those nights when you don&#x27;t have the parental stamina to try to make your wiggly child stand still over the bowl for the full cycle.  </li>
            <li>she was so excited that she immediately began brushing her teeth.  </li>
            <li>My daughter was ver excited when she recieved this.</li>
            <li>so I was really excited when I found this Sonicare for kids at Target.  </li>
            <li>I was so excited to get this for my 6 yr.</li>
            <li>He loves when the music plays as an indication to switch brushing areas (quadrants) and he gets so excited when the reward tune plays at the end of brushing.</li>
            <li>What a simple, yet effective idea!</li>
            <li>This brush was totally worth it!</li>
            <li>What a simple, yet effective idea!</li>
            <li>He is actually excited about brushing his teeth.</li>
            <li>The small brush head works best.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have to worry about the kids brushing because they are do excited to use it.</li>
            <li>Just keep your original receipt and be prepared to give the code on the bottom of your brush for a replacement, just do it before year 2.</li>
            <li>I was excited to see that they have a model specifically for kids and wondered what the differences might be.&lt;br</li>
            <li>My son now is so excited to brush his teeth - after meals, at night, in the morning, in the afternoon..</li>
            <li>It makes it FUN!</li>
            <li>I ordered one for each child (7yo and 8yo) about a month ago and they have been excited to brush.  </li>
            <li>The interchangeable plates make each toothbrush unique for the child.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m the Oral B person, and so is my husband, but Oral B does not seem to make a kid friendly electric toothbrush like this one.</li>
            <li>They are excited to brush their teeth now.  </li>
            <li>The kids were excited to try it.  </li>
            <li>One of the things that we like best about it is that the 4-7 year old size heads are just the right size, even for our 2 year old (who has been using it since he was 18 months).</li>
            <li>My cute little great grandsons said, &amp;#34;It makes brushing your teeth fun.&amp;#34</li>
            <li>My daughter is loving her new brush, she said it&#x27;s tingling in the mouth.</li>
            <li>It was a battle to get him to brush good enough each night, but with his new toothbrush he does a great job of brushing the whole time and getting all of his teeth clean.  </li>
            <li>My daughter loves it, she is 8 and feels so clean after brushing&lt;br /&gt;Love</li>
            <li>chargers work great and look good on the counter behind the sink.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>His teeth now comes out clean every brush.</li>
            <li>have their own brush head, but I am considering getting another unit just so they can each be more independent rather than having to take turns.</li>
            <li>Easy &amp; fun for the kids.  </li>
            <li>Will help her keep her teeth clean with no cavities.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a fun way to brush, and easy to get her to brush.</li>
            <li>Underneath where the brush attaches to the handle can get mucky and even moldy if mom and dad aren&#x27;t checking it and keeping it clean.  </li>
            <li>; there is nothing to clean here!&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>a lot easier to clean with too.</li>
            <li>Their teeth are clean and shiny and the plaque is gone.</li>
            <li>and get her teeth clean than before.</li>
            <li>She will even walk out and rub her teeth sometiems just to show us how squeeky clean her teeth are</li>
            <li>and she raves about how squeaky clean they are.</li>
            <li>My son 11 year old isn&#x27;t the most motivated brusher and had troubles with plaque on his bottom 4 teeth and top canines.</li>
            <li>It not only starts out with an &amp;#34;easy&amp;#34; setting and gradually gets more effective, but it also allows we parents to not bug the child to keep brushing to make the two minute mark</li>
            <li>I get compliments on how clean their teeth are at the dentist.  </li>
            <li>But since the sonicare toothbrush doesn&#x27;t get his teeth completely clean, we&#x27;re still using a manual toothbrush after we use the sonicare.</li>
            <li>We shall see at our next dental visit how thoroughly it works when an eight-year-old is more on her own with brushing with this product.</li>
            <li>Easy to use, and clean super smooth smile.</li>
            <li>super easy compared to brushing and much more gentle.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.is brush to be significantly different than the Sonicare I already own, which is a good thing.  </li>
            <li>It seems others have had this problem and most of the positive reviews are written by people who haven&#x27;t had the brushes for a year.  </li>
            <li>I bought this for my two year old and we love it!</li>
            <li>We got this for our 3 year old and love it!</li>
            <li>I think it is great that children 4 years old and older now have access to a rechargeable toothbrush just like their parents or grandparents.</li>
            <li>So not only does this tooth brush clean just as good as the one for adults</li>
            <li>It was a waste of money and made my son feel like he wasn&#x27;t doing a very good job taking care of his teeth.</li>
            <li>and i&#x27;m confident that later on he&#x27;ll do a great job on his own versus the conventional brushes.   </li>
            <li>It triggered my 9 year old&#x27;s real interest in cleaning his teeth well, and while we don&#x27;t use it for every brushing session, it is handy to have around for a thorough brush!</li>
            <li>The trick is getting a fidgety four-year-old boy to stand still leaning over the sink for the full cycle.  </li>
            <li>Now they continue for the full 2 minutes.  </li>
            <li>My dentist suggested it many years ago and it has really helped.  </li>
            <li>I decided to try it anyway since it&#x27;s more gentle than manual brushing.    </li>
            <li>But when we use the Sonicare she looks forward to it and complies much more readily.</li>
            <li>On the occasions that we let our 2 year old try to do his own teeth, he has no problem with the handle either.</li>
            <li>They just dont know how to do a good enough job.</li>
            <li>My 7 yr old will brush his own teeth in the morning.</li>
            <li>Both of my children will brush for the full two minutes.</li>
            <li>In my opinion that is good with starting out with the toothbrush.</li>
            <li>But kids need to be brushing the full two minutes just like their parents.</li>
            <li>They work very well, my kids love them.</li>
            <li>The sonicare action combined with the 2-minute built in timer has the kids brushing well and for an effective period of time.    </li>
            <li>And he thinks it&#x27;s cool to have a power toothbrush.  </li>
            <li>apparently it&#x27;s true.  </li>
            <li>It gradually builds up to the full time (2 minutes</li>
            <li>Grand kids really like--</li>
            <li>and he brushes well and for two full minutes.  </li>
            <li>so I am keeping my eye on this on Amazon for a good future deal.</li>
            <li>My kids (3 and 5 years old) liked using the OralB which had prompted me to purchase this brush for them</li>
            <li>the toothbrush- and brushes for a full 2 minutes diligently every night and morning.</li>
            <li>but now they love it so much</li>
            <li>It has two speeds and works up to the full two minute cycle, but over a period of completed shorter cycles.  </li>
            <li>He likes the music that alerts his to switch and now he brushes for the full 2 minutes.  </li>
            <li>Glad to get it hear and serves its purpose very well.</li>
            <li>They totally love the sounds and the vibration is so gentle.</li>
            <li>Cool colors</li>
            <li>The dentist told me that most kids under the age of 8 find Sonicare too intense.  </li>
            <li>Trust me, they eat their fair share of candy, but I attribute a big portion of that to this toothbrush.</li>
            <li>I have also spoken with many dental professionals that were very dismayed by the companies response.  </li>
            <li>Good quality for the price and should last him years.</li>
            <li>was to replace my son&#x27;s full size sonicare</li>
            <li>super clean</li>
            <li>and they really do squeek :-).</li>
            <li>Not only does it do a good job</li>
            <li>It has a cool beep every 30 seconds which prompts her to move to another section of her mouth.  </li>
            <li>She likes that it is a cool color and beeps.  </li>
            <li>2 full minutes of brushing every morning and night.</li>
            <li>My daughter&#x27;s is doing okay, but after awhile, the replacement heads just don&#x27;t attach to the handle very well.</li>
            <li>stickers are cute too.his teeth absolutely look cleaner.</li>
            <li>My 4 yr old does his own (with my follow up) and</li>
            <li>But on the whole, worthwhile.</li>
            <li>cool feature.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It not only helps get a good brush in</li>
            <li>Really wants to make them brush more often.</li>
            <li>It was well worth it to see her enjoy brushing her teeth.</li>
            <li>I bought this sonicare for my 4 year old and he does a pretty good job with it.  </li>
            <li>&quot; plastic clip-on templates  - Grip size, though large, is comfortable and easy to hold.  </li>
            <li>It is a very powerful and even fun toothbrush.</li>
            <li>(This is perfect for my family as we only have 2 children but with those with more kids may want something else to store the other children&#x27;s toothbrush heads...</li>
            <li>Something special for your precious little one from a good and reliable company.</li>
            <li>One of our twins was not easy to let us brush his teeth and the sonicare made it much easy to reach every angle of his mouth.&lt;br /&gt;really great product.</li>
            <li>They hold up real well and help the girls get their teeth very clean.</li>
            <li>The brushes fit great in their little hands.  </li>
            <li>Our two daughters love their new toothbrushes!</li>
            <li>Youngest granddaughter is enjoying the use of this new toothbrush!  </li>
            <li>they faces are stick-on, so they are one-shot deals, and b) there are only four audio cues: inside top and bottom, and front top an bottom?  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Still a good toothbrush, but the above points are worth thinking about.</li>
            <li>We switched him from using my old oral B pro care to this thinking it would be more enjoyable for him to have his own fun colored brush, but 4 months into using it I started to notice his teeth were yellow</li>
            <li>and they quickly replaced it.</li>
            <li>I might have been able to get a better deal on regular one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>would imagine this would not be an issue for older brushers who are able to close their lips around the brush while brushing.</li>
            <li>This one definitely has more of a vibrational movement and causes more &#x27;bubbles&#x27; in the mouth from our tooth powder / liquid that we use.       </li>
            <li>I no longer have t worry about her brushing to quickly</li>
            <li>My girls&#x27; dental health has improved tremendously since we went electric.  </li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s great because it&#x27;s a long time to start out with at first.  </li>
            <li>Comes with the 2 different size heads in different colors perfect for my 6 &amp; 8 year olds.</li>
            <li>Particularly since I have bought so many of their products over the years.  </li>
            <li>This brush is designed to hold an adequate charge for about a week.</li>
            <li>Even then they were reluctant to take the time to adequately brush their teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The changeable plates for the front are really nice, fortunate that there are three different designs.</li>
            <li>Because of the unique handle design, he was still able to \\&quot;guide\\&quot; their brushing until they got the hang of it (which didn&#x27;t take long, even for the youngest), and until he was sure they were using the device as it&#x27;s meant to be used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t recommend this more highly.</li>
            <li>The outside is cute and the sound it makes is fun, love the timmer and LOVE the soft headed brushes</li>
            <li>But neither of these seem to be any problem, he took to holding it right away and the mirror is still clean.</li>
            <li>just the right ammout of vibration to get teeth clean</li>
            <li>The dentist was very pleased with her last check-up.      </li>
            <li>Other parents there said that their children liked it better than manual tooth brushes and</li>
            <li>He seems to like it better than a normal brush.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s worth $40 per year for cavity-free checkups.for those nights when you don&#x27;t have the parental stamina to try to make your wiggly child stand still over the bowl for the full cycle.  </li>
            <li>The children now brush a full two minutes and think that is is fun.  </li>
            <li>I love the way Sonicare brushes clean and I will buy my children the adult version now.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used a sonicare toothbrush since the late 90s {I started VERY VERY young...:P} and have always been impressed w/ its performance and effectiveness.  </li>
            <li>The boys love that the sound indicator is a happy / silly sound.  </li>
            <li>easy to use clean and set up highly recommend for people who like their teeth</li>
            <li>Love the new sonic care for kids.  </li>
            <li>My kids LOVE their new toothbrushes.</li>
            <li>It easy for the kid, he enjoys is so much.</li>
            <li>This Kids model&#x27;s charger is very compact and easy to pack for travel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>good product while it works, just be aware that it does not seemed designed to last forever or for an extended period of time.  </li>
            <li>They both loved it once they got used to the speed of the head and the fact that it tickled their upper teeth too much!</li>
            <li>This is the kid version and works very well for adults with small mouths.&lt;br /&gt;The cleaning of this toothbrush is excellent!</li>
            <li>My kids, like most, do not brush long enough and I am not always hovering over them to make sure they do the full 2 minutes.......and quite honestly a manual toothbrush just is not as reliable and you can spend oodles every year on the $9 battery operated cheapies........</li>
            <li>Great device works fine, it comes with two replacement brushes, one for child and one for adults, the engine power is enough to clean your teeth or at least for giving you that kind of sensation.</li>
            <li>I HIGHLY recommend this toothbrush!!!</li>
            <li>Easy grip, they much more regularly and thoroughly brush their teeth!</li>
            <li>The quick movement of the brush head gives the impression that it is doing a better job than hand brushing of old.  </li>
            <li>and I highly recommend it to anyone who wants their kid has a clean teeth!!</li>
            <li>My kids brush a full 2 minutes, they do a much better job of brushing (once they understood the quadrant method - top front, top back, bottom front, bottom back)</li>
            <li>so the child can change their toothbrush&#x27;s look more frequently and easily, and (b) the three faceplates varied more in their themes (one abstract dot pattern is enough, let&#x27;s also have some floral, animal, or cartoon themes!).  </li>
            <li>so the child can change their toothbrush&#x27;s look more frequently and easily, and (b) the three faceplates varied more in their themes (one abstract dot pattern is enough, let&#x27;s also have some floral, animal, or cartoon themes!).  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a little too soon to give a really great review</li>
            <li>The timer and little chimes it plays are great and my children no longer complain about brushing their teeth.</li>
            <li>It cleans her little teeth great.</li>
            <li>It works great mainly because it does the work for them when they can&#x27;t effectively create little circular motions with a normal brush.</li>
            <li>Great  and fun way for them to learn to care for their only set of teeth from a young age.  </li>
            <li>I like that this brush feels like it&#x27;s REALLY cleaning my sons teeth, but a huge downside is that it oversprays toothpaste and spit everywhere.</li>
            <li>In addition to being two parts, the spare head doesn&#x27;t fit on the post very well and tends to pop off.  </li>
            <li>I have been using Sonicare toothbrushes for myself for many years now and totally believe they have made a huge difference in my oral health.  </li>
            <li>Great for my two autistic children!&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s feels solidly build, and the inclusion of two head sizes was nice.  </li>
            <li>Worth researching &amp; finding it here.  </li>
            <li>Worth waiting for it to arrive.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s colorful (the handle)</li>
            <li>Frankly, I haven&#x27;t found anything compelling in the Philips Sonicare, and neither has my son.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s worth $40 per year for cavity-free checkups.</li>
            <li>My 6 and 8 year old love it.  </li>
            <li>Charge holds up for several days and most importantly, my daughter loves it because it tickles.</li>
            <li>Every time I hear the beep, I have to smile.  </li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s fun too.</li>
            <li>It makes fun sounds while she brushes, making it easier for her to brush longer.  </li>
            <li>the Sonicare Kids is well worth it.</li>
            <li>and they have fun doing it.  </li>
            <li>- Melodic series of beeps indicate when to switch brushing to another part of the mouth, which is fun for kids.  </li>
            <li>OK for 7 year old kids</li>
            <li>I think he would have been able to handle this at even three years old.</li>
            <li>He liked customizing his toothbrush with the various sticker plates.  </li>
            <li>I have been using a Sonicare adult for many years.  </li>
            <li>fun</li>
            <li>As for use, this is a nice solid toothbrush.</li>
            <li>So besides those issues my daughter does like it although I think the settings are a bit powerful for her</li>
            <li>When his dentist recommended the Kids Sonicare (I didn&#x27;t know one existed), I thought it was worth a try.</li>
            <li>Until then, guess it is a fairly nice decorative piece in the kid&#x27;s bathroom (sarcasm)and back to disposable spin brushes.  </li>
            <li>So while the product worked, it was worth the cost; however, if they break within a year then their workmanship or design is suspect.  </li>
            <li>Its colorful and fun... has fun tones.  </li>
            <li>so brushing teeth has become fun, not a chore.  </li>
            <li>The dentist could tell an improvement, and that makes them worth it</li>
            <li>Worth the money.</li>
            <li>This toothbrush is worth the money.</li>
            <li>Brushing was a struggle before this; well worth the cost.</li>
            <li>Kids think they are fun.  </li>
            <li>I like the adult version a bit better but the kids like the colored plates.</li>
            <li>I bought this for my 2.5 years old and it makes it easier for me to brush her teeth faster and more thoroughly.</li>
            <li>The cleaning power of sonicare in a fun package for kids.  </li>
            <li>Well worth the money.</li>
            <li>but I feel that it will be well worth every penny when it comes to his dental visits.</li>
            <li>my grandson wanted on like mom and dads (plus grandparents) and seems to enjoy brushing with us like a big boy, so he is now brushing more,</li>
            <li>my grandson loves it and its fun to brush now.</li>
            <li>My Child is more than 2,5 years old</li>
            <li>toothbrush is almost the same as the Sonicare I currently own for myself.  </li>
            <li>Couldn&#x27;t convince my 8  year old grand daughters to brush 2 minutes with out this brush.  </li>
            <li>If it is worth it, then buy it anyway.  </li>
            <li>In my professional opinion, if you&#x27;re looking to buy an electric toothbrush, Sonicare should be at the top of your list.  </li>
            <li>Well worth the money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>She  can&#x27;t wait to use it and finds it a fun chore these days.</li>
            <li>She is brushing on her own several times per day.  </li>
            <li>Fun design for kids, Fun music</li>
            <li>and compared to his friends it seems to be well worth the money.  </li>
            <li>I have bought lots of philips toothbrushes for my family and this one is not a disappointment.  </li>
            <li>on&amp;#34; for a personal touch (my daughter really liked picking out her</li>
            <li>It helps to whiten teeth and isn&#x27;t too powerful for them.</li>
            <li>This was definitely worth the price.</li>
            <li>I was hesitant to purchase this for my seven year old after the dentist said it would be overkill, but I am glad I did.</li>
            <li>The package arrived in good shape and performs as expected.</li>
            <li>This flexibility is well worth it.</li>
            <li>I love this brush for my 3.5 year old boy.  </li>
            <li>She&#x27;s brushing longer and having fun while doing so.</li>
            <li>My  3 year old grandson is happy to use his personal toothbrush every day.</li>
            <li>Worth the money, I recommend it.</li>
            <li>The toothbrush is fun for the children</li>
            <li>They love the music that is played for the length of brushing time and also the individual covers that are available to individualize the brushes.</li>
            <li>So keep a regular brush handy for those instances.  </li>
            <li>Otherwise this was WELL worth the purchase.</li>
            <li>brush is sturdy and the kids like the colorful bases.</li>
            <li>The sounds are fun and keep them brushing.  </li>
            <li>They each chose to use a different plate on the front which helps them identify their own toothbrush.</li>
            <li>so I&#x27;ve had to put the toothbrush up for when she finishes losing the more sensitive teeth.</li>
            <li>The kids liked that they could choose the color for the outside of their brush.  </li>
            <li>It is well worth the price.</li>
            <li>It is worth every penny.  </li>
            <li>Now they are very excited and enjoy brushing at the same time as us adults with our Sonicare toothbrush.  </li>
            <li>This is great brush, but first one stopped working after less then a year.</li>
            <li>Would have been 5 stars except I&#x27;m not a fan of the new peg mini sized chargers that the brush can fall off much more easily than the old style.</li>
            <li>Having experienced other electric \\&quot;kid\\&quot; toothbrushes, one can really tell Sonicare thought this model through.</li>
            <li>Overall we have been very happy with this brush and recommended it to other parents as well as telling our dentist about it</li>
            <li>Having experienced other electric \\&quot;kid\\&quot; toothbrushes, one can really tell Sonicare thought this model through.</li>
            <li>My kids love these toothbrushes so we&#x27;re planning on buying two more for the other bathroom - this way, they can Sonicare either upstairs or downstairs.  </li>
            <li>my child got used to the intensity pretty quickly.  </li>
            <li>It works wonderfully, quickly and efficiently removing stains and tartar that had built up on her teeth during her first years.</li>
            <li>I am very pleased with the purchase and find the brushes to be high quality and so far the performance has be exactly as advertised.</li>
            <li>flat out amazing</li>
            <li>The high frequency motion tends to create a more intense sensation than the lower frequency  OralB motion.</li>
            <li>The brush is just the right size for her</li>
            <li>so this got him used to brushing for the right amount of time..</li>
            <li>Right now, there is a rebate for $5</li>
            <li>Right now we have just the one unit and the kids each</li>
            <li>my grandson brushes the right way now....</li>
            <li>Each one stops working right around the 1 year mark.  </li>
            <li>The tones help them brush for the right amount of time.</li>
            <li>and she was so right on.</li>
            <li>It let&#x27;s them know that they are brushing the right amount of time in each area.  </li>
            <li>I know it was the right choice.  </li>
            <li>I have already dropped the toothbrush on the floor because I didn&#x27;t stick it in right.</li>
            <li>For a couple of months, it was ignored and sat in the closet, even though I was told \\&quot;I like it, I&#x27;m just not using it right</li>
            <li>This is probably the first time I&#x27;m able to post an early review for a \\&quot;Vine\\&quot; Product, and I feel priveliged to do so!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>First, let me say that I LOVE my adult Sonicare toothbrush.  </li>
            <li>This makes it much easier for my son to thoroughly clean his teeth.</li>
            <li>but I found the sensation of brushing with this to be a bit less pleasant than when I used an OralB electric toothbrush which I used for a while and continue to use sometimes.</li>
            <li>We were very happy with the results at first, but now one has broken already, and I can&#x27;t see how to exchange it or what the warranty situation is for the item.</li>
            <li>It stays on for a full 2 minutes and makes sure he is brushing for the proper amount of time.  </li>
            <li>I really gets my sons teeth clean and is quite.</li>
            <li>so wanted to ensure we were doing as much as we could to help him keep them clean.  </li>
            <li>She loves having her own &amp;#34;electric&amp;#34; toothbrush, &amp; willingly brushes regularly!  </li>
            <li>The toothbrush is very easy to use and comes with extra faceplates if you want to change up the look of the toothbrush.</li>
            <li>She was not the most interested tooth brusher, but since getting this, she is always excited to get her teeth brushed.</li>
            <li>A very smart office manager in my dentist&#x27;s suggested this Sonicare For Kids</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll be very surprised if this Does All The Work toothbrush doesn&#x27;t yield good results at their next visit to the dentist.</li>
            <li>Plus it does a far better job cleaning their teeth than they were ever able to do with a regular toothbrush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Plus it makes a cute beep sound that helps the brusher know how much brushing is left to go!</li>
            <li>Apparently some people are more prone to it than others.  </li>
            <li>Makes brushing the regularly missed spots much easier and  more precisely</li>
            <li>The look and sounds were fun at first, but now that the time is increasing and she&#x27;s used it for awhile, the novelty is gone.</li>
            <li>The timer on it is great, no more singing the ABC&#x27;s and getting distracted and having to start over,</li>
            <li>it makes beeps to count time how long to brush and stops on its own after two minutes of brushing.</li>
            <li>The little beep reminders are pleasant to hear.  </li>
            <li>I recommend this brush not just for kids, but for adults with limited dexterity, crowded teeth, heavy stain, and those who found the original Sonicare too strong for their sensitive teeth, but want the toothbrush with the best ability to remove stains.</li>
            <li>First of all, the packaging is VERY easy to open.  </li>
            <li>It has only been a little over a week, but I am impressed to hear him brushing by himself every morning and evening, and with the timer he is brushing longer than he ever has before.    </li>
            <li>and I\\&quot;m sure he&#x27;ll soon be a little pro.  :-)</li>
            <li>My daughter is learning how to brush her teeth &amp;#34;on her own&amp;#34; right now and this is really helping!  </li>
            <li>We have the adult version of the Philips Sonicare from 5 years ago and they are still going strong.  </li>
            <li>That same sound also seems to delight my daughter, who is the primary user of the toothbrush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This toothbrush does a great job and has a timer tone to let my boy know when he has brushed enough.</li>
            <li>The timer and musical chime has been great for him and he likes the brush overall.</li>
            <li>I wanted my 8 year old to use our Sonicare toothbrush, but it is just too strong for him.</li>
            <li>These are not as strong in terms of brushing force as the adult versions.  </li>
            <li>It helps me 7 years old child to brush her teeth more efficiency and the 2 minutes time inerval work really well.</li>
            <li>I use are at least 3 yrs old and the rechargeable batteries are working perfectly.</li>
            <li>was worried it would be too much for my 4 year old but no problems, love the dings letting me know when we are almost done.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The lowest setting is too strong for my 3 year old, but nothing that a desense program wouldn&#x27;t fix.&lt;br</li>
            <li>(I&#x27;ve listened and watched) are SOMEWHAT quieter than models like this meant for adults (I use a Phillips Sonicare ProResults--love it, but it&#x27;s LOUD), so there&#x27;s no \\&quot;scary\\&quot; drill-like sound, AND, the scrub-factor is more gentle than on adult models.&lt;br</li>
            <li>At first glance, the product seems to be pretty sturdy, unfortunately, as another owner experienced, this product was designed for use by more than one child.  </li>
            <li>my daughter like it very much.</li>
            <li>after a day or two of &amp;#34;hehehe it tickles&amp;#34; my 3.5 year old is fine with it.</li>
            <li>There are 3 different faceplates that it comes with that you can chose from so the kids get to personalize it a little too, which is kind of nice.</li>
            <li>He recommended it, great product for small and older children!</li>
            <li>His teeth looks great and clean, so I would totally recommend the product to other parents!</li>
            <li>Another reason for the removal of one star: this isn&#x27;t something you can just hand the kids and say \\&quot;brush your teeth.\\&quot;  They&#x27;ll need some instruction, and maybe even help with their first couple of uses.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>My grandson brushes more thoroughly with this device, and needs only a reminder that its time to brush his teeth.</li>
            <li>This is our second, and we are well pleased.</li>
            <li>To me it seems like the brush head does not have a wide motion that might help, we&#x27;ll see how effective it is over time.    </li>
            <li>favorite feature is the musical tone that indicates when it is time to switch quadrants.  </li>
            <li>The vibrating head tingles the gums when first used and it&#x27;s explicitly written in the manual that \\&quot;The Sonicare may feel ticklish upon first use\\&quot;.</li>
            <li>This brush helped him to become more independent, and now I just help him once a day to get that pesky spot</li>
            <li>We believe the initial cost and brush replacement costs are more than compensated for in savings at the dentists office.</li>
            <li>But after much coaxing, they refuse to use it!  </li>
            <li>I bought this mostly because I wanted my son to begin brushing properly and this has a timer on it for kids.  </li>
            <li>Plus, his dental visits since he&#x27;s had this toothbrush was much better than the one last year.  </li>
            <li>As others mentioned, would have been nice if one of the covers was pink, red or a more frilly color for my daughters</li>
            <li>If you plan on switching out the heads for multiple children, I would considered another more robust toothbrush (maybe an Oral B product which seems to be built to a more robust standard).    </li>
            <li>this is exactly what did it.  </li>
            <li>Once the decision was made it was time to flip a coin to see who would go first.  </li>
            <li>You can not wrong by buying this item, if you have the money go for it.</li>
            <li>Great for the kids, as it slowly increases the time of brushing.</li>
            <li>Much better mouth care, as opposed to a regular toothbrush.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s high-tech which keeps them interested.</li>
            <li>Kids love the musical sounds it chimes when it&#x27;s time to brush another area.</li>
            <li>Cleans very well!</li>
            <li>Those complaints stopped with this brush the first time we used it</li>
            <li>it seems to do a more thorough job than a standard toothbrush.  </li>
            <li>highly* recommend this toothbrush!!</li>
            <li>I have had a sonicare for sometime now and as soon as I was aware of a sonicare for kids</li>
            <li>Its not obvious to me that it does a better job at cleaning than the OralB electric toothbrush.</li>
            <li>Feel it does a better job than a regular brush.</li>
            <li>my kid loves it and doesn&#x27;t complain any more about time to brush; now she knows that we are done only when it stops.</li>
            <li>My kid&#x27;s dentist still said her teeth were pretty stained.</li>
            <li>Outstanding product for younger children!</li>
            <li>My daughter is two and throws an epic fit every time we try to brush her teeth.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t love it enough!</li>
            <li>He has braces and needed something better than a regular toothbrush.</li>
            <li>I hope to be able to purchase a Sonicare for my self in the future!</li>
            <li>So I am going to pick up a second unit to feel better about that.  </li>
            <li>It really can&#x27;t be more simple to get started.</li>
            <li>I love that the &#x27;sonic&#x27; movement is truly different</li>
            <li>$10 a brush head is pretty steep.  </li>
            <li>I worked with her the first couple of times she used it, as you will have to with your kids.  </li>
            <li>But, the sensation was not uncomfortable for her.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Battery lasts several days and it has sustained many drops to the floor.</li>
            <li>Thanks Philips!  </li>
            <li>, so I am really hoping to pass this on to my kids!</li>
            <li>We had our daughters share the first Sonicare, just bought an additional head.  </li>
            <li>and it has held up very well!</li>
            <li>I would recommend it to anyone who has staining issues in their kids teeth and even if they don&#x27;t because this toothbrush does so much better than the standard ones you buy at the store.  </li>
            <li>It makes brushing his teeth fun, the two minutes goes by fast.</li>
            <li>The dentist had commented that he wasn&#x27;t doing a stellar job brushing.   </li>
            <li>My husband &amp; I have had a Sonicare for several months and love it.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend!!</li>
            <li>Got these for the grandkids and they love them and will actually brush their teeth without a fight and seem to be brushing longer as well.</li>
            <li>They work great, we have not had any problems, and they last a long time before needing to be re-charged.</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t sure if it was &amp;#34;kid friendly&amp;#34; enough, but it is.</li>
            <li>highly recommend!!</li>
            <li>The smaller brush works better for kids.</li>
            <li>My boys regularly get told to brush better by our dentist.</li>
            <li>Except for the fact that they splat toothpaste spit everywhere, they are exactly what the dentist ordered.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Overall, they have ended up brushing more often and from what I can tell, it is working well.</li>
            <li>And you will be amazed when you first use it.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s powerful, yet gentle as well.</li>
            <li>Love the different design option stickers</li>
            <li>We called the company with the first one and they replaced it, but it has happened again.  </li>
            <li>you have to keep replacing the heads or the WHOLE toothbrush!</li>
            <li>I love that it signals my son when to move to a different area to brush and when finished gives another signal.  </li>
            <li>My son thinks its fun and continues to use it without me standing over him to brush his teeth...would highly recommend!</li>
            <li>My kids love to brush their teeth now, I especially like the timing for each section of the mouth.</li>
            <li>talk strategy on how to bush and where to move after the first beep.  </li>
            <li>so I really could not be happier with this toothbrush!</li>
            <li>Kids love it, although you may want to supervise younger ones to make sure it&#x27;s used properly.  </li>
            <li>Finally, it may not be as attractive as the adult versions, but the adult heads fit on this one and its quite a bit cheaper than the adult models.  </li>
            <li>Not only is he brushing even more</li>
            <li>With the beeping tones to let him know when to switch to the next quadrant, I know he&#x27;s getting a better quality brushing experience.  </li>
            <li>Now she wants to brush her teeth!</li>
            <li>So the first week or so we stood by and reminded her which &amp;#34;quadrant&amp;#34; to switch to and that was that.  </li>
            <li>(More often than not, she has a big mouth!).</li>
            <li>Very well made!</li>
            <li>We&#x27;ll be buying another one for our son when he&#x27;s ready!</li>
            <li>Mine are 3 and 6 and now they&#x27;re fighting over who gets to brush first.  </li>
            <li>I feel like such a better mom with these toothbrushes now.</li>
            <li>The color is very bright and doesn&#x27;t look like a typical \\&quot;toothbrush\\&quot; and actually brightens up our bathroom.</li>
            <li>I purchased two for my children and one stopped working within a couple months,  Customer service was awesome at Philips and replacement for free, Great toothbrushes otherwise and Child&#x27;s dentist highly recommends these over other brands,  Web: [...] or  Phone: 1-888-PHILIPS (744-5477)</li>
            <li>Wow! for the first time ever her teeth are clean.  </li>
            <li>Super highly recommended.</li>
            <li>My 5 and 8 year old grandsons love their new toothbrushes.  </li>
            <li>My 5 and 7 yr old love their new toothbrushes.</li>
            <li>It has the chime that reminds him to switch to a new section, and keeps him brushing for the full minute.</li>
            <li>After we started using this toothbrush her teeth cleaned right up and her gums look much healthier.</li>
            <li>The brush is small, soft, and very suitable to fit into a child&#x27;s mouth.  </li>
            <li>As was the case when I purchased my FlexCare brush shortly after it was introduced, I think that the price is a bit on the high side, but one could justify that it is worth the dental health benefits if it helps your child brush better and longer each time.</li>
            <li>heads, as with all toothbrushes will eventually wear and need replacement, and the cost is certainly a little bit more than a cheap toothbrush off the grocery store shelf.  </li>
            <li>Other nice amenities are self adhesive coverlets which allowed my son to \\&quot;customize\\</li>
            <li>, they won&#x27;t use any other kind of brush.</li>
            <li>I purchased this for my granddaughter to help with her dental care, we were not disappointed, it works just like the adult version but for children.  </li>
            <li>6 year old loves it and it is preparing her to go to the dentist (the vibration) in a couple of months.&lt;br /&gt;Pricey for us ($60) but worth it!</li>
            <li>So excited that I was able to find this on Amazon for SO much less than at Target.</li>
            <li>but I know this works better to reach hard places and keeps their gums healthy.</li>
            <li>It arrived quickly and it is better than expected!</li>
            <li>/&gt;It is a bit different than the Adult models, more simplified in functions, but does just as good a job as any other toothbrush in the Sonicare line.  </li>
            <li>A quick call to customer service, verification of the serial number, and I had a new handle on its way.</li>
            <li>A quick call to customer service, verification of the serial number, and I had a new handle on its way.</li>
            <li>Forget all the special settings; high and low work just fine.</li>
            <li>Phillips is also a great company, as I have had trouble with my &#x27;adult&#x27; version, they replaced the part with no problem at all.  </li>
            <li>I was concerned that my 5 year old wasn&#x27;t getting his teeth clean when brushing.</li>
            <li>The different speeds are a good idea for the younger kids, but mine were already used to switching areas every 30 seconds</li>
            <li>Sure, you still have to move the toothbrush and angle it properly, but the rapid vibrations help remove stuff from your teeth really well.  </li>
            <li>More comfortable for a child than the sonicare with the round heads.</li>
            <li>Nice product that makes my 3 year old look forward to brushing her teeth and being a big girl at that.</li>
            <li>Both my 3 year old and my 5 year old love the brush.</li>
            <li>old twins and almost 3 year old LOVE using these brushes.  </li>
            <li>Seems to be a far better solution that a normal brush which rarely lasted more than 30 seconds, half of which was spitting out toothpaste and talking to Dad.</li>
            <li>The adult brushes fit fine, and last longer (cheaper, too.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>it beeps when she should change quadrants in her mouth, letting her know how long is appropriate.</li>
            <li>It wasn&#x27;t long after we bought these that we found out that our dentist had started recommending them for kids, which made us feel even better about them.</li>
            <li>My son loves using it, I love the fact it has a timer that teaches kids how long to brush their teeth</li>
            <li>/&gt;Having said all this, a power toothbrush IS way better for a kid than manual brushing in the long run, I think.  </li>
            <li>I brush her first, then she wants to jump in and try.</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t find a similar quality product from other manufacturers so Phillips are happy to explore their edge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bite</li>
            <li>Brush for much longer too;).</li>
            <li>When the kids toothbrush came out, I was anxious to get it for my three boys, ages 7, 4, and 4, thinking it would help develop good brushing habits.  </li>
            <li>that my adult Oral0-B Professional version which they were sharing with me before they got this, our dentist said the kids version is MUCH more gentle on their teeth.   </li>
            <li>the feeling of a Sonicare is a little off-putting to some people at first as it can cause a kind of tingling in the mouth from the rapid vibrations.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommended using these if you have the same problem as we did with our children and teeth-brushing.  :-)</li>
            <li>His teeth are finally getting clean like they are supposed to, and he&#x27;s brushing for the right amount of time.</li>
            <li>It has made it easy to teach them how to brush all four parts of their teeth (upper inside/outside, lower inside/</li>
            <li>They are very quiet and easy to use as well.</li>
            <li>Small head makes brushing her teeth safer and more comfortable for her.  </li>
            <li>If your children fall into those 2 different categories, then you can easily purchase only one as the heads come off easily</li>
            <li>All I need to share is that I can get my 9 year old to brush his teeth for the full 2 minutes twice every day now thanks to this toothbrush.   </li>
            <li>The cool cover choices &amp; fun sounds are just an extra bonus!</li>
            <li>The major difference between this and mine is that it has a more fun jingle that it plays every 30 seconds when it&#x27;s time to move to the next section of your mouth.  </li>
            <li>The handle is a bit large</li>
            <li>The replacement child sized heads are certainly pricey.</li>
            <li>If you are familiar with the adult versions of Sonicare brushes then this will have a familiar feel and operate similarly.</li>
            <li>and it has made our twice a day routine more fun and less of a hassle.  </li>
            <li>Short of holding him down and doing it myself, this is the next best thing!</li>
            <li>But, you don&#x27;t get many chances to make mistakes with the few teeth you have, so developing good brushing habits can save my kid from pain and discomfort down the road.  </li>
            <li>I have found out that when they don&#x27;t want to work like they used to , don&#x27;t run right out &amp; buy a new one until you try this.</li>
            <li>When you throw in some other features, this toothbrush is great for children, with minor exception, which I will revisit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It came with 3 different stickers so he could customize it when he first got it which made him excited to use it.</li>
            <li>Everything gets brushed thourough and quick!</li>
            <li>Yes, the colors/graphics are nice but not worth the cost of short-lived brushes!</li>
            <li>The 5 yr old girl thinks it tickles too  much!!</li>
            <li>Funny to see a 7 year old girl and two 9 year old boys so excited about brushing.</li>
            <li>The cost is not as high as it first seems,  </li>
            <li>I suggest you get the adult line of Sonicare for your kids and use the soft brush heads that are available for them.</li>
            <li>but it has an adult setting and the adult heads fit on it.</li>
            <li>Then there&#x27;s the fact that this toothbrush costs two-and-a-half times as much as the Oral-B does--or did.</li>
            <li>And, the product seems very well made and sturdy.</li>
            <li>They like the timer that tells them when to switch sides, the motion isn&#x27;t too much in the automatic toothbrush</li>
            <li>If I do, then I have to break another rule of going through the whole brushing sequence.  </li>
            <li>so we did the following:  1) gauze with alcohol free mouthwash  2)</li>
            <li>Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>and she wants to brush her teeth all the time.</li>
            <li>but I thought that was more of a plus than a minus (except for maybe the smallest hands).  </li>
            <li>we highly recommend this one!</li>
            <li>highly recommended!</li>
            <li>It is a bargain for the whole family.</li>
            <li>A shame really.</li>
            <li>Also, because we don&#x27;t have to move the brush head itself too much</li>
            <li>+ (unless they&#x27;re very precocious of course).  </li>
            <li>- Personalizable plastic templates don&#x27;t adhere to the toothbrush very well.  </li>
            <li>it was worth the money, and I am getting another one for my five year old.</li>
            <li>This toothbrush has been a real God-send for us.</li>
            <li>My son does not even notice before he brush his teeth for the whole 2 minutes.</li>
            <li>It tickles their gums too much.  </li>
            <li>The brush has made it much easier for my daughter to brush her teeth.</li>
            <li>it makes i highly recommend it!</li>
            <li>All the replacement heads are much longer even the one for kids</li>
            <li>He even will brush much longer then the 2 minute cycle.  </li>
            <li>Our daughter had real difficulty brushing on the insides of her teeth, as well as the two front teeth (for some reason).  </li>
            <li>so your child can feel like a grownup yet still have gentle brush strokes.  </li>
            <li>Not too powerful for my 5 year old.</li>
            <li>Saw this at a brick/mortar store (way overpriced) and found here (reasonably priced).  </li>
            <li>The tooth brush really helps remove tartar and plaque and her teeth are whiter than ever.  </li>
            <li>certainly more thorough for our 3 boys, aged 5, 7, and</li>
            <li>really loves the vibration and now he even keeps up with his hygiene without me having to remind him to brush his teeth.  </li>
            <li>He&#x27;d let me brush his teeth for 5 minutes straight with this if I chose to (</li>
            <li>its so much easier to get her to brush now!!I</li>
            <li>recommend this highly!</li>
            <li>I was very, very pleased with this purchase and would recommend it to anyone with small children.</li>
            <li>My daughter really likes this toothbrush, and we like it because it gets her teeth cleaner.</li>
            <li>so , so much easier.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>and I am worried about when they switch the head, the tip is very pointed and if there is any horseplay then someone could get hurt.  </li>
            <li>(it&#x27;s short don&#x27;t worry, it&#x27;s not annoying)</li>
            <li>None that are real deal breakers</li>
            <li>It cleans my kids&#x27; teeth with no effort gently.</li>
            <li>This part breaks and the whole thing is no longer usable.</li>
            <li>This kids version seems to have used a travel charger (which doesn&#x27;t have a place to store the extra heads) and they just made a piece to fit over it.  </li>
            <li>The really bothersome part is that if the toothbrush is still on when you remove it from the mouth, it splats all over creation.  </li>
            <li>His teeth and gums are much healthier than when using a manual toothbrush.  </li>
            <li>Also brushing  his teeth is no longer a tearful chore but rather just a twice daily activity that he cheerfully does.</li>
            <li>Well worth the money...even on a ticklish 4 year old.</li>
            <li>Has music playing in segments to remind your kiddo to move the brush around the whole mouth.</li>
            <li>The battery hold up really well.</li>
            <li>It really does.</li>
            <li>, same size heads fit this kids model</li>
            <li>Much cheaper that way.</li>
            <li>My daughter loves it and wants to brush her teeth all the time.</li>
            <li>The melody increases in length until it plays the whole tune, which helps her focus on finishing.  </li>
            <li>Our kids really didn&#x27;t like brushing their teeth.  </li>
            <li>Moreover, the kids&#x27; teeth are so much cleaner then before when they used non-electronic tooth brushes.  </li>
            <li>She constantly wants to brush her teeth.</li>
            <li>Since there isn&#x27;t much room from the neck of the head to the bristles, I feel like I&#x27;m going to pull the bristles off at some point.</li>
            <li>Brushing teeth has never been so fun for my 6 yr old.</li>
            <li>and so we ended up buying her a normal toothbrush at first.</li>
            <li>You can really see the difference with the music tones</li>
            <li>My Oral-B toothbrushes have lasted much, much longer.</li>
            <li>Kids didn&#x27;t really care for this toothbrush</li>
            <li>We know that her teeth are getting cleaned well yet gently.  </li>
            <li>This has really helped with those problem areas.</li>
            <li>The whole family has a sonicare toothbrush.</li>
            <li>Product is as described and the &amp;#34;music&amp;#34; it makes really kept my daughter engaged in brushing; she loves it</li>
            <li>the timer function helps much.</li>
            <li>You just have to gently touch the teeth, and the brush does the work.  </li>
            <li>I bought the Philips Sonicare Standard Ultra Soft Sensitive, 3 Brush Heads and it fits nicely.</li>
            <li>thank you so much</li>
            <li>These brushes really helped.</li>
            <li>it cleans really well!happy with it</li>
            <li>It really increases brushing time.</li>
            <li>would highly recommend for kids!</li>
            <li>and so this really helps the brush get in between.  </li>
            <li>The kids enjoy using them, after set time periods they play musical sounds which makes them chuckle.</li>
            <li>My kids brush harder and are more mindful of how they care for their teeth with this.  </li>
            <li>It works really well.  </li>
            <li>because he did it completed the process lighting fast.</li>
            <li>As much of a pain as it is to get kids to brush their teeth, with the Sonicare for Kids they tell me they are going to brush their teeth.  </li>
            <li>The vibration is too much for my daughter</li>
            <li>They would complain that it &amp;#34;tickled&amp;#34; too much and not want to brush.  </li>
            <li>Was the one thing she really wanted.  </li>
            <li>Boys really like to use this electric toothbrush.  </li>
            <li>its just so much easier then trying to show them how manually.</li>
            <li>The brush was working really well - but the brush heads started falling out of the body of the toothbrush.</li>
            <li>I got tired of buying a electric toothbrush for my son every 2 months and this is great.  </li>
            <li>The beep telling them when to move to another area really does work</li>
            <li>The sound emitted during the brush is nowhere as loud as it is on the adult brush so that helps.  </li>
            <li>It is exactly the same as my \\&quot;adult\\&quot; version except it is in a cool color that he can change the face plate.</li>
            <li>My two year old even enjoys brushing his own teeth, though we go back over them with the timer on the short program just to be sure they were properly cleaned.</li>
            <li>Start them on healthy brushing habits early and it&#x27;ll benefit them their entire lives.</li>
            <li>Recently, after what I&#x27;m sure was almost 1500 cycles of use (two kids sharing handle night and day), the battery completely died.</li>
            <li>Recently, after what I&#x27;m sure was almost 1500 cycles of use (two kids sharing handle night and day), the battery completely died.</li>
            <li>The HX6053 (Sensitive), HX6023 (ProResults Compact), and HX6062/HX6063 (DiamondClean) brush heads also fit on both the adult FlexCare and this Kids model.</li>
            <li>On top of that, the barrel-shaped handle of the Kids model is also bigger in circumference than the adult model.  </li>
            <li>On top of that, the barrel-shaped handle of the Kids model is also bigger in circumference than the adult model.  </li>
            <li>It comes with several different faceplates and I let her pick her own one</li>
            <li>Took a few weeks but both are loving it.</li>
            <li>I know from using the similar adult version, that it cleans better than anything else we have used.</li>
            <li>I loved that at the beginning, it started out slow and worked up to the 2 minute brushing.  </li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t scientifically measure how much improvement it has over regular brush, but feels that it more effective as the vibration helps a better cleaning job, and timer helps kids to stay on brushing until the times up, instead of cutting it way</li>
            <li>We think Sonicare toothbrushes in general clean teeth better than other electric toothbrushes on the market.</li>
            <li>I have noticed a huge difference in how clean her teeth are and it frees me up a little because I don&#x27;t feel like I have to watch her as often.</li>
            <li>It gradually gets them to the entire 2 minutes with a very child friendly chime for each quadrant, then eventually stopping when the time has been achieved.  </li>
            <li>She does a pretty good job and at least she enjoys brushing now!  </li>
            <li>The three different decorative templates were certainly an enticement, and they had fun picking which one they wanted to use on it first</li>
            <li>The timer is great not only because he knows we will stop brushing when it is over, but since it uses multiple tones as the time passes he knows how long he has till it turns off.   </li>
            <li>The timer is great because it assures both her and me that she&#x27;s brushed long enough.  </li>
            <li>(he was so excited to open it and use it).</li>
            <li>Way better than any other toothbrush.</li>
            <li>: I love that the charger is compatible with other sonicare toothbrushes.</li>
            <li>Most of the other ones you buy with batteries in them still require manual brushing.</li>
            <li>It works well and cleans his teeth a lot better than his other toothbrush...</li>
            <li>Finally a kids toothbrush worth the money!</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s not covered under the warrantee because they only give warrantee from the original purchase date.  </li>
            <li>We bought the exact same one again b/c kids love it, but I wish it would last longer</li>
            <li>The Sonic Care does the job, but its not kid friendly enough.</li>
            <li>When I spend a lot of hard earned money on quality products, exceptional customer support is a requirement.  </li>
            <li>Now my 6 yr old is brushing on his own without me worrying if he is doing it right and for long enough.</li>
            <li>At low power, I would describe the buzzing sound as \\&quot;housefly\\&quot; volume, at high level</li>
            <li>The features most import to us: rechargeable, varied speeds, and the charm/music that plays very 30 sec, and the auto shut off after two minutes.  </li>
            <li>got it for my daughter&#x27;s training.&lt;br /&gt;she wont use it often, I found it has high very high vibrations even in lower</li>
            <li>My only complaints are that it would be nice to be able to buy the brush with just larger heads, since my kids are both big enough for them.  </li>
            <li>I am disappointed and as you know it is a great day when we brush more than 2 times a day.</li>
            <li>Although the learning and practice continues, now i know my kids are getting their teeth as clean as possible.</li>
            <li>Otherwise these are great and my dentist had less work to do on my teeth after I had used the adult model for several months.</li>
            <li>so we know when to switch to the next spot to clean.</li>
            <li>My daughter does not fuss any longer with the time needed to properly achieve a clean mouth.  </li>
            <li>I actually feel assured that my kids teeth are clean when I&#x27;m done brushing.</li>
            <li>My kids didnt want to brush their teeth long enough so the timer on it is really nice.</li>
            <li>This Sonicare brush is fair superior to the less expensive automatic toothbrush</li>
            <li>I was hesitant at first if this toothbrush would be better than other rechargeable brushes but having seen the results of my 8 year old&#x27;s teeth, I&#x27;m sold.  </li>
            <li>This toothbrush removed built on plaque that we couldn&#x27;t get off with other tooth brushes... it is SOOO worth the price to have some clean teeth kids</li>
            <li>On the other hand, my kid is at the lower end of the advertised age range for this product; older kids--I&#x27;d say six and up--would probably have a better time of it.</li>
            <li>This is a great product and is visually pleasing enough to encourage a four year old to use it on a regular basis.  </li>
            <li>Although it has little merit to the performance of the toothbrush, it made me feel like the company really did its homework to provide a good product starting with the packaging.  </li>
            <li>My seven year old has been brushing his own teeth without a lot of assistance for about a year and a half with the Oral-B rechargeable toothbrushes.  </li>
            <li>We got the first one along with the adult Sonicare system about March of last year and the adult system is still going strong.</li>
            <li>The kids enjoy brishing their teeth in the morning and know how long to brush with the timer.</li>
            <li>old daughter &amp; she absolutely LOVES it!</li>
            <li>The kids like the musical prompts and brush their teeth for the full two minutes.</li>
            <li>My 6 year old had to have her first filling this month</li>
            <li>Its a lot easier to monitor that they brushed their teeth for a full 2 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>No young kids are good at brushing (don&#x27;t believe those other moms and dads).</li>
            <li>It was a pin her down and listen to her scream experience that had to be repeated more than once a day since she had the beginnings of cavities at 12 months.  </li>
            <li>He has always been a good brusher but his front teeth were still a little yellow</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a new toy for their teeth!</li>
            <li>but I can not find a new toothbrush head to buy!</li>
            <li>, why do they act like it&#x27;s something new!</li>
            <li>Got a brand new system from my child&#x27;s orthodontist and after 2 months it stopped working!  </li>
            <li>We have had ours for more than a year and a half</li>
            <li>Quality is so much better than the knock of brands I had previously purchased that broke within a month of purchase</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using an Oral-B Buzz Lightyear rechargeable toothbrush on my four-year-old for a couple of years now; I wanted to see what benefits this model might have over the older unit.</li>
            <li>You could possibly find that your child actually asks to brush his or her teeth more</li>
            <li>I think the vibrant colors attract the kids.</li>
            <li>I think it would be better to have the entire handle white and then 2 panels for each gender.</li>
            <li>Although this children&#x27;s model uses a smaller brush head compared to the adult Sonicare models, the adult-sized brush heads can actually fit onto this children&#x27;s model.  </li>
            <li>With my Oral-B Professional, I also have a sound indicator to tell me when to move to a different quadrant</li>
            <li>It comes with 2 heads, one geared towards 4 year olds and one for older age 7.</li>
            <li>My kids love the fact that it comes with multiple heads and multiple colors.</li>
            <li>My son went from barely dragging his old toothbrush across his teeth for 30 seconds, to brushing for a full 2 mins.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It came with 2 brush heads, one for under 7 and one for older kids</li>
            <li>Comes with two sized heads and the base unit can hold two heads making it great for if you have more then one kid.</li>
            <li>This particular toothbrush is for children.  </li>
            <li>These toothbrushes are decent for kids.  </li>
            <li>I ended up using the brush head for older kids that came with it</li>
            <li>My ten year daughter, who would never spend more than 30 seconds brushing her teeth, now enjoys brushing her teeth and actually brushes three times a day now.</li>
            <li>So far they have been cavity free using this brush, mouthwash and occasional flossing.</li>
            <li>7 year old loves it, and is highly motivated since he recently had to have a cavity filled.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Still, the above are small issues, because overall, this product does what it says, and what it should, which is: providing young kids with good, proper, and effective brushing.</li>
            <li>We bought this for our 7 yr old son because he doesn&#x27;t brush long enough on his own.  </li>
            <li>But, I found the larger one is pretty much exactly like my normal Sonicare head.</li>
            <li>It was easy for him to learn how to use it, it makes a sound when he needs to move it to a different part of his mouth and it plays a little jingle when he&#x27;s finished.</li>
            <li>Paying retail price for this just seemed too high.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this electric toothbrush for kids.</li>
            <li>After 4K in dental work on him, I have high expectations for the check-up.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>Our dentist recommended this toothbrush for our 7 year old and it took a short time for him to get used to it versus the regular rotating tooth brushes, but it works great and gets soaking wet and still works.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend this toothbrush.</li>
            <li>highly recommended.</li>
            <li>Would highly recommend for the youngsters.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>Just to comment on some other reviews on this toothbrush: No child should be left to do his own brushing.</li>
            <li>and I can get more for my other child when he&#x27;s old enough.&lt;br</li>
            <li>it is a \\&quot;bumblebee\\&quot;, compared to the \\&quot;large bumblebee on steroids\\&quot; buzzing and vibration of the adult FlexCare model.  </li>
            <li>my more-expensive Sonicare FlexCare adult brush also had: (1) its handle is coated with a tacky non-slip rubbery coating with prominent knobby bumps along the handle to aid in better grip, whereas my FlexCare has a smooth plastic surface, and (2) a flattened part of the handle allows the brush to be laid down horizontally with the bristles facing upward, whereas if I lay my FlexCare horizontally, it may roll around and end up with its bristles touching the sink counter surface.  </li>
            <li>No cavities in her little mouth :)</li>
            <li>For his molars, I just let the brush head linger a little while more.</li>
            <li>Another thing that could concern me with a younger child is the way you change the power setting from the lower level (for 4-7) to the higher level is a simple button that is easily accessible to children.  </li>
            <li>Plays cute little music chime to let you know when to switch areas</li>
            <li>Chalk it up to too many fruit snacks, no flossing, not realizing Little Bear toothpaste had no flouride when toddlers and no city flouridated water.  </li>
            <li>On the other hand, if it helps kids brush better (and prevents cavities), especially in those too young to floss, it might be worth it.</li>
            <li>Most importantly it gets the job done with minimal screaming and little fists flying.</li>
            <li>After two and a half years of dental worries, surgeries, extractions, and cavities, my 3-yr-old daughter is finally officially cavity free!!</li>
            <li>my daughter saw how i was feeling about my sonicare flex plus and wanted one, now she is so excited about brushing her teeth every single time after she eats.</li>
            <li>For the longest time I was happy with that product, but had recently began noticing that my son had bad breath more often than normal.  </li>
            <li>I have been using the adult version and really like that as well.</li>
            <li>Has lasted much longer than my adult Sonicare.</li>
            <li>That is pretty lame in my opinion and an interchangeable faceplate would make much more sense for kids (especially if you had more than one kid using the brush).&lt;br</li>
            <li>The timer makes sure that the kids brush long enough.</li>
            <li>The musical cues along the way are fun</li>
            <li>I registered them with Phillips (which I normally don&#x27;t).  </li>
            <li>My son makes a big smile and we get in there, but I feel like we have to sort of jam it in there.  </li>
            <li>This toothbrush not only brushes better, but it also has a timer that helps him know how long to brush.   </li>
            <li>We did have a normal non-ultrasonic toothbrush that we bought for her before</li>
            <li>(it&#x27;s nice and small for her little mouth), and how easy it is to maneuver the brush for her.  </li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s slightly cumbersome to deal with the aforementioned issues but overall it does a great job of brushing those young teeth.  </li>
            <li>Older child is fine but younger child dislikes the vibration even on the low setting.</li>
            <li>Our 6 year old granddaughter loves her new Philips Sonicare would highly recommend!  </li>
            <li>Our almost 4 year old son loves his new \\&quot;power\\&quot; toothbrush and is very keen to brush his teeth morning and night.</li>
            <li>As was the case when I purchased my FlexCare brush shortly after it was introduced, I think that the price is a bit on the high side, but one could justify that it is worth the dental health benefits if it helps your child brush better and longer each time.plates mounted on it, it weighs the same 4.8 ounces as my adult model; once the faceplate is mounted onto the brush, its 5.0 ounce weight is actually heavier than my adult model.  </li>
            <li>The head seems a bit too big to get easily onto the upper and lower side gums.  </li>
            <li>Every single one of them promise to send out a replacement one free with a return box to return the old defective toothbrush.  </li>
            <li>Then later on, the brush did not work right no matter what I did.  </li>
            <li>The smaller brush head is just the right size for his mouth.  </li>
            <li>It only took our kids (ages 5 &amp; 7) a few days to get used to the vibration, and they love them!</li>
            <li>It still takes parents &amp; dental professionals to teach kids how to brush properly, but at least it helps to ensure a better clean.</li>
            <li>True, the large size makes it easier for a child who has yet to develop fine motor skills to manipulate, but the large size can also make it difficult to grasp.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>However, it didn&#x27;t take long for our 5 year old to be able to hold it properly without help.</li>
            <li>However the timer sound can not be turned off and is extremely annoying.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It is a little heavy for my son but works Great...</li>
            <li>The red one is the perfect size, the blue (bigger kid) size is still too big for my 6 years old mouth, so i just have two smaller red heads.&lt;br</li>
            <li>My 6 year old son actually enjoys brushing his teeth for the first time!</li>
            <li>I would like the bristles to be a little bit more soft, though.</li>
            <li>update when new models come out.  </li>
            <li>I was always buying new toothbrushes and just decided to splurge on these to save money on dental appointments.</li>
            <li>I son loves his new toothbrush.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had this two years now and it still works like new.  </li>
            <li>and it runs like new still.</li>
            <li>and they continue to work as if they were brand new.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Enjoy!hey continue to work as if they were brand new.  </li>
            <li>My kid hates the beep that the brush makes to indicate you need to switch to a new quadrant.  </li>
            <li>She&#x27;ll live though.</li>
            <li>We purchased a new one from BedBath&amp;Beyond</li>
            <li>My daughter loves brushing her teeth with her new Sonicare.  </li>
            <li>we&#x27;ve bought brand new $7.80 vibrating kids toothbrushes, new set of stickers for the kids to decorate and</li>
            <li>New faceplates used to come with the replacement heads as they need to be replaced just as often.  </li>
            <li>so we have 2 new units.</li>
            <li>/&gt;But now with these new electronic tooth brushes our kids get a \\&quot;kick\\&quot; out of brushing their teeth.  </li>
            <li>Replacement brushes are almost as much as a new unit.</li>
            <li>We sent this to him as a congratulations and incentive to take care of his new teeth.  </li>
            <li>I called Philips to ask for a new one or help figuring out the issue and all they could offer me was a discount code to buy a new one.  </li>
            <li>Really easy for kids to use buy they tend to get black and moldy under then replaceable tooth brush head.</li>
            <li>But I guess with less money to dentist, I can recover my cost easily.</li>
            <li>While this electric toothbrush removed plaque a lot better than a manual toothbrush, the bristles became uneven lengths and caused my two year old&#x27;s gums to bleed.  </li>
            <li>taken care of, but they actually have at least a reasonably good time during brushing.  </li>
            <li>The brush is soft and gentle on young teeth and enamel.</li>
            <li>But a big part of getting young children to brush their teeth is to make it fun and to make it something that they look forward to.    </li>
            <li>i love the slow and fast settings.</li>
            <li>When I took them to their dentist a few days later, she was thrilled that they had this already as she sold it in her office.    </li>
            <li>but my 6 year old can now handle the high speed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>On the high setting it is a diminutively sized adult Sonicare.</li>
            <li>you first begin using them the timer for brushing is short so that they can get used to the new feel of vibration.</li>
            <li>, I have the adult version and my brush stopped charging after 6 months of use and they sent me a replacement as well, but they also told me that the new brush is warranted until year 2, minus the 6 months for the original brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It has worked wonders and the dentist has noticed a marked improvement in his oral health!</li>
            <li>It tickled her at first but only took about a week to get used to it.</li>
            <li>I do have one concern; the toothbrush is designed for kids 4+, but I&#x27;m not sure if it would be safe to use with kids 4</li>
            <li>to do a better job than his ordinary toothbrush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Considering buying the adult version for myself!</li>
            <li>The first week she must have brushed her teeth 50 times.  </li>
            <li>I bought this toothbrush for my 6 year old daughter and she loves it!..</li>
            <li>I have 3 and 5 year old who use it!</li>
            <li>You simply plug in the charger and let the toothbrush charge for 24hrs before it&#x27;s first use.  </li>
            <li>My seven year old son always despised brushing his teeth - until NOW!  </li>
            <li>This tooth brush not only cleans better than any other on the market, it keeps my son entertained.  </li>
            <li>Their customer service was fine and they provided a replacement, which then died in less than one year</li>
            <li>It took a few weeks to teach him how to use it properly, but now I love that it gives him a guide for how long to brush his teeth, plus does a better job than just his regular brushing.</li>
            <li>First one died within 6 months and the 2nd died before the year was up.  </li>
            <li>Also I have to be be careful to put it flat on the teeth because the top and bottom sides are pointy.</li>
            <li>My 3 year old loves this!  </li>
            <li>I purchased this for my 6 year old granddaughter, &amp; she loves it!  </li>
            <li>Hope this review helps for those who are curious about the \\&quot;details\\&quot; and appreciate full disclosure.</li>
            <li>Even though we had been fastidious with dental hygiene prior to purchasing the Sonicares, I have noticed a big difference in how clean their teeth are.  </li>
            <li>In my opinion $50 is pricey for a toothbrush but the fact that it includes two interchangeable brush heads (one for younger, one for older kids) that suited the ages of my two children, helped me justify spending that much.  </li>
            <li>Even my kids, who are not great brushers, enjoy using it and say their teeth feel clean.</li>
            <li>I just wish they would make some cute and fun panels that would appeal to kids.&lt;br /&gt;Despite the expensive brush heads and boring panels, the bottom line is the Sonicare still works great, and clean teeth is worth the money!</li>
            <li>I got this for my 3 year old a year ago and now I have to get a new one.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I searched my local drugstore and other online stores and found that Amazon had the best price-almost 1/2 of what my drugstore was asking and $20 less than other online stores.</li>
            <li>Like many children, my daughter was not very good at \\&quot;estimating\\&quot;</li>
            <li>The big head (7+) does not fit very good in a small kid&#x27;s jaws.</li>
            <li>Big problem is the adorable adhesive faceplates eventually break down and need replacing.  </li>
            <li>My youngest son(6)has soft enamel and has been getting cavities since he was 2 years old!</li>
            <li>We would always have to stand there and supervise the kids to make sure they brushed for long enough, but these brushes automatically go for either 1 minute or 2 mintues.  </li>
            <li>OK, so i must admit that i have gotten really lazy brushing my 6 year old and 4 year old&#x27;s teeth.</li>
            <li>Well I can now say that while she still doesn&#x27;t love having her teeth brushed that this toothbrush has taken it from a scream fest to slight complaining.  </li>
            <li>She was so excited when she saw it that she could hardly wait the recommended 12 hours for the first charge.  </li>
            <li>Also the rubber on the back of the large brush head is peeling off.  </li>
            <li>I attribute it in large part to using this toothbrush for the last 9 months.  </li>
            <li>We certainly haven&#x27;t done anything else different.</li>
            <li>Worked great initially, but after less than two weeks all of the bristles fell out and the head cracked in half!</li>
            <li>Plus, he is able to focus on each individual tooth with little effort.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s hard to explain how much better the kids&#x27; teeth look since they&#x27;ve been using the Sonicare.</li>
            <li>Other so called kid-models were bulky &amp; noisy that were quickly abandoned and thrown out.</li>
            <li>Other so called kid-models were bulky &amp; noisy that were quickly abandoned and thrown out.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s hard to get him to brush the area that is most ticklish.  </li>
            <li>So much more fun and gentler for those timid children uncomfortable with brushing.</li>
            <li>It has some sort of clear peel that you peel off and the faceplate sticks to the front part of the toothbrush handle.    </li>
            <li>I have a 9yr old and a 4yr old who both use this toothbrush and it has been a life saver for my 9yr old.</li>
            <li>Philips says the toothbrush is quiet, and it is--but not that much quieter than the Oral-B.    </li>
            <li>We use our adult Sonicare UV sanitizer case to sanitize the kids brush heads as well.</li>
            <li>Our 4 yr old son loves this toothbrush.</li>
            <li>From about 1 yr old or</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re not missing spots when they&#x27;re brushing anymore</li>
            <li>Note however it is not \\&quot;sonic\\&quot; like Philips adult brushes, just mechanical.  </li>
            <li>My 5 yr old son loves brushing his teeth</li>
            <li>I bought this for my seven year old grandaughter.  </li>
            <li>The 3 year old just got his for his birthday because he wanted one just like his brother.</li>
            <li>East to handle even at 3 years old.</li>
            <li>I got this Sonicare toothbrush for my daughters (ages 10 and 7) who have been using an adult Braun Oral B electric toothbrush for almost 2 years now.  </li>
            <li>(it doesn&#x27;t vibrate too much but just enough).</li>
            <li>My 5 year old loves this toothbrush.</li>
            <li>It is possible to share, though, for kids who are are capable of that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>My 4 year old son loves it.</li>
            <li>I have an adult version of Sonicare</li>
            <li>One for our 7 yr old and one for our 4 yr old.</li>
            <li>My 9 year old loves this.  </li>
            <li>Now our whole family have switched from the traditional manual brush to Sonicare series.</li>
            <li>Ordered this for my 7 yr old son.  </li>
            <li>Since we buy replacement heads for our adult toothbrush in bulk at Amazon so they are cheaper, it works out well.</li>
            <li>Purchased this for use for shared use by and 8 and 4 year old.   </li>
            <li>My 8 year old son used to spend all of 15 seconds brushing his teeth.</li>
            <li>We bought this for my 6 year old daughter and she loves it.  </li>
            <li>This toothbrush really helped (although she initially argued that it was \\&quot;wrong\\&quot; and that she had been brushing longer).      </li>
            <li>6 years old girl like it.</li>
            <li>My six year old son has been using this for about 2 months now.  </li>
            <li>My three year old loves</li>
            <li>(well, the 2 year old is a bit young according to the product but he loves it</li>
            <li>By comparison, our Oral B is now four + years old and we have had no issues with its transmission, motor or battery life.</li>
            <li>old son.</li>
            <li>Her parents have tried nearly everything they can think of: stories, songs, videos while brushing, and nothing has worked all that well.  </li>
            <li>Our daughter got this for christmas 2013 when she was 4 years old.</li>
            <li>Wish I could have professionally personalized with their names.</li>
            <li>After a year, so far so good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>it beeps alot, but my 2 yer old loves that hers is like moms.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;ve tossed their old battery-operated brushes, and are all about these.</li>
            <li>Wow, you need to buy this thing.  </li>
            <li>I like this brush even then the adult version.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s gentle enough for kids!</li>
            <li>I had wanted to introduce my 4yr old to an electric toothbrush in order to improve his cavities problem.</li>
            <li>toothbrush works just like the adult ones, though I wish you could turn the volume off and on.</li>
            <li>We bought this for our 8 and 5 year old sons.  </li>
            <li>My son (the 6 year old) even said he created a system to change sides of his mouth when the song changes.</li>
            <li>I bought this brush for my 13year old and</li>
            <li>8.5 than them using their old brushes.</li>
            <li>I have an adult version recommended to me by my dentist years ago</li>
            <li>My 7 and 4 year old kids loves it.</li>
            <li>He may grow into it, or not, but I would suggest you test out an adult vibrating toothbrush on your young child before shelling out the bucks for this one.  </li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t know if the grandkids would use it, but they have surprised me.  </li>
            <li>So far no cavities.</li>
            <li>My 5 year old loves to brush her teeth now.</li>
            <li>My 7 yr old son loves this toothbrush and it has made brushing easier</li>
            <li>I have been using the adult version for about 5 yrs.</li>
            <li>Usually my 8 yr old and the 10 year old</li>
            <li>I used the adult version of those for years with no issues</li>
            <li>We were having some problems getting our 5 year old to brush thoroughly and this solved the issue.</li>
            <li>He is 4 years old.  </li>
            <li>My 5 year old son loves his toothbrush.  </li>
            <li>I also have both the Sonicare FlexCare and FlexCare Plus adult toothbrushes, both of which can use model HX6013 (ProResults) brush heads, and the HX6013 brush heads also work on this kid&#x27;s version.</li>
            <li>They were &#x27;fast&#x27; brushers and this is helping them brush the proper ammount of time.</li>
            <li>We have a 5 and a 9yr old.  </li>
            <li>After a much postponed trip to a dentist for myself and found out that I need LOTS of dental work, I didn&#x27;t want the same for my kids</li>
            <li>The toothbrush works just like the adult version</li>
            <li>The brush heads are sold as two packs for 5yrs old or 7+.  </li>
            <li>My 4.5 year old son uses this by himself and loves it.  </li>
            <li>So I am hoping to get as much use as possible out of this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>9 year old squealed with glee when she saw the toothbrush.  </li>
            <li>So, just remember that the toothbrush will look beat up with old adhesive on faceplate once the sticker comes off.  </li>
            <li>My dad got this for my seven-year old son.  </li>
            <li>I have an adult version for myself</li>
            <li>he has a sensitive mouth,  </li>
            <li>I bought this for my 6 year old and his 3 year old brother.</li>
            <li>so we decided to also get it for our 4.5 yr old son.  </li>
            <li>I purchased this as a stocking-stuffer for my seven year old daughter.</li>
            <li>My 3 year old could not yet.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used the adult Sonicare for 3 years</li>
            <li>have owned an adult sonicare for years and haven&#x27;t had a cavity since I started</li>
            <li>it really does tickle them (I tried it on myself).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I started on low speed</li>
            <li>My daughter just turned 4 years old</li>
            <li>I would but this for an adult as well</li>
            <li>We bought this toothbrush for our six year old son.   </li>
            <li>Contact Philips directly for replacements (under warranty).</li>
            <li>With my 10 yr old granddaughter it went off too fast,so&lt;br /&gt;it chimed 7 or 8 times making her not want to use it.</li>
            <li>My 6 year old grandson wanted an electric toothbrush like his dad&#x27;s.</li>
            <li>well just completely unacceptable.  </li>
            <li>My son loves this brush because it \\&quot;sings\\&quot; and tells him when he&#x27;s halfway there, and then near the end and then at the end.</li>
            <li>- initially we were done really fast - but that got him used to the brush.</li>
            <li>He says it is gentler than the adult version we have.</li>
            <li>My 5-year old daugher loves brushing with this toothbrush.  </li>
            <li>I bought this for my 4 yr old, who has a tendency to skimp on thorough brushings.  </li>
            <li>so they get a complete brushing.</li>
            <li>My wife and I have basically the adult version (Sonicare HealthyWhite HX6711/02) of this product</li>
            <li>The adult version my wife and</li>
            <li>If this problem was fixed, I&#x27;d buy it</li>
            <li>I bought this for my 4 year old daughter for christmas</li>
            <li>The real test, I suppose, will come next month during the boys&#x27; dental checkup.</li>
            <li>We got this for our eight year old.</li>
            <li>If I had one more &#x27;complaint&#x27;, it would be the panels.</li>
            <li>Purchased for my 3 1/2 yr old grandson and he loves it.  </li>
            <li>\\&quot;MY PROFESSIONAL</li>
            <li>This one was purchased for my 4 year old.  </li>
            <li>This toothbrush was bought for my 9 year old.</li>
            <li>(it was identical in size to the adult heads</li>
            <li>I have had my adult Oral B electric toothbrush for over 5 years</li>
            <li>My 5 year old uses this</li>
            <li>My eight year old loves brushing his teeth with this brush.</li>
            <li>so far no problem.</li>
            <li>By the way, I bought it for my 11 years old son and I ended up using it as well.</li>
            <li>Both my 7 &amp; 8 year old sons used to dread brushing their teeth.  </li>
            <li>My children always wanted to try my adult sonicare</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am in my early 70&#x27;s yet</li>
            <li>It send out music tone during stages, My 5 year old granddaughter loves it.  </li>
            <li>It gets the job done and has a shorter run time than an adult version (which we also have for the grown-ups).</li>
            <li>However, our daughter complains that it &amp;#34;beeps too much&amp;#34; and the beeps are fairly loud.</li>
            <li>My 5 year old loves that he has a toothbrush like mom and dad.</li>
            <li>Our Grandson has started losing his baby teeth and adult teeth are now coming in.  </li>
            <li>so far no issues</li>
            <li>Although not recommended for children so young, we use this on our 2 year old daughter.</li>
            <li>I have a 5 and 8 year old.</li>
            <li>We have an 8 yr old and a 3 1/2 yr old.  </li>
            <li>Have been using this with our 3.5 year old upon dentists rec.</li>
            <li>We use the adult Sonicare</li>
            <li>We purchased these toothbrushes for our 5 and 7 year old.  </li>
            <li>We use the lower speed for my 5 year and the faster speed for the 7 year old.</li>
            <li>It helps me keep track of whether they&#x27;ve turned it off early or not.</li>
            <li>My child (7 years old) likes it also.  </li>
            <li>I really don&#x27;t even care about the extra money.</li>
            <li>and I MIGHT have neglected to show her how to turn the thing off early</li>
            <li>may think this is a bit of an expense for a child, but the benefits outweigh the cost by far.  </li>
            <li>So the $90+tax toothbrush becomes a bathroom decoration until we decide if its worth the hassle to RMA it back to Philips if the next one is going to go out on us within a year.  </li>
            <li>The only thing I wish were different is that the colorful front panels are stick-on and I wish they were snap</li>
            <li>Once he got the hang of it, it became kind of a game for him.</li>
            <li>The old model is too mess to clean.  </li>
            <li>Each section (upper left, upper right, lower left and lower right) gets 30 seconds of brushing since every 30 seconds</li>
            <li>Very useful tool for our disabled daughter.  </li>
            <li>If it were better designed for a kid, it&#x27;d be about half as long (or even shorter).</li>
            <li>If you have an older child - my son is eight - you may have a hard time convincing him to use the smaller brush head like I did.</li>
            <li>A little pricey but worth it!</li>
            <li>Small, easy for a child to handle.</li>
            <li>We&#x27;ve used them for my son for a while now, but they only work well when the battery is very new, and the power runs down quickly.</li>
            <li>My son loves it and is becoming such a diligent little tooth brusher.  </li>
            <li>We purchased two Sonicare for Kids Toothbrushes for our children seven months ago in hopes of improving the oral hygiene, especially our 5 year old daughter who had her first cavities last summer.</li>
            <li>Other than that it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li>My 10 year old got this for his one expensive b-day present, and thank goodness he liked it!</li>
            <li>It has a two different power levels (low power for 4+ and high power for 7+ years old), and in both power levels, both the vibration of the handle and the buzzing sound is far less than than my adult FlexCare model.  </li>
            <li>The first time she used it, we think it knocked a tooth loose</li>
            <li>It now only works for the first cycle and stops when it is supposed to beep to let the child know to move on to the next section of teeth.  </li>
            <li>a long-time user of Sonicare electric toothbrushes (I am currently using their FlexCare), this product marks Philips&#x27; first foray into making a similar toothbrush for kids.  </li>
            <li>This added length, weight, and thickness of the brush handle may make it more cumbersome to use for smaller kids or those with small hands.  </li>
            <li>This added length, weight, and thickness of the brush handle may make it more cumbersome to use for smaller kids or those with small hands.  </li>
            <li>ie: shorter for younger child and longer for older child - BOTH</li>
            <li>The brush head comes in 2 sizes, one for older and younger children.  </li>
            <li>operate the brush in the kids mouths and while this brush worked it did a nice job and in a small mouth where I could let the brush do the brush strokes in the harder to reach</li>
            <li>The power (in both modes) and the time (in the low power mode) are ramped up over the first several uses to allow people to get used to it.</li>
            <li>(they come with 3 different colored fronts to peel and stick) and toothbrushing is fun with the sounds that let them know how long to brush for.  </li>
            <li>It comes with different &amp;#34;stickers&amp;#34; to make the handle a different color - my kids have never been interested in this piece of it.</li>
            <li>If your child doesn&#x27;t like a lot of beeps- which are meant to give guidance on how long to brush certain areas of teeth- you might reconsider.</li>
            <li>like the kid-sized brush, which fits his little mouth well, and the adjustable power/speed, though I will say that, for younger kids, it&#x27;s way too easy for them to change the setting/restart, even if you&#x27;re supervising their brushing as instructed.</li>
            <li>Only time will tell but I want to make sure that the faceplate doesn&#x27;t come loose over time since it&#x27;s used in a wet environment.</li>
            <li>This leads me to believe it is overpriced about $50 too high at the current cost.  </li>
            <li>There are also two settings -- low and high --</li>
            <li>I highly recommend especially for a child around 5 years or so.</li>
            <li>My daughters have never brushed for so long, in fact I&#x27;ve often caught them going through two brush cycles because they like the musical sounds and the clean feeling.  </li>
            <li>*2 DIFFERENT sized toothbrush heads:  1 red smaller toothbrush head for children who are UNDER 7yrs old (4-6yrs old) and 1 slightly larger light blue toothbrush head for children who are 7+ yrs old.    </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve definitely become a loyal, lifelong customer</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve definitely become a loyal, lifelong customer</li>
            <li>They are push-on and pull-off brushes and the fit is pretty tight -- much too hard for a 5-yr-old to do by himself.  </li>
            <li>They love the fun tones that play every 30 sec and treat it like a game to get up to the 2 min timer.</li>
            <li>The timer settings to let kids know how long to brush each area of their mouth is also really helpful</li>
            <li>which did not have small tips available.</li>
            <li>works great and the noised to notify time left to brush are neat  not too much power that it is painful.</li>
            <li>She was not good at manual brushing and as many times as I tried to teach her</li>
            <li>The toothbrush functions well and is exactly what I expected though.</li>
            <li>Also the decorative panels (3) are 2 dark blue ones and 1 bright yellow which seems geared towards little boys.</li>
            <li>- Since brush heads are geared for different ages, perhaps the boxes would be packed with heads geared only for a certain age range.  </li>
            <li>After watching his sister getting brushed with the sonicare, he walked right up and popped his mouth open to be brushed too, and that has continued ever since!</li>
            <li>My kids each took some time to get used to the vibration intensity (even though it has two settings, one for 4 and older and the other for 7 and older)</li>
            <li>I thought that would get annoying at first and was ready to spend the extra cash for another, but its been super easy just changing out the heads that I wont need to.</li>
            <li>They like the musical tones that tell them to switch to a new brushing area (top,inside,bottom,inside).  </li>
            <li>does it several times a day as a result of the new toothbrush...</li>
            <li>almost threw ours out but decided to discharge it as above &amp; they again work like new.</li>
            <li>The last thing I am going to do is buy a NEW one after the &amp;#34;old&amp;#34; one broke after 2 months of use.</li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t last as long as the first one.  </li>
            <li>This toothbrush has two power modes for different ages, reducing the chance that the toothbrush injures young gums and teeth; a rubber over-mold on the brush also helps reduce the risk of damage to young teeth and gums.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I was surprised at the adult size of the handle, especially for a 4 y.o.&#x27;s  use.</li>
            <li>But, they don&#x27;t use the timer consistently and two minutes is a long time for a child (especially if they&#x27;re thinking about doing something else).  </li>
            <li>br /&gt;It has a low setting for smaller kids that is not as intense, but still cleans her teeth</li>
            <li>An adult usIng a toothbrush designed for a child or younger adult?</li>
            <li>The low setting is gentle enough.</li>
            <li>I debated on ordering such a high end toothbrush for my 4 year old, but after what he went through at his last dentist visit (Dr. found a cavity on his front tooth)</li>
            <li>And, for the very young, even the low power mode can be off-putting in their mouths.</li>
            <li>tells when she has brushed long enough and bedtime seemed to be fun.</li>
            <li>Another parent sitting next to me when we were discussing this actually had the same exact issue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s compact for little hands, easy to use, and the musical chime ensures a proper 2-minute brushing.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s compact for little hands, easy to use, and the musical chime ensures a proper 2-minute brushing.</li>
            <li>The 5 year old uses the low power mode and has the smaller brush designed for younger kids and the older one use the bigger brush and high power.</li>
            <li>There is just no other product out there that leaves your teeth feeling as slick and clean as a Sonicare.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s little noises, it&#x27;s made brushing his teeth not just &amp;#34;part of the routine&amp;#34; but actually fun.</li>
            <li>I wish you could choose either two brush heads for older children (basically identical to the regular brush head) or two brush heads for younger children.</li>
            <li>and the head is nice and small and fits in her little mouth</li>
            <li>I am glad I spent the little extra for the Sonicare!</li>
            <li>And it has a little kids and big kids setting and brush, which is really useful because i have a 2 year old brother.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not sure whether it&#x27;s the buzzy tickling sensation or the musical tones, but it&#x27;s made the whole routine much more tolerable for one little girl.  </li>
            <li>Overall, I agree with the other positive reviews but wanted to add two unexpected issues.  </li>
            <li>it).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I removed one star from this review, because, in my observations, it seems the handle isn&#x27;t MUCH smaller than adult size models, and the littlest grandkid just made it, when it came to holding the handle.</li>
            <li>We&#x27;ve gone through two of these so far and the second just stopped working.</li>
            <li>It has two modes to work him up to the 2 minute mark, and loud sounds to let him know to switch to a different quadrant of his mouth.</li>
            <li>Back to the trusty old Oral B for us.</li>
            <li>We use it on both our 3 year old daughter and our 2 year old boy (red head for the girl, blue for the boy).</li>
            <li>The 2 year warranty is the same as the adult versions.</li>
            <li>Both boys brush regularly, but obviously were missing something important.</li>
            <li>My 4 years old loves it and it has music on 30 second intervals.  </li>
            <li>The only thing is you have to buy adult brushes...</li>
            <li>They all have the same half-circle hole inside the brush head that slides onto the half-circle stem on the adult FlexCare or Kids brush.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Without having any of the three supplied faceplates mounted on it, it weighs the same 4.8 ounces as my adult model; once the faceplate is mounted onto the brush, its 5.0 ounce weight is actually heavier than my adult model.  </li>
            <li>The faceplate is mounted to the toothbrush by way of a very sticky adhesive backing, so I do not really think of it as being \\&quot;interchangeable\\&quot; as advertised.  </li>

            <li>I got his as a gift for my grandkids, especially the 7 yr old boy who Hates to brush.&lt;br /&gt;He</li>
            <li>This toothbrush has been helpful in getting my 4 year old, who doesn&#x27;t like to brush, to actually get it done.  </li>
            <li>To prevent this, remove the brush head after each use, rinse the main unit and inside the brush head and let them both sit apart till they dry.</li>
            <li>it works same as adult electric toothbrushes.</li>
            <li>Shipping was on time actually a day or two early.</li>
            <li>The only thing I don&#x27;t like is that it did not come with a travel case like the adult versions do.</li>
            <li>He is five years old next month.</li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t get my 5 year old son to brush longer than about 30 seconds with a regular toothbrush without a struggle.</li>
            <li>I use this brush for my two kids, the big brush head for my 11 year old and the smaller one for my 5 year old.  </li>
            <li>my two yr old tolerates it enough for me to just do the moving through the zones.</li>
            <li>Used by our seven year old, prior to this automatic brush her mom and</li>
            <li>Otherwise the outside part of upper teeth won&#x27;t be brushed very well.</li>
            <li>Though it&#x27;s not cheap, it was well worth the purchase.</li>
            <li>We had tried the cheaper oral-B electric toothbrushes and though the kids liked the characters on them, the brush heads were so bulky that it was difficult to get on the cheek side of the teeth and the quality of brushing doesn&#x27;t even begin to compare to the sonicare.</li>
            <li>The brushes are kind of expensive.</li>
            <li>The timer is really great, it slowly build on the time of each previous brushing, it chimes when it&#x27;s time to move from the upper outside to the inner outside,</li>
            <li>My 5 year old could use this properly right away with very little direction.  </li>
            <li>(w/ new brush heads of course) for a younger sibling since the current price point is around 70.</li>
            <li>kids came down with strep throat shortly after I replaced them, and I really didn&#x27;t want to throw the new brushes away.  </li>
            <li>Everyone loves the usability and I love the fact that its easy to drop on its base so that its charged every time you need to use it.  </li>
            <li>After about a month, there is at least a 80% reduction in the stain and more importantly no new ones.  </li>
            <li>She loves her new toothbrush and we no longer have to fight with our eldest about how long she has to brush because the timer is built in.  </li>
            <li>I have two separate heads for ours and use it on both my 4 yr old and 2 yr old without a single tear.  </li>
            <li>She was somewhat surprised at how long two minutes really is, although I would constantly nag her that she hadn&#x27;t brushed anywhere near that long.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s the tones it makes while it&#x27;s operating or the smaller kid friendly design, but she loves it.  </li>
            <li>Our older child needed the larger one, and our younger child the smaller one.</li>
            <li>I bought this for my 3 year old - who has always been very cooperative when it comes to brushing his teeth - and I noticed within just a few days of using it that there was a considerable amount of plaque/residue left on his teeth after brushing.</li>
            <li>There are various suppliers of after-market skins and covers for personal electronics, but I doubt that there is a high enough of a demand for personalizing electric toothbrush handles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>There are various suppliers of after-market skins and covers for personal electronics, but I doubt that there is a high enough of a demand for personalizing electric toothbrush handles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>In today&#x27;s electronic world, I think kids are always excited for electronic type devices, at least my boys are.  </li>
            <li>This seems a dead giveaway that Philips simply slapped a pretty paint job on one of its adult models, added some kid-friendly sounds, and called it a kid&#x27;s toothbrush.    </li>
            <li>This \\&quot;Sonicare for Kids\\&quot; is heavier and bulkier than the adult Sonicare models and the added weight and bulk are undoubtedly due to the rubbery non-slip grip that completely wraps around the handle (which the adult models lack), but you would think that a \\&quot;Kids\\&quot; toothbrush would be smaller and lighter in weight.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li>This is about 30% cheaper than the regular adult version, but it works just the same.</li>
            <li>(If anyone from Philips reads this: I want my next adult Sonicare to have the same non-slip grip with knobby bumps, horizontal brush rest, and lower noise level too!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It also has the same drawbacks as all Sonicare products, namely it&#x27;s pricey (though not as $$$ as the adult models), especially when you&#x27;re talking about something for a youngster.</li>
            <li>Makes you hesitant to buy the more expensive adult products.  </li>
            <li>However, my son values the tooth brush more, so he takes brushing teeth very serious now.</li>
            <li>First switch would often not engage, then the typical internal shafts breakage occurred.</li>
            <li>, i have the adult sonic care and wish they made soft headed brushes (the red/blue part) because it doesnt hurt if we hit his other teeth with it on mistake while brushing the bottom.</li>
            <li>So far no objection from my ultra sensitive autistic boy who could not tolerate the adult version of Philips sonic toothbrush.</li>
            <li>It vibrates instead of rotates, as the Oral-B does, and if I don&#x27;t press the brushhead to the teeth pretty firmly, it tickles his gums.</li>
            <li>The first few times he used it I had to help him</li>
            <li>Our dentist encouraged us to get this nice toothbrush for our daughter because her baby teeth are ridged and needed extra scrubbing care that is difficult to get with a regular toothbrush.</li>
            <li>advice is to focus on the molars in kids mainly as those last until 10 years old before falling out, whereas the front ones fall out early so even a small cavity isn&#x27;t that big of a deal.</li>
            <li>They stay on via an adhesive strip so if my children want to swap one color for another I have to peel the old one off with no apparent way to get it back on if they want to go back to that color.</li>
            <li>The dentist was shocked at the state of his teeth, since he&#x27;s never had a cavity and generally does a really good job brushing.</li>
            <li>This toothbrush works fine, but went dead after less than two years.  </li>
            <li>Hopefully they&#x27;ll spend a few more minutes brushing than in the past since this has a built in timer.</li>
            <li>We have been a Sonicare family for a long time...using the regular adult version with a different color coded brush head for everyone.  </li>
            <li>It is broken right after a year of normal use.  </li>
            <li>And you want to do it fast to make it easier on you and your little one.  </li>
            <li>The little incremental noises let him know how much longer he needs to brush and when brush time is over.</li>
            <li>I originally had a hard time getting him to want to brush his teeth but after using this he loves it!</li>
            <li>The new replacement is working, but if it fails again they only warranty for 2 years total including the time period using the original brush.  </li>
            <li>Specially because the speed of this little toothbrush is much less than the ones for adults.</li>

            <li> maybe my kids aren&#x27;t really brushing their teeth, LOL!!!</li>
            <li> From my own experience, I know that it is getting her teeth even cleaner.  </li>
            <li> Nice brush system for kids.</li>
            <li> This is a nice feature if it becomes a hand-me-down</li>
            <li> This looks nice but there is a problem.  </li>
            <li> I had to get him his own Sonicare.  </li>
            <li> Just in case someone is wondering, I am not an employee of Oral B nor its subsidiaries nor do I own stocks in the company.  </li>
            <li> and they are up there on their own brushing their teeth.  </li>
            <li> Having had great checkups after using my own Sonicare, I immediately picked up the Kids Sonicare model when it became available.</li>
            <li> It helps to remind them to brush all areas and they liked picking out their own decorative panel from the 3 provided.</li>
            <li> kid\\&quot; one on my own teeth.</li>

            <li> இ Fuzzy Wuzzy&#x27;s Summary:&lt;br /&gt;ѾѾѾѾ Recommended with warm fuzzies.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Once you pry off the glued-on faceplate, to reuse it again, you would have to supply your own adhesive to reattach it to the brush.  </li>
            <li> Once you pry off the glued-on faceplate, to reuse it again, you would have to supply your own adhesive to reattach it to the brush.  </li>
            <li> My husband and I both use Sonicare for our own toothbrushes, and have for years, and thought we&#x27;d give this a try for our son.</li>
            <li> So, it&#x27;s just kind of tacky and unstable.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Well designed, works perfectly and the acoustic signals guide the children very well when brushing the teeth.</li>
            <li> She also liked picking which decorating plate to put on the front of the toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> She would do and say anything to get out of brushing even put herself on time out lmao.</li>
            <li> Good toothbrush for a guy as well as kids - more rugged.</li>
            <li> He is thrilled with this toothbrush and uses it every day.</li>
            <li> Also, it&#x27;s nice having the interval timer</li>
            <li> On time delivery, great price, my kids (5 &amp; 8) love them.  </li>
            <li> The grandchildren liked our Sonicare toothbrushes</li>
            <li> so I thought I&#x27;d get them their own.  </li>
            <li> She missed the vibration though and we have our own sonicare toothbrush</li>
            <li> /&gt;She likes that you can take the face off and select on of a couple designs to make it like your own setup.</li>
            <li> He can even manage on his own whilst I supervise.</li>
            <li> Thanks for the wonderful item!</li>
            <li> I let them brush their own teeth in the morning and they seem to have no problems.</li>
            <li> Loving my own sonic toothbrush, I wanted one for my child.  </li>
            <li> asking what kind of toothbrush my kids were using.  </li>
            <li> My boy is loving bruhing his teeth now.  </li>
            <li> She even enjoys (ineffectively) brushing her own teeth with it.  </li>
            <li> If we didn&#x27;t plan on using the 4+ one I probably wouldn&#x27;t have liked this, however, we made the choice to go ahead and let her do it too.  </li>
            <li> Nice kids toothbrush, recommended by my son&#x27;s dentist.</li>
            <li> He&#x27;s loving it and feels like a grown up.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s perfect for a 6 year old!!!  </li>
            <li> Originally I gave this brush 5 stars, I loved how it worked, my son loved using it</li>
            <li> /&gt;These are great and worth EVERY PENNY!</li>
            <li> But now he is happy to let me brush his teeth, and excited to try it out himself.  </li>
            <li> Well worth the money!!!</li>
            <li> Loved it, child friendly!</li>
            <li> It also seems to be doing a great job keeping his teeth clean.  </li>
            <li> It works great and the music to indicate switching to a new area is great.  </li>
            <li> An easy way to get kids to brush their teeth while knowing that it their teeth will be clean too!!!</li>
            <li> And that&#x27;s when I&#x27;m doing the brushing--he&#x27;s still not that adept at brushing his own teeth, so I still do most of the brushing.</li>
            <li> Have seen a lot of improvement in his teeth and his dentist is super happy with the results.</li>
            <li> on/off button is very easy to operate for both of our children.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Very easy to use and music</li>
            <li> We love them, but the heads are more than $7 each!  </li>
            <li> Our children needed more than our standing over them and telling them to brush more, brush longer!  </li>
            <li> I am very happy that he could get his mouth so clean and fresh.  </li>
            <li> she absolutely loves this toothbrush it cleans her teeths very good</li>
            <li> To be honest, manual brushing and manual brushes are cheaper, cheaper to replace, and do a better job.</li>
            <li> My four year old can handle this toothbrush wonderful.</li>
            <li> I have the adult version of the Sonicare and have been very happy with it.  </li>
            <li> The timing buzzer is a nice feature, reminding her to brush all 4 quadrants for the appropriate amount of time.</li>
            <li> Except for that problem, think it does a good job cleaning my daughter&#x27;s teeth and sound effects get her to brush longer.</li>
            <li> The kids also enjoyed picking out their own interchangeable face plate.</li>
            <li> It came with a set of brushes, one for 7years and up, one for 4 years old, so it was a perfect set for my 8yo and 5yo.</li>
            <li> Loves being able to brush his teeth on his own.  </li>
            <li> and it does a great job well worth the purchase</li>
            <li> This toothbrush is great fun for my daughter.  </li>
            <li> I love that after about a week of instructing her, she now can effectively brush her teeth</li>
            <li> own and love my Philips Sonicare toothbrushes, and this one doesn&#x27;t disappoint either&lt;</li>
            <li> Well this design is perfect for any adult.  </li>
            <li> Quality is great and worth the price.  </li>
            <li> kids do great and like them and rarely here any complaints when time to brush.</li>
            <li> Brushing teeth made easy!</li>
            <li> easy and quicker teeth-brushing experience every night!</li>
            <li> my kids love this toothbrush and I love knowing that it helps them achieve better brushings!</li>
            <li> As kids got older they wanted to brush themselves but weren&#x27;t very good at it.</li>
            <li> The functionality is very good and the musical chimes keep them in a good pattern.    </li>
            <li> Our kids (2 and 4 year old) love brushing their teeth with it and it has an awesome built in function that teaches them to brush their teeth longer without them even noticing it.</li>
            <li> Great toothbrush Kids love it worth the money.</li>
            <li> far we have been very happy with our purchase and the kids love them.</li>
            <li> and it is amazing how clean this sonicare gets your teeth!  </li>
            <li> What a surprising product--to have a child who wouldn&#x27;t brush his teeth more than 30 seconds is incredible; now he waits until he hears the musical notes after brushing each section &amp; the longer tune at the end to then know he&#x27;s done--as it automatically builds up to 2 minutes!  </li>
            <li> The colorful design along with the perfect ergonomics and of course the musical changing pacer / timer makes it a great addition to the bathroom for the children.</li>
            <li> This is very important piece of information.</li>
            <li> Iits a nice size and easy for kids to operate..  </li>
            <li> Or, get a drool cup  :-)  </li>
            <li> Love the product.  </li>

            <li> The toothbrush does work up more foam/spit than a manual or spinning toothbrush, so we just have our son stand on a stool over the bathroom sink.  </li>
            <li> and they&#x27;re able to brush by themselves.  </li>
            <li> More plaque</li>
            <li> What more could you want than for a child to want to brush their teeth.</li>
            <li> They use them and do wait for the congratulatory tune at the end of 2 minutes of brushing, well most of the time.</li>
            <li> My child love it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using a Sonicare for a number of years and LOVE it</li>
            <li> The two different size brushes were perfect for my 8 &amp; 6 year olds.  </li>
            <li> I would NOT recommend this for anyone using it for more than one child.</li>
            <li> my son loves it and he even tells me that this  toothbrush does a better job.   </li>
            <li> it has CUTE music to let my son   know the amount of time to brush every section.</li>
            <li> The kids love it --</li>
            <li> One charge lasts more than 2 weeks.</li>
            <li> I love the size of the brush head</li>
            <li> And all my checkups have been outstanding.</li>
            <li> Love the beeping cycles that are timed.</li>
            <li> - Wave shaped brush heads seemed more efficient at cleaning the teeth.  </li>
            <li> Perhaps magnets would work better.  </li>
            <li> I did purchase the Philips kids sonicare after contemplating the purchase for some time, and I am glad I did.  </li>
            <li> We are TOTALLY pleased with this toothbrush.</li>
            <li> /o, 8y/o, love using their toothbrushes.  </li>
            <li> They had no problem using the Oral B, but I thought they&#x27;d like the timer, cute colors</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t matter how cute it is if you kids</li>
            <li> Ive had an oral b tooth brush for years that I love, so I knew I&#x27;d like this product for my son.  </li>
            <li> (for example, moving from brushing the outer surface of bottom teeth to the top surface of the bottom teeth).  </li>
            <li> That aside, the brush takes no effort to work way more effectivley then a manual method.  </li>
            <li> It makes teeth brushing easier and more efficient.</li>
            <li> The two minute mode for \\&quot;more experienced\\&quot; brushers plays a note every 30 seconds.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Their brushing is much, much better using this brush.   </li>
            <li> We use it twice every night and we&#x27;re certainly glad we purchased it.</li>
            <li> I have been using an Orab B electric brush for the last 15 years and they are all awesome</li>
            <li> Love these sonicare brushes.  </li>
            <li> So I was pleased to be able to try this model out and see how my daughter would like it, and whether it would encourage \\&quot;longer\\&quot; brushing.     </li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure if my son would like it.  </li>
            <li> Just a person who has used both products and find the Oral B a bit more robust given it has lasted over eight times longer.</li>
            <li> I have enjoyed using this with my two girls, 3 and 4.</li>
            <li> I love the timing feature.</li>
            <li> The girls are enjoying brushing</li>
            <li> and I hope for an excellent visit to the dentist next time.</li>
            <li> He said that it does a better job than manual brushing and works for kids under two.  </li>
            <li> So glad I bought it for her.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s been 100x better since getting this toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> Now we just purchase the appropriate sized refills.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Enjoy!</li>
            <li> And I love it, too.</li>
            <li> She is 7, so I&#x27;m glad that we can trust her to brush her teeth and know that they&#x27;re all being reached.  </li>
            <li> You&#x27;d better see it yourself after you get this toothbrush, which comes with both the 4-7 and 7-10 sizes.</li>
            <li> but she has been getting better after we bought this brush 6</li>
            <li> No complaints from my dentist at my latest checkup...</li>
            <li> Safe if you have veneers, implants, etc.</li>
            <li> Kids love them.</li>
            <li> The changeable plates on front help if you have more that one child.</li>
            <li> We really enjoyed this electric toothbrush.</li>
            <li> This toothbrush does a much better job than a regular/manual one.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s encouraged my child to brush their teeth more often and for longer periods.</li>
            <li> We really love the 2 minute shut off feature and alarm every 30 seconds to change locations.</li>
            <li> but they refuse to use it, even on the most gentile setting.</li>
            <li> My child&#x27;s dentist was also pleased when I told him I made the purchase.</li>
            <li> This seems to do a better job and more importantly gets them brushing morning and before bed!</li>
            <li> and I think I&#x27;ve gotten more used to it over time.</li>
            <li> time.&lt;br /&gt;Because the electric century adjustable, it is a better product.</li>
            <li> I was getting concerned with how many teeth</li>
            <li> The kids and the parents love them.</li>
            <li> Plan to buy 2 more for my oldest son&#x27;s boys.</li>
            <li> I love this toothbrush.</li>
            <li> I love my sonicare so decided to get one for my son.</li>
            <li> The timer makes sure that he brushes the recommended period of time.</li>
            <li> He love the &amp;#34;your done&amp;#34; tune.</li>
            <li> Miles better than your disposable electric toothbrush you find at Wal-Mart.  </li>
            <li> Both of my two sons love to using it .</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s been okay</li>
            <li> Purchased this for my Kids and it has been better for them too.</li>
            <li> He also was able to customize his toothbrush by choosing his face plate.</li>
            <li> They love it</li>
            <li> I have a sonicare myself that I love, so I thought I would get him the one made for kids.</li>
            <li> Overall, the unit is of excellent design and quality.&lt;br</li>
            <li> and everyone is satisfied.  </li>
            <li> The set was perfect for my family because it comes with 2 different sized brush heads.  </li>
            <li> What we love about this:  The boys like that</li>
            <li> and she uses the smaller one and is perfect.</li>
            <li> With so many vibrating kids toothbrushes on the market for under $10, I question who would pay this much?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> They, and their parents love them.</li>
            <li> Think it makes them feel more grown up since they have a toothbrush like mom and dad now.  </li>
            <li> likes it a lot better than the &amp;#34;cute&amp;#34</li>
            <li> The age appropriate brushes are a plus.</li>
            <li> I called Philips and gave them appropriate information</li>
            <li> I love Sonicare.  </li>
            <li> I love the built in timer.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;d like to love this product</li>
            <li> If you don&#x27;t like it or you think your child won&#x27;t love it this toothbrush not for you.&lt;br /&gt;There are lots of satisfied customer</li>
            <li> It seems most of them are okay with the vibration some of them aren&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> Perhaps a calculated move on Sonicare&#x27;s part to sell more front plate</li>
            <li> ) Cute kids colors and interchangeable face plate.  </li>
            <li> The charger could be better constructed.  </li>
            <li> I love that it is rechargeable</li>
            <li> It has 2 speeds which is perfect for the younger ones.</li>
            <li> and I feel that it works so much better than the $5 kid brushes you can buy at the store.</li>
            <li> look cute.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m so glad we did.  </li>
            <li> so I am confident he is too.</li>
            <li> It cleans her teeth very well, doc is happy with them too.</li>
            <li> My dentist said it was ok to use on my 2 and 3 year olds.</li>
            <li> I love Sonicare for adults.  </li>
            <li> Love the music notification to change areas and to notify completion.</li>
            <li> Using the &amp;#34;regular&amp;#34; toothbrush was not an enjoyable experience for me or my son.</li>
            <li> Love this toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> :)  </li>
            <li> My kids love it, use it regularlly.  </li>
            <li> My daughter loves the toothbrush and I love the timer in it.  </li>
            <li> this toothbrush has made a difference in brushing habits and teeth are cleaner, better check-up-</li>
            <li> Love this product</li>
            <li> This is fabulous!</li>
            <li> My kids teeth are definitely in better shape.</li>
            <li> love it</li>
            <li> finishing with a grand finale of music when they are all done.</li>
            <li> So I was sure that I needed my son to be using one as well...</li>
            <li> I love Sonicare products and have been using them for many years.  </li>
            <li> sure what is going on Sonicare.  </li>
            <li> really glad we purchased these.  </li>
            <li> My kids love brushing their teeth and that has NEVER been the case in our household.</li>
            <li> We love the chime that reminds you to switch spots and the automatic timer that keeps them brushing until time runs out.</li>
            <li> By flossing and using this toothbrush, you&#x27;ll be doing what most dentists&#x27; kids are doing and safeguarding them from cavities.</li>
            <li> My kids are 10 and 8 and they LOVE these tooth brushes.</li>
            <li> Definetly makes brushing time more desireable &amp; enjoyable.</li>
            <li> Makes brushing more palatable for her</li>
            <li> I like that this toothbrush does most of the work</li>
            <li> My son is much better about brushing his teeth</li>
            <li> My kids have had many battery operated toothbrushes that die in a couple months.  </li>
            <li> They love the sonic toothbrush.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> My kids LIKE to brush their teeth and remain cavity free!</li>
            <li> You could get 4 disposable spinbrushes for that amount (although I think the Sonicare cleans better).</li>
            <li> The dentist was very proud of him on his last checkup.  </li>
            <li> my son should use the same and it is the best.  </li>
            <li> My daughter didn&#x27;t like this, but I&#x27;m using it and love it.  </li>
            <li> Better dental check ups.  </li>
            <li> okay.  </li>
            <li> Kids love to use it nothing more to say how many times do I have to do this for you</li>
            <li> I purchased this tooth brush for my grand as a Christmas gift and both she and her parents absolutely love it.</li>
            <li> Great gift at a reasonable price.</li>
            <li> That is why we love it</li>
            <li> Love this toothbrush.</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m wondering if he would do better with a circle/round bristle head electronic brush.  </li>
            <li> The brushes work much better for my kids than manual toothbrushes.</li>
            <li> However, their teeth are getting brighter and two minutes on the Sonicare is better than the four or five they were spending with a manual brush.</li>
            <li> Love the brush.</li>
            <li> Cleaner results and better office visits.</li>
            <li> Love that there is a timer</li>
            <li> Once they got this one the love to brush their teeth.  </li>
            <li> kids love them.</li>
            <li> This is an awesome tooth brush for children becuase it has a 2 timer with 30 second intervals.  </li>
            <li> bought these brushes for my grandchildren, youngest being 3, and they all love them.  </li>
            <li> I rate it as 5 stars because I am pleased with it.&lt;br</li>
            <li> tried using it again when she was 5, and she was more receptive to it.</li>
            <li> They love them.  </li>
            <li> Even better priced than walmart.</li>
            <li> LOVE the timer feature and love</li>
            <li> It is more convenient and save me more time.</li>
            <li> Recommend this to your lovely kid.</li>
            <li> It makes her want to brush more.</li>
            <li> He used to brush his teeth at lease once a day (most of the times twice a day) and also floss every night without any exception.&lt;br /&gt;But</li>
            <li> I am so satisfied with this toothbrush.</li>
            <li> We are a family of Sonicare and love what it does to our teeth...</li>
            <li> We love this for our child.</li>
            <li> They LOVE it..  </li>
            <li> My kids love it.</li>
            <li> Expect that to stop the more they use it.</li>
            <li> do not hesitate, your kids will love them......</li>
            <li> It took him a while to get used to this, but he is better off using this instead of a manual brush.  </li>
            <li> I love the noise notification every 15 seconds.</li>
            <li> We LOVE this toothbrush!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Outside of that, perfect brush!</li>
            <li> The HX6311/02 comes with interchangeable plates the kids love switching</li>
            <li> my dentist recommended this for my children and they love their tooth brushes.</li>
            <li> Fantastic product!  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know :)</li>
            <li> so it forces her to brush for the entire 2 minutes which is great!</li>
            <li> Its a great buy, I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> /&gt;Update: They replaced it for free!  </li>
            <li> My kids love brushing with this electric toothbrush.</li>
            <li> But once you get them used to it, the kids will love it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> It help your child clean better!</li>
            <li> They were excited to have their own and one that&#x27;s more geared toward kids, which perhaps helps with solidifying the brushing habit.  </li>
            <li> My five year old son loved this!</li>
            <li> This works perfectly because it is gentler for little ones, yet still cleans great quickly.  </li>
            <li> The timer is great because we have bought timers for she and her older sister before to get them to brush for two minutes with their manual brushes.  </li>
            <li> You should be able to buy new brush heads and keep on charging for quite some time, but our luck hasn&#x27;t been great with the kid&#x27;s versions.</li>
            <li> I love that it does a great job cleaning my son&#x27;s teeth and the two minute timer beeps when it is time to move the brush to move the brush to a new quadrant.</li>
            <li> I can agree that I have seen significant stain removal after a week of using the brush, and it is a great investment for anyone who is interested in whitening their teeth.</li>
            <li> I am sure the novelty will wear off, but for now I think its more exciting for them that they have their own rechargeable electric toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> Cleans her teeth pretty good.</li>
            <li> I honestly don&#x27;t find this brush to be significantly different than the Sonicare I already own, which is a good thing.  </li>
            <li> the best part is that it tells the kids know how long to brush and when to stop..</li>
            <li> My kids love it and super easy to use and so cute!</li>
            <li> Great for kids, easy to use if used properly really ensures clean teeth!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m hoping getting my child started right will make dental care simpler and more effective for her--so far so good!</li>
            <li> I returned to Target and happily exchanged for a new one.  </li>
            <li> The ramp up speed is great for them to get used to this new way of brushing.  </li>
            <li> And there is an easy recharging bay which he was able to set up himself.  </li>
            <li> The timer and tunes makes it easy to pace brushing time on all surfaces and entertaining for her too.</li>
            <li> Before this was buying and electric toothbrush at $4 every 3 or 4 weeks, but this toothbrush fits in her mouth better and bristles don&#x27;t wear out so easily</li>
            <li> It is really easy to use, I love the time factor.</li>
            <li> My kids love it; its easy to use</li>
            <li> like I said, it made brushing time easy and enjoyable, so</li>
            <li> like my review title says i love this toothbrush i bought this for my 7 year old son i no longer need to remind him to brush his teeth as soon as his feet hit the floor he is brushing and the timer is great</li>
            <li> The &#x27;age&#x27;appropriate heads make this toothbrush the best money I spent in years.  </li>
            <li> loved it, good present as well ..</li>
            <li> There are two brushing modes that allow for gentler brushing for the young ones and the two head sizes available are ideal for growing mouths, too.</li>
            <li> There are two brushing modes that allow for gentler brushing for the young ones and the two head sizes available are ideal for growing mouths, too.</li>
            <li> I love my grand children but didn&#x27;t enjoy brushing their teeth for them when caring for them!&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li> We figured it would be good to invest in good toothbrushes after going through several the \\&quot;disposable\\&quot; spin brush styles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The color of the toothbrush is vivid and attractive.</li>
            <li> I am so happy with this purchase and plan on getting an adult version for myself!</li>
            <li> This has the right timer, is soft and perfect for he duration the brush needs to be done.</li>
            <li> This is perfect because it is easy to use and will remain charged for a long period of time.  </li>
            <li> Your teeth will feel dentist clean!  </li>
            <li> I think they are great- very effective and worth the cost in the long run.  </li>
            <li> The best part is that now I don&#x27;t have to tell them to clean the brushes (like in the non-electric) ones after brushing as a simple swipe (while its still vibrating) in the water from the tap</li>
            <li> Overall, very good.</li>
            <li> Here&#x27;s what he has to say: &amp;#34;It works so good, and the time - two minutes - is just right to make your teeth feel clean.</li>
            <li> /&gt;As most parents know, getting your child to brush can be a huge chore.  </li>
            <li> Time will tell how they hold up, but they have been great for my boys so far.  </li>
            <li> All in all a great experience so far</li>
            <li> This electric toothbrush has been great at helping my kids to brush better and more independently.</li>
            <li> old son after reading all the great reviews.</li>
            <li> Great product mirroring what my wife and I get from the adult versions.</li>
            <li> With a manual brush, my 4 year old would brush for anout 30 seconds and say he did a great job brushing his teeth.</li>
            <li> I bought one a month ago for my 4 year old and it&#x27;s been great.  </li>
            <li> Brushing everywhere though strengthens the gums which is healthy and important too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Last</li>
            <li> This was a great purchase for my 8 year old son, he loves it</li>
            <li> This is a great buy for my 11 year old son.  </li>
            <li> The adult Sonicare is great too.</li>
            <li> Timer is ideal as it beeps ever 30 seconds for a total time of two minutes.  </li>
            <li> The brush does an excellent job, requiring minimal effort from the child.</li>

            <li> Months Later-&lt;br /&gt;Still going strong.</li>
            <li> and she strongly prefers the Sonicare.</li>
            <li> It is not too strong for him.  </li>
            <li> I think because the vibration is strong however I always choose the lowest level.</li>
            <li> (Making a choice and sticking to it is not any preschooler&#x27;s strong point.)</li>
            <li> I strongly recommend these for kids.</li>
            <li> Almost two years and still working strong.</li>
            <li> It is still going strong.</li>
            <li> It highly encourages longer brushing time and that is good.</li>
            <li> My kids teeth are getting whiter by the day and they are able to brush by them self (age 5 and 7) for the right amount of time (because has a timer!)</li>
            <li> All of these are great improvements, not just for child usage, but also for an electric toothbrush in general.  </li>
            <li> beauty of the Philips Sonicare is that the timer makes sure that they do brush for 2 full minutes</li>
            <li> for our 6 year old - and he&#x27;s LOVING brushing his teeth now!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s cool and cute, and cleans well (I think).</li>
            <li> We have the adult versions and the 2 kids successfully share one of these.  </li>
            <li> The kids brush takes this wonderful brush down to the kids level.  </li>
            <li> The seven-year-old is doing fine with it, and he uses the \\&quot;left\\&quot; side for a gentler brushing.  </li>
            <li> This toothbrush costs less than a visit to the dentist here in Singapore and is an excellent investment!</li>
            <li> Otherwise a perfectly fine toothbrush</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, this is another fine high-quality brush from Philips.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, this is another fine high-quality brush from Philips.  </li>
            <li> Both of my kids CAN hold it just fine</li>
            <li> This suited me fine because I had a 5 and 7yr</li>
            <li> It brushes fine.</li>
            <li> They get a clean feeling after using their tooth brush and I feel happy that this product is doing a better job than a regular tooth brush.  </li>
            <li> The best part about the brush is that it keeps them bushing for the appropriate amount of time, and ends the brushing cycle with a gentle kid friendly tone (I kind of like it better than some of the adult models, which simply stops - no</li>
            <li> It comes with two brushes so makes it even more economical if you have two children or two adults using it.&lt;br /&gt;Reccommend to anyone who wants better check ups at their dentist!</li>
            <li> Having a toothbrush that your child likes is a huge help in overcoming this problem.  </li>
            <li> We have noticed a huge improvement since we bought him this toothbrush.</li>
            <li> I never had a huge struggle with the kids about brushing, but they were a bit too lax on the length of brushing and the quality of the scrubbing.    </li>
            <li> We are a huge sonic care family.  </li>

            <li> Thomas the Train spinning toothbrush with alcohol free mouthwash     </li>
            <li> The beeping is great to remind him to move it to different quadrants in his mouth.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Another great feature is the three included different faceplates so that a user may personalize the toothbrush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Since she is the only one that will use this toothbrush, it would have been great to get two of the toothbrush heads she would use.</li>
            <li> wants one of his own.</li>
            <li> I filled out a rebate form and mailed it.</li>
            <li> My kids appear to really enjoy using the product.  </li>
            <li> so how can you make it more exciting.  </li>
            <li> This brush has allowed her to brush effectively without *much* intervention by us.  </li>
            <li> Love this product and well worth it.</li>
            <li> They enjoy this Sonicare and use without and prompting from me!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s worth not having the &amp;#34;Brush Your Teeth Battle!&amp;#34;  :)</li>
            <li> If you have sonic are toothbrushes you&#x27;ll know that they are great - same applies to the kids version.  </li>
            <li> he could get used to the sound it makes to let you know to change sections of his mouth.</li>
            <li> He moves it over his teeth in one section of his mouth until the sound lets him know the change.</li>
            <li> The 30 second timer on each quadrant of the mouth works great for him.  </li>
            <li> I bought 2 cheap electric teeth brush and they wore out.</li>
            <li> It does a great job of keeping a charge, we probably only recharge once every two months.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s got all of their advanced features in terms of the guts of the brush</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s got all of their advanced features in terms of the guts of the brush</li>
            <li> great for kids because it chimes  when it&#x27;s time to move to the next section.  </li>
            <li> They are ALL such great products.</li>
            <li> This toothbrush really encourages the kids to brush their own teeth.</li>
            <li> These are great with noises to tell the kids when to move to a different part of their mouth, and it keeps them brushing for 2 minutes.</li>
            <li> The musical timer is great and has him running for his toothbrush when we announce that it is time to brush his teeth.  </li>
            <li> Great tool for kids to learn the proper brushing time.</li>
            <li> I do as well and the sound reminders are</li>
            <li> I like that the musical sounds are not obnoxious and are great indicators regarding brushing time.    </li>
            <li> sound will guide change position and finish.&lt;br /&gt;Brush</li>
            <li> Unsure where or if replacement heads are available?</li>
            <li> If need be the head on her toothbrush fits our sonicare brushes just as ours will even fit hers.</li>
            <li> 2 kids ages 5 and 8 use this brush and enjoy it.</li>
            <li> and I know it does a fantastic job cleaning your teeth.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great product and when the time comes we will be getting one for our younger son.</li>
            <li> I am happy that the kids actually brush their teeth until it turns off - mission</li>
            <li> After spending lots of money on not so cheap imitations I bought this toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> It makes it more fun for him to brush with the music intervals in between.  </li>
            <li> You can change the singing sound and you can change the color of the tooth brush😍&lt;br /&gt;Review by 8-year-old</li>
            <li> Brushing the kids teeth was always a nightmare, even with the cheap electric brushes.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s quicker and more effective than using a regular toothbrush, so I&#x27;m glad we got it.</li>
            <li> They both enjoy the ease of using this product and my wife and I have the piece of mind that their teeth are being cleaned the way they should.</li>
            <li> It has a sound that beeps 5 times.</li>
            <li> in a sugar filled world, can&#x27;t hurt.  </li>
            <li> He uses it as a backup tootbrush, when his primary brush needs a charge.  </li>
            <li> The &amp;#34;timed tones&amp;#34; are a great addition to this product to signal when its time to move on to a different &amp;#34;quadrant&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> This is a good size for my 4 yr old.</li>
            <li> Its a good size for my 6 year old to work with</li>
            <li> I love it so much that I ended up ordering 6 more to give to all my nieces and nephews for Christmas.</li>
            <li> My 7 yr old loved that she could choose the decorative face plate.</li>
            <li> 3 &amp; 4 year old can use their own tooth brush, although I do make sure we get all sugarbugs out.    </li>
            <li> it helps the 4 year old do a good job.  </li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t start good dental habits to young.</li>
            <li> good product, both parents use adult sonic are.</li>
            <li> My youngest grand daughter loved this gift last Christmas.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know what magically changed, maybe it tickles, who knows, but whatever it is, I&#x27;m happy and it was money well spent.</li>
            <li> My kids get board quickly with brushing their teeth, so I love that their sonicare brushes keep them brushing for the 2 full minutes with the auto-timer.  </li>
            <li> I am so glad that I made a right choice this time.</li>
            <li> My grand daughter said they could not wait to charge it up and used it right away.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this toothbrush for the challenging toddler!</li>
            <li> With this kid friendly version, it&#x27;s a series of a happy 1-2 second beep and the &#x27;beeps&#x27; that tell them they are finished with brushing</li>
            <li> They say to replace them more frequently, but I mainly remember to replace them each time we go for their 6 month cleanings, which have been great check ups since they are using these brushes!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> BTW, the Oral B stand provides a covered storage space for four brush heads which is also very useful.      </li>
            <li> This this is very powerful and does not bother or tickle my child&#x27;s mouth when using it on them.</li>
            <li> And I am more calm about her teeth getting clean.</li>
            <li> This kind is much easier to clean.</li>
            <li> A children&#x27;s hygenist recommended this toothbrush and said it really helps the kids clean their teeth effectively.</li>
            <li> The unit does have 2 settings though which allows for a lesser vibration to start with and makes it easier to transition into the high setting which works best for dental care.</li>
            <li> I can tell a huge difference in how clean his teeth are compared to manual brushing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Leaves teeth really clean and smooth</li>
            <li> My boys share the main body and have their own brush heads.</li>
            <li> Overall a great product and more effective than standard brushes.</li>
            <li> used to manually brush their teeth for them, (just to be sure they were brushing correctly), but switched them to these electronic models (via professional samples) since he believes they do a more thorough job, and the kids really enjoy using them.  </li>
            <li> Lacking that, I&#x27;d suggest that you keep a manual brush available for those nights when you don&#x27;t have the parental stamina to try to make your wiggly child stand still over the bowl for the full cycle.  </li>
            <li> she was so excited that she immediately began brushing her teeth.  </li>
            <li> My daughter was ver excited when she recieved this.</li>
            <li> so I was really excited when I found this Sonicare for kids at Target.  </li>
            <li> I was so excited to get this for my 6 yr.</li>
            <li> He loves when the music plays as an indication to switch brushing areas (quadrants) and he gets so excited when the reward tune plays at the end of brushing.</li>
            <li> What a simple, yet effective idea!</li>
            <li> This brush was totally worth it!</li>
            <li> What a simple, yet effective idea!</li>
            <li> He is actually excited about brushing his teeth.</li>
            <li> The small brush head works best.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have to worry about the kids brushing because they are do excited to use it.</li>
            <li> Just keep your original receipt and be prepared to give the code on the bottom of your brush for a replacement, just do it before year 2.</li>
            <li> I was excited to see that they have a model specifically for kids and wondered what the differences might be.&lt;br</li>
            <li> My son now is so excited to brush his teeth - after meals, at night, in the morning, in the afternoon..</li>
            <li> It makes it FUN!</li>
            <li> I ordered one for each child (7yo and 8yo) about a month ago and they have been excited to brush.  </li>
            <li> The interchangeable plates make each toothbrush unique for the child.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m the Oral B person, and so is my husband, but Oral B does not seem to make a kid friendly electric toothbrush like this one.</li>
            <li> They are excited to brush their teeth now.  </li>
            <li> The kids were excited to try it.  </li>
            <li> One of the things that we like best about it is that the 4-7 year old size heads are just the right size, even for our 2 year old (who has been using it since he was 18 months).</li>
            <li> My cute little great grandsons said, &amp;#34;It makes brushing your teeth fun.&amp;#34</li>
            <li> My daughter is loving her new brush, she said it&#x27;s tingling in the mouth.</li>
            <li> It was a battle to get him to brush good enough each night, but with his new toothbrush he does a great job of brushing the whole time and getting all of his teeth clean.  </li>
            <li> My daughter loves it, she is 8 and feels so clean after brushing&lt;br /&gt;Love</li>
            <li> chargers work great and look good on the counter behind the sink.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> His teeth now comes out clean every brush.</li>
            <li> have their own brush head, but I am considering getting another unit just so they can each be more independent rather than having to take turns.</li>
            <li> Easy &amp; fun for the kids.  </li>
            <li> Will help her keep her teeth clean with no cavities.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a fun way to brush, and easy to get her to brush.</li>
            <li> Underneath where the brush attaches to the handle can get mucky and even moldy if mom and dad aren&#x27;t checking it and keeping it clean.  </li>
            <li> ; there is nothing to clean here!&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> a lot easier to clean with too.</li>
            <li> Their teeth are clean and shiny and the plaque is gone.</li>
            <li> and get her teeth clean than before.</li>
            <li> She will even walk out and rub her teeth sometiems just to show us how squeeky clean her teeth are</li>
            <li> and she raves about how squeaky clean they are.</li>
            <li> My son 11 year old isn&#x27;t the most motivated brusher and had troubles with plaque on his bottom 4 teeth and top canines.</li>
            <li> It not only starts out with an &amp;#34;easy&amp;#34; setting and gradually gets more effective, but it also allows we parents to not bug the child to keep brushing to make the two minute mark</li>
            <li> I get compliments on how clean their teeth are at the dentist.  </li>
            <li> But since the sonicare toothbrush doesn&#x27;t get his teeth completely clean, we&#x27;re still using a manual toothbrush after we use the sonicare.</li>
            <li> We shall see at our next dental visit how thoroughly it works when an eight-year-old is more on her own with brushing with this product.</li>
            <li> Easy to use, and clean super smooth smile.</li>
            <li> super easy compared to brushing and much more gentle.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it.is brush to be significantly different than the Sonicare I already own, which is a good thing.  </li>
            <li> It seems others have had this problem and most of the positive reviews are written by people who haven&#x27;t had the brushes for a year.  </li>
            <li> I bought this for my two year old and we love it!</li>
            <li> We got this for our 3 year old and love it!</li>
            <li> I think it is great that children 4 years old and older now have access to a rechargeable toothbrush just like their parents or grandparents.</li>
            <li> So not only does this tooth brush clean just as good as the one for adults</li>
            <li> It was a waste of money and made my son feel like he wasn&#x27;t doing a very good job taking care of his teeth.</li>
            <li> and i&#x27;m confident that later on he&#x27;ll do a great job on his own versus the conventional brushes.   </li>
            <li> It triggered my 9 year old&#x27;s real interest in cleaning his teeth well, and while we don&#x27;t use it for every brushing session, it is handy to have around for a thorough brush!</li>
            <li> The trick is getting a fidgety four-year-old boy to stand still leaning over the sink for the full cycle.  </li>
            <li> Now they continue for the full 2 minutes.  </li>
            <li> My dentist suggested it many years ago and it has really helped.  </li>
            <li> I decided to try it anyway since it&#x27;s more gentle than manual brushing.    </li>
            <li> But when we use the Sonicare she looks forward to it and complies much more readily.</li>
            <li> On the occasions that we let our 2 year old try to do his own teeth, he has no problem with the handle either.</li>
            <li> They just dont know how to do a good enough job.</li>
            <li> My 7 yr old will brush his own teeth in the morning.</li>
            <li> Both of my children will brush for the full two minutes.</li>
            <li> In my opinion that is good with starting out with the toothbrush.</li>
            <li> But kids need to be brushing the full two minutes just like their parents.</li>
            <li> They work very well, my kids love them.</li>
            <li> The sonicare action combined with the 2-minute built in timer has the kids brushing well and for an effective period of time.    </li>
            <li> And he thinks it&#x27;s cool to have a power toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> apparently it&#x27;s true.  </li>
            <li> It gradually builds up to the full time (2 minutes</li>
            <li> Grand kids really like--</li>
            <li> and he brushes well and for two full minutes.  </li>
            <li> so I am keeping my eye on this on Amazon for a good future deal.</li>
            <li> My kids (3 and 5 years old) liked using the OralB which had prompted me to purchase this brush for them</li>
            <li> the toothbrush- and brushes for a full 2 minutes diligently every night and morning.</li>
            <li> but now they love it so much</li>
            <li> It has two speeds and works up to the full two minute cycle, but over a period of completed shorter cycles.  </li>
            <li> He likes the music that alerts his to switch and now he brushes for the full 2 minutes.  </li>
            <li> Glad to get it hear and serves its purpose very well.</li>
            <li> They totally love the sounds and the vibration is so gentle.</li>
            <li> Cool colors</li>
            <li> The dentist told me that most kids under the age of 8 find Sonicare too intense.  </li>
            <li> Trust me, they eat their fair share of candy, but I attribute a big portion of that to this toothbrush.</li>
            <li> I have also spoken with many dental professionals that were very dismayed by the companies response.  </li>
            <li> Good quality for the price and should last him years.</li>
            <li> was to replace my son&#x27;s full size sonicare</li>
            <li> super clean</li>
            <li> and they really do squeek :-).</li>
            <li> Not only does it do a good job</li>
            <li> It has a cool beep every 30 seconds which prompts her to move to another section of her mouth.  </li>
            <li> She likes that it is a cool color and beeps.  </li>
            <li> 2 full minutes of brushing every morning and night.</li>
            <li> My daughter&#x27;s is doing okay, but after awhile, the replacement heads just don&#x27;t attach to the handle very well.</li>
            <li> stickers are cute too.his teeth absolutely look cleaner.</li>
            <li> My 4 yr old does his own (with my follow up) and</li>
            <li> But on the whole, worthwhile.</li>
            <li> cool feature.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It not only helps get a good brush in</li>
            <li> Really wants to make them brush more often.</li>
            <li> It was well worth it to see her enjoy brushing her teeth.</li>
            <li> I bought this sonicare for my 4 year old and he does a pretty good job with it.  </li>
            <li> &quot; plastic clip-on templates  - Grip size, though large, is comfortable and easy to hold.  </li>
            <li> It is a very powerful and even fun toothbrush.</li>
            <li> (This is perfect for my family as we only have 2 children but with those with more kids may want something else to store the other children&#x27;s toothbrush heads...</li>
            <li> Something special for your precious little one from a good and reliable company.</li>
            <li> One of our twins was not easy to let us brush his teeth and the sonicare made it much easy to reach every angle of his mouth.&lt;br /&gt;really great product.</li>
            <li> They hold up real well and help the girls get their teeth very clean.</li>
            <li> The brushes fit great in their little hands.  </li>
            <li> Our two daughters love their new toothbrushes!</li>
            <li> Youngest granddaughter is enjoying the use of this new toothbrush!  </li>
            <li> they faces are stick-on, so they are one-shot deals, and b) there are only four audio cues: inside top and bottom, and front top an bottom?  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Still a good toothbrush, but the above points are worth thinking about.</li>
            <li> We switched him from using my old oral B pro care to this thinking it would be more enjoyable for him to have his own fun colored brush, but 4 months into using it I started to notice his teeth were yellow</li>
            <li> and they quickly replaced it.</li>
            <li> I might have been able to get a better deal on regular one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> would imagine this would not be an issue for older brushers who are able to close their lips around the brush while brushing.</li>
            <li> This one definitely has more of a vibrational movement and causes more &#x27;bubbles&#x27; in the mouth from our tooth powder / liquid that we use.       </li>
            <li> I no longer have t worry about her brushing to quickly</li>
            <li> My girls&#x27; dental health has improved tremendously since we went electric.  </li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s great because it&#x27;s a long time to start out with at first.  </li>
            <li> Comes with the 2 different size heads in different colors perfect for my 6 &amp; 8 year olds.</li>
            <li> Particularly since I have bought so many of their products over the years.  </li>
            <li> This brush is designed to hold an adequate charge for about a week.</li>
            <li> Even then they were reluctant to take the time to adequately brush their teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The changeable plates for the front are really nice, fortunate that there are three different designs.</li>
            <li> Because of the unique handle design, he was still able to \\&quot;guide\\&quot; their brushing until they got the hang of it (which didn&#x27;t take long, even for the youngest), and until he was sure they were using the device as it&#x27;s meant to be used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t recommend this more highly.</li>
            <li> The outside is cute and the sound it makes is fun, love the timmer and LOVE the soft headed brushes</li>
            <li> But neither of these seem to be any problem, he took to holding it right away and the mirror is still clean.</li>
            <li> just the right ammout of vibration to get teeth clean</li>
            <li> The dentist was very pleased with her last check-up.      </li>
            <li> Other parents there said that their children liked it better than manual tooth brushes and</li>
            <li> He seems to like it better than a normal brush.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s worth $40 per year for cavity-free checkups.for those nights when you don&#x27;t have the parental stamina to try to make your wiggly child stand still over the bowl for the full cycle.  </li>
            <li> The children now brush a full two minutes and think that is is fun.  </li>
            <li> I love the way Sonicare brushes clean and I will buy my children the adult version now.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used a sonicare toothbrush since the late 90s {I started VERY VERY young...:P} and have always been impressed w/ its performance and effectiveness.  </li>
            <li> The boys love that the sound indicator is a happy / silly sound.  </li>
            <li> easy to use clean and set up highly recommend for people who like their teeth</li>
            <li> Love the new sonic care for kids.  </li>
            <li> My kids LOVE their new toothbrushes.</li>
            <li> It easy for the kid, he enjoys is so much.</li>
            <li> This Kids model&#x27;s charger is very compact and easy to pack for travel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> good product while it works, just be aware that it does not seemed designed to last forever or for an extended period of time.  </li>
            <li> They both loved it once they got used to the speed of the head and the fact that it tickled their upper teeth too much!</li>
            <li> This is the kid version and works very well for adults with small mouths.&lt;br /&gt;The cleaning of this toothbrush is excellent!</li>
            <li> My kids, like most, do not brush long enough and I am not always hovering over them to make sure they do the full 2 minutes.......and quite honestly a manual toothbrush just is not as reliable and you can spend oodles every year on the $9 battery operated cheapies........</li>
            <li> Great device works fine, it comes with two replacement brushes, one for child and one for adults, the engine power is enough to clean your teeth or at least for giving you that kind of sensation.</li>
            <li> I HIGHLY recommend this toothbrush!!!</li>
            <li> Easy grip, they much more regularly and thoroughly brush their teeth!</li>
            <li> The quick movement of the brush head gives the impression that it is doing a better job than hand brushing of old.  </li>
            <li> and I highly recommend it to anyone who wants their kid has a clean teeth!!</li>
            <li> My kids brush a full 2 minutes, they do a much better job of brushing (once they understood the quadrant method - top front, top back, bottom front, bottom back)</li>
            <li> so the child can change their toothbrush&#x27;s look more frequently and easily, and (b) the three faceplates varied more in their themes (one abstract dot pattern is enough, let&#x27;s also have some floral, animal, or cartoon themes!).  </li>
            <li> so the child can change their toothbrush&#x27;s look more frequently and easily, and (b) the three faceplates varied more in their themes (one abstract dot pattern is enough, let&#x27;s also have some floral, animal, or cartoon themes!).  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little too soon to give a really great review</li>
            <li> The timer and little chimes it plays are great and my children no longer complain about brushing their teeth.</li>
            <li> It cleans her little teeth great.</li>
            <li> It works great mainly because it does the work for them when they can&#x27;t effectively create little circular motions with a normal brush.</li>
            <li> Great  and fun way for them to learn to care for their only set of teeth from a young age.  </li>
            <li> I like that this brush feels like it&#x27;s REALLY cleaning my sons teeth, but a huge downside is that it oversprays toothpaste and spit everywhere.</li>
            <li> In addition to being two parts, the spare head doesn&#x27;t fit on the post very well and tends to pop off.  </li>
            <li> I have been using Sonicare toothbrushes for myself for many years now and totally believe they have made a huge difference in my oral health.  </li>
            <li> Great for my two autistic children!&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s feels solidly build, and the inclusion of two head sizes was nice.  </li>
            <li> Worth researching &amp; finding it here.  </li>
            <li> Worth waiting for it to arrive.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s colorful (the handle)</li>
            <li> Frankly, I haven&#x27;t found anything compelling in the Philips Sonicare, and neither has my son.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s worth $40 per year for cavity-free checkups.</li>
            <li> My 6 and 8 year old love it.  </li>
            <li> Charge holds up for several days and most importantly, my daughter loves it because it tickles.</li>
            <li> Every time I hear the beep, I have to smile.  </li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s fun too.</li>
            <li> It makes fun sounds while she brushes, making it easier for her to brush longer.  </li>
            <li> the Sonicare Kids is well worth it.</li>
            <li> and they have fun doing it.  </li>
            <li> - Melodic series of beeps indicate when to switch brushing to another part of the mouth, which is fun for kids.  </li>
            <li> OK for 7 year old kids</li>
            <li> I think he would have been able to handle this at even three years old.</li>
            <li> He liked customizing his toothbrush with the various sticker plates.  </li>
            <li> I have been using a Sonicare adult for many years.  </li>
            <li> fun</li>
            <li> As for use, this is a nice solid toothbrush.</li>
            <li> So besides those issues my daughter does like it although I think the settings are a bit powerful for her</li>
            <li> When his dentist recommended the Kids Sonicare (I didn&#x27;t know one existed), I thought it was worth a try.</li>
            <li> Until then, guess it is a fairly nice decorative piece in the kid&#x27;s bathroom (sarcasm)and back to disposable spin brushes.  </li>
            <li> So while the product worked, it was worth the cost; however, if they break within a year then their workmanship or design is suspect.  </li>
            <li> Its colorful and fun... has fun tones.  </li>
            <li> so brushing teeth has become fun, not a chore.  </li>
            <li> The dentist could tell an improvement, and that makes them worth it</li>
            <li> Worth the money.</li>
            <li> This toothbrush is worth the money.</li>
            <li> Brushing was a struggle before this; well worth the cost.</li>
            <li> Kids think they are fun.  </li>
            <li> I like the adult version a bit better but the kids like the colored plates.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my 2.5 years old and it makes it easier for me to brush her teeth faster and more thoroughly.</li>
            <li> The cleaning power of sonicare in a fun package for kids.  </li>
            <li> Well worth the money.</li>
            <li> but I feel that it will be well worth every penny when it comes to his dental visits.</li>
            <li> my grandson wanted on like mom and dads (plus grandparents) and seems to enjoy brushing with us like a big boy, so he is now brushing more,</li>
            <li> my grandson loves it and its fun to brush now.</li>
            <li> My Child is more than 2,5 years old</li>
            <li> toothbrush is almost the same as the Sonicare I currently own for myself.  </li>
            <li> Couldn&#x27;t convince my 8  year old grand daughters to brush 2 minutes with out this brush.  </li>
            <li> If it is worth it, then buy it anyway.  </li>
            <li> In my professional opinion, if you&#x27;re looking to buy an electric toothbrush, Sonicare should be at the top of your list.  </li>
            <li> Well worth the money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> She  can&#x27;t wait to use it and finds it a fun chore these days.</li>
            <li> She is brushing on her own several times per day.  </li>
            <li> Fun design for kids, Fun music</li>
            <li> and compared to his friends it seems to be well worth the money.  </li>
            <li> I have bought lots of philips toothbrushes for my family and this one is not a disappointment.  </li>
            <li> on&amp;#34; for a personal touch (my daughter really liked picking out her</li>
            <li> It helps to whiten teeth and isn&#x27;t too powerful for them.</li>
            <li> This was definitely worth the price.</li>
            <li> I was hesitant to purchase this for my seven year old after the dentist said it would be overkill, but I am glad I did.</li>
            <li> The package arrived in good shape and performs as expected.</li>
            <li> This flexibility is well worth it.</li>
            <li> I love this brush for my 3.5 year old boy.  </li>
            <li> She&#x27;s brushing longer and having fun while doing so.</li>
            <li> My  3 year old grandson is happy to use his personal toothbrush every day.</li>
            <li> Worth the money, I recommend it.</li>
            <li> The toothbrush is fun for the children</li>
            <li> They love the music that is played for the length of brushing time and also the individual covers that are available to individualize the brushes.</li>
            <li> So keep a regular brush handy for those instances.  </li>
            <li> Otherwise this was WELL worth the purchase.</li>
            <li> brush is sturdy and the kids like the colorful bases.</li>
            <li> The sounds are fun and keep them brushing.  </li>
            <li> They each chose to use a different plate on the front which helps them identify their own toothbrush.</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;ve had to put the toothbrush up for when she finishes losing the more sensitive teeth.</li>
            <li> The kids liked that they could choose the color for the outside of their brush.  </li>
            <li> It is well worth the price.</li>
            <li> It is worth every penny.  </li>
            <li> Now they are very excited and enjoy brushing at the same time as us adults with our Sonicare toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> This is great brush, but first one stopped working after less then a year.</li>
            <li> Would have been 5 stars except I&#x27;m not a fan of the new peg mini sized chargers that the brush can fall off much more easily than the old style.</li>
            <li> Having experienced other electric \\&quot;kid\\&quot; toothbrushes, one can really tell Sonicare thought this model through.</li>
            <li> Overall we have been very happy with this brush and recommended it to other parents as well as telling our dentist about it</li>
            <li> Having experienced other electric \\&quot;kid\\&quot; toothbrushes, one can really tell Sonicare thought this model through.</li>
            <li> My kids love these toothbrushes so we&#x27;re planning on buying two more for the other bathroom - this way, they can Sonicare either upstairs or downstairs.  </li>
            <li> my child got used to the intensity pretty quickly.  </li>
            <li> It works wonderfully, quickly and efficiently removing stains and tartar that had built up on her teeth during her first years.</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with the purchase and find the brushes to be high quality and so far the performance has be exactly as advertised.</li>
            <li> flat out amazing</li>
            <li> The high frequency motion tends to create a more intense sensation than the lower frequency  OralB motion.</li>
            <li> The brush is just the right size for her</li>
            <li> so this got him used to brushing for the right amount of time..</li>
            <li> Right now, there is a rebate for $5</li>
            <li> Right now we have just the one unit and the kids each</li>
            <li> my grandson brushes the right way now....</li>
            <li> Each one stops working right around the 1 year mark.  </li>
            <li> The tones help them brush for the right amount of time.</li>
            <li> and she was so right on.</li>
            <li> It let&#x27;s them know that they are brushing the right amount of time in each area.  </li>
            <li> I know it was the right choice.  </li>
            <li> I have already dropped the toothbrush on the floor because I didn&#x27;t stick it in right.</li>
            <li> For a couple of months, it was ignored and sat in the closet, even though I was told \\&quot;I like it, I&#x27;m just not using it right</li>
            <li> This is probably the first time I&#x27;m able to post an early review for a \\&quot;Vine\\&quot; Product, and I feel priveliged to do so!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> First, let me say that I LOVE my adult Sonicare toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> This makes it much easier for my son to thoroughly clean his teeth.</li>
            <li> but I found the sensation of brushing with this to be a bit less pleasant than when I used an OralB electric toothbrush which I used for a while and continue to use sometimes.</li>
            <li> We were very happy with the results at first, but now one has broken already, and I can&#x27;t see how to exchange it or what the warranty situation is for the item.</li>
            <li> It stays on for a full 2 minutes and makes sure he is brushing for the proper amount of time.  </li>
            <li> I really gets my sons teeth clean and is quite.</li>
            <li> so wanted to ensure we were doing as much as we could to help him keep them clean.  </li>
            <li> She loves having her own &amp;#34;electric&amp;#34; toothbrush, &amp; willingly brushes regularly!  </li>
            <li> The toothbrush is very easy to use and comes with extra faceplates if you want to change up the look of the toothbrush.</li>
            <li> She was not the most interested tooth brusher, but since getting this, she is always excited to get her teeth brushed.</li>
            <li> A very smart office manager in my dentist&#x27;s suggested this Sonicare For Kids</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll be very surprised if this Does All The Work toothbrush doesn&#x27;t yield good results at their next visit to the dentist.</li>
            <li> Plus it does a far better job cleaning their teeth than they were ever able to do with a regular toothbrush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Plus it makes a cute beep sound that helps the brusher know how much brushing is left to go!</li>
            <li> Apparently some people are more prone to it than others.  </li>
            <li> Makes brushing the regularly missed spots much easier and  more precisely</li>
            <li> The look and sounds were fun at first, but now that the time is increasing and she&#x27;s used it for awhile, the novelty is gone.</li>
            <li> The timer on it is great, no more singing the ABC&#x27;s and getting distracted and having to start over,</li>
            <li> it makes beeps to count time how long to brush and stops on its own after two minutes of brushing.</li>
            <li> The little beep reminders are pleasant to hear.  </li>
            <li> I recommend this brush not just for kids, but for adults with limited dexterity, crowded teeth, heavy stain, and those who found the original Sonicare too strong for their sensitive teeth, but want the toothbrush with the best ability to remove stains.</li>
            <li> First of all, the packaging is VERY easy to open.  </li>
            <li> It has only been a little over a week, but I am impressed to hear him brushing by himself every morning and evening, and with the timer he is brushing longer than he ever has before.    </li>
            <li> and I\\&quot;m sure he&#x27;ll soon be a little pro.  :-)</li>
            <li> My daughter is learning how to brush her teeth &amp;#34;on her own&amp;#34; right now and this is really helping!  </li>
            <li> We have the adult version of the Philips Sonicare from 5 years ago and they are still going strong.  </li>
            <li> That same sound also seems to delight my daughter, who is the primary user of the toothbrush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This toothbrush does a great job and has a timer tone to let my boy know when he has brushed enough.</li>
            <li> The timer and musical chime has been great for him and he likes the brush overall.</li>
            <li> I wanted my 8 year old to use our Sonicare toothbrush, but it is just too strong for him.</li>
            <li> These are not as strong in terms of brushing force as the adult versions.  </li>
            <li> It helps me 7 years old child to brush her teeth more efficiency and the 2 minutes time inerval work really well.</li>
            <li> I use are at least 3 yrs old and the rechargeable batteries are working perfectly.</li>
            <li> was worried it would be too much for my 4 year old but no problems, love the dings letting me know when we are almost done.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The lowest setting is too strong for my 3 year old, but nothing that a desense program wouldn&#x27;t fix.&lt;br</li>
            <li> (I&#x27;ve listened and watched) are SOMEWHAT quieter than models like this meant for adults (I use a Phillips Sonicare ProResults--love it, but it&#x27;s LOUD), so there&#x27;s no \\&quot;scary\\&quot; drill-like sound, AND, the scrub-factor is more gentle than on adult models.&lt;br</li>
            <li> At first glance, the product seems to be pretty sturdy, unfortunately, as another owner experienced, this product was designed for use by more than one child.  </li>
            <li> my daughter like it very much.</li>
            <li> after a day or two of &amp;#34;hehehe it tickles&amp;#34; my 3.5 year old is fine with it.</li>
            <li> There are 3 different faceplates that it comes with that you can chose from so the kids get to personalize it a little too, which is kind of nice.</li>
            <li> He recommended it, great product for small and older children!</li>
            <li> His teeth looks great and clean, so I would totally recommend the product to other parents!</li>
            <li> Another reason for the removal of one star: this isn&#x27;t something you can just hand the kids and say \\&quot;brush your teeth.\\&quot;  They&#x27;ll need some instruction, and maybe even help with their first couple of uses.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My grandson brushes more thoroughly with this device, and needs only a reminder that its time to brush his teeth.</li>
            <li> This is our second, and we are well pleased.</li>
            <li> To me it seems like the brush head does not have a wide motion that might help, we&#x27;ll see how effective it is over time.    </li>
            <li> favorite feature is the musical tone that indicates when it is time to switch quadrants.  </li>
            <li> The vibrating head tingles the gums when first used and it&#x27;s explicitly written in the manual that \\&quot;The Sonicare may feel ticklish upon first use\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> This brush helped him to become more independent, and now I just help him once a day to get that pesky spot</li>
            <li> We believe the initial cost and brush replacement costs are more than compensated for in savings at the dentists office.</li>
            <li> But after much coaxing, they refuse to use it!  </li>
            <li> I bought this mostly because I wanted my son to begin brushing properly and this has a timer on it for kids.  </li>
            <li> Plus, his dental visits since he&#x27;s had this toothbrush was much better than the one last year.  </li>
            <li> As others mentioned, would have been nice if one of the covers was pink, red or a more frilly color for my daughters</li>
            <li> If you plan on switching out the heads for multiple children, I would considered another more robust toothbrush (maybe an Oral B product which seems to be built to a more robust standard).    </li>
            <li> this is exactly what did it.  </li>
            <li> Once the decision was made it was time to flip a coin to see who would go first.  </li>
            <li> You can not wrong by buying this item, if you have the money go for it.</li>
            <li> Great for the kids, as it slowly increases the time of brushing.</li>
            <li> Much better mouth care, as opposed to a regular toothbrush.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s high-tech which keeps them interested.</li>
            <li> Kids love the musical sounds it chimes when it&#x27;s time to brush another area.</li>
            <li> Cleans very well!</li>
            <li> Those complaints stopped with this brush the first time we used it</li>
            <li> it seems to do a more thorough job than a standard toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> highly* recommend this toothbrush!!</li>
            <li> I have had a sonicare for sometime now and as soon as I was aware of a sonicare for kids</li>
            <li> Its not obvious to me that it does a better job at cleaning than the OralB electric toothbrush.</li>
            <li> Feel it does a better job than a regular brush.</li>
            <li> my kid loves it and doesn&#x27;t complain any more about time to brush; now she knows that we are done only when it stops.</li>
            <li> My kid&#x27;s dentist still said her teeth were pretty stained.</li>
            <li> Outstanding product for younger children!</li>
            <li> My daughter is two and throws an epic fit every time we try to brush her teeth.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t love it enough!</li>
            <li> He has braces and needed something better than a regular toothbrush.</li>
            <li> I hope to be able to purchase a Sonicare for my self in the future!</li>
            <li> So I am going to pick up a second unit to feel better about that.  </li>
            <li> It really can&#x27;t be more simple to get started.</li>
            <li> I love that the &#x27;sonic&#x27; movement is truly different</li>
            <li> $10 a brush head is pretty steep.  </li>
            <li> I worked with her the first couple of times she used it, as you will have to with your kids.  </li>
            <li> But, the sensation was not uncomfortable for her.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Battery lasts several days and it has sustained many drops to the floor.</li>
            <li> Thanks Philips!  </li>
            <li> , so I am really hoping to pass this on to my kids!</li>
            <li> We had our daughters share the first Sonicare, just bought an additional head.  </li>
            <li> and it has held up very well!</li>
            <li> I would recommend it to anyone who has staining issues in their kids teeth and even if they don&#x27;t because this toothbrush does so much better than the standard ones you buy at the store.  </li>
            <li> It makes brushing his teeth fun, the two minutes goes by fast.</li>
            <li> The dentist had commented that he wasn&#x27;t doing a stellar job brushing.   </li>
            <li> My husband &amp; I have had a Sonicare for several months and love it.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend!!</li>
            <li> Got these for the grandkids and they love them and will actually brush their teeth without a fight and seem to be brushing longer as well.</li>
            <li> They work great, we have not had any problems, and they last a long time before needing to be re-charged.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure if it was &amp;#34;kid friendly&amp;#34; enough, but it is.</li>
            <li> highly recommend!!</li>
            <li> The smaller brush works better for kids.</li>
            <li> My boys regularly get told to brush better by our dentist.</li>
            <li> Except for the fact that they splat toothpaste spit everywhere, they are exactly what the dentist ordered.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Overall, they have ended up brushing more often and from what I can tell, it is working well.</li>
            <li> And you will be amazed when you first use it.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s powerful, yet gentle as well.</li>
            <li> Love the different design option stickers</li>
            <li> We called the company with the first one and they replaced it, but it has happened again.  </li>
            <li> you have to keep replacing the heads or the WHOLE toothbrush!</li>
            <li> I love that it signals my son when to move to a different area to brush and when finished gives another signal.  </li>
            <li> My son thinks its fun and continues to use it without me standing over him to brush his teeth...would highly recommend!</li>
            <li> My kids love to brush their teeth now, I especially like the timing for each section of the mouth.</li>
            <li> talk strategy on how to bush and where to move after the first beep.  </li>
            <li> so I really could not be happier with this toothbrush!</li>
            <li> Kids love it, although you may want to supervise younger ones to make sure it&#x27;s used properly.  </li>
            <li> Finally, it may not be as attractive as the adult versions, but the adult heads fit on this one and its quite a bit cheaper than the adult models.  </li>
            <li> Not only is he brushing even more</li>
            <li> With the beeping tones to let him know when to switch to the next quadrant, I know he&#x27;s getting a better quality brushing experience.  </li>
            <li> Now she wants to brush her teeth!</li>
            <li> So the first week or so we stood by and reminded her which &amp;#34;quadrant&amp;#34; to switch to and that was that.  </li>
            <li> (More often than not, she has a big mouth!).</li>
            <li> Very well made!</li>
            <li> We&#x27;ll be buying another one for our son when he&#x27;s ready!</li>
            <li> Mine are 3 and 6 and now they&#x27;re fighting over who gets to brush first.  </li>
            <li> I feel like such a better mom with these toothbrushes now.</li>
            <li> The color is very bright and doesn&#x27;t look like a typical \\&quot;toothbrush\\&quot; and actually brightens up our bathroom.</li>
            <li> I purchased two for my children and one stopped working within a couple months,  Customer service was awesome at Philips and replacement for free, Great toothbrushes otherwise and Child&#x27;s dentist highly recommends these over other brands,  Web: [...] or  Phone: 1-888-PHILIPS (744-5477)</li>
            <li> Wow! for the first time ever her teeth are clean.  </li>
            <li> Super highly recommended.</li>
            <li> My 5 and 8 year old grandsons love their new toothbrushes.  </li>
            <li> My 5 and 7 yr old love their new toothbrushes.</li>
            <li> It has the chime that reminds him to switch to a new section, and keeps him brushing for the full minute.</li>
            <li> After we started using this toothbrush her teeth cleaned right up and her gums look much healthier.</li>
            <li> The brush is small, soft, and very suitable to fit into a child&#x27;s mouth.  </li>
            <li> As was the case when I purchased my FlexCare brush shortly after it was introduced, I think that the price is a bit on the high side, but one could justify that it is worth the dental health benefits if it helps your child brush better and longer each time.</li>
            <li> heads, as with all toothbrushes will eventually wear and need replacement, and the cost is certainly a little bit more than a cheap toothbrush off the grocery store shelf.  </li>
            <li> Other nice amenities are self adhesive coverlets which allowed my son to \\&quot;customize\\</li>
            <li> , they won&#x27;t use any other kind of brush.</li>
            <li> I purchased this for my granddaughter to help with her dental care, we were not disappointed, it works just like the adult version but for children.  </li>
            <li> 6 year old loves it and it is preparing her to go to the dentist (the vibration) in a couple of months.&lt;br /&gt;Pricey for us ($60) but worth it!</li>
            <li> So excited that I was able to find this on Amazon for SO much less than at Target.</li>
            <li> but I know this works better to reach hard places and keeps their gums healthy.</li>
            <li> It arrived quickly and it is better than expected!</li>
            <li> /&gt;It is a bit different than the Adult models, more simplified in functions, but does just as good a job as any other toothbrush in the Sonicare line.  </li>
            <li> A quick call to customer service, verification of the serial number, and I had a new handle on its way.</li>
            <li> A quick call to customer service, verification of the serial number, and I had a new handle on its way.</li>
            <li> Forget all the special settings; high and low work just fine.</li>
            <li> Phillips is also a great company, as I have had trouble with my &#x27;adult&#x27; version, they replaced the part with no problem at all.  </li>
            <li> I was concerned that my 5 year old wasn&#x27;t getting his teeth clean when brushing.</li>
            <li> The different speeds are a good idea for the younger kids, but mine were already used to switching areas every 30 seconds</li>
            <li> Sure, you still have to move the toothbrush and angle it properly, but the rapid vibrations help remove stuff from your teeth really well.  </li>
            <li> More comfortable for a child than the sonicare with the round heads.</li>
            <li> Nice product that makes my 3 year old look forward to brushing her teeth and being a big girl at that.</li>
            <li> Both my 3 year old and my 5 year old love the brush.</li>
            <li> old twins and almost 3 year old LOVE using these brushes.  </li>
            <li> Seems to be a far better solution that a normal brush which rarely lasted more than 30 seconds, half of which was spitting out toothpaste and talking to Dad.</li>
            <li> The adult brushes fit fine, and last longer (cheaper, too.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> it beeps when she should change quadrants in her mouth, letting her know how long is appropriate.</li>
            <li> It wasn&#x27;t long after we bought these that we found out that our dentist had started recommending them for kids, which made us feel even better about them.</li>
            <li> My son loves using it, I love the fact it has a timer that teaches kids how long to brush their teeth</li>
            <li> /&gt;Having said all this, a power toothbrush IS way better for a kid than manual brushing in the long run, I think.  </li>
            <li> I brush her first, then she wants to jump in and try.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t find a similar quality product from other manufacturers so Phillips are happy to explore their edge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bite</li>
            <li> Brush for much longer too;).</li>
            <li> When the kids toothbrush came out, I was anxious to get it for my three boys, ages 7, 4, and 4, thinking it would help develop good brushing habits.  </li>
            <li> that my adult Oral0-B Professional version which they were sharing with me before they got this, our dentist said the kids version is MUCH more gentle on their teeth.   </li>
            <li> the feeling of a Sonicare is a little off-putting to some people at first as it can cause a kind of tingling in the mouth from the rapid vibrations.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommended using these if you have the same problem as we did with our children and teeth-brushing.  :-)</li>
            <li> His teeth are finally getting clean like they are supposed to, and he&#x27;s brushing for the right amount of time.</li>
            <li> It has made it easy to teach them how to brush all four parts of their teeth (upper inside/outside, lower inside/</li>
            <li> They are very quiet and easy to use as well.</li>
            <li> Small head makes brushing her teeth safer and more comfortable for her.  </li>
            <li> If your children fall into those 2 different categories, then you can easily purchase only one as the heads come off easily</li>
            <li> All I need to share is that I can get my 9 year old to brush his teeth for the full 2 minutes twice every day now thanks to this toothbrush.   </li>
            <li> The cool cover choices &amp; fun sounds are just an extra bonus!</li>
            <li> The major difference between this and mine is that it has a more fun jingle that it plays every 30 seconds when it&#x27;s time to move to the next section of your mouth.  </li>
            <li> The handle is a bit large</li>
            <li> The replacement child sized heads are certainly pricey.</li>
            <li> If you are familiar with the adult versions of Sonicare brushes then this will have a familiar feel and operate similarly.</li>
            <li> and it has made our twice a day routine more fun and less of a hassle.  </li>
            <li> Short of holding him down and doing it myself, this is the next best thing!</li>
            <li> But, you don&#x27;t get many chances to make mistakes with the few teeth you have, so developing good brushing habits can save my kid from pain and discomfort down the road.  </li>
            <li> I have found out that when they don&#x27;t want to work like they used to , don&#x27;t run right out &amp; buy a new one until you try this.</li>
            <li> When you throw in some other features, this toothbrush is great for children, with minor exception, which I will revisit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It came with 3 different stickers so he could customize it when he first got it which made him excited to use it.</li>
            <li> Everything gets brushed thourough and quick!</li>
            <li> Yes, the colors/graphics are nice but not worth the cost of short-lived brushes!</li>
            <li> The 5 yr old girl thinks it tickles too  much!!</li>
            <li> Funny to see a 7 year old girl and two 9 year old boys so excited about brushing.</li>
            <li> The cost is not as high as it first seems,  </li>
            <li> I suggest you get the adult line of Sonicare for your kids and use the soft brush heads that are available for them.</li>
            <li> but it has an adult setting and the adult heads fit on it.</li>
            <li> Then there&#x27;s the fact that this toothbrush costs two-and-a-half times as much as the Oral-B does--or did.</li>
            <li> And, the product seems very well made and sturdy.</li>
            <li> They like the timer that tells them when to switch sides, the motion isn&#x27;t too much in the automatic toothbrush</li>
            <li> If I do, then I have to break another rule of going through the whole brushing sequence.  </li>
            <li> so we did the following:  1) gauze with alcohol free mouthwash  2)</li>
            <li> Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> and she wants to brush her teeth all the time.</li>
            <li> but I thought that was more of a plus than a minus (except for maybe the smallest hands).  </li>
            <li> we highly recommend this one!</li>
            <li> highly recommended!</li>
            <li> It is a bargain for the whole family.</li>
            <li> A shame really.</li>
            <li> Also, because we don&#x27;t have to move the brush head itself too much</li>
            <li> + (unless they&#x27;re very precocious of course).  </li>
            <li> - Personalizable plastic templates don&#x27;t adhere to the toothbrush very well.  </li>
            <li> it was worth the money, and I am getting another one for my five year old.</li>
            <li> This toothbrush has been a real God-send for us.</li>
            <li> My son does not even notice before he brush his teeth for the whole 2 minutes.</li>
            <li> It tickles their gums too much.  </li>
            <li> The brush has made it much easier for my daughter to brush her teeth.</li>
            <li> it makes i highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> All the replacement heads are much longer even the one for kids</li>
            <li> He even will brush much longer then the 2 minute cycle.  </li>
            <li> Our daughter had real difficulty brushing on the insides of her teeth, as well as the two front teeth (for some reason).  </li>
            <li> so your child can feel like a grownup yet still have gentle brush strokes.  </li>
            <li> Not too powerful for my 5 year old.</li>
            <li> Saw this at a brick/mortar store (way overpriced) and found here (reasonably priced).  </li>
            <li> The tooth brush really helps remove tartar and plaque and her teeth are whiter than ever.  </li>
            <li> certainly more thorough for our 3 boys, aged 5, 7, and</li>
            <li> really loves the vibration and now he even keeps up with his hygiene without me having to remind him to brush his teeth.  </li>
            <li> He&#x27;d let me brush his teeth for 5 minutes straight with this if I chose to (</li>
            <li> its so much easier to get her to brush now!!I</li>
            <li> recommend this highly!</li>
            <li> I was very, very pleased with this purchase and would recommend it to anyone with small children.</li>
            <li> My daughter really likes this toothbrush, and we like it because it gets her teeth cleaner.</li>
            <li> so , so much easier.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> and I am worried about when they switch the head, the tip is very pointed and if there is any horseplay then someone could get hurt.  </li>
            <li> (it&#x27;s short don&#x27;t worry, it&#x27;s not annoying)</li>
            <li> None that are real deal breakers</li>
            <li> It cleans my kids&#x27; teeth with no effort gently.</li>
            <li> This part breaks and the whole thing is no longer usable.</li>
            <li> This kids version seems to have used a travel charger (which doesn&#x27;t have a place to store the extra heads) and they just made a piece to fit over it.  </li>
            <li> The really bothersome part is that if the toothbrush is still on when you remove it from the mouth, it splats all over creation.  </li>
            <li> His teeth and gums are much healthier than when using a manual toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> Also brushing  his teeth is no longer a tearful chore but rather just a twice daily activity that he cheerfully does.</li>
            <li> Well worth the money...even on a ticklish 4 year old.</li>
            <li> Has music playing in segments to remind your kiddo to move the brush around the whole mouth.</li>
            <li> The battery hold up really well.</li>
            <li> It really does.</li>
            <li> , same size heads fit this kids model</li>
            <li> Much cheaper that way.</li>
            <li> My daughter loves it and wants to brush her teeth all the time.</li>
            <li> The melody increases in length until it plays the whole tune, which helps her focus on finishing.  </li>
            <li> Our kids really didn&#x27;t like brushing their teeth.  </li>
            <li> Moreover, the kids&#x27; teeth are so much cleaner then before when they used non-electronic tooth brushes.  </li>
            <li> She constantly wants to brush her teeth.</li>
            <li> Since there isn&#x27;t much room from the neck of the head to the bristles, I feel like I&#x27;m going to pull the bristles off at some point.</li>
            <li> Brushing teeth has never been so fun for my 6 yr old.</li>
            <li> and so we ended up buying her a normal toothbrush at first.</li>
            <li> You can really see the difference with the music tones</li>
            <li> My Oral-B toothbrushes have lasted much, much longer.</li>
            <li> Kids didn&#x27;t really care for this toothbrush</li>
            <li> We know that her teeth are getting cleaned well yet gently.  </li>
            <li> This has really helped with those problem areas.</li>
            <li> The whole family has a sonicare toothbrush.</li>
            <li> Product is as described and the &amp;#34;music&amp;#34; it makes really kept my daughter engaged in brushing; she loves it</li>
            <li> the timer function helps much.</li>
            <li> You just have to gently touch the teeth, and the brush does the work.  </li>
            <li> I bought the Philips Sonicare Standard Ultra Soft Sensitive, 3 Brush Heads and it fits nicely.</li>
            <li> thank you so much</li>
            <li> These brushes really helped.</li>
            <li> it cleans really well!happy with it</li>
            <li> It really increases brushing time.</li>
            <li> would highly recommend for kids!</li>
            <li> and so this really helps the brush get in between.  </li>
            <li> The kids enjoy using them, after set time periods they play musical sounds which makes them chuckle.</li>
            <li> My kids brush harder and are more mindful of how they care for their teeth with this.  </li>
            <li> It works really well.  </li>
            <li> because he did it completed the process lighting fast.</li>
            <li> As much of a pain as it is to get kids to brush their teeth, with the Sonicare for Kids they tell me they are going to brush their teeth.  </li>
            <li> The vibration is too much for my daughter</li>
            <li> They would complain that it &amp;#34;tickled&amp;#34; too much and not want to brush.  </li>
            <li> Was the one thing she really wanted.  </li>
            <li> Boys really like to use this electric toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> its just so much easier then trying to show them how manually.</li>
            <li> The brush was working really well - but the brush heads started falling out of the body of the toothbrush.</li>
            <li> I got tired of buying a electric toothbrush for my son every 2 months and this is great.  </li>
            <li> The beep telling them when to move to another area really does work</li>
            <li> The sound emitted during the brush is nowhere as loud as it is on the adult brush so that helps.  </li>
            <li> It is exactly the same as my \\&quot;adult\\&quot; version except it is in a cool color that he can change the face plate.</li>
            <li> My two year old even enjoys brushing his own teeth, though we go back over them with the timer on the short program just to be sure they were properly cleaned.</li>
            <li> Start them on healthy brushing habits early and it&#x27;ll benefit them their entire lives.</li>
            <li> Recently, after what I&#x27;m sure was almost 1500 cycles of use (two kids sharing handle night and day), the battery completely died.</li>
            <li> Recently, after what I&#x27;m sure was almost 1500 cycles of use (two kids sharing handle night and day), the battery completely died.</li>
            <li> The HX6053 (Sensitive), HX6023 (ProResults Compact), and HX6062/HX6063 (DiamondClean) brush heads also fit on both the adult FlexCare and this Kids model.</li>
            <li> On top of that, the barrel-shaped handle of the Kids model is also bigger in circumference than the adult model.  </li>
            <li> On top of that, the barrel-shaped handle of the Kids model is also bigger in circumference than the adult model.  </li>
            <li> It comes with several different faceplates and I let her pick her own one</li>
            <li> Took a few weeks but both are loving it.</li>
            <li> I know from using the similar adult version, that it cleans better than anything else we have used.</li>
            <li> I loved that at the beginning, it started out slow and worked up to the 2 minute brushing.  </li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t scientifically measure how much improvement it has over regular brush, but feels that it more effective as the vibration helps a better cleaning job, and timer helps kids to stay on brushing until the times up, instead of cutting it way</li>
            <li> We think Sonicare toothbrushes in general clean teeth better than other electric toothbrushes on the market.</li>
            <li> I have noticed a huge difference in how clean her teeth are and it frees me up a little because I don&#x27;t feel like I have to watch her as often.</li>
            <li> It gradually gets them to the entire 2 minutes with a very child friendly chime for each quadrant, then eventually stopping when the time has been achieved.  </li>
            <li> She does a pretty good job and at least she enjoys brushing now!  </li>
            <li> The three different decorative templates were certainly an enticement, and they had fun picking which one they wanted to use on it first</li>
            <li> The timer is great not only because he knows we will stop brushing when it is over, but since it uses multiple tones as the time passes he knows how long he has till it turns off.   </li>
            <li> The timer is great because it assures both her and me that she&#x27;s brushed long enough.  </li>
            <li> (he was so excited to open it and use it).</li>
            <li> Way better than any other toothbrush.</li>
            <li> : I love that the charger is compatible with other sonicare toothbrushes.</li>
            <li> Most of the other ones you buy with batteries in them still require manual brushing.</li>
            <li> It works well and cleans his teeth a lot better than his other toothbrush...</li>
            <li> Finally a kids toothbrush worth the money!</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s not covered under the warrantee because they only give warrantee from the original purchase date.  </li>
            <li> We bought the exact same one again b/c kids love it, but I wish it would last longer</li>
            <li> The Sonic Care does the job, but its not kid friendly enough.</li>
            <li> When I spend a lot of hard earned money on quality products, exceptional customer support is a requirement.  </li>
            <li> Now my 6 yr old is brushing on his own without me worrying if he is doing it right and for long enough.</li>
            <li> At low power, I would describe the buzzing sound as \\&quot;housefly\\&quot; volume, at high level</li>
            <li> The features most import to us: rechargeable, varied speeds, and the charm/music that plays very 30 sec, and the auto shut off after two minutes.  </li>
            <li> got it for my daughter&#x27;s training.&lt;br /&gt;she wont use it often, I found it has high very high vibrations even in lower</li>
            <li> My only complaints are that it would be nice to be able to buy the brush with just larger heads, since my kids are both big enough for them.  </li>
            <li> I am disappointed and as you know it is a great day when we brush more than 2 times a day.</li>
            <li> Although the learning and practice continues, now i know my kids are getting their teeth as clean as possible.</li>
            <li> Otherwise these are great and my dentist had less work to do on my teeth after I had used the adult model for several months.</li>
            <li> so we know when to switch to the next spot to clean.</li>
            <li> My daughter does not fuss any longer with the time needed to properly achieve a clean mouth.  </li>
            <li> I actually feel assured that my kids teeth are clean when I&#x27;m done brushing.</li>
            <li> My kids didnt want to brush their teeth long enough so the timer on it is really nice.</li>
            <li> This Sonicare brush is fair superior to the less expensive automatic toothbrush</li>
            <li> I was hesitant at first if this toothbrush would be better than other rechargeable brushes but having seen the results of my 8 year old&#x27;s teeth, I&#x27;m sold.  </li>
            <li> This toothbrush removed built on plaque that we couldn&#x27;t get off with other tooth brushes... it is SOOO worth the price to have some clean teeth kids</li>
            <li> On the other hand, my kid is at the lower end of the advertised age range for this product; older kids--I&#x27;d say six and up--would probably have a better time of it.</li>
            <li> This is a great product and is visually pleasing enough to encourage a four year old to use it on a regular basis.  </li>
            <li> Although it has little merit to the performance of the toothbrush, it made me feel like the company really did its homework to provide a good product starting with the packaging.  </li>
            <li> My seven year old has been brushing his own teeth without a lot of assistance for about a year and a half with the Oral-B rechargeable toothbrushes.  </li>
            <li> We got the first one along with the adult Sonicare system about March of last year and the adult system is still going strong.</li>
            <li> The kids enjoy brishing their teeth in the morning and know how long to brush with the timer.</li>
            <li> old daughter &amp; she absolutely LOVES it!</li>
            <li> The kids like the musical prompts and brush their teeth for the full two minutes.</li>
            <li> My 6 year old had to have her first filling this month</li>
            <li> Its a lot easier to monitor that they brushed their teeth for a full 2 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> No young kids are good at brushing (don&#x27;t believe those other moms and dads).</li>
            <li> It was a pin her down and listen to her scream experience that had to be repeated more than once a day since she had the beginnings of cavities at 12 months.  </li>
            <li> He has always been a good brusher but his front teeth were still a little yellow</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a new toy for their teeth!</li>
            <li> but I can not find a new toothbrush head to buy!</li>
            <li> , why do they act like it&#x27;s something new!</li>
            <li> Got a brand new system from my child&#x27;s orthodontist and after 2 months it stopped working!  </li>
            <li> We have had ours for more than a year and a half</li>
            <li> Quality is so much better than the knock of brands I had previously purchased that broke within a month of purchase</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using an Oral-B Buzz Lightyear rechargeable toothbrush on my four-year-old for a couple of years now; I wanted to see what benefits this model might have over the older unit.</li>
            <li> You could possibly find that your child actually asks to brush his or her teeth more</li>
            <li> I think the vibrant colors attract the kids.</li>
            <li> I think it would be better to have the entire handle white and then 2 panels for each gender.</li>
            <li> Although this children&#x27;s model uses a smaller brush head compared to the adult Sonicare models, the adult-sized brush heads can actually fit onto this children&#x27;s model.  </li>
            <li> With my Oral-B Professional, I also have a sound indicator to tell me when to move to a different quadrant</li>
            <li> It comes with 2 heads, one geared towards 4 year olds and one for older age 7.</li>
            <li> My kids love the fact that it comes with multiple heads and multiple colors.</li>
            <li> My son went from barely dragging his old toothbrush across his teeth for 30 seconds, to brushing for a full 2 mins.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It came with 2 brush heads, one for under 7 and one for older kids</li>
            <li> Comes with two sized heads and the base unit can hold two heads making it great for if you have more then one kid.</li>
            <li> This particular toothbrush is for children.  </li>
            <li> These toothbrushes are decent for kids.  </li>
            <li> I ended up using the brush head for older kids that came with it</li>
            <li> My ten year daughter, who would never spend more than 30 seconds brushing her teeth, now enjoys brushing her teeth and actually brushes three times a day now.</li>
            <li> So far they have been cavity free using this brush, mouthwash and occasional flossing.</li>
            <li> 7 year old loves it, and is highly motivated since he recently had to have a cavity filled.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Still, the above are small issues, because overall, this product does what it says, and what it should, which is: providing young kids with good, proper, and effective brushing.</li>
            <li> We bought this for our 7 yr old son because he doesn&#x27;t brush long enough on his own.  </li>
            <li> But, I found the larger one is pretty much exactly like my normal Sonicare head.</li>
            <li> It was easy for him to learn how to use it, it makes a sound when he needs to move it to a different part of his mouth and it plays a little jingle when he&#x27;s finished.</li>
            <li> Paying retail price for this just seemed too high.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this electric toothbrush for kids.</li>
            <li> After 4K in dental work on him, I have high expectations for the check-up.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Our dentist recommended this toothbrush for our 7 year old and it took a short time for him to get used to it versus the regular rotating tooth brushes, but it works great and gets soaking wet and still works.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend this toothbrush.</li>
            <li> highly recommended.</li>
            <li> Would highly recommend for the youngsters.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> Just to comment on some other reviews on this toothbrush: No child should be left to do his own brushing.</li>
            <li> and I can get more for my other child when he&#x27;s old enough.&lt;br</li>
            <li> it is a \\&quot;bumblebee\\&quot;, compared to the \\&quot;large bumblebee on steroids\\&quot; buzzing and vibration of the adult FlexCare model.  </li>
            <li> my more-expensive Sonicare FlexCare adult brush also had: (1) its handle is coated with a tacky non-slip rubbery coating with prominent knobby bumps along the handle to aid in better grip, whereas my FlexCare has a smooth plastic surface, and (2) a flattened part of the handle allows the brush to be laid down horizontally with the bristles facing upward, whereas if I lay my FlexCare horizontally, it may roll around and end up with its bristles touching the sink counter surface.  </li>
            <li> No cavities in her little mouth :)</li>
            <li> For his molars, I just let the brush head linger a little while more.</li>
            <li> Another thing that could concern me with a younger child is the way you change the power setting from the lower level (for 4-7) to the higher level is a simple button that is easily accessible to children.  </li>
            <li> Plays cute little music chime to let you know when to switch areas</li>
            <li> Chalk it up to too many fruit snacks, no flossing, not realizing Little Bear toothpaste had no flouride when toddlers and no city flouridated water.  </li>
            <li> On the other hand, if it helps kids brush better (and prevents cavities), especially in those too young to floss, it might be worth it.</li>
            <li> Most importantly it gets the job done with minimal screaming and little fists flying.</li>
            <li> After two and a half years of dental worries, surgeries, extractions, and cavities, my 3-yr-old daughter is finally officially cavity free!!</li>
            <li> my daughter saw how i was feeling about my sonicare flex plus and wanted one, now she is so excited about brushing her teeth every single time after she eats.</li>
            <li> For the longest time I was happy with that product, but had recently began noticing that my son had bad breath more often than normal.  </li>
            <li> I have been using the adult version and really like that as well.</li>
            <li> Has lasted much longer than my adult Sonicare.</li>
            <li> That is pretty lame in my opinion and an interchangeable faceplate would make much more sense for kids (especially if you had more than one kid using the brush).&lt;br</li>
            <li> The timer makes sure that the kids brush long enough.</li>
            <li> The musical cues along the way are fun</li>
            <li> I registered them with Phillips (which I normally don&#x27;t).  </li>
            <li> My son makes a big smile and we get in there, but I feel like we have to sort of jam it in there.  </li>
            <li> This toothbrush not only brushes better, but it also has a timer that helps him know how long to brush.   </li>
            <li> We did have a normal non-ultrasonic toothbrush that we bought for her before</li>
            <li> (it&#x27;s nice and small for her little mouth), and how easy it is to maneuver the brush for her.  </li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s slightly cumbersome to deal with the aforementioned issues but overall it does a great job of brushing those young teeth.  </li>
            <li> Older child is fine but younger child dislikes the vibration even on the low setting.</li>
            <li> Our 6 year old granddaughter loves her new Philips Sonicare would highly recommend!  </li>
            <li> Our almost 4 year old son loves his new \\&quot;power\\&quot; toothbrush and is very keen to brush his teeth morning and night.</li>
            <li> As was the case when I purchased my FlexCare brush shortly after it was introduced, I think that the price is a bit on the high side, but one could justify that it is worth the dental health benefits if it helps your child brush better and longer each time.plates mounted on it, it weighs the same 4.8 ounces as my adult model; once the faceplate is mounted onto the brush, its 5.0 ounce weight is actually heavier than my adult model.  </li>
            <li> The head seems a bit too big to get easily onto the upper and lower side gums.  </li>
            <li> Every single one of them promise to send out a replacement one free with a return box to return the old defective toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> Then later on, the brush did not work right no matter what I did.  </li>
            <li> The smaller brush head is just the right size for his mouth.  </li>
            <li> It only took our kids (ages 5 &amp; 7) a few days to get used to the vibration, and they love them!</li>
            <li> It still takes parents &amp; dental professionals to teach kids how to brush properly, but at least it helps to ensure a better clean.</li>
            <li> True, the large size makes it easier for a child who has yet to develop fine motor skills to manipulate, but the large size can also make it difficult to grasp.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> However, it didn&#x27;t take long for our 5 year old to be able to hold it properly without help.</li>
            <li> However the timer sound can not be turned off and is extremely annoying.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It is a little heavy for my son but works Great...</li>
            <li> The red one is the perfect size, the blue (bigger kid) size is still too big for my 6 years old mouth, so i just have two smaller red heads.&lt;br</li>
            <li> My 6 year old son actually enjoys brushing his teeth for the first time!</li>
            <li> I would like the bristles to be a little bit more soft, though.</li>
            <li> update when new models come out.  </li>
            <li> I was always buying new toothbrushes and just decided to splurge on these to save money on dental appointments.</li>
            <li> I son loves his new toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this two years now and it still works like new.  </li>
            <li> and it runs like new still.</li>
            <li> and they continue to work as if they were brand new.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Enjoy!hey continue to work as if they were brand new.  </li>
            <li> My kid hates the beep that the brush makes to indicate you need to switch to a new quadrant.  </li>
            <li> She&#x27;ll live though.</li>
            <li> We purchased a new one from BedBath&amp;Beyond</li>
            <li> My daughter loves brushing her teeth with her new Sonicare.  </li>
            <li> we&#x27;ve bought brand new $7.80 vibrating kids toothbrushes, new set of stickers for the kids to decorate and</li>
            <li> New faceplates used to come with the replacement heads as they need to be replaced just as often.  </li>
            <li> so we have 2 new units.</li>
            <li> /&gt;But now with these new electronic tooth brushes our kids get a \\&quot;kick\\&quot; out of brushing their teeth.  </li>
            <li> Replacement brushes are almost as much as a new unit.</li>
            <li> We sent this to him as a congratulations and incentive to take care of his new teeth.  </li>
            <li> I called Philips to ask for a new one or help figuring out the issue and all they could offer me was a discount code to buy a new one.  </li>
            <li> Really easy for kids to use buy they tend to get black and moldy under then replaceable tooth brush head.</li>
            <li> But I guess with less money to dentist, I can recover my cost easily.</li>
            <li> While this electric toothbrush removed plaque a lot better than a manual toothbrush, the bristles became uneven lengths and caused my two year old&#x27;s gums to bleed.  </li>
            <li> taken care of, but they actually have at least a reasonably good time during brushing.  </li>
            <li> The brush is soft and gentle on young teeth and enamel.</li>
            <li> But a big part of getting young children to brush their teeth is to make it fun and to make it something that they look forward to.    </li>
            <li> i love the slow and fast settings.</li>
            <li> When I took them to their dentist a few days later, she was thrilled that they had this already as she sold it in her office.    </li>
            <li> but my 6 year old can now handle the high speed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> On the high setting it is a diminutively sized adult Sonicare.</li>
            <li> you first begin using them the timer for brushing is short so that they can get used to the new feel of vibration.</li>
            <li> , I have the adult version and my brush stopped charging after 6 months of use and they sent me a replacement as well, but they also told me that the new brush is warranted until year 2, minus the 6 months for the original brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It has worked wonders and the dentist has noticed a marked improvement in his oral health!</li>
            <li> It tickled her at first but only took about a week to get used to it.</li>
            <li> I do have one concern; the toothbrush is designed for kids 4+, but I&#x27;m not sure if it would be safe to use with kids 4</li>
            <li> to do a better job than his ordinary toothbrush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Considering buying the adult version for myself!</li>
            <li> The first week she must have brushed her teeth 50 times.  </li>
            <li> I bought this toothbrush for my 6 year old daughter and she loves it!..</li>
            <li> I have 3 and 5 year old who use it!</li>
            <li> You simply plug in the charger and let the toothbrush charge for 24hrs before it&#x27;s first use.  </li>
            <li> My seven year old son always despised brushing his teeth - until NOW!  </li>
            <li> This tooth brush not only cleans better than any other on the market, it keeps my son entertained.  </li>
            <li> Their customer service was fine and they provided a replacement, which then died in less than one year</li>
            <li> It took a few weeks to teach him how to use it properly, but now I love that it gives him a guide for how long to brush his teeth, plus does a better job than just his regular brushing.</li>
            <li> First one died within 6 months and the 2nd died before the year was up.  </li>
            <li> Also I have to be be careful to put it flat on the teeth because the top and bottom sides are pointy.</li>
            <li> My 3 year old loves this!  </li>
            <li> I purchased this for my 6 year old granddaughter, &amp; she loves it!  </li>
            <li> Hope this review helps for those who are curious about the \\&quot;details\\&quot; and appreciate full disclosure.</li>
            <li> Even though we had been fastidious with dental hygiene prior to purchasing the Sonicares, I have noticed a big difference in how clean their teeth are.  </li>
            <li> In my opinion $50 is pricey for a toothbrush but the fact that it includes two interchangeable brush heads (one for younger, one for older kids) that suited the ages of my two children, helped me justify spending that much.  </li>
            <li> Even my kids, who are not great brushers, enjoy using it and say their teeth feel clean.</li>
            <li> I just wish they would make some cute and fun panels that would appeal to kids.&lt;br /&gt;Despite the expensive brush heads and boring panels, the bottom line is the Sonicare still works great, and clean teeth is worth the money!</li>
            <li> I got this for my 3 year old a year ago and now I have to get a new one.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I searched my local drugstore and other online stores and found that Amazon had the best price-almost 1/2 of what my drugstore was asking and $20 less than other online stores.</li>
            <li> Like many children, my daughter was not very good at \\&quot;estimating\\&quot;</li>
            <li> The big head (7+) does not fit very good in a small kid&#x27;s jaws.</li>
            <li> Big problem is the adorable adhesive faceplates eventually break down and need replacing.  </li>
            <li> My youngest son(6)has soft enamel and has been getting cavities since he was 2 years old!</li>
            <li> We would always have to stand there and supervise the kids to make sure they brushed for long enough, but these brushes automatically go for either 1 minute or 2 mintues.  </li>
            <li> OK, so i must admit that i have gotten really lazy brushing my 6 year old and 4 year old&#x27;s teeth.</li>
            <li> Well I can now say that while she still doesn&#x27;t love having her teeth brushed that this toothbrush has taken it from a scream fest to slight complaining.  </li>
            <li> She was so excited when she saw it that she could hardly wait the recommended 12 hours for the first charge.  </li>
            <li> Also the rubber on the back of the large brush head is peeling off.  </li>
            <li> I attribute it in large part to using this toothbrush for the last 9 months.  </li>
            <li> We certainly haven&#x27;t done anything else different.</li>
            <li> Worked great initially, but after less than two weeks all of the bristles fell out and the head cracked in half!</li>
            <li> Plus, he is able to focus on each individual tooth with little effort.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to explain how much better the kids&#x27; teeth look since they&#x27;ve been using the Sonicare.</li>
            <li> Other so called kid-models were bulky &amp; noisy that were quickly abandoned and thrown out.</li>
            <li> Other so called kid-models were bulky &amp; noisy that were quickly abandoned and thrown out.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to get him to brush the area that is most ticklish.  </li>
            <li> So much more fun and gentler for those timid children uncomfortable with brushing.</li>
            <li> It has some sort of clear peel that you peel off and the faceplate sticks to the front part of the toothbrush handle.    </li>
            <li> I have a 9yr old and a 4yr old who both use this toothbrush and it has been a life saver for my 9yr old.</li>
            <li> Philips says the toothbrush is quiet, and it is--but not that much quieter than the Oral-B.    </li>
            <li> We use our adult Sonicare UV sanitizer case to sanitize the kids brush heads as well.</li>
            <li> Our 4 yr old son loves this toothbrush.</li>
            <li> From about 1 yr old or</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re not missing spots when they&#x27;re brushing anymore</li>
            <li> Note however it is not \\&quot;sonic\\&quot; like Philips adult brushes, just mechanical.  </li>
            <li> My 5 yr old son loves brushing his teeth</li>
            <li> I bought this for my seven year old grandaughter.  </li>
            <li> The 3 year old just got his for his birthday because he wanted one just like his brother.</li>
            <li> East to handle even at 3 years old.</li>
            <li> I got this Sonicare toothbrush for my daughters (ages 10 and 7) who have been using an adult Braun Oral B electric toothbrush for almost 2 years now.  </li>
            <li> (it doesn&#x27;t vibrate too much but just enough).</li>
            <li> My 5 year old loves this toothbrush.</li>
            <li> It is possible to share, though, for kids who are are capable of that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My 4 year old son loves it.</li>
            <li> I have an adult version of Sonicare</li>
            <li> One for our 7 yr old and one for our 4 yr old.</li>
            <li> My 9 year old loves this.  </li>
            <li> Now our whole family have switched from the traditional manual brush to Sonicare series.</li>
            <li> Ordered this for my 7 yr old son.  </li>
            <li> Since we buy replacement heads for our adult toothbrush in bulk at Amazon so they are cheaper, it works out well.</li>
            <li> Purchased this for use for shared use by and 8 and 4 year old.   </li>
            <li> My 8 year old son used to spend all of 15 seconds brushing his teeth.</li>
            <li> We bought this for my 6 year old daughter and she loves it.  </li>
            <li> This toothbrush really helped (although she initially argued that it was \\&quot;wrong\\&quot; and that she had been brushing longer).      </li>
            <li> 6 years old girl like it.</li>
            <li> My six year old son has been using this for about 2 months now.  </li>
            <li> My three year old loves</li>
            <li> (well, the 2 year old is a bit young according to the product but he loves it</li>
            <li> By comparison, our Oral B is now four + years old and we have had no issues with its transmission, motor or battery life.</li>
            <li> old son.</li>
            <li> Her parents have tried nearly everything they can think of: stories, songs, videos while brushing, and nothing has worked all that well.  </li>
            <li> Our daughter got this for christmas 2013 when she was 4 years old.</li>
            <li> Wish I could have professionally personalized with their names.</li>
            <li> After a year, so far so good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> it beeps alot, but my 2 yer old loves that hers is like moms.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;ve tossed their old battery-operated brushes, and are all about these.</li>
            <li> Wow, you need to buy this thing.  </li>
            <li> I like this brush even then the adult version.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s gentle enough for kids!</li>
            <li> I had wanted to introduce my 4yr old to an electric toothbrush in order to improve his cavities problem.</li>
            <li> toothbrush works just like the adult ones, though I wish you could turn the volume off and on.</li>
            <li> We bought this for our 8 and 5 year old sons.  </li>
            <li> My son (the 6 year old) even said he created a system to change sides of his mouth when the song changes.</li>
            <li> I bought this brush for my 13year old and</li>
            <li> 8.5 than them using their old brushes.</li>
            <li> I have an adult version recommended to me by my dentist years ago</li>
            <li> My 7 and 4 year old kids loves it.</li>
            <li> He may grow into it, or not, but I would suggest you test out an adult vibrating toothbrush on your young child before shelling out the bucks for this one.  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t know if the grandkids would use it, but they have surprised me.  </li>
            <li> So far no cavities.</li>
            <li> My 5 year old loves to brush her teeth now.</li>
            <li> My 7 yr old son loves this toothbrush and it has made brushing easier</li>
            <li> I have been using the adult version for about 5 yrs.</li>
            <li> Usually my 8 yr old and the 10 year old</li>
            <li> I used the adult version of those for years with no issues</li>
            <li> We were having some problems getting our 5 year old to brush thoroughly and this solved the issue.</li>
            <li> He is 4 years old.  </li>
            <li> My 5 year old son loves his toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> I also have both the Sonicare FlexCare and FlexCare Plus adult toothbrushes, both of which can use model HX6013 (ProResults) brush heads, and the HX6013 brush heads also work on this kid&#x27;s version.</li>
            <li> They were &#x27;fast&#x27; brushers and this is helping them brush the proper ammount of time.</li>
            <li> We have a 5 and a 9yr old.  </li>
            <li> After a much postponed trip to a dentist for myself and found out that I need LOTS of dental work, I didn&#x27;t want the same for my kids</li>
            <li> The toothbrush works just like the adult version</li>
            <li> The brush heads are sold as two packs for 5yrs old or 7+.  </li>
            <li> My 4.5 year old son uses this by himself and loves it.  </li>
            <li> So I am hoping to get as much use as possible out of this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> 9 year old squealed with glee when she saw the toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> So, just remember that the toothbrush will look beat up with old adhesive on faceplate once the sticker comes off.  </li>
            <li> My dad got this for my seven-year old son.  </li>
            <li> I have an adult version for myself</li>
            <li> he has a sensitive mouth,  </li>
            <li> I bought this for my 6 year old and his 3 year old brother.</li>
            <li> so we decided to also get it for our 4.5 yr old son.  </li>
            <li> I purchased this as a stocking-stuffer for my seven year old daughter.</li>
            <li> My 3 year old could not yet.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used the adult Sonicare for 3 years</li>
            <li> have owned an adult sonicare for years and haven&#x27;t had a cavity since I started</li>
            <li> it really does tickle them (I tried it on myself).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I started on low speed</li>
            <li> My daughter just turned 4 years old</li>
            <li> I would but this for an adult as well</li>
            <li> We bought this toothbrush for our six year old son.   </li>
            <li> Contact Philips directly for replacements (under warranty).</li>
            <li> With my 10 yr old granddaughter it went off too fast,so&lt;br /&gt;it chimed 7 or 8 times making her not want to use it.</li>
            <li> My 6 year old grandson wanted an electric toothbrush like his dad&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> well just completely unacceptable.  </li>
            <li> My son loves this brush because it \\&quot;sings\\&quot; and tells him when he&#x27;s halfway there, and then near the end and then at the end.</li>
            <li> - initially we were done really fast - but that got him used to the brush.</li>
            <li> He says it is gentler than the adult version we have.</li>
            <li> My 5-year old daugher loves brushing with this toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> I bought this for my 4 yr old, who has a tendency to skimp on thorough brushings.  </li>
            <li> so they get a complete brushing.</li>
            <li> My wife and I have basically the adult version (Sonicare HealthyWhite HX6711/02) of this product</li>
            <li> The adult version my wife and</li>
            <li> If this problem was fixed, I&#x27;d buy it</li>
            <li> I bought this for my 4 year old daughter for christmas</li>
            <li> The real test, I suppose, will come next month during the boys&#x27; dental checkup.</li>
            <li> We got this for our eight year old.</li>
            <li> If I had one more &#x27;complaint&#x27;, it would be the panels.</li>
            <li> Purchased for my 3 1/2 yr old grandson and he loves it.  </li>
            <li> \\&quot;MY PROFESSIONAL</li>
            <li> This one was purchased for my 4 year old.  </li>
            <li> This toothbrush was bought for my 9 year old.</li>
            <li> (it was identical in size to the adult heads</li>
            <li> I have had my adult Oral B electric toothbrush for over 5 years</li>
            <li> My 5 year old uses this</li>
            <li> My eight year old loves brushing his teeth with this brush.</li>
            <li> so far no problem.</li>
            <li> By the way, I bought it for my 11 years old son and I ended up using it as well.</li>
            <li> Both my 7 &amp; 8 year old sons used to dread brushing their teeth.  </li>
            <li> My children always wanted to try my adult sonicare</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am in my early 70&#x27;s yet</li>
            <li> It send out music tone during stages, My 5 year old granddaughter loves it.  </li>
            <li> It gets the job done and has a shorter run time than an adult version (which we also have for the grown-ups).</li>
            <li> However, our daughter complains that it &amp;#34;beeps too much&amp;#34; and the beeps are fairly loud.</li>
            <li> My 5 year old loves that he has a toothbrush like mom and dad.</li>
            <li> Our Grandson has started losing his baby teeth and adult teeth are now coming in.  </li>
            <li> so far no issues</li>
            <li> Although not recommended for children so young, we use this on our 2 year old daughter.</li>
            <li> I have a 5 and 8 year old.</li>
            <li> We have an 8 yr old and a 3 1/2 yr old.  </li>
            <li> Have been using this with our 3.5 year old upon dentists rec.</li>
            <li> We use the adult Sonicare</li>
            <li> We purchased these toothbrushes for our 5 and 7 year old.  </li>
            <li> We use the lower speed for my 5 year and the faster speed for the 7 year old.</li>
            <li> It helps me keep track of whether they&#x27;ve turned it off early or not.</li>
            <li> My child (7 years old) likes it also.  </li>
            <li> I really don&#x27;t even care about the extra money.</li>
            <li> and I MIGHT have neglected to show her how to turn the thing off early</li>
            <li> may think this is a bit of an expense for a child, but the benefits outweigh the cost by far.  </li>
            <li> So the $90+tax toothbrush becomes a bathroom decoration until we decide if its worth the hassle to RMA it back to Philips if the next one is going to go out on us within a year.  </li>
            <li> The only thing I wish were different is that the colorful front panels are stick-on and I wish they were snap</li>
            <li> Once he got the hang of it, it became kind of a game for him.</li>
            <li> The old model is too mess to clean.  </li>
            <li> Each section (upper left, upper right, lower left and lower right) gets 30 seconds of brushing since every 30 seconds</li>
            <li> Very useful tool for our disabled daughter.  </li>
            <li> If it were better designed for a kid, it&#x27;d be about half as long (or even shorter).</li>
            <li> If you have an older child - my son is eight - you may have a hard time convincing him to use the smaller brush head like I did.</li>
            <li> A little pricey but worth it!</li>
            <li> Small, easy for a child to handle.</li>
            <li> We&#x27;ve used them for my son for a while now, but they only work well when the battery is very new, and the power runs down quickly.</li>
            <li> My son loves it and is becoming such a diligent little tooth brusher.  </li>
            <li> We purchased two Sonicare for Kids Toothbrushes for our children seven months ago in hopes of improving the oral hygiene, especially our 5 year old daughter who had her first cavities last summer.</li>
            <li> Other than that it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li> My 10 year old got this for his one expensive b-day present, and thank goodness he liked it!</li>
            <li> It has a two different power levels (low power for 4+ and high power for 7+ years old), and in both power levels, both the vibration of the handle and the buzzing sound is far less than than my adult FlexCare model.  </li>
            <li> The first time she used it, we think it knocked a tooth loose</li>
            <li> It now only works for the first cycle and stops when it is supposed to beep to let the child know to move on to the next section of teeth.  </li>
            <li> a long-time user of Sonicare electric toothbrushes (I am currently using their FlexCare), this product marks Philips&#x27; first foray into making a similar toothbrush for kids.  </li>
            <li> This added length, weight, and thickness of the brush handle may make it more cumbersome to use for smaller kids or those with small hands.  </li>
            <li> This added length, weight, and thickness of the brush handle may make it more cumbersome to use for smaller kids or those with small hands.  </li>
            <li> ie: shorter for younger child and longer for older child - BOTH</li>
            <li> The brush head comes in 2 sizes, one for older and younger children.  </li>
            <li> operate the brush in the kids mouths and while this brush worked it did a nice job and in a small mouth where I could let the brush do the brush strokes in the harder to reach</li>
            <li> The power (in both modes) and the time (in the low power mode) are ramped up over the first several uses to allow people to get used to it.</li>
            <li> (they come with 3 different colored fronts to peel and stick) and toothbrushing is fun with the sounds that let them know how long to brush for.  </li>
            <li> It comes with different &amp;#34;stickers&amp;#34; to make the handle a different color - my kids have never been interested in this piece of it.</li>
            <li> If your child doesn&#x27;t like a lot of beeps- which are meant to give guidance on how long to brush certain areas of teeth- you might reconsider.</li>
            <li> like the kid-sized brush, which fits his little mouth well, and the adjustable power/speed, though I will say that, for younger kids, it&#x27;s way too easy for them to change the setting/restart, even if you&#x27;re supervising their brushing as instructed.</li>
            <li> Only time will tell but I want to make sure that the faceplate doesn&#x27;t come loose over time since it&#x27;s used in a wet environment.</li>
            <li> This leads me to believe it is overpriced about $50 too high at the current cost.  </li>
            <li> There are also two settings -- low and high --</li>
            <li> I highly recommend especially for a child around 5 years or so.</li>
            <li> My daughters have never brushed for so long, in fact I&#x27;ve often caught them going through two brush cycles because they like the musical sounds and the clean feeling.  </li>
            <li> *2 DIFFERENT sized toothbrush heads:  1 red smaller toothbrush head for children who are UNDER 7yrs old (4-6yrs old) and 1 slightly larger light blue toothbrush head for children who are 7+ yrs old.    </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve definitely become a loyal, lifelong customer</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve definitely become a loyal, lifelong customer</li>
            <li> They are push-on and pull-off brushes and the fit is pretty tight -- much too hard for a 5-yr-old to do by himself.  </li>
            <li> They love the fun tones that play every 30 sec and treat it like a game to get up to the 2 min timer.</li>
            <li> The timer settings to let kids know how long to brush each area of their mouth is also really helpful</li>
            <li> which did not have small tips available.</li>
            <li> works great and the noised to notify time left to brush are neat  not too much power that it is painful.</li>
            <li> She was not good at manual brushing and as many times as I tried to teach her</li>
            <li> The toothbrush functions well and is exactly what I expected though.</li>
            <li> Also the decorative panels (3) are 2 dark blue ones and 1 bright yellow which seems geared towards little boys.</li>
            <li> - Since brush heads are geared for different ages, perhaps the boxes would be packed with heads geared only for a certain age range.  </li>
            <li> After watching his sister getting brushed with the sonicare, he walked right up and popped his mouth open to be brushed too, and that has continued ever since!</li>
            <li> My kids each took some time to get used to the vibration intensity (even though it has two settings, one for 4 and older and the other for 7 and older)</li>
            <li> I thought that would get annoying at first and was ready to spend the extra cash for another, but its been super easy just changing out the heads that I wont need to.</li>
            <li> They like the musical tones that tell them to switch to a new brushing area (top,inside,bottom,inside).  </li>
            <li> does it several times a day as a result of the new toothbrush...</li>
            <li> almost threw ours out but decided to discharge it as above &amp; they again work like new.</li>
            <li> The last thing I am going to do is buy a NEW one after the &amp;#34;old&amp;#34; one broke after 2 months of use.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t last as long as the first one.  </li>
            <li> This toothbrush has two power modes for different ages, reducing the chance that the toothbrush injures young gums and teeth; a rubber over-mold on the brush also helps reduce the risk of damage to young teeth and gums.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I was surprised at the adult size of the handle, especially for a 4 y.o.&#x27;s  use.</li>
            <li> But, they don&#x27;t use the timer consistently and two minutes is a long time for a child (especially if they&#x27;re thinking about doing something else).  </li>
            <li> br /&gt;It has a low setting for smaller kids that is not as intense, but still cleans her teeth</li>
            <li> An adult usIng a toothbrush designed for a child or younger adult?</li>
            <li> The low setting is gentle enough.</li>
            <li> I debated on ordering such a high end toothbrush for my 4 year old, but after what he went through at his last dentist visit (Dr. found a cavity on his front tooth)</li>
            <li> And, for the very young, even the low power mode can be off-putting in their mouths.</li>
            <li> tells when she has brushed long enough and bedtime seemed to be fun.</li>
            <li> Another parent sitting next to me when we were discussing this actually had the same exact issue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s compact for little hands, easy to use, and the musical chime ensures a proper 2-minute brushing.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s compact for little hands, easy to use, and the musical chime ensures a proper 2-minute brushing.</li>
            <li> The 5 year old uses the low power mode and has the smaller brush designed for younger kids and the older one use the bigger brush and high power.</li>
            <li> There is just no other product out there that leaves your teeth feeling as slick and clean as a Sonicare.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s little noises, it&#x27;s made brushing his teeth not just &amp;#34;part of the routine&amp;#34; but actually fun.</li>
            <li> I wish you could choose either two brush heads for older children (basically identical to the regular brush head) or two brush heads for younger children.</li>
            <li> and the head is nice and small and fits in her little mouth</li>
            <li> I am glad I spent the little extra for the Sonicare!</li>
            <li> And it has a little kids and big kids setting and brush, which is really useful because i have a 2 year old brother.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure whether it&#x27;s the buzzy tickling sensation or the musical tones, but it&#x27;s made the whole routine much more tolerable for one little girl.  </li>
            <li> Overall, I agree with the other positive reviews but wanted to add two unexpected issues.  </li>
            <li> it).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I removed one star from this review, because, in my observations, it seems the handle isn&#x27;t MUCH smaller than adult size models, and the littlest grandkid just made it, when it came to holding the handle.</li>
            <li> We&#x27;ve gone through two of these so far and the second just stopped working.</li>
            <li> It has two modes to work him up to the 2 minute mark, and loud sounds to let him know to switch to a different quadrant of his mouth.</li>
            <li> Back to the trusty old Oral B for us.</li>
            <li> We use it on both our 3 year old daughter and our 2 year old boy (red head for the girl, blue for the boy).</li>
            <li> The 2 year warranty is the same as the adult versions.</li>
            <li> Both boys brush regularly, but obviously were missing something important.</li>
            <li> My 4 years old loves it and it has music on 30 second intervals.  </li>
            <li> The only thing is you have to buy adult brushes...</li>
            <li> They all have the same half-circle hole inside the brush head that slides onto the half-circle stem on the adult FlexCare or Kids brush.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Without having any of the three supplied faceplates mounted on it, it weighs the same 4.8 ounces as my adult model; once the faceplate is mounted onto the brush, its 5.0 ounce weight is actually heavier than my adult model.  </li>
            <li> The faceplate is mounted to the toothbrush by way of a very sticky adhesive backing, so I do not really think of it as being \\&quot;interchangeable\\&quot; as advertised.  </li>

            <li> I got his as a gift for my grandkids, especially the 7 yr old boy who Hates to brush.&lt;br /&gt;He</li>
            <li> This toothbrush has been helpful in getting my 4 year old, who doesn&#x27;t like to brush, to actually get it done.  </li>
            <li> To prevent this, remove the brush head after each use, rinse the main unit and inside the brush head and let them both sit apart till they dry.</li>
            <li> it works same as adult electric toothbrushes.</li>
            <li> Shipping was on time actually a day or two early.</li>
            <li> The only thing I don&#x27;t like is that it did not come with a travel case like the adult versions do.</li>
            <li> He is five years old next month.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t get my 5 year old son to brush longer than about 30 seconds with a regular toothbrush without a struggle.</li>
            <li> I use this brush for my two kids, the big brush head for my 11 year old and the smaller one for my 5 year old.  </li>
            <li> my two yr old tolerates it enough for me to just do the moving through the zones.</li>
            <li> Used by our seven year old, prior to this automatic brush her mom and</li>
            <li> Otherwise the outside part of upper teeth won&#x27;t be brushed very well.</li>
            <li> Though it&#x27;s not cheap, it was well worth the purchase.</li>
            <li> We had tried the cheaper oral-B electric toothbrushes and though the kids liked the characters on them, the brush heads were so bulky that it was difficult to get on the cheek side of the teeth and the quality of brushing doesn&#x27;t even begin to compare to the sonicare.</li>
            <li> The brushes are kind of expensive.</li>
            <li> The timer is really great, it slowly build on the time of each previous brushing, it chimes when it&#x27;s time to move from the upper outside to the inner outside,</li>
            <li> My 5 year old could use this properly right away with very little direction.  </li>
            <li> (w/ new brush heads of course) for a younger sibling since the current price point is around 70.</li>
            <li> kids came down with strep throat shortly after I replaced them, and I really didn&#x27;t want to throw the new brushes away.  </li>
            <li> Everyone loves the usability and I love the fact that its easy to drop on its base so that its charged every time you need to use it.  </li>
            <li> After about a month, there is at least a 80% reduction in the stain and more importantly no new ones.  </li>
            <li> She loves her new toothbrush and we no longer have to fight with our eldest about how long she has to brush because the timer is built in.  </li>
            <li> I have two separate heads for ours and use it on both my 4 yr old and 2 yr old without a single tear.  </li>
            <li> She was somewhat surprised at how long two minutes really is, although I would constantly nag her that she hadn&#x27;t brushed anywhere near that long.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s the tones it makes while it&#x27;s operating or the smaller kid friendly design, but she loves it.  </li>
            <li> Our older child needed the larger one, and our younger child the smaller one.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my 3 year old - who has always been very cooperative when it comes to brushing his teeth - and I noticed within just a few days of using it that there was a considerable amount of plaque/residue left on his teeth after brushing.</li>
            <li> There are various suppliers of after-market skins and covers for personal electronics, but I doubt that there is a high enough of a demand for personalizing electric toothbrush handles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li> In today&#x27;s electronic world, I think kids are always excited for electronic type devices, at least my boys are.  </li>
            <li> This seems a dead giveaway that Philips simply slapped a pretty paint job on one of its adult models, added some kid-friendly sounds, and called it a kid&#x27;s toothbrush.    </li>
            <li> This \\&quot;Sonicare for Kids\\&quot; is heavier and bulkier than the adult Sonicare models and the added weight and bulk are undoubtedly due to the rubbery non-slip grip that completely wraps around the handle (which the adult models lack), but you would think that a \\&quot;Kids\\&quot; toothbrush would be smaller and lighter in weight.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li> This is about 30% cheaper than the regular adult version, but it works just the same.</li>
            <li> (If anyone from Philips reads this: I want my next adult Sonicare to have the same non-slip grip with knobby bumps, horizontal brush rest, and lower noise level too!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It also has the same drawbacks as all Sonicare products, namely it&#x27;s pricey (though not as $$$ as the adult models), especially when you&#x27;re talking about something for a youngster.</li>
            <li> Makes you hesitant to buy the more expensive adult products.  </li>
            <li> However, my son values the tooth brush more, so he takes brushing teeth very serious now.</li>
            <li> First switch would often not engage, then the typical internal shafts breakage occurred.</li>
            <li> , i have the adult sonic care and wish they made soft headed brushes (the red/blue part) because it doesnt hurt if we hit his other teeth with it on mistake while brushing the bottom.</li>
            <li> So far no objection from my ultra sensitive autistic boy who could not tolerate the adult version of Philips sonic toothbrush.</li>
            <li> It vibrates instead of rotates, as the Oral-B does, and if I don&#x27;t press the brushhead to the teeth pretty firmly, it tickles his gums.</li>
            <li> The first few times he used it I had to help him</li>
            <li> Our dentist encouraged us to get this nice toothbrush for our daughter because her baby teeth are ridged and needed extra scrubbing care that is difficult to get with a regular toothbrush.</li>
            <li> advice is to focus on the molars in kids mainly as those last until 10 years old before falling out, whereas the front ones fall out early so even a small cavity isn&#x27;t that big of a deal.</li>
            <li> They stay on via an adhesive strip so if my children want to swap one color for another I have to peel the old one off with no apparent way to get it back on if they want to go back to that color.</li>
            <li> The dentist was shocked at the state of his teeth, since he&#x27;s never had a cavity and generally does a really good job brushing.</li>
            <li> This toothbrush works fine, but went dead after less than two years.  </li>
            <li> Hopefully they&#x27;ll spend a few more minutes brushing than in the past since this has a built in timer.</li>
            <li> We have been a Sonicare family for a long time...using the regular adult version with a different color coded brush head for everyone.  </li>
            <li> It is broken right after a year of normal use.  </li>
            <li> And you want to do it fast to make it easier on you and your little one.  </li>
            <li> The little incremental noises let him know how much longer he needs to brush and when brush time is over.</li>
            <li> I originally had a hard time getting him to want to brush his teeth but after using this he loves it!</li>
            <li> The new replacement is working, but if it fails again they only warranty for 2 years total including the time period using the original brush.  </li>
            <li> Specially because the speed of this little toothbrush is much less than the ones for adults.</li>
            <li> My 7 yr old son never wanted to brush his teeth (and certainly not for 2 mins)</li>
            <li> My only complaint would be that right after I ordered it I saw it at Wal Mart for a cheaper price.</li>
            <li> One for younger children (little tots) and one for older kids.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Secondly, the plastic shield that protects the bristles of the brush does not easily come off when you&#x27;re ready to use it.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;d probably wait until they were a little older, but we&#x27;ll use them all eventually.</li>
            <li> Will need to try again when they are a little older.</li>
            <li> I expected a little resistance since it also took a little while for me to get used to the strong vibrations.</li>
            <li> Not sure how long brushes will last, but it is so much higher quality and cost efficient than all those \\&quot;spin\\&quot; brushes we&#x27;ve brought that I am embarrassed to say we ever even bought them.  </li>
            <li> One of the 5 year old twins lets us use it on him but doesn&#x27;t want to use it himself, and the other twin still refuses to use it altogether.</li>
            <li> to clarify, one of the brush heads is for 4-7 years old usage and the other one for 7+.</li>
            <li> They even thought of making the back of the handle flat so that it doesn&#x27;t roll off the sink while applying toothpaste.</li>
            <li> They even thought of making the back of the handle flat so that it doesn&#x27;t roll off the sink while applying toothpaste.</li>
            <li> the price still is a little high.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a cheap skate so spending this much on toothbrush for my son was very difficult.  </li>
            <li> few visits over the past 2 years problem free.</li>
            <li> It ensures he brushes long enough, and gets to places a regular brush just doesn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> , there&#x27;s no guessing if he brushed for long enough!</li>
            <li> After a few weeks it has stopped working at full speed as if its battery was dying so we had no use for it after a few weeks.</li>
            <li> The handle is too large for some small hands.  </li>
            <li> It has two sizes of heads, small and large, so kids of any age can use it.  </li>
            <li> even though it tickles his lips and gum very very much he still uses it without complaint.  </li>
            <li> After trying a couple of times to brush my young toddler&#x27;s teeth with mine, I realized the adult version is just too intense and scary for him, so I resorted to the regular manual tooth brush for him.  </li>
            <li> It works well, &amp; is small enough to fit into a little mouth!  </li>
            <li> The unit is only slightly shorter in length compared to my adult FlexCare toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> I brought my first sonicare in the late ninties and have brought them as gifts for my children and now my grandchildren.  </li>
            <li> Not sure is was really working that well either.</li>
            <li> Does Philips suggest milk bones for the flat parts?  </li>
            <li> brush handle is long enough for a parent to hold on and help (which we</li>
            <li> no matter how long he brushed.  </li>
            <li> So you can use any brush head as long as the connector is the same type.  </li>
            <li> long lasting battery (between charges).</li>
            <li> /&gt;The reason it didn&#x27;t get 5 stars is because I&#x27;m not suer how long it will last.</li>
            <li> Great!!!!!The battery life seems to be lasting a long time.</li>
            <li> , you know that they are brushing for a long enough duration.  </li>
            <li> The two valued timer function lets me know when I have brushed long enough.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This took all the battle away from brushing long enough (been using for about a month).  </li>
            <li> complaint about the former (front plate) is that they&#x27;re not really that useful.</li>
            <li> It plays a little tune when it&#x27;s time to move to a new section of the mouth and increases the brush time gradually.</li>
            <li> The coolest feature is the  little music chime that goes off four times to tell them when to brush a new section of their mouths.</li>
            <li> adult version of Sonicare broke down twice within the warranty time.</li>
            <li> They are still struggling brushing down near the gumline, but this has always been an issue-</li>
            <li> i bought this for my 20 month old grandaughter and she won&#x27;t put it down.  </li>
            <li> After the first week using the new brush, so many disgusting things have been scrubbed off of our mirrors and out the sink.  </li>
            <li> Curious children may push the button and end up brushingtheir teeth with either too much power or too little power.  </li>
            <li> It is pretty expensive to buy, but the long term cost is probably not much more than the cheap battery brushes.</li>
            <li> The Philip&#x27;s soft traveling case has a lot to be desired, it allows the toothbrush to turn on in the luggage because it is a soft case unlike our Oral B hard travel cases.  </li>
            <li> I hope it will last for a long time!</li>
            <li> course, the silly sound does not get teeth brushed.  </li>
            <li> This toothbrush is well designed and is easy to grip especially in small hands.</li>
            <li> she is less than 7 years old.</li>
            <li> On nights when they are extremely tired or grouchy, I can&#x27;t do a quick brushing (just to maintain the rule of brushing every night).  </li>
            <li> We finally can brush every single tooth for him without struggling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> SO FAR, it seems to be sealed tightly</li>
            <li> +, we only needed to buy one and both kids use the same base with their own individual brush heads.</li>
            <li> My dentist sells this brush at his office, only more expensive!</li>
            <li> I usually offer him the choice of which toothbrush to use, and he picks the older model about 75 percent of the time.    </li>
            <li> a little bit of getting the hang of it for a 4 year old.      </li>
            <li> It gives little beeps just like the adult sonicare.</li>
            <li> - A little loud if everyone is trying to sleep, but I would still purchase it.</li>
            <li> He was afraid of it at first, but after a few days he was excited about it.  </li>
            <li> Because my husband and I have the adult ones, she feels like an adult when brushing her teeth and takes her brushing seriously.  </li>
            <li> I wish the button that indicates whether it is a small child or older child brushing (this determines the difference in how long each child brushes...</li>
            <li> /&gt;The different settings seem to brush at the same speed, the only difference i noted is that one brushes for 15 sec intervals and the other for 30.</li>
            <li> This product makes it so much easier for kids to get those hard to get to spots.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little ticklish on them the first few times (as it was with ours).  </li>
            <li> (this one actually plays a little musical tone instead of just a different vibration).  </li>
            <li> The other thing is that it comes with two sizes of toothbrush heads - one for little kids and one for older kids.</li>
            <li> Of course the novelty and newness will wear off, but long term he won&#x27;t mind using the toothbrush at all.  </li>
            <li> I have a son with a developmental disability, and he long needed parent help.</li>
            <li> The chimes let her know when to switch and long chime at the end lets her know when she is done.</li>
            <li> long run.</li>
            <li> but in the long run the value is there.</li>
            <li> It has a built in timer, so she knows how long to brush.  </li>
            <li> My daughter Emily used to make every excuse about brushing her teeth.</li>
            <li> This brush cost a lot, but the charge lasts a long time, and no batteries to replace when it does need a charge.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The charge lasts a long time too.</li>
            <li> Both my kids have used this brush for a long time.</li>
            <li> My husband and I are sonicare users for a long time.</li>
            <li> so kids know how long to brush.</li>
            <li> Should of bought this a long time ago....</li>
            <li> so kids know how long to brush each area of mouth - works well.</li>
            <li> Both my wife and I have been long time users of Sonicare toothbrushes and decided to purchase this for our children.</li>
            <li> so he knows how long he has to brush.</li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t realize how long 2 minutes is with a manual tooth brush until you practice this.</li>
            <li> Sometimes she complains that it hurts, so I have to try keep it moving and not to do it too long on one area.</li>
            <li> Long battery life.</li>
            <li> the kids love it - they hate brushing until the end of the music but that just shows how they normally would be stopping too soon.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good idea every once in a while to take off the refillable and rinse around the base of the metal bar.  </li>
            <li> when it came to the brush your teeth fight with my kids i would have to hold them down and try and get them to open long enough to scrub scrub without them biting the brush</li>
            <li> BTW, I &amp;#34;stalked&amp;#34; this item in my Amazon cart/save for later until the price dropped down to the low 30s.  </li>
            <li> The entire back of the faceplate is covered with strong adhesive which is very difficult to peel off once applied.</li>
            <li> , it is less expensive, and has a more robust handle.  </li>
            <li> You get a yellow one, a blue one, and a black one.</li>
            <li> To prevent this, after use, rinse off the unit then set it down on a flat surface parallel to the surface.</li>
            <li> It also plays a little tune to tell the child to switch to the next area to be brushed...</li>
            <li> The Sonicare makes it simple for them, with the little musical tone every 15 seconds or so</li>
            <li> other reviewers have mentioned, it has two modes - one minute mode for younger brushers - it plays a note every 15 seconds.</li>
            <li> Not only does it play little ring  tones to remind her to keep the brush moving around in her mouth but comes with a couple different snap on covers she likes to change around.  </li>
            <li> After reading other reviews, we purchased three toothbrushes so they wouldn&#x27;t have to change the heads (which I know would lead to taking off a brother&#x27;s and leaving it lying on the counter - gross!).</li>
            <li> The three supplied faceplate panels are lacking in originality and pizazz in an age when kids can personalize their MP3 players, cell phones, and other personal electronics using a myriad of interchangeable faceplates or skins.  </li>
            <li> The three supplied faceplate panels are lacking in originality and pizazz in an age when kids can personalize their MP3 players, cell phones, and other personal electronics using a myriad of interchangeable faceplates or skins.  </li>
            <li> but it seems that if it was meant for smaller hands, the device would be smaller in size for little hands.    </li>
            <li> The other thing you&#x27;ll have to work with your child on is not using this like a regular toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> I have spoken to other parents that had the same problem.  </li>
            <li> The quality of the brush is similar to other Sonicare products.  </li>
            <li> Other than that, this was a terrific buy!  </li>
            <li> part replacement is little expensive but kids love bush their teeth.</li>
            <li> I have a hard time get the back teeth and flossing can be a chore for my 3 year old.</li>
            <li> My younger 5 yr old has a hard time pushing his &#x27;side&#x27; of the button.    </li>
            <li> The battery holds a charge for a very long time without the need to recharge.</li>
            <li> Battery lasts for very long time upon each charge.</li>
            <li> For some kids, this toothbrush feels a little different at first and could be tough to get used to using over a standard toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> Seriously, what does it matter to them how much I pay the retailer?  </li>
            <li> This will allow it to dry out.</li>
            <li> I let everything dry out and</li>
            <li> only negative thing I can say about this brush is now my almost 2 year old</li>
            <li> Sonicare HealthyWhite toothbrush, which is very similar in construction and works the same way, broke just after a year, water somehow leaked into the brush and killed it.</li>
            <li> ever couple days when the unit hasn&#x27;t been used for a few hours i put it back on the charger and let it charge several hours.</li>
            <li> The older boy was the slow starter, complaining that it made his lips itch.</li>
            <li> The only down side to this, is that the brush comes with 2 heads, one for younger kids and one for a little older kids, not very ideal if you are buying this for one age of child, the older brush is just sitting around because we will be not able to use it for years, way to big!</li>
            <li> You&#x27;ll notice that the run time shortens in duration &amp; when it gets down to running for only a few seconds put it back into the charger &amp; let it charge for a day &amp; it&#x27;ll come back to life.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> We haven&#x27;t had a single problem with this product.</li>
            <li> It lasts about two weeks on a single charge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> other note: For us, it was too hard for 2 kids to share it  - which was our original intention - because changing the heads takes a bit of time and kids are impatient!</li>
            <li> They are cheap to buy but expensive to use due to replacing batteries so often.</li>
            <li> Get an adult version with small head.  </li>
            <li> No more arguing that they haven&#x27;t brushed long enough.</li>
            <li> I saw some of the reviews that other young kids were having trouble with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Ultimately, you&#x27;ll end up saving money because the toothbrush heads last longer (better quality) and the base is rechargeable.</li>
            <li> loose on the handle, again replaced with warranty.  </li>
            <li> The brush handle is a bit thick for little hands (seems the same size as adult models), but the non-slip rubber grip that covers the entire thing is appreciated.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The small brush is too small for my 10 year old but it included a large brush also, so my little kid got the 2 small brushes &amp; my big kid got 2 big ones.</li>
            <li> You need to balance both the base and the toothbrush (top) on top of a short stick, and it drives me crazy.</li>
            <li> The battery stays charged for a very long time!</li>
            <li> Unfortunately the vibration is just too intense for him and we have barely used it.  </li>
            <li> Ours came with black, navy and yellow and all had some sort of designs on them.  </li>
            <li> only down side I can find is that the chaging stand has only a little peg to stand on.</li>
            <li> /&gt;They hold a charge really well (as long as you charge it, use it until it is dead, then repeat, don&#x27;t leave it on the charger at all times), the power settings have slowly increased along with the duration over the last month and a half, the kids don&#x27;t even notice!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to tell whether it is from abuse from three boys who beat it against the sink instead of lightly shaking the brush when done, or from a weak component.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to tell whether it is from abuse from three boys who beat it against the sink instead of lightly shaking the brush when done, or from a weak component.  </li>
            <li> The reason 2 stars were absent, one is due to the cost and the second due to handle size and absence of little girl colors.</li>
            <li> It took two of us to brush his teeth - one holding him down and the other trying to pry his mouth open and brush.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s even taller than an adults electric toothbrush, making it potentially cumbersome for little</li>
            <li> Little girls like pastels, especially pinks and lavender to purples combined.</li>
            <li> BTW, if you are also buying the brush heads, the age 7-10 one seems to be a little too big.</li>
            <li> It also plays a little musical tune when you are done.</li>
            <li> It starts off with lower power and for little kids, a shorter overall brushing</li>
            <li> She likes the little music noise it makes between telling you to brush the next quadrant.  </li>
            <li> Not long enough to get bored and not short enough to make your teeth feel like you missed a bunch of spots.</li>
            <li> I have a hard time getting my 5 year old to brush her teeth...</li>
            <li> No more guessing on how long she thinks she brushed for.  </li>
            <li> Total waste of money.</li>
            <li> He usually tries to hold it with two hands--often with one hand up on the brushhead.</li>
            <li> He sees this shiny red toothbrush as a toy (it&#x27;s only been a few days), so he asks to brush his teeth a few times per day.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s had its share of rough handling and dropping</li>
            <li> We are tossing these expensive units as soon as the brushes reach their useful life threshold.  </li>
            <li> Works as expected.</li>
            <li> I think Phillips has a potential winner if the few modifications are made.</li>
            <li> Since I killed one of mine, we have an extra travel case.</li>
            <li> Yes, since I killed that one we had an extra travel case, but for $50 I think they could include a $0.50 travel case to prevent that from happening to this one.</li>
            <li> these get wet all the time.  </li>
            <li> The only issue is that the decals that come with the toothbrush peel off after a few months of use.</li>
            <li> And it is not too rough</li>
            <li> For some reason, it is not readily posted on the Sonicare website but of course, you could email them to request it be emailed to you as well.  </li>
            <li> The brush comes with a starter brush head and a few different decorative face plates to change the outer design of the brush.&lt;br</li>
            <li> in all, this brush seems to have the quality of the regular Sonicare line, with a few noteworthy kid-friendly features.</li>
            <li> Ordered it for my son a few month back</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve bought a few extra heads</li>
            <li> /&gt;Still I wish it had the expected Sonicare system.</li>
            <li> It is not very bulky.  </li>
            <li> For the next few days, she stopped eating and was crying constantly saying that her mouth hurt.</li>
            <li> We bought two of these for each of our brushing aged kids.  </li>
            <li> Then a few months later the shaft&lt;br /&gt;came</li>
            <li> He is not a very thorough brusher, but he has had no cavities so far.&lt;br</li>
            <li> My kids actually look forward to brushing their teeth now whereas before it was an everyday battle.</li>
            <li> She actually sits up to have her teeth brushed now, no more pinning her down needed.    </li>
            <li> I did buy two because the idea of sharing the same toothbrush base did not work for the 10 year old, and then the youngest child picked the same faceplate as his older brother</li>
            <li> He has always brushed, but as with all kids, it&#x27;s hard to stand there and brush as long as he should.  </li>
            <li> The metal shaft that the brush snaps down on came loose and the brush would not sit correctly.  </li>
            <li> Thus, families whose kids are in a particular age bracket will not have unnecessary brush heads.</li>
            <li> downfall:  After using it for about 9 months, the brush started vibrating a little inconsistent and not how it was typically operating, as if it was making the vibrating noise but not moving the brush in the same brush stroke motion.  </li>
            <li> a little too long though for kids.&lt;br /&gt;Cons</li>
            <li> It helps get to all those little areas in the back molars that are hard to reach with a traditional toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> The only complaint is that the rubber on the back of the brush head is a little brittle, so it cracks after about 6 weeks of use.</li>
            <li> The other problem is due to \\&quot;sonic\\&quot; design--i.e., how the brushhead moves.</li>
            <li> For some reason, this is not an issue with manual brushes, nor with other brands of electric toothbrushes.  </li>
            <li> other concern may be reliability.  </li>
            <li> When I call back, I am told by another CS rep that they are not sure why the ticket was \\&quot;closed\\&quot;</li>
            <li> The toothpaste can fall off if you turn it on before you put it in your mouth, but other than that the toothbrush has held up extremely well.</li>
            <li> and they will brush longer due to the timer.</li>
            <li> I hope amz can promot the products sharply</li>
            <li> After he got past the initial tickle vibration he loves using it.</li>
            <li> Just take the time to read the brushing instructions - this is not like the other brushes on the market.</li>
            <li> and we have not heard any other complaints since we started using it.  </li>
            <li> so he could tell other parents if he wanted.</li>
            <li> When my other kids grow up a bit, I&#x27;ll be getting them brushes too.</li>
            <li> We wish we could set it to the time WE want, not it&#x27;s pre-programmed &amp;#34;build up time&amp;#34; business they have going on, but other than that it&#x27;s a five start.  </li>
            <li> They were extremely unhelpful and refused to replace the brush.  </li>
            <li> use it everyday for a long time.</li>
            <li> It takes a lot of force to get the head off of the handle to put the other head on.</li>
            <li> Timer lets him know when to move brush to other teeth.</li>
            <li> We bought it because it is a Sonicare, but didn&#x27;t know that it works with a vibrating mechanical peg / brush system, not the magnetic \\&quot;sonicare\\&quot; mechanism that you find in the other models.  </li>
            <li> ; The other one said, &amp;</li>
            <li> The chimes must not amuse them as much as other kids because they still hem and haw when it is time to brush.  </li>
            <li> Unlike with other kiddy brushes.</li>
            <li> and there are other reasons to see a dentist, but regular cleanings seem almost pointless after using this.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also about 1/2 the price of the other models.</li>
            <li> due the the price and its durability, i will give it 1 star but 5 stars for the performance.</li>
            <li> Other than that, it removes almost all plaque.</li>
            <li> I am afraid I can not get a replacement if I don&#x27;t have the old broken one available.</li>
            <li> Other reviewers said theirs kids</li>
            <li> whether is was due to lack of knowledge or laziness</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to hold &amp; doesn&#x27;t tickle his nose as badly as the battery operated toothbrushes I&#x27;d been buying at Target.</li>
            <li> Our family loves Sonicares, but for some reason, the last two Kids&#x27; Sonicares we have purchased, have broken shortly after the warranty expired.</li>
            <li> I like the kidPacer feature, but it seems a little bit faster than what I expected.</li>
            <li> I thought the Sonicare might help him to learn, but it&#x27;s even bigger and heavier than the Oral-B, so he has a hard time maneuvering it.</li>
            <li> It vibrates so hard it actually shakes all the toothpaste off.</li>
            <li> and there&#x27;s a small little musical interlude between brushing the kids</li>
            <li> have only one complaint about this toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> The only complaint is the size of the handle....</li>
            <li> Not sure why I waited this long.  </li>
            <li> It also comes with two brush heads, one round and one that resembles a small regular tooth brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that the toothbrush head storage plastic holder pins on the charger broke off after a year of use.</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that the toothbrush head storage plastic holder pins on the charger broke off after a year of use.</li>
            <li> /&gt;ѾѾѾ Average not-good not-bad 3-fuzzies feature ratings:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> so we used a sharpie to mark initials on each brush so depending on the ages of your kids you might not be able to share the base.</li>
            <li> I am sure this will be another reason they hate me in adulthood.</li>
            <li> /&gt;ѾѾѾѾѾ If you also use a for-adults Sonicare toothbrush, in addition to being able to share replacement brush heads between the for-adults and for-kids models, the charging base is also interchangeable.  </li>
            <li> and we decided to buy this one for our 8 yr old when we got tired of wasting money on throw-away, character toothbrushes.</li>
            <li> He actually follows along and as it slowly builds up the brushing duration and intensity over 14 brushes, he hasn&#x27;t even noticed the brushing time is increasing.</li>
            <li> got this for my 7 year old who is a poor brusher.  </li>
            <li> The toothbrush did break due to how tight the head was secured to the body.</li>
            <li> You literally have to hold down on the brush head to remove the plastic shield.  </li>
            <li> I got sick of buying the cheap ones for my kids and having them die</li>
            <li> At least with this brush, there have been no cavities as little skill is required, just hold the brush still while you count to 5 and move to the next tooth.</li>
            <li> , we are still working on the brushing habits but at least this gives a little extra boost.</li>
            <li> My daughter owned this toothbrush for less than six months before it just stopped working one day.</li>
            <li> Previously we might have goten them to brush for 1 minute tops.</li>
            <li> They have the replacement bruses as well, however, even with a rebate, it is still a bit less at Amazon.  </li>
            <li> Previously we were using the spin brushes.  </li>
            <li> I was looking at this one for quite a while and even had it in my cart at Target a half a dozen times.</li>
            <li> The Philips rep stated it is made that way as the rubber encasing does not adequately allow for this to happen.  </li>
            <li> Went through two of these in a year and a half.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m going to try using it with less charge to see if the vibrating will slow.&lt;br</li>
            <li> My daughter unfortunatley inherited my genes in getting black stain on her teeth.  </li>
            <li> So, I looked and found it here for much less</li>
            <li> MUCH LESS</li>
            <li> The price on amazon is lot less then retail.</li>
            <li> Will outlast a kids typical power toothbrush wear</li>
            <li> son became less dislike brushing his teeth.</li>
            <li> Still a fight to brush their teeth, but less so.</li>
            <li> child is 9, and he had has this toothbrush for a year and a half.  </li>
            <li> Decent but brush heads are way too expensive.</li>
            <li> Daughter has lost (milk) teeth, but not due to cavities from poor brush function; brush works well.</li>
            <li> But when I used it on her, I saw her pain as little tears welled up and fell down her cheeks.</li>
            <li> She hates having anyone mess around with her mouth.  </li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s making a mess of my bathroom</li>
            <li> He also like the fact that we can change the plate on the front to have a different color and design when he&#x27;s tired of the other one.</li>
            <li> My kids have really tight spacing in their teeth</li>
            <li> I made the jump to electric tooth brushes some time ago and my oldest was a little jealous.</li>
            <li> &quot; his brush a little.</li>
            <li> The sounds it makes help the little ones stay motivated during brushing.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Took a little getting use to it</li>
            <li> yes, even little kids can brush cleanly!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> vibrations take a little getting used to, and Philips handled that by giving two settings on handle to help the kids get used to it.</li>
            <li> Before you order it think about little bit about vibration.</li>
            <li> It allows the child to brush his teeth with little effort.</li>
            <li> We&#x27;ve had it for a little over a year now, and it continues to do its job.</li>
            <li> Took a little bit to get used to it though as it tickles her teeth to start.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little easier for them to manipulate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> son likes the little music noises prompting him to switch to each side of his mouth.  </li>
            <li> It has sounds for when it&#x27;s time to move the brush to another area, and plays a little music when done.  </li>
            <li> one day we saw a little stain on his front teeth.</li>
            <li> So you must use the little one for your kid</li>
            <li> It plays a little song at the end to indicate you are done also.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> 4 for each quadrant of the mouth and 5 for a little longer/different tune to tell your children when to switch sides of the mouth and when they are done!&lt;br</li>
            <li> Plays a little song which is helpful.</li>
            <li> Only drawback is that the plastic covers get cruddy fairly quickly.  </li>
            <li> The charging base is the standard bland hygenic white plastic but the brush handles are red and do come with three sets of faceplates.  </li>
            <li> and they tend to be a little messy.</li>
            <li> there is one dislike, I would say that the brush is a bit heavy for little kids because of the bulk and the battery.</li>
            <li> I was a little skeptical about this toothbrush for an under two year old until the dentist on the veryyoungkids teeth group recommended it.  </li>
            <li> My 7 year old daughter just had a bad dental checkup - even after following all of the recommendations of our dentist.  </li>
            <li> Whereas, with the Oral-B, the point is to let the toothbrush do all the work, so you don&#x27;t have to press all that firmly.</li>
            <li> Takes a few days to get used to.</li>
            <li> Both of my kids use this brush everyday.</li>
            <li> and she whined a few times because she said it hurt her mouth.  </li>
            <li> but it was dead.</li>
            <li> ) - I recommend subscribing to get a few replacements every few months...</li>
            <li> They also brush longer, rather than just sliding the brush over their teeth a few times.  </li>
            <li> Bought this for my autistic daughter.  </li>
            <li> I was wondering what features it might be missing.  </li>
            <li> I was wondering what features it might be missing.  </li>
            <li> Now, they are not available anywhere--Amazon, Target, Walmart, etc...  </li>
            <li> We have not had any trouble with the toothbrush.</li>
            <li> One of the two I ordered for my 2 sons stopped working a few months after product was received.</li>
            <li> Lots of crying.  </li>
            <li> My kid loves it and use that everyday.</li>
            <li> both of them would have caught on and disliked it from the beginning...</li>
            <li> sonic care toothbrushes died after a few months.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Sonicare brush for quite a few years.</li>
            <li> My kids has to restart the toothbrush after 1 minute to go another round.</li>
            <li> Of course less business for him!</li>
            <li> The only down side are the hard-to-find and/or expensive replacement heads.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, that left my son&#x27;s with black since we are trying to keep the two sets and four heads separate</li>
            <li> First, the brush head does not fit all the way down to the base of the handle.  </li>
            <li> My only other complaint is that the brushes are difficult to swap out.  </li>
            <li> she enjoys the little song it plays at the end!  </li>
            <li> Tickles a little!</li>
            <li> I am a little hard core on dental care since i despise dentists offices so</li>
            <li> The hygienist has very little to do, when my cleanings used to take 40 mins every 6 mos.</li>
            <li> I still check her mouth every few days, and there&#x27;s hardly ANY build-up/calcification like there used to be.  </li>
            <li> He usually has very little patience for brushing and just rushes through it.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used my Sonicare on her with the small attachment</li>
            <li> The battery charge on this thing is unbelievable, it seems to go for weeks before it needs to be charge...</li>
            <li> Not much more to say.  </li>
            <li> Not sure about this one yet.</li>
            <li> kids usually brush in the shower, so</li>
            <li> No more arguing about &amp;#34;brush time&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> But parental advice to stop brushing his lips and work on his teeth got him past that hurdle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Brushing is an effortless glide from tooth to tooth instead of the usual vigorous side to side brushing.</li>
            <li> and we heard complaints about the vibrations and how it was uncomfortable when we brushed.  </li>
            <li> though we usually keep it to around 60 seconds).</li>
            <li> No more cavities in this house.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pretty disappointed in this</li>
            <li> For the not-inexpensive price of the brush, I would have much preferred that the faceplate panels were designed so that: (a) the faceplate panel firmly snaps onto the brush body (like how battery compartment doors often snap on)</li>

            <li> thinks it looks like an &#x27;alien&#x27; and has named it something, too.</li>
            <li> I would have preferred receiving all small tips since the purpose of buying it</li>
            <li> This should be required for small kids.</li>
            <li> No more arguing about brushing teeth.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if it is the head style of the brush?  </li>
            <li> No more tender gums and because the brush is timed</li>
            <li> Only drawback is the vibration was difficult for my kids to get used too.  </li>
            <li> The other place is at the base of the main unit.</li>
            <li> she also stated that all of the $10 or less products that are battery operated are quite useless and do not really help you with oral hygiene.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Tired of endlessly replacing batteries in our 3-year-old&#x27;s toothbrushes, I bought one of these, thinking it would eventually save us money and end the wasteful, polluting chain of batteries.  </li>
            <li> This particular product is just bad.  </li>
            <li> however, the deal in not very good.</li>
            <li> Slightly annoying because you naturally want to press down on the brush head to remove the gap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> so it makes it hard to use this brush.  </li>
            <li> I also had to show him not to scrub or push too hard.</li>
            <li> Hard to find a kid size sonic toothbrush.</li>
            <li> The three supplied faceplates are just boring variations of dot patterns against a black, blue, or yellow background.  </li>
            <li> The three supplied faceplates are just boring variations of dot patterns against a black, blue, or yellow background.  </li>
            <li> Children tend to brush too hard anyway</li>
            <li> like the built in timer and the kids do not need to brush hard as the sonic movement cleans the teeth.</li>
            <li> Our youngest was a little intimidated by the vibration (even when we activated the switch that decreased the intensity for 2 weeks) but he did eventually get over it and now lets us brush them without hesitation.</li>
            <li> It is now late June, and I wanted to share my experiences and suggestions for improvement.  </li>
            <li> For some reason, the Sonicare brushes, at least in our family, generate a LOT of saliva.  </li>
            <li> There are some shortcomings with electric toothbrushes like they are awkward to hold when compared to a regular tooth brush</li>
            <li> This toothbrush was such a disappointment.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d prefer at least 7</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, the replacement brush heads are a bit costly at approximately $20 for a pair with the standard 3 month suggested replacement.  </li>
            <li> This product is the answer, at least in our family.  </li>
            <li> I hope that nothing icky grows under it.  </li>
            <li> If you go into your purchase knowing that you have at least those 2 years of product use</li>
            <li> The timer thing is wonky.  </li>
            <li> I finally decided to buy a forty dollar sonic toothbrush - which when you think about it is crazy in a way.  </li>
            <li> At least they add the surrounding piece that keeps the charger itself from falling over.</li>
            <li> That said, the kids version simply sucks.  </li>
            <li> I have not been told this for at least 5 years, since I started using the Sonicare.  </li>
            <li> I bought 3 for my 3 boys who never really liked brushing teeth.</li>
            <li> Our daughter uses it at least twice a day.</li>
            <li> Partly because you are &#x27;forced&#x27; to brush for two minutes.    </li>
            <li> It also slowly increases the time in between beeps to eventually reach the dentist recommended two minutes.</li>
            <li> The brush actually slowly increases brush time</li>
            <li> We found the slow ramp-up to 2 minutes of brushing helpful.</li>
            <li> Still have to watch then brush but very little complaining about brushing time in the morning and evening!</li>
            <li> I just wish the replacement brushes are less expensive.</li>
            <li> A two pack cost about 20 dollars, which is ridiculous.</li>
            <li> We take care of my son&#x27;s dental health seriously.</li>
            <li> A little expensive up front,</li>
            <li> Some users have reported that this toothbrush failed within a few months.  </li>
            <li> Comes with 3 ugly faceplates that are the same.</li>
            <li> When I placed the order I was nervous that my 4 year old would hate using this toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> However, it takes too long and cleans terribly with a manual tooth brush especially when they  are resistant!</li>
            <li> I wad not expecting a Philips product would fail in less than a year!</li>
            <li> Sonicare is quite awesome in cleaning ability, so I can&#x27;t fault them there, but the kids are very disappointed about the fact that their toothbrushes look ugly now. :-(</li>
            <li> My kids have had terrible teeth (75% parent&#x27;s fault) since their first checkups.</li>
            <li> Also, it is very hard to get her to floss, so the sonciare seems to help with reducing the plaque build up</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s really tough to get in there because she keeps closing her mouth.    </li>
            <li> What a waste of money!!!</li>
            <li> Every parent knows that there are times that some things must be compromised (e.g. do I generate a bed time tantrum trying to make an exhausted child stand still for two minutes?)  </li>
            <li> if you think the base will last, if not, guess no reason to purchase the replacement heads.    </li>
            <li> Product quality is poor.  </li>
            <li> The shape at the base is just slightly different.  </li>
            <li> I purchased this product because I was tired of purchasing battery operated toothbrushes (Spinbrush Kids - My Way Electric Toothbrush) that weren&#x27;t making the 90 day mark.</li>
            <li> Just frustrating.</li>
            <li> Both of his toothbrushes of this style have broken off with the metal attachment inside the bristle head.  </li>
            <li> dental health has improved in the time that I have used it, approximately one month.</li>
            <li> and then we come behind her once a day and do it for her.  </li>
            <li> Also that the charger base is in 2 pieces instead of one, but these issues are really minor.</li>
            <li> your 3 year old will HATE IT!  </li>
            <li> But, too expensive to replace when it broke just after the warranty expired.</li>
            <li> We just have them do another 1/2 cycle, but seems like a silly oversight.</li>
            <li> This sensation may make it difficult for your child to \\&quot;ease into the Sonicare experience\\&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> tooth brush head is way too expensive with</li>
            <li> but I am not impressed with this Sonicare.  </li>
            <li> Also that fact you had to change batteries every month made them expensive.  </li>
            <li> Lame.</li>
            <li> Needless to say I tried charging it</li>
            <li> Team up with Tom&#x27;s silly strawberry toothpaste and you will have to pull the toothbrush away from them.</li>
            <li> It would turn off and on randomly.</li>
            <li> When the time arrives to brush teeth, any parent will attest to how difficult it is to get a toddler to cooperate in that post meal ritual.</li>
            <li> The structure of her teeth makes them vulnerable to cavities.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical</li>
            <li> Failed in about a year.</li>
            <li> Brushing my kids teeth is, unfortunately, a struggle.</li>
            <li> But, the motion of the head does make it difficult to brush.  </li>
            <li> : expensive.</li>
            <li> However, the timer does encourage longer brushing time and the sonicare brush ensures that her teeth are getting cleaner no matter how bored she is with brushing.</li>
            <li> Im so not happy!!!!</li>
            <li> Also replacements are expensive.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately my daughter doesn&#x27;t have the patience and doesn&#x27;t use the brush anymore.</li>
            <li> The unfortunate thing about his unit is that it stopped working after 7 months.  </li>
            <li> My kids unfortunately are both under 7, so I bought 2,but</li>
            <li> It is, however, ridiculous to require &amp;#34;word count&amp;#34; on critique :(((</li>
            <li> I bought these for my grandsons, ages 4 and 9, after 2 disappointing dental checkups.</li>
            <li> my teeth are dirty I need to brush\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> Disappointing.</li>
            <li> In the garbage it went, very sad.</li>
            <li> , the replacement brushes are very expensive.</li>
            <li> That way the price sting wasn&#x27;t so bad.</li>
            <li> The Bad:  -----------------------  </li>
            <li> I have not smelled bad breath after a cleaning with the kids</li>
            <li> so maybe we got one that was a bad egg?  </li>
            <li> I have a bad feeling too when I hold it in my hand.</li>
            <li> Once we realized how bad it was, mom and dad took over the brushing routine.  </li>
            <li> Bad Bad product and the customer support....</li>
            <li> But this one I bought for my son was really a bad one.</li>
            <li> but it can be painful for kids losing baby teeth.  </li>
            <li> I have never been disappointed with the results of using their products...</li>
            <li> For a Sonicare product this is very disappointing.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s an annoying vibration frequency.  </li>
            <li> hate to brush, its a chore for them...</li>
            <li> So our kids HATE the dentist and are literally frightened to walk in the door.  </li>
            <li> Worthless.</li>
            <li> downside: The base of the refillable brush gets a little...gunky.  </li>
            <li> Too bad!</li>
            <li> My 4-year-old daughter has always HATED brushing her teeth.  </li>
            <li> We tried every toothbrush out there, and every toothpaste, too, but she still hated it, and it was a battle every night to get it done.    </li>
            <li> My grandaughter hated brushing her teeth but with this she is brushing day and night.</li>
            <li> Very frustrated</li>
            <li> Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> They are designed to appeal to kids, but are rather boring.</li>
            <li> And her dentist assures me it will help with the horrible stains she gets on her teeth because of her asthma medications.    </li>
            <li> Those things are terrible and wasteful.</li>
            <li> Oh, the colors are awful and the added &amp;#34;art&amp;#34; that you can put on is horrendous so keep in mind, it&#x27;s for cleaning teeth and not for art work.</li>
            <li> This made the brush vibrate terribly and was unusable.  </li>
            <li> Very annoying.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> My son loved this and so did his dentist.  But, too expensive to replace when it broke just after the warranty expired.</li>
            <li> My 6 year old son actually enjoys brushing his teeth for the first time! I recommend this product to all parents for their kids.</li>
            <li> Every time we go to the pediatric dentist, they are always impressed by how clean my daughter&#x27;s teeth are.  I&#x27;m quite sure it&#x27;s because of this awesome toothbrush.  I like that it beeps when she should change quadrants in her mouth, letting her know how long is appropriate.</li>
            <li> Time will tell how they hold up, but they have been great for my boys so far.  They have no problem using them, and use the beeps to know when to change position.  It&#x27;s feels solidly build, and the inclusion of two head sizes was nice.  Especially for us with a 6 and 10yr old, so we now have two small and two normal sizes (they always squeeze you on replacement heads).  I also like the face plates they include so they can customize them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only reason for not giving 4 stars is a) they faces are stick-on, so they are one-shot deals, and b) there are only four audio cues: inside top and bottom, and front top an bottom?  Does Philips suggest milk bones for the flat parts?  We just have them do another 1/2 cycle, but seems like a silly oversight.</li>
            <li> Ordered this toothbrush in March 2013 for my grandsons.  It is now June 2013 and both brush heads are totally frayed and looked like they have been used for a year.  Also the rubber on the back of the large brush head is peeling off.  For a Sonicare product this is very disappointing.  Total waste of money.</li>
            <li> While this electric toothbrush removed plaque a lot better than a manual toothbrush, the bristles became uneven lengths and caused my two year old&#x27;s gums to bleed.  It was like brushing with a weed-wacker.  The manufacturer did nothing for us when we notified them.</li>
            <li> Dentist recommended this but to buy from dentist office was 30% more expensive.  Worth researching &amp; finding it here.  Worth waiting for it to arrive.</li>
            <li> This is probably the first time I&#x27;m able to post an early review for a \\&quot;Vine\\&quot; Product, and I feel priveliged to do so!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My (step) son-in-law, a dentist, gets to \\&quot;preview\\&quot; items like this, and already has his three children using it. (Ages: 10, 8, 6.) So I KNOW this is a great item. (Hey, Dentist endorsed :&gt;)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;He used to manually brush their teeth for them, (just to be sure they were brushing correctly), but switched them to these electronic models (via professional samples) since he believes they do a more thorough job, and the kids really enjoy using them.  Because of the unique handle design, he was still able to \\&quot;guide\\&quot; their brushing until they got the hang of it (which didn&#x27;t take long, even for the youngest), and until he was sure they were using the device as it&#x27;s meant to be used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The power-modes on the brush (I&#x27;ve listened and watched) are SOMEWHAT quieter than models like this meant for adults (I use a Phillips Sonicare ProResults--love it, but it&#x27;s LOUD), so there&#x27;s no \\&quot;scary\\&quot; drill-like sound, AND, the scrub-factor is more gentle than on adult models.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s colorful (the handle), it does a good job, and it trains kids to brush for the recommended 2 minutes (there&#x27;s a timer on it).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I removed one star from this review, because, in my observations, it seems the handle isn&#x27;t MUCH smaller than adult size models, and the littlest grandkid just made it, when it came to holding the handle. Another reason for the removal of one star: this isn&#x27;t something you can just hand the kids and say \\&quot;brush your teeth.\\&quot;  They&#x27;ll need some instruction, and maybe even help with their first couple of uses.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Still, the above are small issues, because overall, this product does what it says, and what it should, which is: providing young kids with good, proper, and effective brushing.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using an Oral-B Buzz Lightyear rechargeable toothbrush on my four-year-old for a couple of years now; I wanted to see what benefits this model might have over the older unit. Frankly, I haven&#x27;t found anything compelling in the Philips Sonicare, and neither has my son. I usually offer him the choice of which toothbrush to use, and he picks the older model about 75 percent of the time.    And that&#x27;s when I&#x27;m doing the brushing--he&#x27;s still not that adept at brushing his own teeth, so I still do most of the brushing. I thought the Sonicare might help him to learn, but it&#x27;s even bigger and heavier than the Oral-B, so he has a hard time maneuvering it. He usually tries to hold it with two hands--often with one hand up on the brushhead. If it were better designed for a kid, it&#x27;d be about half as long (or even shorter). This seems a dead giveaway that Philips simply slapped a pretty paint job on one of its adult models, added some kid-friendly sounds, and called it a kid&#x27;s toothbrush.    The other problem is due to \\&quot;sonic\\&quot; design--i.e., how the brushhead moves. It vibrates instead of rotates, as the Oral-B does, and if I don&#x27;t press the brushhead to the teeth pretty firmly, it tickles his gums. Whereas, with the Oral-B, the point is to let the toothbrush do all the work, so you don&#x27;t have to press all that firmly. Philips says the toothbrush is quiet, and it is--but not that much quieter than the Oral-B.    Then there&#x27;s the fact that this toothbrush costs two-and-a-half times as much as the Oral-B does--or did. Oral-B has discontinued its kid models, though you can still find them; here&#x27;s a link to one on Amazon: [[ASIN:B0019FGZNQ Braun D9513K Oral B Kids Power Toothbrushes- 950TX The Incredibles]].     On the other hand, my kid is at the lower end of the advertised age range for this product; older kids--I&#x27;d say six and up--would probably have a better time of it. And, the product seems very well made and sturdy.</li>
            <li> My youngest son(6)has soft enamel and has been getting cavities since he was 2 years old! A children&#x27;s hygenist recommended this toothbrush and said it really helps the kids clean their teeth effectively. Every night and morning it was a fight, including tears, to get him to brush. Now my both kids ask if it is time to brush!  They like the timer that tells them when to switch sides, the motion isn&#x27;t too much in the automatic toothbrush and they think it is just like the adults toothbrush. I was skeptical but the kids love it. I did buy two because the idea of sharing the same toothbrush base did not work for the 10 year old, and then the youngest child picked the same faceplate as his older brother so we used a sharpie to mark initials on each brush so depending on the ages of your kids you might not be able to share the base. We use our adult Sonicare UV sanitizer case to sanitize the kids brush heads as well. This Sonicare brush is fair superior to the less expensive automatic toothbrush I was giving the kids and they definetly brush longer on their own with no fights!</li>
            <li> First, let me say that I LOVE my adult Sonicare toothbrush.  When the kids toothbrush came out, I was anxious to get it for my three boys, ages 7, 4, and 4, thinking it would help develop good brushing habits.  We gave it to them at Easter.  It is now late June, and I wanted to share my experiences and suggestions for improvement.  The seven-year-old is doing fine with it, and he uses the \\&quot;left\\&quot; side for a gentler brushing.  My complaints revolve around my younger boys.  For some reason, the Sonicare brushes, at least in our family, generate a LOT of saliva.  Even though we do the inside bottom last (where the salivary glands are), we have to make the child hang over the bowl to catch the volumes of drips.  For some reason, this is not an issue with manual brushes, nor with other brands of electric toothbrushes.  Yes, we only use a tiny dot of toothpaste.  The trick is getting a fidgety four-year-old boy to stand still leaning over the sink for the full cycle.  One of my boys can&#x27;t stand the saliva build-up, and has to spit in between beeps.  If I take the brush out of his mouth while it&#x27;s still running, then the brush sprays saliva and toothpaste everywhere.  If I turn it off, it forgets where it was in the cycle, and it thinks it&#x27;s starting all over again, so we lose the built-in programming.  On nights when they are extremely tired or grouchy, I can&#x27;t do a quick brushing (just to maintain the rule of brushing every night).  If I do, then I have to break another rule of going through the whole brushing sequence.  Every parent knows that there are times that some things must be compromised (e.g. do I generate a bed time tantrum trying to make an exhausted child stand still for two minutes?)  I understand that children should not be allowed to compromise the program.  What I&#x27;d like to see is a &#x27;refresh&#x27; button on the device, or a \\&quot;secret\\&quot; multi-button push that parents can use to get a shorter cycle.  Lacking that, I&#x27;d suggest that you keep a manual brush available for those nights when you don&#x27;t have the parental stamina to try to make your wiggly child stand still over the bowl for the full cycle.  Or, get a drool cup  :-)  .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update 4/28/2012:&lt;br /&gt;Well, just plan on buying one of these per year.  They break.  It&#x27;s hard to tell whether it is from abuse from three boys who beat it against the sink instead of lightly shaking the brush when done, or from a weak component.  I&#x27;m guessing the former.  Love the product.  Instead of getting upset that they break so easily, I just change my mindset.  It&#x27;s worth $40 per year for cavity-free checkups.for those nights when you don&#x27;t have the parental stamina to try to make your wiggly child stand still over the bowl for the full cycle.

            <li> When I placed the order I was nervous that my 4 year old would hate using this toothbrush.  I&#x27;ve used my Sonicare on her with the small attachment and she would cry every time.  The day it arrived in the mail she was so excited that she immediately began brushing her teeth.  I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s the tones it makes while it&#x27;s operating or the smaller kid friendly design, but she loves it.  I have two separate heads for ours and use it on both my 4 yr old and 2 yr old without a single tear.  Thank you Sonicare for making a kids&#x27; version of a product I already love.</li>
            <li> Our 4 yr old son loves this toothbrush. He sees this shiny red toothbrush as a toy (it&#x27;s only been a few days), so he asks to brush his teeth a few times per day.  Of course the novelty and newness will wear off, but long term he won&#x27;t mind using the toothbrush at all.  We gradually moved to this toothbrush. From about 1 yr old or so we did the following:  1) gauze with alcohol free mouthwash  2) manual toothbrush with alcohol free mouthwash  3) Thomas the Train spinning toothbrush with alcohol free mouthwash     It works great and the music to indicate switching to a new area is great.  The toothbrush does work up more foam/spit than a manual or spinning toothbrush, so we just have our son stand on a stool over the bathroom sink.  At the end we tell him to spit.    We have the adult version of the Philips Sonicare from 5 years ago and they are still going strong.  The kids version looks just as durable.</li>
            <li> This toothbrush is wonderful.  My 6 and 8 year old love it.  They&#x27;re not missing spots when they&#x27;re brushing anymore and they&#x27;re able to brush by themselves.  Very happy with the toothbrush!</li>
            <li> This makes it much easier for my son to thoroughly clean his teeth. He loves it and I&#x27;m happy with it.</li>
            <li> This is a great toothbrush for kids, my 4 and 6 year olds love it and giggle when they put it on their teeth.  Not sure how long brushes will last, but it is so much higher quality and cost efficient than all those \\&quot;spin\\&quot; brushes we&#x27;ve brought that I am embarrassed to say we ever even bought them.  Note however it is not \\&quot;sonic\\&quot; like Philips adult brushes, just mechanical.  Doesn&#x27;t matter, though, still great.</li>
            <li> My daughter owned this toothbrush for less than six months before it just stopped working one day. It just wouldn&#x27;t turn on after it finished charging. I wasn&#x27;t a big fan of it anyway. We had switched from one of those battery operated Oral B brushes with the characters on the handle and her dentist noticed the difference in her teeth immediately... More plaque and said she wasn&#x27;t brushing well. I&#x27;m sorry to be out the money but am going back to Oral B for sure.</li>
            <li> My 5 yr old son loves brushing his teeth and I thought I would never say that! The beeping is great to remind him to move it to different quadrants in his mouth. Had it for a month and no problems. Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> I bought this for my seven year old grandaughter.  She loves it.  She always used my soni care (with her own brush) when she visited me.  This works out great for her.  The brush is just the right size for her and she wants to brush her teeth all the time. Great product - great results.  What more could you want than for a child to want to brush their teeth.</li>
            <li> Great toothbrush! My kid loves it and I&#x27;ve had it for a while now. It&#x27;s had its share of rough handling and dropping but it&#x27;s still going strong.</li>
            <li> I suggest you get the adult line of Sonicare for your kids and use the soft brush heads that are available for them. We&#x27;ve gone through two of these so far and the second just stopped working. We got the first one along with the adult Sonicare system about March of last year and the adult system is still going strong. Yes, the colors/graphics are nice but not worth the cost of short-lived brushes!</li>
            <li> Bought 2 for the grandsons, 7 &amp; 9. They use them and do wait for the congratulatory tune at the end of 2 minutes of brushing, well most of the time. Grandma is happy.</li>
            <li> My daughter was ver excited when she recieved this. It is a very powerful and even fun toothbrush. The first time she used it, we think it knocked a tooth loose and it came out that same nite!</li>
            <li> My child likes this toothbrush. The tune signaling a change in brushing zones is helpful. The end tune is a nice touch. Small, easy for a child to handle.</li>
            <li> I have bought one for each of my grandkids.  The 3 year old just got his for his birthday because he wanted one just like his brother. East to handle even at 3 years old. This product makes it so much easier for kids to get those hard to get to spots.  Great value and kids and parents like it!</li>
            <li> I got this one to replace a one time use version. This is a good size for my 4 yr old. It includes 2 different size heads. Charge holds up for several days and most importantly, my daughter loves it because it tickles. Brushing teeth made easy!</li>
            <li> My grandson brushes more thoroughly with this device, and needs only a reminder that its time to brush his teeth. This is our second, and we are well pleased.</li>
            <li> I made the jump to electric tooth brushes some time ago and my oldest was a little jealous. So when the opportunity to get a child&#x27;s electric tooth brush came up, I jumped. It has only been a little over a week, but I am impressed to hear him brushing by himself every morning and evening, and with the timer he is brushing longer than he ever has before.    There are some shortcomings with electric toothbrushes like they are awkward to hold when compared to a regular tooth brush and they tend to be a little messy. But neither of these seem to be any problem, he took to holding it right away and the mirror is still clean. To me it seems like the brush head does not have a wide motion that might help, we&#x27;ll see how effective it is over time.    Other nice amenities are self adhesive coverlets which allowed my son to \\&quot;customize\\&quot; his brush a little. And there is an easy recharging bay which he was able to set up himself.  All in all a great experience so far and he is very proud of it.</li>
            <li> I got this Sonicare toothbrush for my daughters (ages 10 and 7) who have been using an adult Braun Oral B electric toothbrush for almost 2 years now.  They were excited to have their own and one that&#x27;s more geared toward kids, which perhaps helps with solidifying the brushing habit.  The three different decorative templates were certainly an enticement, and they had fun picking which one they wanted to use on it first (I had my doubts but it&#x27;s still holding on over a month later).  The different speeds are a good idea for the younger kids, but mine were already used to switching areas every 30 seconds (this one actually plays a little musical tone instead of just a different vibration).  The handle is a bit large but I thought that was more of a plus than a minus (except for maybe the smallest hands).  My only complaints are that it would be nice to be able to buy the brush with just larger heads, since my kids are both big enough for them.  Also that the charger base is in 2 pieces instead of one, but these issues are really minor.</li>
            <li> It was great. My child love it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using a Sonicare for a number of years and LOVE it so I was really excited when I found this Sonicare for kids at Target.  The two different size brushes were perfect for my 8 &amp; 6 year olds.  Only two weeks into using the toothbrush, it stopped working.  It seemed like the problem was caused by switching out the brushes for each of the kids.  I was always the one doing the switch so I know that it wasn&#x27;t being abused in any way.  I returned to Target and happily exchanged for a new one.  The same thing happened with the second one as well.  It didn&#x27;t last as long as the first one.  I would NOT recommend this for anyone using it for more than one child.</li>
            <li> Why didn&#x27;t we buy this sooner? The dentist did say it would be helpful but we had no idea it would be as great as it is. I think the dentists are upset because it will put them out of business! Easy to use, and clean super smooth smile.</li>
            <li> We bought 2 of these for our children and not only have we noticed there teeth are beter taken care of, but they actually have at least a reasonably good time during brushing.  The music that plays at intervals helps hem know when to move to the next area and when they are done.  Previously we might have goten them to brush for 1 minute tops. Now they continue for the full 2 minutes.  Would definitely recommend to others.</li>
            <li> We have been a big fan of electric toothbrushes for a while.  Sure, you still have to move the toothbrush and angle it properly, but the rapid vibrations help remove stuff from your teeth really well.  When you throw in some other features, this toothbrush is great for children, with minor exception, which I will revisit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My favorite feature is the musical tone that indicates when it is time to switch quadrants.  Every time I hear the beep, I have to smile.  That same sound also seems to delight my daughter, who is the primary user of the toothbrush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Of course, the silly sound does not get teeth brushed.  The brush is small, soft, and very suitable to fit into a child&#x27;s mouth.  This toothbrush has two power modes for different ages, reducing the chance that the toothbrush injures young gums and teeth; a rubber over-mold on the brush also helps reduce the risk of damage to young teeth and gums.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another great feature is the three included different faceplates so that a user may personalize the toothbrush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One other concern may be reliability.  Some users have reported that this toothbrush failed within a few months.  We have had ours for more than a year and a half and it continues to function well and to charm our daughter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have only one complaint about this toothbrush.  The handle is too large for some small hands.  True, the large size makes it easier for a child who has yet to develop fine motor skills to manipulate, but the large size can also make it difficult to grasp.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As most parents know, getting your child to brush can be a huge chore.  Having a toothbrush that your child likes is a huge help in overcoming this problem.  You could possibly find that your child actually asks to brush his or her teeth more often.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Enjoy!</li>
            <li> we highly recommend this one! my son loves it and he even tells me that this  toothbrush does a better job.   even his dad can now brush my son&#x27;s teeth with ease. it has CUTE music to let my son   know the amount of time to brush every section. we&#x27;re helping him to understand and use  the brush now and i&#x27;m confident that later on he&#x27;ll do a great job on his own versus the conventional brushes.   highly recommended! easy and quicker teeth-brushing experience every night!</li>
            <li> It is so well made! It is their latest technology! It is a bargain for the whole family. The kids love it -- I think the vibrant colors attract the kids. Just a great product at a great price point. Super highly recommended.</li>
            <li> We have been using the Sonicare brushes for years.... update when new models come out.  My dentist suggested it many years ago and it has really helped.  Partly because you are &#x27;forced&#x27; to brush for two minutes.    The kids brush takes this wonderful brush down to the kids level.  The sound emitted during the brush is nowhere as loud as it is on the adult brush so that helps.  The ramp up speed is great for them to get used to this new way of brushing.  And the idea of knowing when to switch to another side of your teeth and when it is over is so helpful.      The only complaint is the size of the handle....a little bit of getting the hang of it for a 4 year old.      Nonetheless, it does an excellent job.  Bravo Sonicare.  It&#x27;s the talk of the household.</li>
            <li> This is a pretty good product with excellent battery life. One charge lasts more than 2 weeks. The brush is soft and gentle on young teeth and enamel. There are some flaws, however, that you may wish to consider:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Surprisingly big for a kids product. It&#x27;s even taller than an adults electric toothbrush, making it potentially cumbersome for little hands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Takes a few days to get used to. The vibrating head tingles the gums when first used and it&#x27;s explicitly written in the manual that \\&quot;The Sonicare may feel ticklish upon first use\\&quot;. This sensation may make it difficult for your child to \\&quot;ease into the Sonicare experience\\&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Comes with 3 ugly faceplates that are the same. They are designed to appeal to kids, but are rather boring. You get a yellow one, a blue one, and a black one. All just dots or bubbles (see gallery). The entire back of the faceplate is covered with strong adhesive which is very difficult to peel off once applied. Faceplate will probably get destroyed in the removal attempt. I used my finger nails and couldn&#x27;t pry one off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- During the beeping of the KidTimer intervals every 30 seconds, brushing stops temporarily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Still a good toothbrush, but the above points are worth thinking about.</li>
            <li> Item as described. A+</li>
            <li> This brush was recommended by my son&#x27;s dentist and it has turned out to be great! It has two modes to work him up to the 2 minute mark, and loud sounds to let him know to switch to a different quadrant of his mouth. It has worked wonders and the dentist has noticed a marked improvement in his oral health!</li>
            <li> My 4-year-old daughter has always HATED brushing her teeth.  We tried every toothbrush out there, and every toothpaste, too, but she still hated it, and it was a battle every night to get it done.    And then we bought the Sonicare for kids, and now she loves to brush her teeth.  She adores the pacing music, and says it tickles when we brush her teeth.  I love the size of the brush head (it&#x27;s nice and small for her little mouth), and how easy it is to maneuver the brush for her.  And her dentist assures me it will help with the horrible stains she gets on her teeth because of her asthma medications.    My husband was really skeptical about this toothbrush, but I&#x27;m glad I ignored him.  I would recommend it to anyone!</li>
            <li> What a surprising product--to have a child who wouldn&#x27;t brush his teeth more than 30 seconds is incredible; now he waits until he hears the musical notes after brushing each section &amp; the longer tune at the end to then know he&#x27;s done--as it automatically builds up to 2 minutes!  I can&#x27;t wait to hear what his dentist says.</li>
            <li> My husband and I have had our Sonicare for years and I was waiting for our daughter to turn 4 so that she could get one too. It is easy to use, it does a great job cleaning her teeth and she likes it (it doesn&#x27;t vibrate too much but just enough). She also likes the timing reminders and I know that we are doing the best we can to maximize her oral health. I recommend this product.</li>
            <li> My 5 year old loves this toothbrush. It tickled her at first but only took about a week to get used to it. It has settings so that you can reduce this in the beginning if it is bothersome. It also slowly increases the time in between beeps to eventually reach the dentist recommended two minutes. It also plays a little tune to tell the child to switch to the next area to be brushed...this also serves as encouragement to continue brushing. We expect improvement at next dental appointment.</li>
            <li> I purchased this toothbrush for my daughter and within 6 months is stopped working correctly.  It now only works for the first cycle and stops when it is supposed to beep to let the child know to move on to the next section of teeth.  I contacted Phillips Sonic Care customer service who had very nice and helpful customer service people.  Every single one of them promise to send out a replacement one free with a return box to return the old defective toothbrush.  I get a reference number, however NEVER receive the shipment.  When I call back, I am told by another CS rep that they are not sure why the ticket was \\&quot;closed\\&quot; and then I am reissued another reference number with a promise to send a replacement one.  This has been going on for almost 4 months now... with countless reference numbers.  This company is a nightmare to deal with....</li>
            <li> good buy would buy again</li>
            <li> What a difference...  With this electric toothbrush brushing went to the NEXT level.  It easy for the kid, he enjoys is so much.</li>
            <li> This toothbrush is awesome! You don&#x27;t have to worry about spinning heads catching your childs cheeks. Also, it has beginner levels and music that will encourage your child to brush longer. It comes with 3 different plate designs as well &amp; 2 different brushes for age levels.</li>
            <li> A friend bought our children these brushes.   We love them, but the heads are more than $7 each!  There are disposable electric toothbrushes that sell for handle and head under $6.  We are tossing these expensive units as soon as the brushes reach their useful life threshold.  A shame really.</li>
            <li> My daughter loves it, she is 8 and feels so clean after brushing&lt;br /&gt;Love that it times them so that they brush properly</li>
            <li> This electric toothbrush has been great at helping my kids to brush better and more independently. I have a son with a developmental disability, and he long needed parent help. This brush helped him to become more independent, and now I just help him once a day to get that pesky spot he misses.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like that the brushes are replacable. I wish they were cheaper, though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My kids have difficulty sharing the handle, so I purchased two brushes. It is possible to share, though, for kids who are are capable of that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great product, Sonicare!</li>
            <li> it is a wonderful toothbrush and helps gets want to brush their teeth.  I recommend this product, as it was recommended by our dentist and it is well made.  Best price was Amazon!</li>
            <li> Both of my kids use this brush everyday. They each have their own tip. The toothpaste can fall off if you turn it on before you put it in your mouth, but other than that the toothbrush has held up extremely well. The battery charge on this thing is unbelievable, it seems to go for weeks before it needs to be charge...maybe my kids aren&#x27;t really brushing their teeth, LOL!!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using a Sonicare for years after my dentist recommended it to me. And all my checkups have been outstanding. I never knew there was a Sonicare for Kids until I saw one in the bathroom at a friends house. And knowing what a chore it is to get my kids (ages 6 and 10) to brush their teeth properly and thoroughly, I didn&#x27;t hesitate to buy the Sonicare. The Sonicare makes it simple for them, with the little musical tone every 15 seconds or so (it eventually lengthens to 30 seconds per interval). Plus it does a far better job cleaning their teeth than they were ever able to do with a regular toothbrush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since the package comes with two brush heads, one for ages 4+ and one for ages 7+, we only needed to buy one and both kids use the same base with their own individual brush heads. That way the price sting wasn&#x27;t so bad. It&#x27;s hard to explain how much better the kids&#x27; teeth look since they&#x27;ve been using the Sonicare. Though it&#x27;s not cheap, it was well worth the purchase.</li>
            <li> My kid has been using this brush for a while now. Have seen a lot of improvement in his teeth and his dentist is super happy with the results.</li>
            <li> Beware of this product for the sake of your childs dental health! I was so excited to get this for my 6 yr. old son after reading all the great reviews. We switched him from using my old oral B pro care to this thinking it would be more enjoyable for him to have his own fun colored brush, but 4 months into using it I started to notice his teeth were yellow and I could actually see the build up! The dentist was shocked at the state of his teeth, since he&#x27;s never had a cavity and generally does a really good job brushing. This toothbrush was such a disappointment. It was a waste of money and made my son feel like he wasn&#x27;t doing a very good job taking care of his teeth. Back to the trusty old Oral B for us.</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with this toothbrush. I was concerned that my 5 year old wasn&#x27;t getting his teeth clean when brushing. Now using the Sonicare for Kids I can see that he is doing a great job and it&#x27;s fun too. He loves when the music plays as an indication to switch brushing areas (quadrants) and he gets so excited when the reward tune plays at the end of brushing. He finishes each brushing session with a big smile and a very proud \\&quot;I did it\\&quot;!</li>
            <li> My 4 year old son loves it. Works as expected. Recommended for kids of a similar age. Parental supervision suggested.</li>
            <li> My 7 year old daughter just had a bad dental checkup - even after following all of the recommendations of our dentist.  So I bought this Philips Sonicare toothbrush for her to use.  When I showed her the toothbrush on line, she wasn&#x27;t very thrilled with it - didn&#x27;t think it was very attractive. However, after she saw that she could customize it with the plates, she didn&#x27;t say anything else about that.  It makes fun sounds while she brushes, making it easier for her to brush longer.  From my own experience, I know that it is getting her teeth even cleaner.  She had only used battery-operated and manual toothbrushes before.  I do wish that you could specify the type of toothbrush heads for it. It comes with a 7+ toothbrush head and a under 7 one.  Since she is the only one that will use this toothbrush, it would have been great to get two of the toothbrush heads she would use.</li>
            <li> Easy to use for kids and comes with interchangeable panels of design for easy identification. Love the beeping cycles that are timed.</li>
            <li> So I ordered the kids toothbrush without realizing that the it&#x27;s meant for ages 4+. I decided to try it anyway since it&#x27;s more gentle than manual brushing.    We&#x27;re currently brushing my kid&#x27;s teeth manually (morning and night) and it&#x27;s really tough to get in there because she keeps closing her mouth.    But when we use the Sonicare she looks forward to it and complies much more readily. Also, because we don&#x27;t have to move the brush head itself too much it&#x27;s easier to get coverage of all tooth surfaces.    To be honest, manual brushing and manual brushes are cheaper, cheaper to replace, and do a better job. But a big part of getting young children to brush their teeth is to make it fun and to make it something that they look forward to.    Based on that alone the Sonicare Kids is well worth it.</li>
            <li> Not much more to say.  My kids brush a full 2 minutes, they do a much better job of brushing (once they understood the quadrant method - top front, top back, bottom front, bottom back) and they have fun doing it.  Great product mirroring what my wife and I get from the adult versions.</li>
            <li> If your son or daughter is looking for an automatic toothbrush, then look no further than this Philips Sonicare for kids.  It&#x27;s a bit pricey, but it gets the job done, and then some.  I do have one concern; the toothbrush is designed for kids 4+, but I&#x27;m not sure if it would be safe to use with kids 4+ (unless they&#x27;re very precocious of course).  I&#x27;d prefer at least 7+, if not 10+.    The Good:  -----------------------  - Wave shaped brush heads seemed more efficient at cleaning the teeth.  - Melodic series of beeps indicate when to switch brushing to another part of the mouth, which is fun for kids.  Moreover, it&#x27;s a helpful motivator for encouraging thorough brushing.    - Different brush heads for different ages.  - Personalizable \\&quot;fun\\&quot; plastic clip-on templates  - Grip size, though large, is comfortable and easy to hold.  - Base/stand provides power to the brush.    The Bad:  -----------------------  - Personalizable plastic templates don&#x27;t adhere to the toothbrush very well.  Perhaps magnets would work better.  - Since brush heads are geared for different ages, perhaps the boxes would be packed with heads geared only for a certain age range.  Thus, families whose kids are in a particular age bracket will not have unnecessary brush heads.</li>
            <li> I have been using Philips Sonicare toothbrushs myself for about five years.  I think they are great- very effective and worth the cost in the long run.  My seven year old has been brushing his own teeth without a lot of assistance for about a year and a half with the Oral-B rechargeable toothbrushes.  For the longest time I was happy with that product, but had recently began noticing that my son had bad breath more often than normal.  Later I discovered that he was not brushing his teeth for 2 minutes, or even one minute some days.  I decided I needed a kids&#x27; brush that would run then stop after a time period, and also have sounds that I could hear without standing over him while he brushed.  I did purchase the Philips kids sonicare after contemplating the purchase for some time, and I am glad I did.  After the first week using the new brush, so many disgusting things have been scrubbed off of our mirrors and out the sink.  I am very happy that he could get his mouth so clean and fresh.  I have not smelled bad breath after a cleaning with the kids sonicare toothbrush- it was worth the money, and I am getting another one for my five year old.</li>
            <li> This toothbrush has been a real God-send for us. We use it on both our 3 year old daughter and our 2 year old boy (red head for the girl, blue for the boy). Despite diligent manual tooth-brushing, our daughter was having lots of pre-cavity symptoms like discoloration and white spots. After we started using this toothbrush her teeth cleaned right up and her gums look much healthier. The dentist was very pleased with her last check-up.      With our son the problem was a bit different. It took two of us to brush his teeth - one holding him down and the other trying to pry his mouth open and brush. After watching his sister getting brushed with the sonicare, he walked right up and popped his mouth open to be brushed too, and that has continued ever since! We just had his check-up and were told he has excellent oral hygiene.      One of the things that we like best about it is that the 4-7 year old size heads are just the right size, even for our 2 year old (who has been using it since he was 18 months). We had tried the cheaper oral-B electric toothbrushes and though the kids liked the characters on them, the brush heads were so bulky that it was difficult to get on the cheek side of the teeth and the quality of brushing doesn&#x27;t even begin to compare to the sonicare. I know one of the reviews complains that the handle is too big, but we have not found that to be so. On the occasions that we let our 2 year old try to do his own teeth, he has no problem with the handle either. We are TOTALLY pleased with this toothbrush. We believe the initial cost and brush replacement costs are more than compensated for in savings at the dentists office.</li>
            <li> OK for 7 year old kids</li>
            <li> My 3 children, 4 y/o, 7y/o, 8y/o, love using their toothbrushes.  The music helps them to keep brushing.  Hopefully this prevents us from getting another $1000 dental bill.  Ha!</li>
            <li> I have an adult version of Sonicare and I like it a lot. So I got a child version for my son. He like it from the beginning. The color of the toothbrush is vivid and attractive. The brushing time are automatically prolonged from 30 seconds to 120 seconds. My son does not even notice before he brush his teeth for the whole 2 minutes. We finally can brush every single tooth for him without struggling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some Cons:&lt;br /&gt;The tooth brush head is way too expensive with 18.99$ for 2 brush head&lt;br /&gt;my adult version of Sonicare broke down twice within the warranty time. Not sure about this one yet.</li>
            <li> This toothbrush does a great job and has a timer tone to let my boy know when he has brushed enough. I can tell a huge difference in how clean his teeth are compared to manual brushing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Couple this with this water flosser http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004Y99EO6/ref&#x3D;cm_cr_ryp_prd_ttl_sol_176 for a great combo that will keep the dentist bills away.</li>
            <li> We bought two of these. One for our 7 yr old and one for our 4 yr old. Just to comment on some other reviews on this toothbrush: No child should be left to do his own brushing. They just dont know how to do a good enough job. None of my children have cavities and we do not take flouride. My husband and I brush their teeth every night. My 7 yr old will brush his own teeth in the morning. That is his time to learn how to brush correctly. This toothbrush is wonderful. Both of my children will brush for the full two minutes. They lower level one is only brushing for one minute. In my opinion that is good with starting out with the toothbrush. But kids need to be brushing the full two minutes just like their parents. My four year old can handle this toothbrush wonderful. I think he would have been able to handle this at even three years old. I will not be buying the store bought electric toothbrushes anymore or the manuals. This toothbrush works great and travels great.</li>
            <li> I bought the Philips Sonicare for Kids after they kept using our electric toothbrush.  They had no problem using the Oral B, but I thought they&#x27;d like the timer, cute colors and I&#x27;d finally get them out of the parent&#x27;s bathroom.  But after much coaxing, they refuse to use it!  It tickles their gums too much.  I tried it myself and must agree- it&#x27;s an annoying vibration frequency.  It doesn&#x27;t matter how cute it is if you kids WON&#x27;T USE IT.</li>
            <li> Nice brush system for kids. Only mis-giving is that the brush heads do not seem to last a full 3 months with normal brushing and are quite expensive to replace.</li>
            <li> This is perfect because it is easy to use and will remain charged for a long period of time.  I bought this mostly because I wanted my son to begin brushing properly and this has a timer on it for kids.  Plus, he is able to focus on each individual tooth with little effort.  He liked customizing his toothbrush with the various sticker plates.  Ive had an oral b tooth brush for years that I love, so I knew I&#x27;d like this product for my son.  Plus, his dental visits since he&#x27;s had this toothbrush was much better than the one last year.  He didn&#x27;t have any issues this year, last year they gave him 2 sealants.</li>
            <li> It comes with three different front panels for your child to choose.  It has an internal beeper that lets children know when to move from one area to another (for example, moving from brushing the outer surface of bottom teeth to the top surface of the bottom teeth).  It encourages our 7-yr olds to brush longer than they have with regular spinning toothbrushes.</li>
            <li> Great, I recommend it.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my two year old and we love it! The outside is cute and the sound it makes is fun, love the timmer and LOVE the soft headed brushes, i have the adult sonic care and wish they made soft headed brushes (the red/blue part) because it doesnt hurt if we hit his other teeth with it on mistake while brushing the bottom. The timer is great and it tells you when to move onto the next section of teeth, this feature will work even better when he gets all of his teeth in. The only down side to this, is that the brush comes with 2 heads, one for younger kids and one for a little older kids, not very ideal if you are buying this for one age of child, the older brush is just sitting around because we will be not able to use it for years, way to big! But other then that fact, the brush is awesome!!!!!! The price cant be beat either, in walmart they were well over 60.00</li>
            <li> I have been using a Sonicare adult for many years.  Our dentist believes in it and sells them at his cost. The child model was....50 (no tax?...but good)  and a 10 mail in rebate.  This rebate coupon is sent to Dentists only.  They have the replacement bruses as well, however, even with a rebate, it is still a bit less at Amazon.  The brush has made it much easier for my daughter to brush her teeth. She is 5 years. We have never had a big battle, however, this is way easier.  That aside, the brush takes no effort to work way more effectivley then a manual method.  Not sure why I waited this long.  I would never use anything else for myself.  Check out your dentist .  They may do the same deal as our dentist did.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is a 2 year warranty on Sonicare toothbrushes. They will honor it.  Keep your receipt.</li>
            <li> I got two of these for each of my daughters. I was always buying new toothbrushes and just decided to splurge on these to save money on dental appointments. They work very well, my kids love them.</li>
            <li> My 9 year old loves this.  It lets me know when he has to switch quadrants in his mouth and lets him know when to stop brushing.  As a reminder the brush moves up to the two minutes (recommended by dentists) so the initial brushings seem very short.  I think this is a great idea because my child doesn&#x27;t like to brush so this got him used to brushing for the right amount of time..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only negative thing I can say about this brush is now my almost 2 year old wants one of his own.</li>
            <li> It is a must have if you have toddlers who don&#x27;t like toothbrushing time. Now our whole family have switched from the traditional manual brush to Sonicare series. It makes teeth brushing easier and more efficient.</li>
            <li> Ordered this for my 7 yr old son.  He usually has very little patience for brushing and just rushes through it.  The timer and musical chime has been great for him and he likes the brush overall. Only difficulty has been with teaching him to use it properly - he doesn&#x27;t keep his mouth shut so a lot of the toothpaste runs all over the place or the vibrating bristles spray the mirror.  Working on that though and I\\&quot;m sure he&#x27;ll soon be a little pro.  :-)</li>
            <li> like my review title says i love this toothbrush i bought this for my 7 year old son i no longer need to remind him to brush his teeth as soon as his feet hit the floor he is brushing and the timer is great let&#x27;s him know it is time to move to different sections on his teeth and his teeth look great you can see the difference it makes i highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> I think it is great that children 4 years old and older now have access to a rechargeable toothbrush just like their parents or grandparents. For that reason it should be an incentive for teeth brushing to be something  fun and they will brush longer due to the timer. I was surprised at the adult size of the handle, especially for a 4 y.o.&#x27;s  use. I suggest the length and girth be shorter and narrower. Also the decorative panels (3) are 2 dark blue ones and 1 bright yellow which seems geared towards little boys. Little girls like pastels, especially pinks and lavender to purples combined. I think it would be better to have the entire handle white and then 2 panels for each gender. As for use, this is a nice solid toothbrush. It is pre-programmed to gradually increase the power over 14 brushings. This feature can be de-and re-activated as needed. This is a nice feature if it becomes a hand-me-down (w/ new brush heads of course) for a younger sibling since the current price point is around 70. Another great feature is the recyclable battery. All in all I think Phillips has a potential winner if the few modifications are made. The reason 2 stars were absent, one is due to the cost and the second due to handle size and absence of little girl colors. The 2 year warranty is the same as the adult versions.</li>
            <li> I son loves his new toothbrush.  I like how it plays a tone every 30 seconds to let him know to change the area he is brushing.  He has been using this for about a couple of months and I have seen an improvement in his teeth.</li>
            <li> Love the new sonic care for kids.  the timer is a great idea. It peeps to rotate in mouth and then peeps to stop.  I have seen an improvement in my daughters teeth since using. Beats standing over them to brush good.</li>
            <li> I think it is a good toothbrush. it can help children use the toothbrush correctly. however, the deal in not very good. the price still is a little high.  I hope amz can promot the products sharply</li>
            <li> It is exactly the same as my \\&quot;adult\\&quot; version except it is in a cool color that he can change the face plate. When he used up the two heads it came with, we put on one of our \\&quot;grown up\\&quot; toothbrush heads on it. It works just great. Since we buy replacement heads for our adult toothbrush in bulk at Amazon so they are cheaper, it works out well. It even fits in the travel case from my \\&quot;grown up\\&quot; Sonicare toothbrush. Since I killed one of mine, we have an extra travel case. The travel charger for my Sonicare toothbrush works with this one as well, so we just pack one travel charger.&lt;br /&gt;As other reviewers have mentioned, it has two modes - one minute mode for younger brushers - it plays a note every 15 seconds. The two minute mode for \\&quot;more experienced\\&quot; brushers plays a note every 30 seconds.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Two things I did not like about this toothbrush - why does it not come with a travel case - I broke one of mine when I forgot about the travel case and packed it in a ziploc bag. Yes, since I killed that one we had an extra travel case, but for $50 I think they could include a $0.50 travel case to prevent that from happening to this one. The other thing is that it comes with two sizes of toothbrush heads - one for little kids and one for older kids. If you have an older child - my son is eight - you may have a hard time convincing him to use the smaller brush head like I did. I wish you could choose either two brush heads for older children (basically identical to the regular brush head) or two brush heads for younger children.</li>
            <li> I must admit that the toothbrush itself is good. However my issue is that the faceplate is a sticker.  You must stick it on permanently, you can&#x27;t change it once it is on without ruining it.  That is pretty lame in my opinion and an interchangeable faceplate would make much more sense for kids (especially if you had more than one kid using the brush).&lt;br /&gt;ALSO, my problem with Phillips is their customer service.  I filled out a rebate form and mailed it. It was returned with the note that because amazon gave me a &#x27;discount&#x27; on the product they wouldn&#x27;t give me the rebate!  Seriously, what does it matter to them how much I pay the retailer?  I contacted customer service they essentially said the same thing.  No rebate.  It&#x27;s a scam.  So besides those issues my daughter does like it although I think the settings are a bit powerful for her and she whined a few times because she said it hurt her mouth.  She is used to it now though and it cleans her teeth well.</li>
            <li> Purchased this for use for shared use by and 8 and 4 year old.   Their brushing is much, much better using this brush.   The sonicare action combined with the 2-minute built in timer has the kids brushing well and for an effective period of time.    The head swap process is easy and does not appear to be creating any wear sitatuion with the attachment mechanism.    We use it twice every night and we&#x27;re certainly glad we purchased it.</li>
            <li> My 8 year old son used to spend all of 15 seconds brushing his teeth. When his dentist recommended the Kids Sonicare (I didn&#x27;t know one existed), I thought it was worth a try. This is a great toothbrush for kids. It is expensive, but not when you compare it to the possibility of multiple dentist visits and fillings and more. Plus it makes a cute beep sound that helps the brusher know how much brushing is left to go! A thumbs up for this one.</li>
            <li> I ordered this for my child that had problems brushing her teeth.  The chimes let her know when to switch and long chime at the end lets her know when she is done.</li>
            <li> I bought two of these, one for each one of my girls.  This looks nice but there is a problem.  After my girls used this brush for a couple of months, I tried to change the heads since they needed to be replaced.  All the replacement heads are much longer even the one for kids so it makes it hard to use this brush.  Then later on, the brush did not work right no matter what I did.  I have been using an Orab B electric brush for the last 15 years and they are all awesome but I am not impressed with this Sonicare.  I am going to buy my girls the Orab B brush that I know it is reliable.</li>
            <li> I have been an owner of several Sonicare&#x27;s for over 10 years myself.  The brand has proven to me that it cleans well as I have not had a cavity since.  I debated on ordering such a high end toothbrush for my 4 year old, but after what he went through at his last dentist visit (Dr. found a cavity on his front tooth) I had to get him his own Sonicare.  I can not brush his teeth myself daily so I am relying on the Sonicare and it&#x27;s thousands of &amp;#34;brush strokes&amp;#34; to do a better job than his ordinary toothbrush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I searched my local drugstore and other online stores and found that Amazon had the best price-almost 1/2 of what my drugstore was asking and $20 less than other online stores.</li>
            <li> Love these sonicare brushes.  Really gets the kids&#x27; to do a good job brushing.  Replacement heads are where these guys make the money, though.</li>
            <li> We bought this for my 6 year old daughter and she loves it.  Not only does it play little ring  tones to remind her to keep the brush moving around in her mouth but comes with a couple different snap on covers she likes to change around.  Plus it helps keep her teeth cleaner.  No cavities in her little mouth :)</li>
            <li> 7 year old loves it, and is highly motivated since he recently had to have a cavity filled. One of the 5 year old twins lets us use it on him but doesn&#x27;t want to use it himself, and the other twin still refuses to use it altogether. I&#x27;d probably wait until they were a little older, but we&#x27;ll use them all eventually.</li>
            <li> I have the adult version of the Sonicare and have been very happy with it.  So I was pleased to be able to try this model out and see how my daughter would like it, and whether it would encourage \\&quot;longer\\&quot; brushing.     Like many children, my daughter was not very good at \\&quot;estimating\\&quot; the amount of time she should be spending brushing her teeth.  She was somewhat surprised at how long two minutes really is, although I would constantly nag her that she hadn&#x27;t brushed anywhere near that long.  This toothbrush really helped (although she initially argued that it was \\&quot;wrong\\&quot; and that she had been brushing longer).      I have to believe that an electronic toothbrush like the Sonicare inherently brushes \\&quot;better\\&quot; than a kid using a \\&quot;regular\\&quot; toothbrush. When you add in the convenience of the recharging base, and the incremental timing features, this is a great product for the price.</li>
            <li> Very good produce, The Sonicare  can work in 110-240V.&lt;br /&gt;My 6 years old girl like it.She use it every day.</li>
            <li> My daughter is loving her new brush, she said it&#x27;s tingling in the mouth. Now she is visiting the bathroom with such enthusiasm! And I am more calm about her teeth getting clean.</li>
            <li> My six year old son has been using this for about 2 months now.  Previously we were using the spin brushes.  The heads on the kid&#x27;s spin brushes were so big that he would gag when he brushed his back teeth. Also that fact you had to change batteries every month made them expensive.  He had his 1st caveity over the summer.    I saw this toothbrush advertised in Parent&#x27;s magazine.  I knew we had to try it.  I wasn&#x27;t sure if my son would like it.  From the minute he saw it, he couldn&#x27;t wait to use it.  The &#x27;age&#x27;appropriate heads make this toothbrush the best money I spent in years.  My son loves it. I don&#x27;t get any fights about brushing.  He even will brush much longer then the 2 minute cycle.  He no longer gags trying to brush the back teeth.  Before he started using it, his back teeth were starting to yellow from not being brushed throughly.  Now they are back to their pearly whites again.  This is a must have for any child.  We can&#x27;t wait for his next check-up!</li>
            <li> My kids got used to using this and now they have cleaner teeth.  What else are you looking for?  That is it.  Had different skins too to decorate to your kids&#x27; desires.</li>
            <li> Great product. Must Buy.&lt;br /&gt;Kids loved it, good present as well .. it was easy to set up and use.</li>
            <li> So, great toothbrush! My three year old loves it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only downside, which I just now realized since the thing needs charging... there is no charger included.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I guess I understand the price and no charger, but come on! Now I have to buy a $25 charger? Lame.</li>
            <li> We purchased two Sonicare for Kids Toothbrushes for our children seven months ago in hopes of improving the oral hygiene, especially our 5 year old daughter who had her first cavities last summer. My kids appear to really enjoy using the product.  The size and the weight of the product has not been an issue for any of my children ages 2-11.  My two year old even enjoys brushing his own teeth, though we go back over them with the timer on the short program just to be sure they were properly cleaned. The tooth brush sets come with two sets of brush heads that were perfect for my 4 kids since two fell into each age range (well, the 2 year old is a bit young according to the product but he loves it so what the heck).  Unfortunately, the replacement brush heads are a bit costly at approximately $20 for a pair with the standard 3 month suggested replacement.  Right now, there is a rebate for $5 so stock up on a couple if you think the base will last, if not, guess no reason to purchase the replacement heads.    The charging base is the standard bland hygenic white plastic but the brush handles are red and do come with three sets of faceplates.  As others mentioned, would have been nice if one of the covers was pink, red or a more frilly color for my daughters but they don&#x27;t seem to mind the blue.  Unfortunately, that left my son&#x27;s with black since we are trying to keep the two sets and four heads separate so they don&#x27;t end up using one another toothbrushes.  The Philip&#x27;s soft traveling case has a lot to be desired, it allows the toothbrush to turn on in the luggage because it is a soft case unlike our Oral B hard travel cases.  BTW, the Oral B stand provides a covered storage space for four brush heads which is also very useful.      At first glance, the product seems to be pretty sturdy, unfortunately, as another owner experienced, this product was designed for use by more than one child.  My wife or I will replace the brush heads, yet, at this point, we have one that isnon functional because the link that couples the gears to the brush head seems to have become disconnected.  So the $90+tax toothbrush becomes a bathroom decoration until we decide if its worth the hassle to RMA it back to Philips if the next one is going to go out on us within a year.  Until then, guess it is a fairly nice decorative piece in the kid&#x27;s bathroom (sarcasm)and back to disposable spin brushes.  By comparison, our Oral B is now four + years old and we have had no issues with its transmission, motor or battery life. The two year warranty is great but if the product continually requires warranty work (i.e., Dodge vehicles) then the time it is out of service diminishes the value of the product.    So while the product worked, it was worth the cost; however, if they break within a year then their workmanship or design is suspect.  This leads me to believe it is overpriced about $50 too high at the current cost.  It should cost about the same as two disposable electric toothbrushes not 9 spin brushes at the current cost of the Sonicare.  So in end, this may be a really good brush if you buy one for each child.  If you plan on switching out the heads for multiple children, I would considered another more robust toothbrush (maybe an Oral B product which seems to be built to a more robust standard).    Just in case someone is wondering, I am not an employee of Oral B nor its subsidiaries nor do I own stocks in the company.  Just a person who has used both products and find the Oral B a bit more robust given it has lasted over eight times longer.</li>
            <li> We bought this for our 7 yr old son because he doesn&#x27;t brush long enough on his own.  Now I know he&#x27;s brushing for the recommended 2 minutes since it has a timer.  And he thinks it&#x27;s cool to have a power toothbrush.  He likes to brush his teeth now!!</li>
            <li> Originally I gave this brush 5 stars, I loved how it worked, my son loved using it, it was really great...until a few months in, when it just stopped working. I kept it clean, always supervised my son while he used it, so fairly sure it has not need dropped. Needless to say I tried charging it but it was dead. There&#x27;s no way to open it, so I could no enlist my father in law to fix it. In the garbage it went, very sad.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my 6 yr. old son. his orthodontist recommended this brush for the best cleaning. After he got past the initial tickle vibration he loves using it.</li>
            <li> I have enjoyed using this with my two girls, 3 and 4. Our dentist recommeded it. I have a hard time get the back teeth and flossing can be a chore for my 3 year old. This brush get inbetween the teeth and is easy to use. We got a great deal and we love it. I love the timing feature. It beeps to let you know when to move on. The girls are enjoying brushing and I hope for an excellent visit to the dentist next time.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this two years now and it still works like new.  I would recommend it.  It has also helped with my son&#x27;s dental visits.</li>
            <li> Brushing my granddaughter&#x27;s teeth (she&#x27;s not quite two) has been a battle for over a year now.  She hates having anyone mess around with her mouth.  Her parents have tried nearly everything they can think of: stories, songs, videos while brushing, and nothing has worked all that well.  It was a pin her down and listen to her scream experience that had to be repeated more than once a day since she had the beginnings of cavities at 12 months.  Well I can now say that while she still doesn&#x27;t love having her teeth brushed that this toothbrush has taken it from a scream fest to slight complaining.  She actually sits up to have her teeth brushed now, no more pinning her down needed.    I was a little skeptical about this toothbrush for an under two year old until the dentist on the veryyoungkids teeth group recommended it.  He said that it does a better job than manual brushing and works for kids under two.  Other parents there said that their children liked it better than manual tooth brushes and apparently it&#x27;s true.  I&#x27;m not sure whether it&#x27;s the buzzy tickling sensation or the musical tones, but it&#x27;s made the whole routine much more tolerable for one little girl.  So glad I bought it for her.</li>
            <li> Our pediatric dentist recommended this toothbrush for our 3-year-old.  It has always been a challenge getting him to brush his teeth but it&#x27;s been 100x better since getting this toothbrush.  Its colorful and fun... has fun tones.  I would highly recommend this toothbrush for the challenging toddler!</li>
            <li> If you are buying disposable rechargeable toothbrushes for your kids, please stop. Those things are terrible and wasteful. This thing is a champ, and my daughter loves it. The 2-minute timer is great and the cleaning job it does is superb. Couldn&#x27;t be happier with it.</li>
            <li> Our daughter got this for christmas 2013 when she was 4 years old. 1 1/2 years later and it runs like new still. Her teeth are in great shape, so it does a good job cleaning. The sounds it makes help the little ones stay motivated during brushing.&lt;br /&gt;We love it!</li>
            <li> It wasn&#x27;t long after we bought these that we found out that our dentist had started recommending them for kids, which made us feel even better about them. It only took our kids (ages 5 &amp; 7) a few days to get used to the vibration, and they love them! They come with three front panel options (different colors) so each of our kids picked a different one so that they could tell them apart. This brush comes with two different size heads for larger and smaller mouths. Our older child needed the larger one, and our younger child the smaller one. Now we just purchase the appropriate sized refills.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here&#x27;s what we like about them:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*When you first begin using them the timer for brushing is short so that they can get used to the new feel of vibration. It gradually builds up to the full time (2 minutes I think?).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*The audible tones are great, and my kids really enjoy hearing them. It has made it easy to teach them how to brush all four parts of their teeth (upper inside/outside, lower inside/outside).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*The brush handle is long enough for a parent to hold on and help (which we sometimes do).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*The chargers work great and look good on the counter behind the sink.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*The on/off button is very easy to operate for both of our children.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*The kids have CLEANER TEETH!! That&#x27;s the point after all, right?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If there is one dislike, I would say that the brush is a bit heavy for little kids because of the bulk and the battery. However, it didn&#x27;t take long for our 5 year old to be able to hold it properly without help.</li>
            <li> Great for our children. It has a timer on it to let our children  know when it is time to move to another section of there mouth and when they are finished.</li>
            <li> I wanted my 8 year old to use our Sonicare toothbrush, but it is just too strong for him. I was looking at this one for quite a while and even had it in my cart at Target a half a dozen times. So excited that I was able to find this on Amazon for SO much less than at Target.</li>
            <li> My son hates brushing his teeth and needs all the help he can get. Short of holding him down and doing it myself, this is the next best thing!</li>
            <li> We have been a Sonicare family for a long time...using the regular adult version with a different color coded brush head for everyone.  Everyone loves the usability and I love the fact that its easy to drop on its base so that its charged every time you need to use it.  However, as with all kids, brushing requires some motivational skills...this is exactly what did it.  Read on...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Kids hate to brush, its a chore for them...so how can you make it more exciting.  This product is the answer, at least in our family.  We have three kids 12, 7, 7 that already use Sonicare for their daily brushing..but their mom has to remind them regularly to get it done.  When this rendition of the Sonicare arrived, it took 10-15 minutes of discussing which face plate would go on it.  Once the decision was made it was time to flip a coin to see who would go first.  It begins.  Day 2 into this and they are up there on their own brushing their teeth.  I am sure the novelty will wear off, but for now I think its more exciting for them that they have their own rechargeable electric toothbrush.  Time will tell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bursh heads from the Sonicare are all inter-compatible and thus you can subscribe and save ( [[ASIN:B000WHNI2I Philips Sonicare ProResults HX6013 Brush Head Standard 3pk]] ) - I recommend subscribing to get a few replacements every few months...as recommended by dentists.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Box includes the brush, the charger, and 3 face plates that will allow for it to be customized to the kids taste.  It also comes with two brush heads, one round and one that resembles a small regular tooth brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Quick Note: We have spoken to our dentist numerous times about the Sonicare product and she says it is one of the best in the market...she also stated that all of the $10 or less products that are battery operated are quite useless and do not really help you with oral hygiene.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a great product, which is indeed a bit on the pricey side.  We have had 2 units running for 1.5yrs+ and they continue to work as if they were brand new.  In the end there is a beneficial value to be realized from the upfront investment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Enjoy!hey continue to work as if they were brand new.  In the end there is a beneficial value to be realized from the upfront investment.    Enjoy!</li>
            <li> I already have one for myself and both one of these for my son.  Took a little getting use to it but now he uses it all the time, very handy and gets the job done.  I have had no issues and would recommend this to a fried.</li>
            <li> Great device works fine, it comes with two replacement brushes, one for child and one for adults, the engine power is enough to clean your teeth or at least for giving you that kind of sensation. You can not wrong by buying this item, if you have the money go for it.</li>
            <li> Grand kids really like--so brushing teeth has become fun, not a chore.  Wish I could have professionally personalized with their names.</li>
            <li> Bought these for my 3 and 6 year olds.  It was a chore brushing their teeth with standard tooth brush, and even if we succeeded in getting them to brush themselves, the teeth weren&#x27;t clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With the Sonicare, the kids love to brush!  These are not as strong in terms of brushing force as the adult versions.  The adult brushes fit fine, and last longer (cheaper, too.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The kids usually brush in the shower, so these get wet all the time.  After a year, so far so good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And yes, even little kids can brush cleanly!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> Get this for your kids. Paying for one cavity is so much more expensive than this. Start them on healthy brushing habits early and it&#x27;ll benefit them their entire lives. Comes with 2 heads. My boys share the main body and have their own brush heads.</li>
            <li> it beeps alot, but my 2 yer old loves that hers is like moms. i love the slow and fast settings.</li>
            <li> My daughter loves the toothbrush And I love it, too. Cleans her teeth pretty good. Very easy to use and music is good</li>
            <li> After spending THOUSANDS of dollars on our daughter&#x27;s mouth, our hygienist suggested this product.  Our daughter had real difficulty brushing on the insides of her teeth, as well as the two front teeth (for some reason).  This brush has allowed her to brush effectively without *much* intervention by us.  She is 7, so I&#x27;m glad that we can trust her to brush her teeth and know that they&#x27;re all being reached.  I still check her mouth every few days, and there&#x27;s hardly ANY build-up/calcification like there used to be.  Good check-ups now!</li>
            <li> For years I&#x27;ve been plauged by \\&quot;can I be done?\\&quot; questions. No Longer! My girls lnow when to change sides, Their teeth are cleanner than ever and best of all they know when to be done. I totally recommed this toothbrush!.&lt;br /&gt;The only down side I can find is that the chaging stand has only a little peg to stand on.</li>
            <li> Great for the kids, as it slowly increases the time of brushing. They use it until it stops, and with each &amp;#34;sound&amp;#34; tells them to switch quadrants. Much better mouth care, as opposed to a regular toothbrush.</li>
            <li> Having had great checkups after using my own Sonicare, I immediately picked up the Kids Sonicare model when it became available. It&#x27;s compact for little hands, easy to use, and the musical chime ensures a proper 2-minute brushing. There are two brushing modes that allow for gentler brushing for the young ones and the two head sizes available are ideal for growing mouths, too. My two children ages 7 &amp; 4 have been sharing this handle since Sonicare introduced it over a year ago, and they&#x27;ve had great dental checkups ever since. Having experienced other electric \\&quot;kid\\&quot; toothbrushes, one can really tell Sonicare thought this model through. They even thought of making the back of the handle flat so that it doesn&#x27;t roll off the sink while applying toothpaste. What a simple, yet effective idea! Other so called kid-models were bulky &amp; noisy that were quickly abandoned and thrown out. My only complaint is that the toothbrush head storage plastic holder pins on the charger broke off after a year of use. I must also praise Sonicare Customer Service. Recently, after what I&#x27;m sure was almost 1500 cycles of use (two kids sharing handle night and day), the battery completely died. A quick call to customer service, verification of the serial number, and I had a new handle on its way. Tip: This is one of those times it pays to keep your receipt around. I&#x27;ve definitely become a loyal, lifelong customer and I&#x27;m sure my kids will be, too!</li>
            <li> Best Toothbrush ever! My kids teeth are getting whiter by the day and they are able to brush by them self (age 5 and 7) for the right amount of time (because has a timer!) I soooo recommend this product. And it arrived before it was supposed to.</li>
            <li> All I need to share is that I can get my 9 year old to brush his teeth for the full 2 minutes twice every day now thanks to this toothbrush.   BTW, if you are also buying the brush heads, the age 7-10 one seems to be a little too big. You&#x27;d better see it yourself after you get this toothbrush, which comes with both the 4-7 and 7-10 sizes.</li>
            <li> My 5 and 8 year old grandsons love their new toothbrushes.  It helps to remind them to brush all areas and they liked picking out their own decorative panel from the 3 provided.</li>
            <li> My son loves this toothbrush! Just have to get used to it (because he&#x27;s only used manual toothbrushes).  No more arguing about &amp;#34;brush time&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> Excellent product! Arrived as described and a very good value!</li>
            <li> I have a hard time getting my 5 year old to brush her teeth... but she has been getting better after we bought this brush 6 Monthis ago. The timing buzzer is a nice feature, reminding her to brush all 4 quadrants for the appropriate amount of time. And it has two different speeds .&lt;br /&gt;This comes with 2 different size brush heads. I actually use the \\&quot;big kid\\&quot; one on my own teeth. No complaints from my dentist at my latest checkup... it does a good job.</li>
            <li> I purchased this item in September 2011.  It is now May 2012 and the toothbrush no longer works.  It no longer recharges and no longer vibrates.  I thought it would last longer than 8 months.</li>
            <li> I recommend this brush not just for kids, but for adults with limited dexterity, crowded teeth, heavy stain, and those who found the original Sonicare too strong for their sensitive teeth, but want the toothbrush with the best ability to remove stains. I can agree that I have seen significant stain removal after a week of using the brush, and it is a great investment for anyone who is interested in whitening their teeth. The two head sizes make this a versatile brush for everyone. Safe if you have veneers, implants, etc. Just take the time to read the brushing instructions - this is not like the other brushes on the market.</li>
            <li> I bought these for my grandsons, ages 4 and 9, after 2 disappointing dental checkups. Both boys brush regularly, but obviously were missing something important. They&#x27;ve tossed their old battery-operated brushes, and are all about these. The older boy was the slow starter, complaining that it made his lips itch. But parental advice to stop brushing his lips and work on his teeth got him past that hurdle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The beauty of the Philips Sonicare is that the timer makes sure that they do brush for 2 full minutes and it&#x27;s high-tech which keeps them interested. I&#x27;ll be very surprised if this Does All The Work toothbrush doesn&#x27;t yield good results at their next visit to the dentist.</li>
            <li> Wow, you need to buy this thing.  Its quality, works great, and best of all... your 3 year old will HATE IT!  It makes brushing your teeth and therapy session in 30 years for your kids.  I am sure this will be another reason they hate me in adulthood.</li>
            <li> Great toothbrush!  Kids brush and get raving reviews from dentist.  Only drawback is that the plastic covers get cruddy fairly quickly.  I like this brush even then the adult version.  Save your money and buy this for the adults in the family too!</li>
            <li> Kids love them. The timer makes sure that the kids brush long enough. The changeable plates on front help if you have more that one child. The dentist could tell an improvement, and that makes them worth it alone.&lt;br /&gt;I would buy from this company again.</li>
            <li> This is a great toothbrush!  My 7 yr old son never wanted to brush his teeth (and certainly not for 2 mins) and now I don&#x27;t even have to ask.  I like that it has different plates to change the patter on the front in case you have multiple kids/toothbrushes.  I like the 2 different brush head options for different age groups.  Its also great that the toothbrush looks and feels like Mom and Dad&#x27;s brush so your child can feel like a grownup yet still have gentle brush strokes.  This brush was totally worth it!</li>
            <li> A great sonic toothbrush for the kids. They know how to use it, and it&#x27;s not too strong for them. The battery holds a charge for a very long time without the need to recharge. Excellent quality. The only issue is that the decals that come with the toothbrush peel off after a few months of use.</li>
            <li> We bought this as a Christmas gift and found it to be very effective at encouraging good brushing habits for children. The timer keeps them brushing for longer than with a manual toothbrush and there are intermittent beeps to remind them to move to another area of the mouth. Overall a great product and more effective than standard brushes.</li>
            <li> We really enjoyed this electric toothbrush. It triggered my 9 year old&#x27;s real interest in cleaning his teeth well, and while we don&#x27;t use it for every brushing session, it is handy to have around for a thorough brush!</li>
            <li> It is a really good quality electric toothbrush for kids.  My 4 years old loves it and it has music on 30 second intervals.  And it is not too rough it&#x27;s gentle enough for kids!</li>
            <li> Overall, I agree with the other positive reviews but wanted to add two unexpected issues.  First, the brush head does not fit all the way down to the base of the handle.  The Philips rep stated it is made that way as the rubber encasing does not adequately allow for this to happen.  As such, there is a gap between the brush head and handle.  Slightly annoying because you naturally want to press down on the brush head to remove the gap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Secondly, the plastic shield that protects the bristles of the brush does not easily come off when you&#x27;re ready to use it.  You literally have to hold down on the brush head to remove the plastic shield.  Again the Philips rep stated it&#x27;s made that way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the moment of doing home care with your children, it&#x27;s slightly cumbersome to deal with the aforementioned issues but overall it does a great job of brushing those young teeth.  Hope this review helps for those who are curious about the \\&quot;details\\&quot; and appreciate full disclosure.</li>
            <li> My kid LOVES this toothbrush!  And so do we. The features most import to us: rechargeable, varied speeds, and the charm/music that plays very 30 sec, and the auto shut off after two minutes.  BTW, I &amp;#34;stalked&amp;#34; this item in my Amazon cart/save for later until the price dropped down to the low 30s.  Paying retail price for this just seemed too high.</li>
            <li> My kids&#x27; brushing habits have definitely improved with the use of these.  There are 2 sized brush heads for different ages as well as an adjustable time sequence.</li>
            <li> works good. long run. my son still using it!</li>
            <li> Worth the money. Kids love the musical sounds it chimes when it&#x27;s time to brush another area. Also like the two levels of bristle rotation. Not too powerful for my 5 year old. Cleans very well!</li>
            <li> I had wanted to introduce my 4yr old to an electric toothbrush in order to improve his cavities problem. After some research, i decided to get the Philips Kids Sonicare but the local electronic stores in Singapore is asking over SGD110 (USD90) for it! After determining that it&#x27;s worldwide voltage (110v-240v), I took the plunge and had it shipped over plus a couple boxes of replacement brush heads.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My boy loves the musical chimes and I loves how the tartar and bit of pieces of food is being flushed out from every nook and cranny between his teeth. Brushing is an effortless glide from tooth to tooth instead of the usual vigorous side to side brushing. For his molars, I just let the brush head linger a little while more. His teeth now comes out clean every brush. This toothbrush costs less than a visit to the dentist here in Singapore and is an excellent investment!</li>
            <li> This toothbrush does a much better job than a regular/manual one. It&#x27;s encouraged my child to brush their teeth more often and for longer periods. I like how it times the brushing and makes music when it&#x27;s finished. Good investment!</li>
            <li> We were using the disposable battery powered toothbrushes with characters before we got this toothbrush and we heard complaints about the vibrations and how it was uncomfortable when we brushed.  Those complaints stopped with this brush the first time we used it and we have not heard any other complaints since we started using it.  The timer is great not only because he knows we will stop brushing when it is over, but since it uses multiple tones as the time passes he knows how long he has till it turns off.   The brush is easy for him to handle, yet we can brush is teeth with it easily as well.  Overall we have been very happy with this brush and recommended it to other parents as well as telling our dentist about it so he could tell other parents if he wanted.</li>
            <li> Perfect for kids. My son brushes without help...and he brushes well and for two full minutes.  This toothbrush is worth the money.</li>
            <li> The toothbrush refused to turn off. Called them up and they quickly replaced it. I was just outside their warranty period too. Their staff was knowledgeable and it only took one call to one person.&lt;br /&gt;This toothbrush works just like the adult ones, though I wish you could turn the volume off and on. My kid hates the beep that the brush makes to indicate you need to switch to a new quadrant.  She&#x27;ll live though.</li>
            <li> We bought this for our 8 and 5 year old sons.  They like the musical tones that tell them to switch to a new brushing area (top,inside,bottom,inside).  It&#x27;s a little ticklish on them the first few times (as it was with ours).  I like that it seems to do a more thorough job than a standard toothbrush.  They also brush longer, rather than just sliding the brush over their teeth a few times.  There are also two settings -- low and high -- so they can get use the lower setting as they got used to the vibrations in the brush.  My 5-yr-old still prefers the standard toothbrush, but the 8-yr-old likes this one.  I think the 5-yr-old still hasn&#x27;t gotten used to the vibrations.  My only other complaint is that the brushes are difficult to swap out.  They are push-on and pull-off brushes and the fit is pretty tight -- much too hard for a 5-yr-old to do by himself.  I even struggled with it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a cheap skate so spending this much on toothbrush for my son was very difficult.  He has always been a good brusher but his front teeth were still a little yellow no matter how long he brushed.  In one week using this Sonicare brush his teeth were sparkling white. We really love the 2 minute shut off feature and alarm every 30 seconds to change locations. Well worth the money!!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used a sonicare toothbrush since the late 90s {I started VERY VERY young...:P} and have always been impressed w/ its performance and effectiveness.  Saw this at a brick/mortar store (way overpriced) and found here (reasonably priced).  My son loves using it, I love the fact it has a timer that teaches kids how long to brush their teeth (means I don&#x27;t have to nag anymore).  The smaller brush head is just the right size for his mouth.  He loves the interchangeable face plates &#x3D; we are both pleased!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve has a Sonicare toothebrush for many years and it has always done a good job on my teeth. I bought these for my children but they refuse to use it, even on the most gentile setting. They complain it hurt their teeth and gums. Will need to try again when they are a little older.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my kids on recommendation from their dentist. They love the fun tones that play every 30 sec and treat it like a game to get up to the 2 min timer. Easy to use, they&#x27;ve had no issue taking brushes on/off or putting it on charging stand. Very happy with this purchase.</li>
            <li> I have always used power and spin brushes for my kids, but they would have to be constantly reminded to brush longer. This one makes it so much easier for them to give their teeth a good once over. The musical cues along the way are fun and I can see each of my kids (ages 8 and 6) timing it in their heads until the next tune plays. My son (the 6 year old) even said he created a system to change sides of his mouth when the song changes. Their teeth are clean and healthy looking and their breath has even improved. Right now we have just the one unit and the kids each have their own brush head, but I am considering getting another unit just so they can each be more independent rather than having to take turns. Plus it would help out with our time management in the morning. I got this at a really good price ($34.99) so I am keeping my eye on this on Amazon for a good future deal. I would recommend this to any parent who wants good, diligent teeth brushing that their kids are eager to do for themselves.</li>
            <li> My kid loves this. Great  and fun way for them to learn to care for their only set of teeth from a young age.  Team up with Tom&#x27;s silly strawberry toothpaste and you will have to pull the toothbrush away from them.</li>
            <li> This is about 30% cheaper than the regular adult version, but it works just the same. Recommend to anyone, any age. Although they sell kids&#x27; size brush head, the connector is the same. Only difference is the size of the brush.  So you can use any brush head as long as the connector is the same type.  So that&#x27;s another plus. The color is very bright and doesn&#x27;t look like a typical \\&quot;toothbrush\\&quot; and actually brightens up our bathroom.</li>
            <li> My dentist told me that the kids and adults toothbrush were the same so instead of buying the $100 +++ for adults. The only thing is you have to buy adult brushes...</li>
            <li> After two and a half years of dental worries, surgeries, extractions, and cavities, my 3-yr-old daughter is finally officially cavity free!! I attribute it in large part to using this toothbrush for the last 9 months.  We certainly haven&#x27;t done anything else different. If you have a child, and can afford it, I *highly* recommend this toothbrush!!</li>
            <li> This toothbrush is great.  I have had a sonicare for sometime now and as soon as I was aware of a sonicare for kids I jumped on it.  I like that it&#x27;s timed for 2 min for 7yrs and up and it is also timed for each section of the upper and lower mouth.  My child&#x27;s dentist was also pleased when I told him I made the purchase.</li>
            <li> Worked great until we took it on the plane.  Stopped working after the flight.  It would turn off and on randomly.</li>
            <li> for our 6 year old - and he&#x27;s LOVING brushing his teeth now! Brushing was a struggle before this; well worth the cost.</li>
            <li> We have three boys. After reading other reviews, we purchased three toothbrushes so they wouldn&#x27;t have to change the heads (which I know would lead to taking off a brother&#x27;s and leaving it lying on the counter - gross!). The boys enjoy brushing with these and they seem to do a great job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Our dentist did recommend we use this one time a day, and let them practice without turning it on another time - just so they get the experience of brushing on their own.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-Six Months Later-&lt;br /&gt;Still going strong. We haven&#x27;t had a single problem with this product. I&#x27;d recommend this to my friends.</li>
            <li> I bought this brush for my 13year old and Wow! for the first time ever her teeth are clean.  The tooth brush really helps remove tartar and plaque and her teeth are whiter than ever.  I love it!  It&#x27;s a must buy to get your kids teeth clean and healthy.</li>
            <li> The product is good, the kids have transitioned well to using them and really like them. They are still struggling brushing down near the gumline, but this has always been an issue- no fault of the toothbrush. I have seen an improvement in their teeth. Will see what the dentist says at the next visit! Considering buying the adult version for myself!</li>
            <li> He now loves brushing his teeth...does it several times a day as a result of the new toothbrush...great choice - great product!!</li>
            <li> i own two of these toothbrushes.  the timer is a great way to make sure the kids brush their teeth for 2 mins and the kids loves the toothbrushes.  i just wish the replacement heads is cheaper.</li>
            <li> certainly more thorough for our 3 boys, aged 5, 7, and 8.5 than them using their old brushes. This seems to do a better job and more importantly gets them brushing morning and before bed!</li>
            <li> This seems to be a well made product but I found the sensation of brushing with this to be a bit less pleasant than when I used an OralB electric toothbrush which I used for a while and continue to use sometimes. The high frequency motion tends to create a more intense sensation than the lower frequency  OralB motion. My kids (3 and 5 years old) liked using the OralB which had prompted me to purchase this brush for them but they seem to prefer manual toothbrushes over this one. I continue to use the Sonicare brush and I think I&#x27;ve gotten more used to it over time. Its not obvious to me that it does a better job at cleaning than the OralB electric toothbrush.</li>
            <li> Wish I had bought this sooner. My kid loves the toothbrush- and brushes for a full 2 minutes diligently every night and morning.</li>
            <li> My kids like the design on the toothbrush and it is just a mini version of the ones my husband and I have.  I like that it has 30 second beeps to remind the kids to switch sections in their mouths to brush.</li>
            <li> Timer to inform every 30 seconds, how to use simple!&lt;br /&gt;The products that exist to ease the toothpaste time.&lt;br /&gt;Because the electric century adjustable, it is a better product.</li>
            <li> Awesomest toothbrushes. My kids each took some time to get used to the vibration intensity (even though it has two settings, one for 4 and older and the other for 7 and older) but now they love it so much, they won&#x27;t use any other kind of brush.</li>
            <li> My son finally loves to brush his teeth! really loves the vibration and now he even keeps up with his hygiene without me having to remind him to brush his teeth.  it&#x27;s a tooth saver!!!</li>
            <li> Having had great checkups after using my own Sonicare, I immediately picked up the Kids Sonicare model when it became available. It&#x27;s compact for little hands, easy to use, and the musical chime ensures a proper 2-minute brushing. There are two brushing modes that allow for gentler brushing for the young ones and the two head sizes available are ideal for growing mouths, too. My two children ages 7 &amp; 4 have been sharing this handle since Sonicare introduced it over a year ago, and they&#x27;ve had great dental checkups ever since. Having experienced other electric \\&quot;kid\\&quot; toothbrushes, one can really tell Sonicare thought this model through. They even thought of making the back of the handle flat so that it doesn&#x27;t roll off the sink while applying toothpaste. What a simple, yet effective idea! Other so called kid-models were bulky &amp; noisy that were quickly abandoned and thrown out. My only complaint is that the toothbrush head storage plastic holder pins on the charger broke off after a year of use. I must also praise Sonicare Customer Service. Recently, after what I&#x27;m sure was almost 1500 cycles of use (two kids sharing handle night and day), the battery completely died. A quick call to customer service, verification of the serial number, and I had a new handle on its way. Tip: This is one of those times it pays to keep your receipt around. I&#x27;ve definitely become a loyal, lifelong customer and I&#x27;m sure my kids will be, too!</li>
            <li> My daughter was not a fan of using my Sonicare - tickled the roof of her mouth, I guess.  After she saw her friends using this she wanted one.  It has two speeds and works up to the full two minute cycle, but over a period of completed shorter cycles.  Seems to be a far better solution that a normal brush which rarely lasted more than 30 seconds, half of which was spitting out toothpaste and talking to Dad.</li>
            <li> I was getting concerned with how many teeth my niece was losing so I decided to get her one of these.  She was so excited when she saw it that she could hardly wait the recommended 12 hours for the first charge.  The first week she must have brushed her teeth 50 times.  The timer is great because it assures both her and me that she&#x27;s brushed long enough.  I would recommend this to every parent or doting aunt!</li>
            <li> I have 2 of these.  They work great.  Kids think they are fun.  They do work.  Grandma is a dentist and says she sees an improvement in their dental hygiene.  I registered them with Phillips (which I normally don&#x27;t).  One of them stopped working after 5 months and I called them up and they sent me a replacement immediately.  I like the adult version a bit better but the kids like the colored plates.</li>
            <li> Really easy for kids to use buy they tend to get black and moldy under then replaceable tooth brush head.</li>
            <li> I have twins and they were fighting over it so I got another one so they have their own. Love this product and well worth it.</li>
            <li> Bought two Sonicare for Kids for my grandchildren. The kids and the parents love them. Plan to buy 2 more for my oldest son&#x27;s boys. I would highly recommend this electric toothbrush for kids.</li>
            <li> When the time arrives to brush teeth, any parent will attest to how difficult it is to get a toddler to cooperate in that post meal ritual. Since buying this toothbrush (and accompanying toddler bjorn step-up to the sink) I literally never have a night where my son doesn&#x27;t cooperate fully. He&#x27;d let me brush his teeth for 5 minutes straight with this if I chose to (though we usually keep it to around 60 seconds). Because it&#x27;s a Sonicare you know it is doing a good job too. I couldn&#x27;t recommend this more highly.</li>
            <li> My kids have had this since December and it is now March. It makes brushing teeth with kids easier. It has two heads so it worked well for me with two kids, they both have their color.</li>
            <li> Worked great initially, but after less than two weeks all of the bristles fell out and the head cracked in half! Called customer service and still waiting for replacement heads (close to two weeks ago). May have to call again. Except for that problem, think it does a good job cleaning my daughter&#x27;s teeth and sound effects get her to brush longer.</li>
            <li> I love this toothbrush. It has a timer that goes off every 30 seconds. It can help them know when to switch sections to brush and they can know they are almost done. This is a great product!</li>
            <li> I purchased Sonicare for Kids for my two daughters who are 7 and 5.  Even though we had been fastidious with dental hygiene prior to purchasing the Sonicares, I have noticed a big difference in how clean their teeth are.  The children now brush a full two minutes and think that is is fun.  When my other kids grow up a bit, I&#x27;ll be getting them brushes too.</li>
            <li> I bought this toothbrush for my 6 year old daughter and she loves it!.. its so much easier to get her to brush now!!I recommend this highly!</li>
            <li> I purchased this for my granddaughter to help with her dental care, we were not disappointed, it works just like the adult version but for children.  She loved the timer, we did too.  It helps get to all those little areas in the back molars that are hard to reach with a traditional toothbrush.  I was very, very pleased with this purchase and would recommend it to anyone with small children.</li>
            <li> I bought these for my grandchildren who had some dental issues! I have an adult version recommended to me by my dentist years ago and I love it! I thought they would benefit from the pediatric version as well. It&#x27;s a little too soon to give a really great review but I think it will help them a lot!</li>
            <li> We bought three of these for our children. We were very happy with the results at first, but now one has broken already, and I can&#x27;t see how to exchange it or what the warranty situation is for the item. Makes me nervous to order again on-line.</li>
            <li> Excellent buy! Now my 6 yr old is brushing on his own without me worrying if he is doing it right and for long enough.</li>
            <li> My kid uses the Sonicare every night and her dentist has been happy. Of course less business for him! I just wish the replacement brushes are less expensive. But I guess with less money to dentist, I can recover my cost easily.</li>
            <li> My 7 and 4 year old kids loves it. It comes with 2 brush heads so they just share the unit and use different brush heads.</li>
            <li> Our two daughters love their new toothbrushes! These are a great investment in your kids dental health. No more cavities in this house.&lt;br /&gt;The vibrations take a little getting used to, and Philips handled that by giving two settings on handle to help the kids get used to it. The kids also enjoyed picking out their own interchangeable face plate.</li>
            <li> Sonicare is very good, but this one broke after 1 year of use.&lt;br /&gt;It broke mechanically. I had another one before, broke after 2  years of using.</li>
            <li> This item was rated for kids 4 and up.  Tired of endlessly replacing batteries in our 3-year-old&#x27;s toothbrushes, I bought one of these, thinking it would eventually save us money and end the wasteful, polluting chain of batteries.  Unfortunately the vibration is just too intense for him and we have barely used it.  He may grow into it, or not, but I would suggest you test out an adult vibrating toothbrush on your young child before shelling out the bucks for this one.  Otherwise a perfectly fine toothbrush - it even comes with two sizes of brush head for when their mouths get both literally and figuratively bigger.</li>
            <li> I brought my first sonicare in the late ninties and have brought them as gifts for my children and now my grandchildren.  They are great, great, great.  A dental tec told me if dentists gave out sonicare toothbrushes, it would put them out of business.  My cleanings at the dentist take about10 minutes.  I didn&#x27;t know if the grandkids would use it, but they have surprised me.  They are 10 and 8 years and they tell me they like the way their teeth feel after brushing with the sonicare.</li>
            <li> In today&#x27;s electronic world, I think kids are always excited for electronic type devices, at least my boys are.  I no longer have to ask if they brushed.  They enjoy this Sonicare and use without and prompting from me!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recommend cause it&#x27;s worth not having the &amp;#34;Brush Your Teeth Battle!&amp;#34;  :)</li>
            <li> My daughter really likes this toothbrush, and we like it because it gets her teeth cleaner. That said, it is basically the same thing as a regular Sonicare. It takes the same type of brush heads, uses the same type of charger. I might have been able to get a better deal on regular one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;FWIW, my wife is a dental hygienist and she strongly prefers the Sonicare.</li>
            <li> after a day or two of &amp;#34;hehehe it tickles&amp;#34; my 3.5 year old is fine with it. After 4K in dental work on him, I have high expectations for the check-up.</li>
            <li> Kid loves it. No kidding the battery lasted something like 4 months before had to recharge. Its a good size for my 6 year old to work with and she likes using it. Feel it does a better job than a regular brush. So far no cavities. Good quality product.</li>
            <li> I ordered this for my son who recently got braces. He loves and so does his orthodontist. My only complaint would be that right after I ordered it I saw it at Wal Mart for a cheaper price.</li>
            <li> I used a sonicare for years and have been hey with it. Got one for my son and he loves it.</li>
            <li> I love my sonicare so decided to get one for my son. The timer makes sure that he brushes the recommended period of time. He love the &amp;#34;your done&amp;#34; tune.</li>
            <li> Product quality is poor.  It is broken right after a year of normal use.  Even the head of the tooth brush rubber started feeling off during use.</li>
            <li> This is awesome for the kids! It gets their teeth brushed just as they should be! My dentist sells this brush at his office, only more expensive! He recommended it, great product for small and older children!</li>
            <li> Have had a sonicare brush for myself for 2 years now. Just bought these for my kids to help make the next step to brushing effectively.&lt;br /&gt;These are great and worth EVERY PENNY!</li>
            <li> Great product, my daughter loves brushing now bc she enjoys the little song it plays at the end!  In regards to cleaning, Sonicare is the best when it comes to oral health.</li>
            <li> nice design. long lasting battery (between charges). it makes beeps to count time how long to brush and stops on its own after two minutes of brushing. my kid loves it and doesn&#x27;t complain any more about time to brush; now she knows that we are done only when it stops. will recommend.</li>
            <li> A little expensive up front, but in the long run the value is there. My 5 year old loves to brush her teeth now.</li>
            <li> My 7 yr old son loves this toothbrush and it has made brushing easier and the timer is great as it tells him when to move around in his mouth.  He has great dental check-ups so we are sold on this toothbrush!</li>
            <li> I got sick of buying the cheap ones for my kids and having them die so I decided to get two of these.  They also clean their teeth better.  Definitely recommend.</li>
            <li> my kids brush their teeth and finish without even realizing what they are doing. However, these brushes are pricey so shop around.</li>
            <li> Miles better than your disposable electric toothbrush you find at Wal-Mart.  Cleans vigorously without having to worry about recharging batteries.  We got 2 heads: one for boy, one for girl.  Would purchase again!</li>
            <li> Great electrical toothbrush!  It is functional and also very cute.  Both of my two sons love to using it .</li>
            <li> Great toothbrush!  Children had to get use to the feel and now it is wonderful.  It&#x27;s a new toy for their teeth!</li>
            <li> Our family loves Sonicares, but for some reason, the last two Kids&#x27; Sonicares we have purchased, have broken shortly after the warranty expired.</li>
            <li> The battery pack on this died within three months.  We purchased a new one from BedBath&amp;Beyond and it&#x27;s been okay (it&#x27;s been about 4 months now, so maybe we got one that was a bad egg?  You should be able to buy new brush heads and keep on charging for quite some time, but our luck hasn&#x27;t been great with the kid&#x27;s versions.</li>
            <li> the toothbrushes are good for kids while they work, but one out of 2 stopped working at 6 months!  If you have sonic are toothbrushes you&#x27;ll know that they are great - same applies to the kids version.  Wish I could recommend them, but seems too likely to break...</li>
            <li> Really nice toothbrush. Hope it helps keep my sons teeth cleaner. He seems to like it better than a normal brush.</li>
            <li> I have been using the adult version for about 5 yrs. Purchased this for my Kids and it has been better for them too. Usually my 8 yr old and the 10 year old dont do a good job of brushing manually.</li>
            <li> Went through two of these in a year and a half. Not sure is was really working that well either. My kid&#x27;s dentist still said her teeth were pretty stained. I see I can finally get a kids version of a proper rechargeable spinbrush. I used the adult version of those for years with no issues so will try that next.</li>
            <li> Good price, use perfectly. Even it is designed for kids, it also works for adults. Will buy the brush heads and continue to use it.</li>
            <li> We were having some problems getting our 5 year old to brush thoroughly and this solved the issue. He loves using this brush. It plays a little tune when it&#x27;s time to move to a new section of the mouth and increases the brush time gradually. He also was able to customize his toothbrush by choosing his face plate. He is actually excited about brushing his teeth. Go figure.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my 2.5 years old and it makes it easier for me to brush her teeth faster and more thoroughly. I love it so much that I ended up ordering 6 more to give to all my nieces and nephews for Christmas. They love it</li>
            <li> The toothbrush is good and cleans my son&#x27;s teeth better than the manual one we had. I would like the bristles to be a little bit more soft, though.</li>
            <li> It Works very well and she loves the way her teeth feel after she brushes and she gets good dental reports.</li>
            <li> Every one should use an electric toothbrush (opposed to just a battery or manual). You will remove more plaque and keep the gums healthy!!</li>
            <li> Outstanding product for younger children! My son loves it. Its a great way to get kids into brushing their teeth right! !</li>
            <li> My daughter is two and throws an epic fit every time we try to brush her teeth. This has made my life so, so , so much easier. I can&#x27;t love it enough! It gives little beeps just like the adult sonicare. It also plays a little musical tune when you are done. Comes with a couple plates. Most importantly it gets the job done with minimal screaming and little fists flying.</li>
            <li> My son uses it every night.  It is not too strong for him.  He is 4 years old.  Very good buy.</li>
            <li> Genius, simply genius!  The cleaning power of sonicare in a fun package for kids.  My daughters have never brushed for so long, in fact I&#x27;ve often caught them going through two brush cycles because they like the musical sounds and the clean feeling.  Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> My son loves the sonicare toothbrush. He has braces and needed something better than a regular toothbrush. The small brush head works best.</li>
            <li> Every child should have this. So much more fun and gentler for those timid children uncomfortable with brushing. More comfortable for a child than the sonicare with the round heads. My son brags to his friends, now each of their parents are purchasing this product as well! Well worth the money. Great quality and does a great job cleaning hard to reach areas.</li>
            <li> Great toothbrush.  This this is very powerful and does not bother or tickle my child&#x27;s mouth when using it on them.</li>
            <li> With a manual brush, my 4 year old would brush for anout 30 seconds and say he did a great job brushing his teeth. I have a sonicare myself that I love, so I thought I would get him the one made for kids. The first few times he used it I had to help him sp he could get used to the sound it makes to let you know to change sections of his mouth. I also had to show him not to scrub or push too hard. Once he got the hang of it, it became kind of a game for him. He moves it over his teeth in one section of his mouth until the sound lets him know the change. Then the toothbrush turns off automatically when the 2 minutes is up. His teeth are finally getting clean like they are supposed to, and he&#x27;s brushing for the right amount of time. He also like the fact that we can change the plate on the front to have a different color and design when he&#x27;s tired of the other one. Thank you sonicare!</li>
            <li> I got this for my 3 year old a year ago and now I have to get a new one. I am disappointed and as you know it is a great day when we brush more than 2 times a day.</li>
            <li> Training mode is really good for the kids to get used to.  Will buy another one for my younger child!</li>
            <li> Nice product that makes my 3 year old look forward to brushing her teeth and being a big girl at that.</li>
            <li> My 5 year old son loves his toothbrush.  Before with a manual toothbrush, he would hurry through brushing his teeth.  Now he looks forward to brushing his teeth.  The 30 second timer on each quadrant of the mouth works great for him.  He likes the music that alerts his to switch and now he brushes for the full 2 minutes.  Definitely more expensive than a manual toothbrush but I feel that it will be well worth every penny when it comes to his dental visits.</li>
            <li> We are very happy with this brush &amp; my kids enjoy using it.  The small brush is too small for my 10 year old but it included a large brush also, so my little kid got the 2 small brushes &amp; my big kid got 2 big ones.</li>
            <li> my grandson wanted on like mom and dads (plus grandparents) and seems to enjoy brushing with us like a big boy, so he is now brushing more, which is what is needed!</li>
            <li> Easy &amp; fun for the kids.  Excellent yet gentle cleaning results.  Kids like the choice of face plates, mom &amp; dad like the price &amp; quality of the product.</li>
            <li> Hard to find a kid size sonic toothbrush. Glad to get it hear and serves its purpose very well. I&#x27;m very happy with it</li>
            <li> Kids love it!! The timer is great!! I have 3 and 5 year old who use it! Tickles a little!</li>
            <li> I like that this brush feels like it&#x27;s REALLY cleaning my sons teeth, but a huge downside is that it oversprays toothpaste and spit everywhere. I am still brushing my sons teeth for him, so his mouth is open while brushing. When i brush the front teeth, the toothbrush sprays on his nose, chest, cheeks. It vibrates so hard it actually shakes all the toothpaste off. I&#x27;m pretty disappointed in this, it&#x27;s making a mess of my bathroom every night.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m going to try using it with less charge to see if the vibrating will slow.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would imagine this would not be an issue for older brushers who are able to close their lips around the brush while brushing.</li>
            <li> It has been a couple months since purchase and it cleans great, easy to use, and sturdy.&lt;br /&gt;Timer function is also a plus.</li>
            <li> இ Fuzzy Wuzzy&#x27;s Summary:&lt;br /&gt;ѾѾѾѾ Recommended with warm fuzzies.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As a long-time user of Sonicare electric toothbrushes (I am currently using their FlexCare), this product marks Philips&#x27; first foray into making a similar toothbrush for kids.  Overall, the unit is of excellent design and quality.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;ѾѾѾѾѾ Excellent 5-fuzzies feature ratings:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;ѾѾѾѾѾ Like my for-adults Sonicare FlexCare, this brush has different power settings for children of different ages.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;ѾѾѾѾѾ This kids Sonicare also caters to children by emitting a musical tone every 30 seconds to let your child know that it is time to switch the brush to a different section of teeth.  On for-adults models of Sonicare, the brush just briefly pauses.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;ѾѾѾѾѾ Although this children&#x27;s model uses a smaller brush head compared to the adult Sonicare models, the adult-sized brush heads can actually fit onto this children&#x27;s model.  The package includes a smaller brush head for ages 4-7 and a larger brush head for 7+.  So if you are already using a Sonicare and have a supply of replacement brush heads, when your child becomes a teenager, he can continue to use the same brush fitted with the for-adults brush heads.  The larger brush head that is included with this package is very similar to the for-adults replacement brush heads.  I also have both the Sonicare FlexCare and FlexCare Plus adult toothbrushes, both of which can use model HX6013 (ProResults) brush heads, and the HX6013 brush heads also work on this kid&#x27;s version. The HX6053 (Sensitive), HX6023 (ProResults Compact), and HX6062/HX6063 (DiamondClean) brush heads also fit on both the adult FlexCare and this Kids model. They all have the same half-circle hole inside the brush head that slides onto the half-circle stem on the adult FlexCare or Kids brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;ѾѾѾѾѾ If you also use a for-adults Sonicare toothbrush, in addition to being able to share replacement brush heads between the for-adults and for-kids models, the charging base is also interchangeable.  So your adult-model Sonicare can be charged on the travel-sized charger that this model comes with, and this kids model can be charged on the charger that your Sonicare came with.  This Kids model&#x27;s charger is very compact and easy to pack for travel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;ѾѾѾѾѾ This kid toothbrush has two design features that I wished my more-expensive Sonicare FlexCare adult brush also had: (1) its handle is coated with a tacky non-slip rubbery coating with prominent knobby bumps along the handle to aid in better grip, whereas my FlexCare has a smooth plastic surface, and (2) a flattened part of the handle allows the brush to be laid down horizontally with the bristles facing upward, whereas if I lay my FlexCare horizontally, it may roll around and end up with its bristles touching the sink counter surface.  It has a two different power levels (low power for 4+ and high power for 7+ years old), and in both power levels, both the vibration of the handle and the buzzing sound is far less than than my adult FlexCare model.  At low power, I would describe the buzzing sound as \\&quot;housefly\\&quot; volume, at high level it is a \\&quot;bumblebee\\&quot;, compared to the \\&quot;large bumblebee on steroids\\&quot; buzzing and vibration of the adult FlexCare model.  Also different from my FlexCare is that the Quadpacer 30-second interval timer on this Kids model plays music to tell your child that it is time to brush another quadrant of the mouth.  All of these are great improvements, not just for child usage, but also for an electric toothbrush in general.  (If anyone from Philips reads this: I want my next adult Sonicare to have the same non-slip grip with knobby bumps, horizontal brush rest, and lower noise level too!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;ѾѾѾ Average not-good not-bad 3-fuzzies feature ratings:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;ѾѾѾ The unit is only slightly shorter in length compared to my adult FlexCare toothbrush.  Without having any of the three supplied faceplates mounted on it, it weighs the same 4.8 ounces as my adult model; once the faceplate is mounted onto the brush, its 5.0 ounce weight is actually heavier than my adult model.  On top of that, the barrel-shaped handle of the Kids model is also bigger in circumference than the adult model.  This added length, weight, and thickness of the brush handle may make it more cumbersome to use for smaller kids or those with small hands.  This \\&quot;Sonicare for Kids\\&quot; is heavier and bulkier than the adult Sonicare models and the added weight and bulk are undoubtedly due to the rubbery non-slip grip that completely wraps around the handle (which the adult models lack), but you would think that a \\&quot;Kids\\&quot; toothbrush would be smaller and lighter in weight.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;ѾѾѾ The three supplied faceplate panels are lacking in originality and pizazz in an age when kids can personalize their MP3 players, cell phones, and other personal electronics using a myriad of interchangeable faceplates or skins.  The three supplied faceplates are just boring variations of dot patterns against a black, blue, or yellow background.  The faceplate is mounted to the toothbrush by way of a very sticky adhesive backing, so I do not really think of it as being \\&quot;interchangeable\\&quot; as advertised.  Once you pry off the glued-on faceplate, to reuse it again, you would have to supply your own adhesive to reattach it to the brush.  I presume that Philips engineers assume that the child will just pick one faceplate design and never want to change it again.  For the not-inexpensive price of the brush, I would have much preferred that the faceplate panels were designed so that: (a) the faceplate panel firmly snaps onto the brush body (like how battery compartment doors often snap on) so the child can change their toothbrush&#x27;s look more frequently and easily, and (b) the three faceplates varied more in their themes (one abstract dot pattern is enough, let&#x27;s also have some floral, animal, or cartoon themes!).  There are various suppliers of after-market skins and covers for personal electronics, but I doubt that there is a high enough of a demand for personalizing electric toothbrush handles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;௫ Fuzzy Wuzzy&#x27;s Conclusion:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, this is another fine high-quality brush from Philips.  As was the case when I purchased my FlexCare brush shortly after it was introduced, I think that the price is a bit on the high side, but one could justify that it is worth the dental health benefits if it helps your child brush better and longer each time.plates mounted on it, it weighs the same 4.8 ounces as my adult model; once the faceplate is mounted onto the brush, its 5.0 ounce weight is actually heavier than my adult model.  On top of that, the barrel-shaped handle of the Kids model is also bigger in circumference than the adult model.  This added length, weight, and thickness of the brush handle may make it more cumbersome to use for smaller kids or those with small hands.  This \\&quot;Sonicare for Kids\\&quot; is heavier and bulkier than the adult Sonicare models and the added weight and bulk are undoubtedly due to the rubbery non-slip grip that completely wraps around the handle (which the adult models lack), but you would think that a \\&quot;Kids\\&quot; toothbrush would be smaller and lighter in weight.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;ѾѾѾ The three supplied faceplate panels are lacking in originality and pizazz in an age when kids can personalize their MP3 players, cell phones, and other personal electronics using a myriad of interchangeable faceplates or skins.  The three supplied faceplates are just boring variations of dot patterns against a black, blue, or yellow background.  The faceplate is mounted to the toothbrush by way of a very sticky adhesive backing, so I do not really think of it as being \\&quot;interchangeable\\&quot; as advertised.  Once you pry off the glued-on faceplate, to reuse it again, you would have to supply your own adhesive to reattach it to the brush.

            <li> I purchased the Philips Sonicare for Kids for my two boys. They were &#x27;fast&#x27; brushers and this is helping them brush the proper ammount of time. I hope to be able to purchase a Sonicare for my self in the future!</li>
            <li> I have two boys using the toothbrush for over a month now and everyone is satisfied.  I recommend getting a separate toothbrush for each child.  The boys (5 &amp; 7) sharing it and I am worried about when they switch the head, the tip is very pointed and if there is any horseplay then someone could get hurt.  So I am going to pick up a second unit to feel better about that.  The functionality is very good and the musical chimes keep them in a good pattern.    I have been using the adult version and really like that as well.</li>
            <li> We have a 5 and a 9yr old.  After a much postponed trip to a dentist for myself and found out that I need LOTS of dental work, I didn&#x27;t want the same for my kids so I decided to ramp up their proactive care and purchased this Phillips Sonicare for Kids HX6311/02 Rechargeable Toothbrush set.  When I took them to their dentist a few days later, she was thrilled that they had this already as she sold it in her office.    The BEST thing about this is that BOTH of my boys now WILLINGLY brush their teeth with no complaints whatsoever.  The set was perfect for my family because it comes with 2 different sized brush heads.  Here is what comes in the box:    **Rechargeable toothbrush with 3 different changeable &#x27;face plates&#x27; (if you look at the picture, it&#x27;s the yellow portion of the handle).  Ours came with black, navy and yellow and all had some sort of designs on them.  It has some sort of clear peel that you peel off and the faceplate sticks to the front part of the toothbrush handle.    **2 DIFFERENT sized toothbrush heads:  1 red smaller toothbrush head for children who are UNDER 7yrs old (4-6yrs old) and 1 slightly larger light blue toothbrush head for children who are 7+ yrs old.    **Toothbrush stand &amp; corded charger in one:  The toothbrush charger &#x27;holder&#x27; is in the front and the two &#x27;holders&#x27; in the back are for 2 toothbrush heads.  (This is perfect for my family as we only have 2 children but with those with more kids may want something else to store the other children&#x27;s toothbrush heads...I was thinking a UV light disinfecting chamber would be great)    It really can&#x27;t be more simple to get started. You simply plug in the charger and let the toothbrush charge for 24hrs before it&#x27;s first use.  Then you are good to go!    PROS / What we love about this:  The boys like that it&#x27;s JUST FOR KIDS!  I love that the &#x27;sonic&#x27; movement is truly different that my adult Oral0-B Professional version which they were sharing with me before they got this, our dentist said the kids version is MUCH more gentle on their teeth.   This one definitely has more of a vibrational movement and causes more &#x27;bubbles&#x27; in the mouth from our tooth powder / liquid that we use.       The boys love that the sound indicator is a happy / silly sound.  With my Oral-B Professional, I also have a sound indicator to tell me when to move to a different quadrant but it&#x27;s a generic beep and the boys didn&#x27;t always pay attention to it.  With this kid friendly version, it&#x27;s a series of a happy 1-2 second beep and the &#x27;beeps&#x27; that tell them they are finished with brushing is a bit longer like a beeping song (it&#x27;s short don&#x27;t worry, it&#x27;s not annoying) are totally distinctive and different so they know what the differences are and it automatically turns off after the &#x27;finished brushing beep.      CONS:  None that are real deal breakers but...  * Only time will tell but I want to make sure that the faceplate doesn&#x27;t come loose over time since it&#x27;s used in a wet environment. I hope that nothing icky grows under it.  SO FAR, it seems to be sealed tightly but I&#x27;ll keep checking.    *I wish the button that indicates whether it is a small child or older child brushing (this determines the difference in how long each child brushes...ie: shorter for younger child and longer for older child - BOTH start out a bit shorter and then over time, add time eventually leading up to the recommended 2 minute brushing session) is EASIER to push.  My younger 5 yr old has a hard time pushing his &#x27;side&#x27; of the button.    *I wish that the toothbrush handle part was a bit slimmer in diameter. Both of my kids CAN hold it just fine but it seems that if it was meant for smaller hands, the device would be smaller in size for little hands.    This IS worth getting and both Mom and kids are happy to have it!

            <li> Although the learning and practice continues, now i know my kids are getting their teeth as clean as possible.</li>
            <li> Iits a nice size and easy for kids to operate..  It does a good job of flushing their teeth and I don&#x27;t think they mind using it so is easier to get them to brush their teeth</li>
            <li> Bought this for my autistic daughter.  It has a built in timer, so she knows how long to brush.  Also, it is very hard to get her to floss, so the sonciare seems to help with reducing the plaque build up she used to get with a regular toothbrush.</li>
            <li> My daughter loves brushing her teeth with her new Sonicare.  Because my husband and I have the adult ones, she feels like an adult when brushing her teeth and takes her brushing seriously.  The little beep reminders are pleasant to hear.  I would recommend this to anyone with children.  The brush head comes in 2 sizes, one for older and younger children.  My daughter is 4 and she uses the smaller one and is perfect.</li>
            <li> The toothbrush works just like the adult version so if you&#x27;ve used the regular Sonicare then this is the same but in brighter colours.  It comes with two brush heads, one for under 7yrs and one for over 7yrs.  This suited me fine because I had a 5 and 7yr old.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The problem is when the brush heads wore out, which took about 6 months.  The brush heads are sold as two packs for 5yrs old or 7+.  When I bought the toothbrush last year it was $50 on Amazon, it is now $65.  The brush head which only comes in a two pack is $20 each.  That means I have to spend $40 to replace 2 brush heads for my two kids.  $10 a brush head is pretty steep.  With so many vibrating kids toothbrushes on the market for under $10, I question who would pay this much?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So we&#x27;ve bought brand new $7.80 vibrating kids toothbrushes, new set of stickers for the kids to decorate and they are over the moon.  Unless Sonicare drops the price of their replacement brush heads it will go to the land fill.</li>
            <li> I got these as Christmas gifts for my grandchildren, ages 1-9. They, and their parents love them. Sonicare is an excellent product.</li>
            <li> It helps me 7 years old child to brush her teeth more efficiency and the 2 minutes time inerval work really well.</li>
            <li> They love it and it does a great job.  Think it makes them feel more grown up since they have a toothbrush like mom and dad now.  Hopefully they&#x27;ll spend a few more minutes brushing than in the past since this has a built in timer.</li>
            <li> Changed the way my kids brushed their teeth.  2 minutes twice a day.  They (and me) would never go back to a regular brush.  Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> Both my 3 year old and my 5 year old love the brush. They totally love the sounds and the vibration is so gentle. I I hope it will last for a long time!</li>
            <li> my grandson brushes the right way now....the brush has a chime timer while you brush to tell you when to go to the next section of your mouth. my grandson loves it and its fun to brush now.</li>
            <li> I got his as a gift for my grandkids, especially the 7 yr old boy who Hates to brush.&lt;br /&gt;He likes it a lot better than the &amp;#34;cute&amp;#34; battery brushes and his parents tell me it is easier to get him to brush longer.&lt;br /&gt;He thinks it looks like an &#x27;alien&#x27; and has named it something, too.</li>
            <li> My 7 yr old loved that she could choose the decorative face plate. She lves brushing her teeth, and never needs a reminder from us to do so.</li>
            <li> The gift came at a great time. My grandson needed this toothbrush and likes using it.  The age appropriate brushes are a plus.</li>
            <li> This product is great! It cleans my kids&#x27; teeth with no effort gently. I bought 2 cheap electric teeth brush and they wore out. I needed the replacements and I saw this product with coupon($4 off). It came with a set of brushes, one for 7years and up, one for 4 years old, so it was a perfect set for my 8yo and 5yo. I am so glad that I made a right choice this time.</li>
            <li> We have went through 4 of these toothbrushes now.  Each one stops working right around the 1 year mark.  There is a problem with the way the head attaches to the brush itself. This part breaks and the whole thing is no longer usable. It seems others have had this problem and most of the positive reviews are written by people who haven&#x27;t had the brushes for a year.  I love the way Sonicare brushes clean and I will buy my children the adult version now.</li>
            <li> And it was a hit.  Works great and helps her want to brush her teeth....tells when she has brushed long enough and bedtime seemed to be fun.</li>
            <li> So far no objection from my ultra sensitive autistic boy who could not tolerate the adult version of Philips sonic toothbrush.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have to worry about the kids brushing because they are do excited to use it. Easy to use... recommended 100%</li>
            <li> My 4.5 year old son uses this by himself and loves it.  He was afraid of it at first, but after a few days he was excited about it.  Loves being able to brush his teeth on his own.  We had asked his dentist who said this was a great choice.</li>
            <li> Having a Sonicare my self and knowing how awesomely clean my teeth feel afterward, I purchased one for my kids to help instill healthy oral habits.  The brush comes with a starter brush head and a few different decorative face plates to change the outer design of the brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The brush has two different speeds so for younger kids you may want a lower speed until they get used to the way the brush feels in their mouth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I operate the brush in the kids mouths and while this brush worked it did a nice job and in a small mouth where I could let the brush do the brush strokes in the harder to reach places.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Only downfall:  After using it for about 9 months, the brush started vibrating a little inconsistent and not how it was typically operating, as if it was making the vibrating noise but not moving the brush in the same brush stroke motion.  I called Philips and gave them appropriate information and they sent us a replacement because it was with in the 2 year warranty period.  The new replacement is working, but if it fails again they only warranty for 2 years total including the time period using the original brush.  So I am hoping to get as much use as possible out of this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On another note, I have the adult version and my brush stopped charging after 6 months of use and they sent me a replacement as well, but they also told me that the new brush is warranted until year 2, minus the 6 months for the original brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In conclusion- good product while it works, just be aware that it does not seemed designed to last forever or for an extended period of time.  If you go into your purchase knowing that you have at least those 2 years of product use and you can justify it, GO FOR IT!!  Just keep your original receipt and be prepared to give the code on the bottom of your brush for a replacement, just do it before year 2.</li>
            <li> I love Sonicare.  Everyone in my family now owns one.  I&#x27;ve had a kids sonicare for two years now for my daughter.  It does a great job of cleaning her teeth.  I love the built in timer.  It does a great job of keeping a charge, we probably only recharge once every two months.  She hasn&#x27;t had any cavities.  The heads are easy to change.  I have nothing to complain about with this toothbrush.  I bought one a month ago for my 4 year old and it&#x27;s been great.  It was a battle to get him to brush good enough each night, but with his new toothbrush he does a great job of brushing the whole time and getting all of his teeth clean.  If you have a child you won&#x27;t regret buying this toothbrush.  Oh, it comes with three different covers so your kids can each pick one out so they won&#x27;t confuse brushes.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d like to love this product but I can&#x27;t. My Child is more than 2,5 years old and she doesn&#x27;t like it. I think because the vibration is strong however I always choose the lowest level. I have a bad feeling too when I hold it in my hand. I thought if it would work for my Child I would use to it. But we have to fight to wash teeth almost every night. So I think we have to stop to use it. Maybe try again one year later.&lt;br /&gt;Anyway the smallest brush head is perfect size and it has a good shape too. Before you order it think about little bit about vibration. If you don&#x27;t like it or you think your child won&#x27;t love it this toothbrush not for you.&lt;br /&gt;There are lots of satisfied customer so I think the children are just different. It seems most of them are okay with the vibration some of them aren&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> My husband and I both use Sonicare for our own toothbrushes, and have for years, and thought we&#x27;d give this a try for our son. He likes that it&#x27;s his \\&quot;own\\&quot; brush, just like mommy and daddy&#x27;s, and appreciates the \\&quot;fun\\&quot; elements--interchangeable front plates, musical notes for instructional brushing--even if he doesn&#x27;t fully use/understand the latter at this point.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My complaint about the former (front plate) is that they&#x27;re not really that useful. They&#x27;re just stick on things, so they&#x27;ll eventually come off--my son removed his within two days--and they can&#x27;t be changed on a whim (one-time use only), which any parent knows kids have--frequently. (Making a choice and sticking to it is not any preschooler&#x27;s strong point.) Perhaps a calculated move on Sonicare&#x27;s part to sell more front plate replacements?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like the kid-sized brush, which fits his little mouth well, and the adjustable power/speed, though I will say that, for younger kids, it&#x27;s way too easy for them to change the setting/restart, even if you&#x27;re supervising their brushing as instructed. And, for the very young, even the low power mode can be off-putting in their mouths. (Sonicare recommends this brush for ages 4+ and my son isn&#x27;t quite there yet.) The brush handle is a bit thick for little hands (seems the same size as adult models), but the non-slip rubber grip that covers the entire thing is appreciated.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, this brush seems to have the quality of the regular Sonicare line, with a few noteworthy kid-friendly features. It also has the same drawbacks as all Sonicare products, namely it&#x27;s pricey (though not as $$$ as the adult models), especially when you&#x27;re talking about something for a youngster. (And when you can buy disposable kids&#x27; electrics for around $5 at any grocery store.) On the other hand, if it helps kids brush better (and prevents cavities), especially in those too young to floss, it might be worth it.</li>
            <li> I have been using Philips Sonicare toothbrushes for years and years.  I&#x27;ve owned several as I&#x27;ve worn them out over the years and as they have improved the design.  I was excited to see that they have a model specifically for kids and wondered what the differences might be.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The toothbrush is almost the same as the Sonicare I currently own for myself.  The similarities are:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1.) Different power levels for different users (in the case of the kids&#x27; brush one setting for ages 4-7 and one for ages 7-10.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2.) Quadrapace timer- the children&#x27;s version has a musical tone every 30 seconds to let your child know to move to the next quadrant of her mouth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3.) Ramped up power and time- the feeling of a Sonicare is a little off-putting to some people at first as it can cause a kind of tingling in the mouth from the rapid vibrations.  The power (in both modes) and the time (in the low power mode) are ramped up over the first several uses to allow people to get used to it. It starts off with lower power and for little kids, a shorter overall brushing time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4.) Different size heads- the head is actually interchangeable with the regular Sonicare brush that I have.  The shape at the base is just slightly different.  I was worried about finding heads for the kids&#x27; brush.  But, if I can&#x27;t, I&#x27;ll just buy a regular head for her when this one wears out.  The heads come in two sizes.  But, I found the larger one is pretty much exactly like my normal Sonicare head. The bristles seem to be about the same stiffness and the shape of the bristles and the head is just about the same.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The differences are:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1.) Cute kids colors and interchangeable face plate.  Read the directions.  The face plate has a protective back that should be removed so it doesn&#x27;t keep falling off.  It&#x27;ll come with one face plate on it. But, you can change it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2.) Charger is a two piece device- I don&#x27;t like this.  My Sonicare came with a travel charge in addition to the regular charger. This kids version seems to have used a travel charger (which doesn&#x27;t have a place to store the extra heads) and they just made a piece to fit over it.  The problem is it doesn&#x27;t snap together. So, it&#x27;s just kind of tacky and unstable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3.) Instead of just pausing between quadrants, the kids version of the brush actually plays a musical tone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My 9 year old squealed with glee when she saw the toothbrush.  She couldn&#x27;t wait to use it.  She even asked if she could brush three times a day instead of two.  I worked with her the first couple of times she used it, as you will have to with your kids.  The timer is great because we have bought timers for she and her older sister before to get them to brush for two minutes with their manual brushes.  But, they don&#x27;t use the timer consistently and two minutes is a long time for a child (especially if they&#x27;re thinking about doing something else).  The other thing you&#x27;ll have to work with your child on is not using this like a regular toothbrush.  Children tend to brush too hard anyway and we have been working with both our children about not scrubbing their teeth.  With the Sonicare, you just place the brush against the teeth and move it from section to section.  It took a while for her to get this concept as she kept wanting to use a back and forth motion.  She laughed saying the brush \\&quot;tickled\\&quot;.  But, the sensation was not uncomfortable for her.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I give the brush a very good rating.  There are only a couple of things I don&#x27;t like about it. The charger could be better constructed.  In addition to being two parts, the spare head doesn&#x27;t fit on the post very well and tends to pop off.  Another thing that could concern me with a younger child is the way you change the power setting from the lower level (for 4-7) to the higher level is a simple button that is easily accessible to children.  Curious children may push the button and end up brushingtheir teeth with either too much power or too little power.  I honestly don&#x27;t find this brush to be significantly different than the Sonicare I already own, which is a good thing.  This is not a water-down version of a Sonicare.  I was wondering what features it might be missing.  It&#x27;s got all of their advanced features in terms of the guts of the brush (I have the one with the Ultraviolet cleaner).  The novelty of it and the built-in timer will get kids excited about brushing and make sure they brush thoroughly.  I highly recommend it.is brush to be significantly different than the Sonicare I already own, which is a good thing.  This is not a water-down version of a Sonicare.

            <li> Couldn&#x27;t convince my 8  year old grand daughters to brush 2 minutes with out this brush.  It&#x27;s&lt;br /&gt;colorful so they like it and it plays music when they move to another area so all&lt;br /&gt;teeth get some attention.</li>
            <li> This is an awesome toothbrush for kids.  Big problem is the adorable adhesive faceplates eventually break down and need replacing.  New faceplates used to come with the replacement heads as they need to be replaced just as often.  Now, they are not available anywhere--Amazon, Target, Walmart, etc...  So, I called Philips, and they couldn&#x27;t help me either.  So, just remember that the toothbrush will look beat up with old adhesive on faceplate once the sticker comes off.  If it is worth it, then buy it anyway.  Sonicare is quite awesome in cleaning ability, so I can&#x27;t fault them there, but the kids are very disappointed about the fact that their toothbrushes look ugly now. :-(</li>
            <li> Works good and kids use it.</li>
            <li> My daughter is learning how to brush her teeth &amp;#34;on her own&amp;#34; right now and this is really helping!  It has a great building signal which we have not gotten up to the two minute mark on it!  It comes with several different faceplates and I let her pick her own one and now she just loves to brush her teeth!  I love that it is rechargeable and it has made our twice a day routine more fun and less of a hassle.  I am so happy with this purchase and plan on getting an adult version for myself!</li>
            <li> Bought this for my 3-year-old. Does a great job cleaning and she tolerates the 2 minutes. Cool colors and you can change the front design, which she likes.</li>
            <li> Great brush! It comes with 2 heads, one geared towards 4 year olds and one for older age 7. It has 2 speeds which is perfect for the younger ones. It cleans well and I feel that it works so much better than the $5 kid brushes you can buy at the store.</li>
            <li> Our kids (2 and 4 year old) love brushing their teeth with it and it has an awesome built in function that teaches them to brush their teeth longer without them even noticing it.</li>
            <li> My kids loved decorating their own toothbrushes (they come with 3 different colored fronts to peel and stick) and toothbrushing is fun with the sounds that let them know how long to brush for.  I would recommend to anyone who has a kid who doesn&#x27;t love to brush their teeth!</li>
            <li> Youngest granddaughter is enjoying the use of this new toothbrush!  Will help her keep her teeth clean with no cavities.</li>
            <li> My dad got this for my seven-year old son.  It&#x27;s cool and cute, and cleans well (I think). Two gripes: The head seems a bit too big to get easily onto the upper and lower side gums.  My son makes a big smile and we get in there, but I feel like we have to sort of jam it in there.  The really bothersome part is that if the toothbrush is still on when you remove it from the mouth, it splats all over creation.  I guess that&#x27;s a testament to its power but it is a pain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Having said all this, a power toothbrush IS way better for a kid than manual brushing in the long run, I think.  And it&#x27;s a good brand.</li>
            <li> product work great.  great for kids because it chimes  when it&#x27;s time to move to the next section.  my child got used to the intensity pretty quickly.  look cute.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very good at keeping your teeth white,but it takes time to get used to.</li>
            <li> This is a great tooth brush.  My son&#x27;s dentist recommended we buy it and I&#x27;m so glad we did.  His teeth and gums are much healthier than when using a manual toothbrush.  Also brushing  his teeth is no longer a tearful chore but rather just a twice daily activity that he cheerfully does.</li>
            <li> Great Toothbrush! We started using a manual toothbrush on our 2 son but never knew if we were cleaning well enough. We have been using this for over a year now and it has been great! I have an adult version for myself and I know that I get a better clean when I use so I am confident he is too. Battery lasts several days and it has sustained many drops to the floor. I just wish the brush heads were cheaper!</li>
            <li> Easy for kids to use and it works well.&lt;br /&gt;Starting to have problems with the vibration motor not starting after only a year.&lt;br /&gt;Also, the replacement brushes are very expensive.</li>
            <li> This is an excellent product, I feel so good that my son has a great tooth brush similar to ours. It allows the child to brush his teeth with little effort.</li>
            <li> My daughter loves the toothbrush. It cleans her teeth very well, doc is happy with them too. It&#x27;s a fun way to brush, and easy to get her to brush.</li>
            <li> The toothbursh works grea, My Daughter has been using it for about 6 months now and loves it. I no longer have t worry about her brushing to quickly and it does a great job well worth the purchase</li>
            <li> Well designed, works perfectly and the acoustic signals guide the children very well when brushing the teeth. My 5 and 7 yr old love their new toothbrushes.</li>
            <li> My five year old son loved this! I originally had a hard time getting him to want to brush his teeth but after using this he loves it! A little pricey but worth it!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been a dental hygienist  for 10 years and I am constantly trying products not only for my benefit, but for my patient&#x27;s as well.  I bought this sonicare for my 4 year old and he does a pretty good job with it.  he has a sensitive mouth,  so sometimes the vibrations are too ticklish for him, however, it does come with 2 different sized heads and the handle has 2 settings allowing for a lesser sonic pulsation.  In my professional opinion, if you&#x27;re looking to buy an electric toothbrush, Sonicare should be at the top of your list.  I have never been disappointed with the results of using their products...they are not junk!  Well worth the money...even on a ticklish 4 year old.</li>
            <li> My dentist said it was ok to use on my 2 and 3 year olds. Does a great job!</li>
            <li> We bought these for the grandchildren to use at our house, and they love them!  Philips Sonicare products are great!</li>
            <li> PROs: I bought two of these for my children since regular toothbrushes always seem to miss food and sometimes hurt their gums since they are still waiting for baby teeth to be replaced.  This takes care of both of those problems.  The timer and little chimes it plays are great and my children no longer complain about brushing their teeth. In fact, they can&#x27;t wait to brush their teeth now.  Thanks Philips!  Well worth the money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONs: The face plates don&#x27;t clip on.  They stay on via an adhesive strip so if my children want to swap one color for another I have to peel the old one off with no apparent way to get it back on if they want to go back to that color.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my 6 year old and his 3 year old brother. They both loved it once they got used to the speed of the head and the fact that it tickled their upper teeth too much!</li>
            <li> I love Sonicare for adults.  My husband and I been using it religiously so we decided to also get it for our 4.5 yr old son.  The dentist told me that most kids under the age of 8 find Sonicare too intense.  After reading this product&#x27;s description and reviews from parents with younger kids, I decided to buy it anyway.  I thought that the lower setting (it has two) would work for my son.  Well, it didn&#x27;t.  Although he loved the concept, he felt it was too intense and wouldn&#x27;t let me use it.  I would have returned it but my son destroyed the packaging (he was so excited to open it and use it).</li>
            <li> My kids get board quickly with brushing their teeth, so I love that their sonicare brushes keep them brushing for the 2 full minutes with the auto-timer.  They say to replace them more frequently, but I mainly remember to replace them each time we go for their 6 month cleanings, which have been great check ups since they are using these brushes!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My kids came down with strep throat shortly after I replaced them, and I really didn&#x27;t want to throw the new brushes away.  I held the brush part in boiling water for 5 minutes to sanitize them and the brushes held up with no problem.</li>
            <li> but seem to be same quality as brush, so I expect satisfaction. It is, however, ridiculous to require &amp;#34;word count&amp;#34; on critique :(((</li>
            <li> Well..what can anyone say about Phillips products..!!??  They are ALL such great products. I purchased this as a stocking-stuffer for my seven year old daughter. I think out of all of the gifts she recieved, she gets more enjoyment out of this one thing ! Using it daily now, she no longer has to be continually told to brush her teeth. She  can&#x27;t wait to use it and finds it a fun chore these days. The colorful design along with the perfect ergonomics and of course the musical changing pacer / timer makes it a great addition to the bathroom for the children.</li>
            <li> My 5 year old could use this properly right away with very little direction.  My 3 year old could not yet.  Love the music notification to change areas and to notify completion.</li>
            <li> My girls&#x27; dental health has improved tremendously since we went electric.  An added benefit is that my youngest daughter actually asks to brush her teeth.  She loves it!  Will definitely not go back to standard manual brushes.</li>
            <li> At the pediatric dentist&#x27;s suggestion, we started my toddler on this one when she was about 3 1/2. The structure of her teeth makes them vulnerable to cavities. The timer and tunes makes it easy to pace brushing time on all surfaces and entertaining for her too. I brush her first, then she wants to jump in and try. I&#x27;ve used the adult Sonicare for 3 years and I&#x27;ve had the best check-ups of my life with it. The hygienist has very little to do, when my cleanings used to take 40 mins every 6 mos. I&#x27;m hoping getting my child started right will make dental care simpler and more effective for her--so far so good!</li>
            <li> Quality construction and works great. Really helpful in teaching my daughter good practices for brushing her teeth.  The beeps ensure she spends enough time on each section.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have owned an adult sonicare for years and haven&#x27;t had a cavity since I started, so I am really hoping to pass this on to my kids!</li>
            <li> Using the &amp;#34;regular&amp;#34; toothbrush was not an enjoyable experience for me or my son. He always wanted &amp;#34;mommy&amp;#34; to brush his teeth. This toothbrush really encourages the kids to brush their own teeth. My son now is so excited to brush his teeth - after meals, at night, in the morning, in the afternoon..he simply loves this toothbrush.&lt;br /&gt;The timer on here lets him know when it is time to move to the next section. I showed him once and after that he had it!</li>
            <li> My daughter (at 10 months) would only chew on a regular toothbrush. However with this brush she actually lets me brush her teeth. Plays cute little music chime to let you know when to switch areas and when you are done. So glad I got this toothbrush!</li>
            <li> Love this toothbrush.  Has music playing in segments to remind your kiddo to move the brush around the whole mouth. :)  Likely will purchase another when this one dies.</li>
            <li> We had our daughters share the first Sonicare, just bought an additional head.  They hold up real well and help the girls get their teeth very clean.</li>
            <li> Great! My kids love it, use it regularlly.  We&#x27;ve had this for a while now and it has held up very well!</li>
            <li> Decent but brush heads are way too expensive.</li>
            <li> My daughter loves the toothbrush and I love the timer in it.  She also loves the ability to change the look.</li>
            <li> this toothbrush has made a difference in brushing habits and teeth are cleaner, better check-up- I can see a difference !!!!!!</li>
            <li> dentist recommended for kids. I was skeptical but I use electric for myself as well. kids are 3 and 6. Took a few weeks but both are loving it. super easy compared to brushing and much more gentle. it really does tickle them (I tried it on myself).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I started on low speed but my 6 year old can now handle the high speed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My advice is to focus on the molars in kids mainly as those last until 10 years old before falling out, whereas the front ones fall out early so even a small cavity isn&#x27;t that big of a deal. Brushing everywhere though strengthens the gums which is healthy and important too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Last few visits over the past 2 years problem free. Thank you sonicare for saving on my dental bills.</li>
            <li> My daughter unfortunatley inherited my genes in getting black stain on her teeth.  Apparently some people are more prone to it than others.  I have used the Sonicare toothbrush for years which keeps this problem at bay for myself.  My daughter just turned 4 years old so we got this for  her once we noticed she was getting the same staining I used to.  After about a month, there is at least a 80% reduction in the stain and more importantly no new ones.  Considering she is using the toddler toothpaste that has no abrasion at all that is great. (I bought some dentist scraping tools on Amazon to remove the remaining stains) I loved that at the beginning, it started out slow and worked up to the 2 minute brushing.  I think it takes 2 weeks to get there and it&#x27;s great because it&#x27;s a long time to start out with at first.  She likes the little music noise it makes between telling you to brush the next quadrant.  She also liked picking which decorating plate to put on the front of the toothbrush.  You get three choices.  The battery hold up really well. I would recommend it to anyone who has staining issues in their kids teeth and even if they don&#x27;t because this toothbrush does so much better than the standard ones you buy at the store.  It really does.</li>
            <li> My daughter Emily used to make every excuse about brushing her teeth. I.E. \\&quot;I gotta potty\\&quot; lol \\&quot;, \\&quot;I wanna take a nap...PLEEEAASSEE!\\&quot; etc. She would do and say anything to get out of brushing even put herself on time out lmao. But now everytime she eats she says \\&quot; Mommy my teeth are dirty I need to brush\\&quot;. Or when it&#x27;s bedtime and I tell my girls to brush their teeth Emily shouts \\&quot;YAAAAAYY I get to brush my teeth now!\\&quot;. So not only does this tooth brush clean just as good as the one for adults but it changes a childs perception of personal hygiene. It makes it FUN! Love this product I will be buying one for my son when he gets bigger.</li>
            <li> This is a great rechargeable electric toothbrush for kids. My kids love the fact that it comes with multiple heads and multiple colors.</li>
            <li> Our 6 year old granddaughter loves her new Philips Sonicare would highly recommend!  She is brushing on her own several times per day.  Easy rechargeable holder.</li>
            <li> An easy way to get kids to brush their teeth while knowing that it their teeth will be clean too!!! Love it!!!</li>
            <li> I like the toothbrush.  The timer thing is wonky.  We wish we could set it to the time WE want, not it&#x27;s pre-programmed &amp;#34;build up time&amp;#34; business they have going on, but other than that it&#x27;s a five start.  Works well, holds charge well.  We&#x27;ve had it for months now and it&#x27;s been great.  Oh, the colors are awful and the added &amp;#34;art&amp;#34; that you can put on is horrendous so keep in mind, it&#x27;s for cleaning teeth and not for art work.</li>
            <li> Kids seem to like it, definitely has their teeth cleaner.  They like the face plates they can put on.  Bought one for our two children as it comes with two different heads - seems to work well.  I would but this for an adult as well, same size heads fit this kids model, it is less expensive, and has a more robust handle.  Good toothbrush for a guy as well as kids - more rugged.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my son who is 7, he loves it. It makes brushing his teeth fun, the two minutes goes by fast.</li>
            <li> Bought these for the kids after getting tired of all the cheap ones lasting a month or two before breaking. These are great with noises to tell the kids when to move to a different part of their mouth, and it keeps them brushing for 2 minutes. You get what you pay for.</li>
            <li> We have the adult versions and the 2 kids successfully share one of these.  Hopefully it gets them off to a good start.  The tones help them brush for the right amount of time.</li>
            <li> UPDATE 09/07/11: Guess what. Contacted customer service. Was promised a replacement. It did not arrive. Contacted them again and they are telling me it was already replaced (it wasn&#x27;t) and it&#x27;s out of warranty (it is still is, bought in March 2010). Not only only their products suck, but so does customer service.     Failed in about a year. First switch would often not engage, then the typical internal shafts breakage occurred. No Philips product we have ever bought lasted longer than 2-3 years and that includes a DVD player, an electric kettle, a couple Sonicare toothbrushes, Skype VOIP phone. Stay away, this brand needs to fix their quality problems or just die.</li>
            <li> We bought this toothbrush for our six year old son.   The dentist had commented that he wasn&#x27;t doing a stellar job brushing.   This toothbrush not only brushes better, but it also has a timer that helps him know how long to brush.   We have noticed a huge improvement since we bought him this toothbrush.</li>
            <li> I bought this because I loved my Sonicare toothbrush so much.  My son loves it and is becoming such a diligent little tooth brusher.  The musical timer is great and has him running for his toothbrush when we announce that it is time to brush his teeth.  Great purchase!!</li>
            <li> This is fabulous! Comes with the 2 different size heads in different colors perfect for my 6 &amp; 8 year olds. We just switch the heads.  The kids love to brush now!</li>
            <li> Best Best Best. My kids teeth are definitely in better shape. 3 &amp; 4 year old can use their own tooth brush, although I do make sure we get all sugarbugs out.    Battery will last forever before I need to re charge it.</li>
            <li> Great brushes but some problems with handles that stop working; spinning. Contact Philips directly for replacements (under warranty). I purchased two for my children and one stopped working within a couple months,  Customer service was awesome at Philips and replacement for free, Great toothbrushes otherwise and Child&#x27;s dentist highly recommends these over other brands,  Web: [...] or  Phone: 1-888-PHILIPS (744-5477)</li>
            <li> great for learning to brush kids. It help your child clean better! love it</li>
            <li> This toothbrush is the best!  My son went from barely dragging his old toothbrush across his teeth for 30 seconds, to brushing for a full 2 mins.  The timer is really great, it slowly build on the time of each previous brushing, it chimes when it&#x27;s time to move from the upper outside to the inner outside, etc. finishing with a grand finale of music when they are all done.</li>
            <li> My kids have had terrible teeth (75% parent&#x27;s fault) since their first checkups. Chalk it up to too many fruit snacks, no flossing, not realizing Little Bear toothpaste had no flouride when toddlers and no city flouridated water.  We screwed up BIG TIME!  So our kids HATE the dentist and are literally frightened to walk in the door.  Once we realized how bad it was, mom and dad took over the brushing routine.  As kids got older they wanted to brush themselves but weren&#x27;t very good at it. Their dentist gives out grades for brushing and they were always getting C&#x27;s.  I finally decided to buy a forty dollar sonic toothbrush - which when you think about it is crazy in a way.  HOWEVER...  the kids love it - they hate brushing until the end of the music but that just shows how they normally would be stopping too soon.  Best of all - A+ grades for brushing now and mom and dad have not had to pay for a cavity fill or root canal in almost a year now!  Our trips to the dentist were costing us &gt; $150 each visit because of the work needed outside of insurance.  This forty dollar toothbrush was an investment in dropping those visits to a thirty dollar co-pay.  PROS: Fun design for kids, Fun music and it conditions them to brush longer, great brushing grades at the dentist now!  CON: Underneath where the brush attaches to the handle can get mucky and even moldy if mom and dad aren&#x27;t checking it and keeping it clean.  I haven&#x27;t had to use customer service so I can&#x27;t comment on those complaints.</li>
            <li> Great product. My kids haven&#x27;t had cavities yet and they&#x27;re 2/4 graders. Trust me, they eat their fair share of candy, but I attribute a big portion of that to this toothbrush. they share one toothbrush but have different heads. Much cheaper that way.</li>
            <li> Best toothbrush for kids ever &amp; best price here on Amazon!!  My kids dentist recommended it &amp; I back him up 100%!</li>
            <li> It brushes fine. However the timer sound can not be turned off and is extremely annoying.&lt;br /&gt;It is supposed to  go off after each 1/4 of their mouth. With my 10 yr old granddaughter it went off too fast,so&lt;br /&gt;it chimed 7 or 8 times making her not want to use it.</li>
            <li> Way better than any other toothbrush. Chimes when one must move the brush to different quadrant. Dentist always says&amp;#34; there is nothing to clean here!&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> Great tool for kids to learn the proper brushing time. We bought these for both kids.</li>
            <li> I am convinced that using Sonicare has saved me hundreds of dollars in dental bills over the years.  So I was sure that I needed my son to be using one as well...and compared to his friends it seems to be well worth the money.  It ensures he brushes long enough, and gets to places a regular brush just doesn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> My 6 year old grandson wanted an electric toothbrush like his dad&#x27;s. He is thrilled with this toothbrush and uses it every day.</li>
            <li> I love Sonicare products and have been using them for many years.  This particular product is just bad.  The colored design on front is put on with a sticker that can peel off.  Also, on my kids brush, the rubber around the stem that goes into the brush head, did not hold up.  It cracked and started pulling away from the stem.  This allowed moisture to get in that rubber seal and start to grow things.  I have spoken to other parents that had the same problem.  After that I could no longer allow my child to use the brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, I of course called Sonicare.  They were extremely unhelpful and refused to replace the brush.  Now, this is not the customer service that I would expect from this company.  Particularly since I have bought so many of their products over the years.  I have also spoken with many dental professionals that were very dismayed by the companies response.  I even convinced our dentist to stop carrying the product.  Another parent sitting next to me when we were discussing this actually had the same exact issue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not sure what is going on Sonicare.  Bad Bad product and the customer support....well just completely unacceptable.  When I spend a lot of hard earned money on quality products, exceptional customer support is a requirement.  Makes you hesitant to buy the more expensive adult products.  Buyer Beware.</li>
            <li> We placed the order and within 2 days we had the product in hand. We couldn&#x27;t find these in any of our local stores and our child loves it, so we had to get another one.</li>
            <li> Loved it, child friendly! Excellent toothbrush!</li>
            <li> This toothbrush has been helpful in getting my 4 year old, who doesn&#x27;t like to brush, to actually get it done.  The encouraging tones and timed brushing is great.  Would definitely buy again.</li>
            <li> Ordered it for my son a few month back and he likes it (he&#x27;s turning 5). It comes with two decorative face plates and two brush heads (one smaller softer head and a bigger one). I can&#x27;t scientifically measure how much improvement it has over regular brush, but feels that it more effective as the vibration helps a better cleaning job, and timer helps kids to stay on brushing until the times up, instead of cutting it way short.&lt;br /&gt;The reason it didn&#x27;t get 5 stars is because I&#x27;m not suer how long it will last. I had Sonicare HealthyWhite toothbrush, which is very similar in construction and works the same way, broke just after a year, water somehow leaked into the brush and killed it. I hope this one last longer.</li>
            <li> Best kids toothbrush. Great timer feature and good choice in head sizes for smaller/bigger kids. It still takes parents &amp; dental professionals to teach kids how to brush properly, but at least it helps to ensure a better clean. Sidenote: I love that the charger is compatible with other sonicare toothbrushes.</li>
            <li> We had one already and had a need for another. Ordered 2 so we have 2 new units. Children seem to use them well without any issues, both like to brush their teeth. I notice these will mold and mildew in 2 places. One is around the stem where you attach the brush head. To prevent this, remove the brush head after each use, rinse the main unit and inside the brush head and let them both sit apart till they dry. The other place is at the base of the main unit. To prevent this, after use, rinse off the unit then set it down on a flat surface parallel to the surface. This will allow it to dry out. This brush is designed to hold an adequate charge for about a week. I let everything dry out and ever couple days when the unit hasn&#x27;t been used for a few hours i put it back on the charger and let it charge several hours. Otherwise these are great and my dentist had less work to do on my teeth after I had used the adult model for several months.</li>
            <li> This was recommended by my son&#x27;s pediatric dentist. She said it&#x27;s the only electric toothbrush for kids that actually cleans without requiring \\&quot;brushing\\&quot; movements - it works same as adult electric toothbrushes. Most of the other ones you buy with batteries in them still require manual brushing. My son loves this brush because it \\&quot;sings\\&quot; and tells him when he&#x27;s halfway there, and then near the end and then at the end. The brush actually slowly increases brush time so your child can get used to brushing eventually 2 mins.. so it was a great way for my son to get into it - initially we were done really fast - but that got him used to the brush. His teeth look great, he&#x27;s happy, so I&#x27;m happy!</li>
            <li> I bought this for my son and he loves it.I do as well and the sound reminders are Great!!!!!The battery life seems to be lasting a long time. Shipping was on time actually a day or two early.</li>
            <li> I have bought lots of philips toothbrushes for my family and this one is not a disappointment.  My grandson still has and uses it!</li>
            <li> Great!  My daughter loves it and wants to brush her teeth all the time. I have checked her mouth after she brushes and it does a great job.</li>
            <li> With our son&#x27;s dentist recommendation we purchased this toothbrush. I&#x27;m a Sonicare user so I knew this would be a great purchase for our son. It works well and cleans his teeth a lot better than his other toothbrush...a lot easier to clean with too. Also, it&#x27;s nice having the interval timer so we know when to switch to the next spot to clean. The only thing I don&#x27;t like is that it did not come with a travel case like the adult versions do.</li>
            <li> These are great toothbrushes. I have found out that when they don&#x27;t want to work like they used to , don&#x27;t run right out &amp; buy a new one until you try this. We, my wife &amp; myself have one each of the Sonicare brushes.&lt;br /&gt;If it isn&#x27;t running like it used to try removing it from the charger &amp; let it sit for , say a week. While your watching TV or just sitting keep it with you &amp; press the button to make it run and when it stops push the button again &amp; again. This is to remove the charge memory from the unit. You&#x27;ll notice that the run time shortens in duration &amp; when it gets down to running for only a few seconds put it back into the charger &amp; let it charge for a day &amp; it&#x27;ll come back to life.&lt;br /&gt;I almost threw ours out but decided to discharge it as above &amp; they again work like new.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product because I was tired of purchasing battery operated toothbrushes (Spinbrush Kids - My Way Electric Toothbrush) that weren&#x27;t making the 90 day mark. This toothbrush is great fun for my daughter.  It matches mine and plays music to prompt her to continue brushing for the recommended time. Great investment.</li>
            <li> My son loves the kid version. He says it is gentler than the adult version we have. We think Sonicare toothbrushes in general clean teeth better than other electric toothbrushes on the market.</li>
            <li> Stopped working after just one month. Worthless.</li>
            <li> Good quality for the price and should last him years. NEVER buy the spin brush kinds with the heads going back and forth in two directions, as they have been proven to chip, break and crack teeth.</li>
            <li> These toothbrushes are great.  I have three kids and they all like to brush their teeth now. They are very quiet and easy to use as well.</li>
            <li> My 5-year old daugher loves brushing with this toothbrush.  She learnt to make use of the prompting tones to change the area of brushing.  I also like the fact that the brush shuts automatically.  The quality of the brush is similar to other Sonicare products.  Very pleased with this purchase!</li>
            <li> I bought this for my 4 yr old, who has a tendency to skimp on thorough brushings.  I love that after about a week of instructing her, she now can effectively brush her teeth WELL.  The melody increases in length until it plays the whole tune, which helps her focus on finishing.  It also lets me hear that she is brushing for the correct amount of time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros -&lt;br /&gt;I own and love my Philips Sonicare toothbrushes, and this one doesn&#x27;t disappoint either&lt;br /&gt;It has a low setting for smaller kids that is not as intense, but still cleans her teeth well.&lt;br /&gt;It came with 2 brush heads, one for under 7 and one for older kids and I can get more for my other child when he&#x27;s old enough.&lt;br /&gt;It has 3 different case covers that &amp;#34;stick on&amp;#34; for a personal touch (my daughter really liked picking out her design)&lt;br /&gt;It has a battery charger/stand, so even if not plugged in, the toothbrush sits upright and doesn&#x27;t fall over.&lt;br /&gt;It is portable and has a great battery life, can go for almost 2 months without needing to be charged.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons - A little loud if everyone is trying to sleep, but I would still purchase it.</li>
            <li> Our kids really didn&#x27;t like brushing their teeth.  They seemed to somehow forget to do it unless we reminded them.  Even then they were reluctant to take the time to adequately brush their teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But now with these new electronic tooth brushes our kids get a \\&quot;kick\\&quot; out of brushing their teeth.  They always look forward to doing it and now rush to the bathroom whenever we ask them to brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We&#x27;re really glad we purchased these.  Moreover, the kids&#x27; teeth are so much cleaner then before when they used non-electronic tooth brushes.  I highly recommended using these if you have the same problem as we did with our children and teeth-brushing.  :-)</li>
            <li> Our dentist encouraged us to get this nice toothbrush for our daughter because her baby teeth are ridged and needed extra scrubbing care that is difficult to get with a regular toothbrush. It holds quite the charge and has been great. We&#x27;ve had it for a little over a year now, and it continues to do its job.</li>
            <li> Finally a kids toothbrush worth the money! My kids love brushing their teeth and that has NEVER been the case in our household. We love the chime that reminds you to switch spots and the automatic timer that keeps them brushing until time runs out.</li>
            <li> Kids love it and it works beautifully.  The timer settings to let kids know how long to brush each area of their mouth is also really helpful so they get a complete brushing.</li>
            <li> My wife and I have basically the adult version (Sonicare HealthyWhite HX6711/02) of this product and we decided to buy this one for our 8 yr old when we got tired of wasting money on throw-away, character toothbrushes. Ultimately, you&#x27;ll end up saving money because the toothbrush heads last longer (better quality) and the base is rechargeable. The adult version my wife and I use are at least 3 yrs old and the rechargeable batteries are working perfectly. The kids unit appears to be of the same quality and materials. By flossing and using this toothbrush, you&#x27;ll be doing what most dentists&#x27; kids are doing and safeguarding them from cavities. This is a definite recommended buy!</li>
            <li> Overall, very good. I would have preferred receiving all small tips since the purpose of buying it was to replace my son&#x27;s full size sonicare which did not have small tips available. Would have been 5 stars except I&#x27;m not a fan of the new peg mini sized chargers that the brush can fall off much more easily than the old style. At least they add the surrounding piece that keeps the charger itself from falling over.</li>
            <li> It is a little heavy for my son but works Great... Makes brushing the regularly missed spots much easier and  more precisely</li>
            <li> My son loves this and I&#x27;m happy that i got it. Great product!</li>
            <li> This should be required for small kids. No young kids are good at brushing (don&#x27;t believe those other moms and dads). This times the brushing and gives a thorough brushing.</li>
            <li> My kids are 10 and 8 and they LOVE these tooth brushes. They have been using them for a week and I can already tell a difference! It helps to whiten teeth and isn&#x27;t too powerful for them.</li>
            <li> I purchased this over a month ago for my 4 yr. old daughter &amp; she absolutely LOVES it! She constantly wants to brush her teeth. The cool cover choices &amp; fun sounds are just an extra bonus! Definetly makes brushing time more desireable &amp; enjoyable.</li>
            <li> On time delivery, great price, my kids (5 &amp; 8) love them.  Easy grip, they much more regularly and thoroughly brush their teeth!</li>
            <li> From the moment I opened the box I was impressed.  First of all, the packaging is VERY easy to open.  Although it has little merit to the performance of the toothbrush, it made me feel like the company really did its homework to provide a good product starting with the packaging.  The toothbrush is easy to setup and has wonderful features to entice kids to get excited about brushing.  I ordered one for each child (7yo and 8yo) about a month ago and they have been excited to brush.  I never had a huge struggle with the kids about brushing, but they were a bit too lax on the length of brushing and the quality of the scrubbing.    The interchangeable plates make each toothbrush unique for the child.  I like that the musical sounds are not obnoxious and are great indicators regarding brushing time.    I am very pleased with the purchase and find the brushes to be high quality and so far the performance has be exactly as advertised.</li>
            <li> This is great brush, but first one stopped working after less then a year. Lets hope this one lasts longer.</li>
            <li> Our dentist recommended this toothbrush for our 7 year old and it took a short time for him to get used to it versus the regular rotating tooth brushes, but it works great and gets soaking wet and still works.  Great investment!</li>
            <li> use it everyday for a long time. easy to use clean and set up highly recommend for people who like their teeth super clean</li>
            <li> My husband &amp; I have had a Sonicare for several months and love it. My youngest daughters 10 &amp; 8 weren&#x27;t big fans of brushing or flossing until we bought them this toothbrush. Their gums were slightly red from not being flossed and in a matter of 2 weeks the redness is gone. Their teeth are clean and shiny and the plaque is gone. The toothbrush is very easy to use and comes with extra faceplates if you want to change up the look of the toothbrush. I highly recommend this toothbrush.</li>
            <li> My son and daughter share this toothbrush since it comes with two heads. The kids like to hear the musical cues so they brush for the entire 2 minutes. This was definitely worth the price. The only problem is that we switch the heads every day since the toothbrush is shared. It takes a lot of force to get the head off of the handle to put the other head on. Since there isn&#x27;t much room from the neck of the head to the bristles, I feel like I&#x27;m going to pull the bristles off at some point. Other than that, this was a terrific buy!  UPDATE: The toothbrush did break due to how tight the head was secured to the body. If this problem was fixed, I&#x27;d buy it but for now I&#x27;ll have to look elsewhere.</li>
            <li> My 9 year-old grandson loves this toothbrush!! He is brushing longer and telling others it.  The changeable handles make it easy to customize it.</li>
            <li> Wish I had gotten this toothbrush YEARS ago for my child.  Makes brushing more palatable for her and I can hear her brushing.  Her dentist and orthodontist are very pleased with her oral hygiene improvement.  Totally recommend with 10 thumbs up.  Comes with several interchangeable face plates to customize, and the timing sounds are fun.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Worth the 50 bucks!!</li>
            <li> Good product we like it.</li>
            <li> We got this for our 3 year old and love it! Makes teeth brushing easy….</li>
            <li> works great and the noised to notify time left to brush are neat  not too much power that it is painful. just the right ammout of vibration to get teeth clean</li>
            <li> OMG!  This item was a Godsend!!! My seven year old son always despised brushing his teeth - until NOW!  This tooth brush not only cleans better than any other on the market, it keeps my son entertained.  It has a series of musical indicators that go off so that he knows when to start brushing the next section of his mouth.  It allows him also to know when he is almost finished brushing.  I like that this toothbrush does most of the work and we aren&#x27;t so dependent on him getting the job done alone.  I HIGHLY recommend this toothbrush!!!</li>
            <li> My kid loves to use this tooth brush. sound will guide change position and finish.&lt;br /&gt;Brush part replacement is little expensive but kids love bush their teeth.</li>
            <li> this Rechargeable Electric Toothbrush is a great product for kids. my daughter like it very much. and get her teeth clean than before.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m the Oral B person, and so is my husband, but Oral B does not seem to make a kid friendly electric toothbrush like this one. It does its job! My have twins, so I appreciate the interchangeable fronts that allow to differentiate the toothbrushes.</li>
            <li> Older child is fine but younger child dislikes the vibration even on the low setting. Unsure where or if replacement heads are available? Hoping this cleans.</li>
            <li> Brushing teeth has never been so fun for my 6 yr old. I highly recommend!! My son loves his very own sonicare</li>
            <li> Two factors to consider: how well it cleans and the cost&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. I know from using the similar adult version, that it cleans better than anything else we have used. And it is the easiest to use. Just glide it from one tooth to the next. My son is much better about brushing his teeth now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. It is pretty expensive to buy, but the long term cost is probably not much more than the cheap battery brushes. We&#x27;ve used them for my son for a while now, but they only work well when the battery is very new, and the power runs down quickly. They are cheap to buy but expensive to use due to replacing batteries so often. Just frustrating. This brush cost a lot, but the charge lasts a long time, and no batteries to replace when it does need a charge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Final verdict is that I am very happy we got it for him.  The cost is not as high as it first seems,  it&#x27;s easier to use, and we have a more compliant kid and the best performance available.</li>
            <li> The grandchildren liked our Sonicare toothbrushes so I thought I&#x27;d get them their own.  It was a great idea.  They are excited to brush their teeth now.  The charge lasts a long time too.</li>
            <li> I was hesitant to purchase this for my seven year old after the dentist said it would be overkill, but I am glad I did. My son&#x27;s brushing quality has improved and his teeth look great! He likes the designs and has learned to brush until the brush automatically turns off. The nighttime struggles to brush before bed have diminished and is no longer a fight. I am glad I spent the little extra for the Sonicare!</li>
            <li> was worried it would be too much for my 4 year old but no problems, love the dings letting me know when we are almost done. Before this was buying and electric toothbrush at $4 every 3 or 4 weeks, but this toothbrush fits in her mouth better and bristles don&#x27;t wear out so easily</li>
            <li> I bought this for my 4 year old daughter for christmas and she loves it. We did have a normal non-ultrasonic toothbrush that we bought for her before but it broke for some reason and so we ended up buying her a normal toothbrush at first. She missed the vibration though and we have our own sonicare toothbrush so figured we would get this for her.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She likes that you can take the face off and select on of a couple designs to make it like your own setup. Helps her out with the music as it tells her when each quad is done and she needs to move on to the next quad. Took a little bit to get used to it though as it tickles her teeth to start. It&#x27;s also quite easy for her to grab and move around and the head is nice and small and fits in her little mouth great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As parents we like it cause it allows her to do a good job at cleaning her own teeth. Comes with two sized heads and the base unit can hold two heads making it great for if you have more then one kid. If need be the head on her toothbrush fits our sonicare brushes just as ours will even fit hers. It cleans her little teeth great. She will even walk out and rub her teeth sometiems just to show us how squeeky clean her teeth are and they really do squeek :-).</li>
            <li> The package arrived in good shape and performs as expected. We have not had any trouble with the toothbrush. I recommend this product.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s perfect for a 6 year old!!!  You can really see the difference with the music tones it&#x27;s all together awsome.</li>
            <li> 2 kids ages 5 and 8 use this brush and enjoy it. The 5 year old uses the low power mode and has the smaller brush designed for younger kids and the older one use the bigger brush and high power. This flexibility is well worth it.</li>
            <li> This is a great gift for any kids or parents. My kids love it and super easy to use and so cute! highly recommended.</li>
            <li> my daughter saw how i was feeling about my sonicare flex plus and wanted one, now she is so excited about brushing her teeth every single time after she eats. she absolutely loves this toothbrush it cleans her teeths very good and she raves about how squeaky clean they are.</li>
            <li> This toothbrush works fine, but went dead after less than two years.  Their customer service was fine and they provided a replacement, which then died in less than one year and it&#x27;s not covered under the warrantee because they only give warrantee from the original purchase date.  My Oral-B toothbrushes have lasted much, much longer.</li>
            <li> Kids didn&#x27;t really care for this toothbrush</li>
            <li> I bought based on a recommendation by one of my brothers and am very pleased with its performance.  The real test, I suppose, will come next month during the boys&#x27; dental checkup.</li>
            <li> My kids have had many battery operated toothbrushes that die in a couple months.  They love the sonic toothbrush.&lt;br /&gt;I have used sonic for years and I know it does a fantastic job cleaning your teeth.  I still help them but I know this works better to reach hard places and keeps their gums healthy.</li>
            <li> We got this for our eight year old. It took a few weeks to teach him how to use it properly, but now I love that it gives him a guide for how long to brush his teeth, plus does a better job than just his regular brushing. His teeth are noticeably cleaner, too.</li>
            <li> I love this brush for my 3.5 year old boy.  It cleans his teeth so well.  Very happy with my purchase.  Phillips is also a great company, as I have had trouble with my &#x27;adult&#x27; version, they replaced the part with no problem at all.  Something special for your precious little one from a good and reliable company.</li>
            <li> Great deal and it is amazing how clean this sonicare gets your teeth!  I&#x27;ve bought a few extra heads so I can use it myself.  Has 2 modes - 2 min and 4 minute timer.  Leaves teeth really clean and smooth</li>
            <li> Our almost 4 year old son loves his new \\&quot;power\\&quot; toothbrush and is very keen to brush his teeth morning and night. He can even manage on his own whilst I supervise. It&#x27;s a great product and when the time comes we will be getting one for our younger son.</li>
            <li> Got these for the grandkids and they love them and will actually brush their teeth without a fight and seem to be brushing longer as well.</li>
            <li> Our daughter won this toothbrush at the dentist so we already knew it was a great product - but they were selling them for $65.00 at the dentist.  So, I looked and found it here for much less and it is the same item.  My kids LIKE to brush their teeth and remain cavity free!</li>
            <li> I purchased these for my kids, after reading the reviews online. They work great, we have not had any problems, and they last a long time before needing to be re-charged. I am happy that the kids actually brush their teeth until it turns off - mission accomplished!&lt;br /&gt;The downfall of this brush is the expense of replacing the heads! A two pack cost about 20 dollars, which is ridiculous. You could get 4 disposable spinbrushes for that amount (although I think the Sonicare cleans better). If I had one more &#x27;complaint&#x27;, it would be the panels. I just wish they would make some cute and fun panels that would appeal to kids.&lt;br /&gt;Despite the expensive brush heads and boring panels, the bottom line is the Sonicare still works great, and clean teeth is worth the money!</li>
            <li> Easy to use product, and my daughter loves it. I wasn&#x27;t sure if it was &amp;#34;kid friendly&amp;#34; enough, but it is.</li>
            <li> Great product.  The kids enjoy brishing their teeth in the morning and know how long to brush with the timer.</li>
            <li> After spending lots of money on not so cheap imitations I bought this toothbrush.  Not only does it do a good job it helps the 4 year old do a good job.  The dentist was very proud of him on his last checkup.  You can&#x27;t start good dental habits to young.</li>
            <li> Purchased for my 3 1/2 yr old grandson and he loves it.  Timer lets him know when to move brush to other teeth.</li>
            <li> This is an awesome product, worth every penny.  However, they should include \\&quot;girl\\&quot; face plates.  My daughter does not want to use it because it is boy colors.</li>
            <li> I figure I use a sonicare and work in the dental field my son should use the same and it is the best.  It makes it more fun for him to brush with the music intervals in between.  He is 4 and this was a great purchase...highly recommend!!</li>
            <li> I bought it for my son a year ago. He is five years old next month. He like it but I can not find a new toothbrush head to buy!</li>
            <li> This is a very adequate toothbrush.  We bought it because it is a Sonicare, but didn&#x27;t know that it works with a vibrating mechanical peg / brush system, not the magnetic \\&quot;sonicare\\&quot; mechanism that you find in the other models.  The smaller brush works better for kids. It&#x27;s a little easier for them to manipulate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Still I wish it had the expected Sonicare system.</li>
            <li> My daughter didn&#x27;t like this, but I&#x27;m using it and love it.  Better dental check ups.  Has lasted much longer than my adult Sonicare.</li>
            <li> Awesome tooth brush! You can change the singing sound and you can change the color of the tooth brush😍&lt;br /&gt;Review by 8-year-old</li>
            <li> Seems to work okay.  Grandchildren use them.</li>
            <li> I AM A REGISTERED (PEDIATRIC) DENTAL HYGIENIST-I HAVE PURCHASED TWO OF THESE FOR MY CHILDREN-(AT MY COST)-I PURCHASED THIS ONE FOR MY NIECE AT MUCH LESS THEN \\&quot;MY PROFESSIONAL COST\\&quot;-THIS IS AN EXCELLENT PRODUCT-PLEASE READ THE INSTRUCTIONS- IT HAS MANY WONDERFUL FEATURES-ESPECIALLY THE TIMER(IT ACTUALLY DIVIDES THE MOUTH INTO 4 SECTIONS-4 BEEPS ,EACH TELLING YOU WHEN TO SWITCH,)THEN A MELODY IS PLAYED AT THE END -AWESOME PRODUCT!(ESPECIALLY AT THE AMAZON PRICE)-</li>
            <li> I have personally used Sonicare toothbrushes for a decade.  This one was purchased for my 4 year old.  She has used several battery operated toothbrushes.  The difference in this one is, well, it just works.  We know that her teeth are getting cleaned well yet gently.  It has a cool beep every 30 seconds which prompts her to move to another section of her mouth.  This alone means that she is brushing her teeth for 2 minutes.  She likes that it is a cool color and beeps.  It keeps her brushing and keeps me happy.  The battery life is excellent.  Also, this model is easy to keep clean, both the toothbrush and the charging base. I would definitely recommend this toothbrush!</li>
            <li> Kids love to use it nothing more to say how many times do I have to do this for you</li>
            <li> I purchased this tooth brush for my grand as a Christmas gift and both she and her parents absolutely love it. She&#x27;s brushing longer and having fun while doing so.</li>
            <li> I love my grand children but didn&#x27;t enjoy brushing their teeth for them when caring for them!&lt;br /&gt;The 5 yr. old twins and almost 3 year old LOVE using these brushes.  No more arguing about brushing teeth.&lt;br /&gt;The timed chime tells them when to switch from upper to lower teeth so they get a good cleaning.  The brushes fit great in their little hands.  Great gift at a reasonable price.</li>
            <li> The timer works well for us.  My daughter does not fuss any longer with the time needed to properly achieve a clean mouth.  It gradually gets them to the entire 2 minutes with a very child friendly chime for each quadrant, then eventually stopping when the time has been achieved.  It is not very bulky.  Great choice!!</li>
            <li> Great toothbrush with a timer!! That is why we love it, there&#x27;s no guessing if he brushed for long enough!</li>
            <li> My son 11 year old isn&#x27;t the most motivated brusher and had troubles with plaque on his bottom 4 teeth and top canines. This has really helped with those problem areas.</li>
            <li> My boys regularly get told to brush better by our dentist. This has a 4 30 second timers so they know when to work on another area</li>
            <li> Could not be HAPPIER with this product!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My son likes the little music noises prompting him to switch to each side of his mouth.  His teeth are noticeably whiter and he loves using it!  WIN!!!!</li>
            <li> I purchased 3 for my children. Except for the fact that they splat toothpaste spit everywhere, they are exactly what the dentist ordered.&lt;br /&gt;My kids aren&#x27;t allowed to stop brushing until the brush stops itself. The result us 2 full minutes of brushing every morning and night. Love this toothbrush.</li>
            <li> We have been a sonicare fans for years and our dentist has always been impressed with our oral hygiene-- I give all the credit to sonicare.  That said, the kids version simply sucks.  First one died within 6 months and the 2nd died before the year was up.  They simply stopped working, stopped taking a charge.  Get an adult version with small head.  Bummer.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my two children and I have been happy with the product.  In my opinion $50 is pricey for a toothbrush but the fact that it includes two interchangeable brush heads (one for younger, one for older kids) that suited the ages of my two children, helped me justify spending that much.  The kids were excited to try it.  They giggle and say that it tickles.  Overall, they have ended up brushing more often and from what I can tell, it is working well.</li>
            <li> Both my kids have used this brush for a long time. We have purchased one replacement though. It comes with different &amp;#34;stickers&amp;#34; to make the handle a different color - my kids have never been interested in this piece of it. Brushing my kids teeth is, unfortunately, a struggle. At least with this brush, there have been no cavities as little skill is required, just hold the brush still while you count to 5 and move to the next tooth.</li>
            <li> I strongly recommend these for kids. The price on amazon is lot less then retail. I have 2 kids : 4 and 9 . This has the right timer, is soft and perfect for he duration the brush needs to be done. Must buy</li>
            <li> My cute little great grandsons said, &amp;#34;It makes brushing your teeth fun.&amp;#34; The other one said, &amp;#34;It tingles your teeth.&amp;#34;  They both loved the brush. My grand daughter said they could not wait to charge it up and used it right away. Twice. We are all happy. :)</li>
            <li> I have been using Sonicare toothbrushes for myself for many years now and totally believe they have made a huge difference in my oral health.  Before I started using it, I was constantly told that I was at the beginning stages of gingivitis.  I have not been told this for at least 5 years, since I started using the Sonicare.  And you will be amazed when you first use it.  Your teeth will feel dentist clean!  This particular toothbrush is for children.  I bought one for my daughter because of the big difference it made for myself!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very happy with this toothbrush. I bought 3 for my 3 boys who never really liked brushing teeth. The kids like the musical prompts and brush their teeth for the full two minutes. The changeable plates for the front are really nice, fortunate that there are three different designs.</li>
            <li> This toothbrush was bought for my 9 year old. I love it. He loves it. It&#x27;s powerful, yet gentle as well. The only thing I wish were different is that the colorful front panels are stick-on and I wish they were snap-on so that you could change them back and forth.</li>
            <li> Grandkids like the toothbrush, especially the boys ages 5 &amp; 7.  The 5 yr old girl thinks it tickles too  much!!</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t get my 5 year old son to brush longer than about 30 seconds with a regular toothbrush without a struggle. This one playes musical notes every time you need to change which part of the mouth you&#x27;re brushing. He actually follows along and as it slowly builds up the brushing duration and intensity over 14 brushes, he hasn&#x27;t even noticed the brushing time is increasing. I highly recommend especially for a child around 5 years or so. I think any younger and he wouldn&#x27;t have understood what he was suppose to do.</li>
            <li> My husband and I are sonicare users for a long time. One of our twins was not easy to let us brush his teeth and the sonicare made it much easy to reach every angle of his mouth.&lt;br /&gt;really great product.</li>
            <li> An adult usIng a toothbrush designed for a child or younger adult? Well this design is perfect for any adult.  Because of a health issue,  sometimes I have problems holding objects such as a toothbrush. This is just perfect,  shape wise weight wise and most important,  performance wise. A very smart office manager in my dentist&#x27;s suggested this Sonicare For Kids and she was so right on. A larger head is included so all bases are covered. Did I mention the handle has different color inserts you can change depending on your brush mood. This is the only toothbrush I know of that will have you smiling before, during and after!</li>
            <li> Kids love it!  Love the different design option stickers</li>
            <li> These toothbrushes are decent for kids.  We purchased them at the recommendation of our pediatric dentist.  My son will be on his 3rd electric toothbrush (I think I&#x27;m getting a different brand/head this time).  Both of his toothbrushes of this style have broken off with the metal attachment inside the bristle head.  We called the company with the first one and they replaced it, but it has happened again.  I&#x27;m not sure if it is the head style of the brush?  I&#x27;m wondering if he would do better with a circle/round bristle head electronic brush.  My daughter&#x27;s is doing okay, but after awhile, the replacement heads just don&#x27;t attach to the handle very well.</li>
            <li> The brushes work much better for my kids than manual toothbrushes. The chimes must not amuse them as much as other kids because they still hem and haw when it is time to brush.  However, their teeth are getting brighter and two minutes on the Sonicare is better than the four or five they were spending with a manual brush.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m an senior citzen but my Dentist told me to get this model and it&#x27;s perfect. This one is $20 cheaper&lt;br /&gt;And has the same strength</li>
            <li> It is very helpful in engendering good oral hygiene in tots. The 4 beeps help keep him on track. The low setting is gentle enough. I ended up using the brush head for older kids that came with it (it was identical in size to the adult heads I later bought) for myself. On the high setting it is a diminutively sized adult Sonicare. So now we share. Works great.</li>
            <li> Love the brush. The whole family has a sonicare toothbrush. Cleaner results and better office visits. Will outlast a kids typical power toothbrush wear you have to keep replacing the heads or the WHOLE toothbrush!</li>
            <li> My twin boys have loved their Sonicare tootbrushes, but they died after 3 years.  Sonicare told me they do not repair the toothbrushes nor will they replace them after 2 years.  I have had my adult Oral B electric toothbrush for over 5 years and now I will be trying the Oral B kids toothbrushes instead.</li>
            <li> My 4YO daughter loves brushing her teeth now!  We have been using Sonicares for years, and this product seems like it will have the reliability that we have come to expect from Philips.  There are four audible beeps for each quadrant of your mouth, just like the &amp;#34;adult toothbrushes&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> This was a great purchase for my 8 year old son, he loves it and I love it!!! It was easy for him to learn how to use it, it makes a sound when he needs to move it to a different part of his mouth and it plays a little jingle when he&#x27;s finished. It came with 3 different stickers so he could customize it when he first got it which made him excited to use it. Came with 2 different sized bruse heads for the different age groups also.</li>
            <li> This toothbrush removed built on plaque that we couldn&#x27;t get off with other tooth brushes... it is SOOO worth the price to have some clean teeth kids</li>
            <li> Product is as described and the &amp;#34;music&amp;#34; it makes really kept my daughter engaged in brushing; she loves it and I would recommend this product to anyone; I just hope the replacement brush heads are compatible that ordered on Amazon too; I haven&#x27;t received those yet but I will place my review on them once I do.  Thanks for the wonderful item! A+++++++++</li>
            <li> My ten year daughter, who would never spend more than 30 seconds brushing her teeth, now enjoys brushing her teeth and actually brushes three times a day now.</li>
            <li> This is a great brush for kids.  Love that there is a timer so kids know how long to brush.</li>
            <li> My 5 year old uses this &amp; it&#x27;s a great toothbrush. It has the chime that reminds him to switch to a new section, and keeps him brushing for the full minute. It&#x27;s easy to hold &amp; doesn&#x27;t tickle his nose as badly as the battery operated toothbrushes I&#x27;d been buying at Target.</li>
            <li> My  3 year old grandson is happy to use his personal toothbrush every day. He enjoys it and never has cavities.</li>
            <li> My son loves it! Can&#x27;t find a similar quality product from other manufacturers so Phillips are happy to explore their edge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bite the bullet and your kid will be happy to brush his teeth (i.e. priceless)</li>
            <li> My son must like it in some way since even though it tickles his lips and gum very very much he still uses it without complaint.  But, the motion of the head does make it difficult to brush.  It&#x27;s hard to get him to brush the area that is most ticklish.  The Braun (which we got for our daughter) does not tickle like this one.</li>
            <li> Brushing the kids teeth was always a nightmare, even with the cheap electric brushes.  Once they got this one the love to brush their teeth.  It has two sizes of heads, small and large, so kids of any age can use it.  It has sounds for when it&#x27;s time to move the brush to another area, and plays a little music when done.  Should of bought this a long time ago....</li>
            <li> This toothbrush was recommended by my son&#x27;s oral hygienist.  My son loves it and so do I.  I love that it signals my son when to move to a different area to brush and when finished gives another signal.  My son thinks its fun and continues to use it without me standing over him to brush his teeth...would highly recommend!</li>
            <li> This is a great tool. It not only starts out with an &amp;#34;easy&amp;#34; setting and gradually gets more effective, but it also allows we parents to not bug the child to keep brushing to make the two minute mark - they want to get to the song at the end as their reward.  After 6 months my kids had their best check-up at the dentist.</li>
            <li> My eight year old loves brushing his teeth with this brush. Definitely can see whiter teeth after 6 weeks of brushing. Unlike with other kiddy brushes.</li>
            <li> One of the two I ordered for my 2 sons stopped working a few months after product was received. would give a 5 star rating if both still worked.</li>
            <li> my boy loves it. easy to grap. the timer function helps much. stickers are cute too.his teeth absolutely look cleaner.</li>
            <li> Brushing my kiddos teeth twice a day was always a nightmare.  Lots of crying.  But now he is happy to let me brush his teeth, and excited to try it out himself.  His teeth looks great and clean, so I would totally recommend the product to other parents!</li>
            <li> Quality is great and worth the price.  kids love them. so far no problem. a little too long though for kids.&lt;br /&gt;Cons: expensive.</li>
            <li> The look and sounds were fun at first, but now that the time is increasing and she&#x27;s used it for awhile, the novelty is gone. However, the timer does encourage longer brushing time and the sonicare brush ensures that her teeth are getting cleaner no matter how bored she is with brushing. Good product.</li>
            <li> My kids love to brush their teeth now, I especially like the timing for each section of the mouth. Very good.</li>
            <li> Great toothbrush Kids love it worth the money. Wish it came with a carry case. Other than that it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li> My husband and I have been Sonicare fans for quite some time now.  There is just no other product out there that leaves your teeth feeling as slick and clean as a Sonicare.  After trying a couple of times to brush my young toddler&#x27;s teeth with mine, I realized the adult version is just too intense and scary for him, so I resorted to the regular manual tooth brush for him.  However, it takes too long and cleans terribly with a manual tooth brush especially when they  are resistant! This works perfectly because it is gentler for little ones, yet still cleans great quickly.  And you want to do it fast to make it easier on you and your little one.  You just have to gently touch the teeth, and the brush does the work.  Not saying that it makes him cooperative about brushing his teeth, but definitely aids in the struggle!</li>
            <li> Almost two years and still working strong. By the way, I bought it for my 11 years old son and I ended up using it as well. I bought the Philips Sonicare Standard Ultra Soft Sensitive, 3 Brush Heads and it fits nicely.</li>
            <li> Replacement brushes are almost as much as a new unit.</li>
            <li> it stopped working 2 months after i got it and I cant return it. Im so not happy!!!! Very frustrated</li>
            <li> Easy to use, kids just plug and play brushing their teeth.  I use it to have play time with the kids and they brush ....</li>
            <li> This is a great buy for my 11 year old son.  It stays on for a full 2 minutes and makes sure he is brushing for the proper amount of time.  He has had great reviews at the dentist after using this toothbrush twice a day.</li>
            <li> So great for kids. Let&#x27;s them know when to move the brush to a different area on their teeth. Turns off automatically when they should be done. No more arguing that they haven&#x27;t brushed long enough. The brush speaks/beeps for itself. I&#x27;m confident that their dental check-ups will be great. Great investment to have good teeth for a lifetime.</li>
            <li> Works great! Only wish it was a smaller, so my daughter can brush teeth herself, rather than me having to do it.</li>
            <li> My 10 year old got this for his one expensive b-day present, and thank goodness he liked it! Here&#x27;s what he has to say: &amp;#34;It works so good, and the time - two minutes - is just right to make your teeth feel clean. Not long enough to get bored and not short enough to make your teeth feel like you missed a bunch of spots. And it has a little kids and big kids setting and brush, which is really useful because i have a 2 year old brother.</li>
            <li> Have had this about a month - good quality toothbrush - has timer so kids know how long to brush each area of mouth - works well.</li>
            <li> This toothbrush is well designed and is easy to grip especially in small hands. Both my wife and I have been long time users of Sonicare toothbrushes and decided to purchase this for our children. If you are familiar with the adult versions of Sonicare brushes then this will have a familiar feel and operate similarly.</li>
            <li> My daughter loves it.  Color is attractive and i love the brush cover.. i carried it to the hotel... thank you so much</li>
            <li> This is a must have for your kids.. great product at a great price...the best part is that it tells the kids know how long to brush and when to stop..</li>
            <li> Why is cleaning a 4 &amp; 6 years teeth such a chore every night? We do it every night, why do they act like it&#x27;s something new! These brushes really helped. Need I say more!</li>
            <li> Both my 7 &amp; 8 year old sons used to dread brushing their teeth.  Now they are very excited and enjoy brushing at the same time as us adults with our Sonicare toothbrush.  They each got a toothbrush to customize with three different plates and a brushing head sized correctly for their mouths.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They hold a charge really well (as long as you charge it, use it until it is dead, then repeat, don&#x27;t leave it on the charger at all times), the power settings have slowly increased along with the duration over the last month and a half, the kids don&#x27;t even notice!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great job again Philips!  Get these for your kids!</li>
            <li> I use this brush for my two kids, the big brush head for my 11 year old and the smaller one for my 5 year old.  I get compliments on how clean their teeth are at the dentist.  Worth the money, I recommend it.</li>
            <li> We love it! I really gets my sons teeth clean and is quite. It also has the timer so he knows how long he has to brush.</li>
            <li> it works the best!!Nice experience! it cleans really well!happy with it and I highly recommend it to anyone who wants their kid has a clean teeth!!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s good for my son of 3.&lt;br /&gt;The music is instructive for teeth brushing.&lt;br /&gt;my son became less dislike brushing his teeth.</li>
            <li> We bought for our son almost a year ago today! He is still using it! It&#x27;s a great tooth brush!</li>
            <li> my kids love this toothbrush and I love knowing that it helps them achieve better brushings! It has worked great and they have gotten great reviews from the dentist! I love the timed cleanings as well!</li>
            <li> This is an awesome tooth brush for children becuase it has a 2 timer with 30 second intervals.  The toothbrush is fun for the children</li>
            <li> like the built in timer and the kids do not need to brush hard as the sonic movement cleans the teeth.</li>
            <li> I use this on my sons teeth and when he spits the tooth paste out, you can see the yellow tinge amongst the white tooth paste foam in the sink. If I use a standard tooth brush on him three brushing episodes in a row, you can tell the difference.</li>
            <li> My children always wanted to try my adult sonicare but I was too scare they&#x27;d damage their gums. My dentist recommended we give the children&#x27;s sonicare a try (I didn&#x27;t know there was one). My kids like that it times them and beeps when they need to move the brush. The dentist is proud of their teeth and gums</li>
            <li> The best electric tooth brush out there for kids. I purchased this for my 7yr.old  granddaughter for Christmas. 5 months later she thanked me for it again. She loves it. It has a timer and automatically turns off after 2 minutes. Instructions are to divide the mouth into 4 sections and brush each section for 30 seconds, and the timer beeps every 30 seconds to signal to move to the next section. Her teeth stay whiter now. When I am at her house she makes me brush my teeth the same length of time she is brushing hers. You don&#x27;t realize how long 2 minutes is with a manual tooth brush until you practice this. It really increases brushing time. The tooth brush came with different colored decorative snap on fronts so the kids can choose which one they want. It also comes with 2 brushing heads. One for younger children (little tots) and one for older kids.  I would definitely recommend this tooth brush for kids. The adult Sonicare is great too.</li>
            <li> I love that it does a great job cleaning my son&#x27;s teeth and the two minute timer beeps when it is time to move the brush to move the brush to a new quadrant.</li>
            <li> I bought these for my 4 and 2 year olds and it has done wonders for brushing time! I am a little hard core on dental care since i despise dentists offices so when it came to the brush your teeth fight with my kids i would have to hold them down and try and get them to open long enough to scrub scrub without them biting the brush so im locked. This brush is AMAZING it does the brushing for you and has chimes for when to switch zones. My 4 yr old does his own (with my follow up) and my two yr old tolerates it enough for me to just do the moving through the zones. Everything gets brushed thourough and quick! I will never go back to manual!</li>
            <li> Their teeth are cleaner than they were before we bought this brush.  Though our wallets are lighter too.  But on the whole, worthwhile.</li>
            <li> I was hesitant at first if this toothbrush would be better than other rechargeable brushes but having seen the results of my 8 year old&#x27;s teeth, I&#x27;m sold.  No more tender gums and because the brush is timed, she goes through the entire 2 minute setting to brush her teeth.  No more guessing on how long she thinks she brushed for.  Each section (upper left, upper right, lower left and lower right) gets 30 seconds of brushing since every 30 seconds the brush beeps to let you know that you can move to another section.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would highly recommend for kids!</li>
            <li> This is really a great product for kids.  It is so easy for them to use and because it has a set timer, you know that they are brushing for a long enough duration.  They get a clean feeling after using their tooth brush and I feel happy that this product is doing a better job than a regular tooth brush.  My kids have really tight spacing in their teeth and so this really helps the brush get in between.  But you still should floss the kids teeth regardless.</li>
            <li> I got this one for my daughter and she loves it. Loves the multiple skins that she can put on it and has improved her brushing experience. Good one!</li>
            <li> bought these brushes for my grandchildren, youngest being 3, and they all love them.  They love the music that is played for the length of brushing time and also the individual covers that are available to individualize the brushes.</li>
            <li> I rate it as 5 stars because I am pleased with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am in my early 70&#x27;s yet my dentist recommended the childs model Philips Sonicare.  The two valued timer function lets me know when I have brushed long enough.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My dental health has improved in the time that I have used it, approximately one month.</li>
            <li> These toothbrushes are amazing. The kids enjoy using them, after set time periods they play musical sounds which makes them chuckle. Still a fight to brush their teeth, but less so.</li>
            <li> Does what it says and is what it is.  The kid has braces so wanted to ensure we were doing as much as we could to help him keep them clean.  Solid construction and works well.</li>
            <li> I got this kids&#x27; Sonicare for my three-year-old because it worked so well for me. I expected a little resistance since it also took a little while for me to get used to the strong vibrations. But when I used it on her, I saw her pain as little tears welled up and fell down her cheeks. Enough to break a mother&#x27;s heart. She told me it hurt and refused to let me use it on her anymore. For the next few days, she stopped eating and was crying constantly saying that her mouth hurt. I saw some of the reviews that other young kids were having trouble with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried using it again when she was 5, and she was more receptive to it. It&#x27;s quicker and more effective than using a regular toothbrush, so I&#x27;m glad we got it. Sometimes she complains that it hurts, so I have to try keep it moving and not to do it too long on one area. Also I have to be be careful to put it flat on the teeth because the top and bottom sides are pointy. Also replacements are expensive. Thankfully, you can order cheaper generic replacement heads on Amazon.</li>
            <li> got this for my 7 year old who is a poor brusher.  she seems to like it, we are still working on the brushing habits but at least this gives a little extra boost.</li>
            <li> best idea and price for your kid around.  It has a timer that gradually increases to 2 min so the kids get used to it.  flat out amazing</li>
            <li> My kids actually wanted these for Christmas.  They love them.  I have been listening to them talk strategy on how to bush and where to move after the first beep.  It let&#x27;s them know that they are brushing the right amount of time in each area.  Funny to see a 7 year old girl and two 9 year old boys so excited about brushing.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my 3 year old - who has always been very cooperative when it comes to brushing his teeth - and I noticed within just a few days of using it that there was a considerable amount of plaque/residue left on his teeth after brushing. We&#x27;ve been using the smaller/younger-child toothbrush head and setting on the toothbrush. The benefit to this toothbrush is that my son loves when the toothbrush plays it&#x27;s little noises, it&#x27;s made brushing his teeth not just &amp;#34;part of the routine&amp;#34; but actually fun. But since the sonicare toothbrush doesn&#x27;t get his teeth completely clean, we&#x27;re still using a manual toothbrush after we use the sonicare.</li>
            <li> OK, so i must admit that i have gotten really lazy brushing my 6 year old and 4 year old&#x27;s teeth. My 6 year old had to have her first filling this month and i vowed i would never let it happen again. So i immediately purchased this toothbrush after using the sonicare essence myself for over a year.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The brush did take them some time to get used to. Especially the upper teeth for some reason, but about 4 weeks into it, its no big deal anymore. My kids do share the same device, i just change out the brush heads for them. I thought that would get annoying at first and was ready to spend the extra cash for another, but its been super easy just changing out the heads that I wont need to. The red one is the perfect size, the blue (bigger kid) size is still too big for my 6 years old mouth, so i just have two smaller red heads.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The different settings seem to brush at the same speed, the only difference i noted is that one brushes for 15 sec intervals and the other for 30. I let them brush their own teeth in the morning and they seem to have no problems. Its a lot easier to monitor that they brushed their teeth for a full 2 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did shop around for the best price, btw. And kept hoping someone would have an after thanksgiving sale on it. but the price on amazon is the cheapest you&#x27;re gonna get. Even better priced than walmart.</li>
            <li> Very useful tool for our disabled daughter.  Small head makes brushing her teeth safer and more comfortable for her.  Timer is wonderful.  Recommended by her dentist.  Best price on line.</li>
            <li> Loving my own sonic toothbrush, I wanted one for my child.  LOVE the timer feature and love that it&#x27;s getting her teeth cleaner than the traditional brush.  Definitely a good buy.  She was totally bummed that she could not take it on vacation.</li>
            <li> My kids brush harder and are more mindful of how they care for their teeth with this.  I actually got calls from moms of their friends at school asking what kind of toothbrush my kids were using.  It has two heads so that both of my kids can use the same motor.  It works really well.  The only problem we have, is when one of the girl leaves for a sleep-over.  They fight over who gets the toothbrush.  So keep a regular brush handy for those instances.  Otherwise this was WELL worth the purchase.</li>
            <li> It is really easy to use, I love the time factor. My kids didnt want to brush their teeth long enough so the timer on it is really nice.</li>
            <li> My kid loves it and use that everyday. It is more convenient and save me more time. Recommend this to your lovely kid.</li>
            <li> Bought one for myself (6500) and my daughter.  She was not the most interested tooth brusher, but since getting this, she is always excited to get her teeth brushed.</li>
            <li> We bought two of these for each of our brushing aged kids.  We figured it would be good to invest in good toothbrushes after going through several the \\&quot;disposable\\&quot; spin brush styles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So far we have been very happy with our purchase and the kids love them. The coolest feature is the  little music chime that goes off four times to tell them when to brush a new section of their mouths. It also goes off  when they are done  which is a cool feature.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The brush is sturdy and the kids like the colorful bases.</li>
            <li> My daughter has owned this for about a year. It makes her want to brush more. The replacement child sized heads are certainly pricey. Just over $10 each and you are supposed to replace it every 3 months. So you&#x27;re looking at $40/year just for the heads.</li>
            <li> Used by our seven year old, prior to this automatic brush her mom and I would have to help brush her teeth with her regular toothbrush.  The quick movement of the brush head gives the impression that it is doing a better job than hand brushing of old.  Daughter has lost (milk) teeth, but not due to cavities from poor brush function; brush works well.</li>
            <li> My kids love it; its easy to use and they&#x27;re done in a minute. The best part is that now I don&#x27;t have to tell them to clean the brushes (like in the non-electric) ones after brushing as a simple swipe (while its still vibrating) in the water from the tap takes care of that...</li>
            <li> We take care of my son&#x27;s dental health seriously. He used to brush his teeth at lease once a day (most of the times twice a day) and also floss every night without any exception.&lt;br /&gt;But one day we saw a little stain on his front teeth. After that day, we were monitoring the stain on daily basis and we found out that the stain was growing.&lt;br /&gt;Then I made the decision and bought this electric toothbrush.&lt;br /&gt;In 2 weeks the stain was gone. Really amazing results. I couldn&#x27;t believe what I saw. Specially because the speed of this little toothbrush is much less than the ones for adults. So I didn&#x27;t expect it to be this good.&lt;br /&gt;It is really good and works really well.&lt;br /&gt;Just to clarify, one of the brush heads is for 4-7 years old usage and the other one for 7+. This is very important piece of information. The big head (7+) does not fit very good in a small kid&#x27;s jaws. So you must use the little one for your kid if he/she is less than 7 years old. Otherwise the outside part of upper teeth won&#x27;t be brushed very well.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great toothbrush when use.  My kids never had dental issues &amp; their teeth are sparkling shine :-).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s design for kids use &amp; abuse, it only last us for over a year.  We bought the exact same one again b/c kids love it, but I wish it would last longer</li>
            <li> We bought these for both of our kids ages 7 &amp; 9.  They prefer to use these now to brush their teeth versus a manual toothbrush.  The sounds are fun and keep them brushing.  They each chose to use a different plate on the front which helps them identify their own toothbrush.</li>
            <li> The toothbrush is sturdy and beautiful. It send out music tone during stages, My 5 year old granddaughter loves it.  I let her brush by herself and do the final touch up. Well made and hurrah!</li>
            <li> I am so satisfied with this toothbrush. My son uses it himself and never complains about brushing. The little incremental noises let him know how much longer he needs to brush and when brush time is over. He uses it and doesn&#x27;t complain so I really could not be happier with this toothbrush!</li>
            <li> We are a family of Sonicare and love what it does to our teeth... Great check up with the dentist.. Great products..</li>
            <li> It highly encourages longer brushing time and that is good. We shall see at our next dental visit how thoroughly it works when an eight-year-old is more on her own with brushing with this product. So, I guess I somewhat withhold my opinion until after that - but initially I like it.</li>
            <li> My boys totally dislike brushing their teeth. That all changed with this toothbrush. They both enjoy the ease of using this product and my wife and I have the piece of mind that their teeth are being cleaned the way they should.</li>
            <li> We love this for our child. I recommend it for the great brushing it accomplishes. It gets the job done and has a shorter run time than an adult version (which we also have for the grown-ups). However, our daughter complains that it &amp;#34;beeps too much&amp;#34; and the beeps are fairly loud. If your child doesn&#x27;t like a lot of beeps- which are meant to give guidance on how long to brush certain areas of teeth- you might reconsider. It plays a little song at the end to indicate you are done also.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One other note: For us, it was too hard for 2 kids to share it  - which was our original intention - because changing the heads takes a bit of time and kids are impatient!</li>
            <li> Great for my two autistic children!&lt;br /&gt;The lowest setting is too strong for my 3 year old, but nothing that a desense program wouldn&#x27;t fix.&lt;br /&gt;My 6 year old loves it and it is preparing her to go to the dentist (the vibration) in a couple of months.&lt;br /&gt;Pricey for us ($60) but worth it! It has a sound that beeps 5 times. 4 for each quadrant of the mouth and 5 for a little longer/different tune to tell your children when to switch sides of the mouth and when they are done!&lt;br /&gt;PERFECT.</li>
            <li> Works well. My 5 year old loves that he has a toothbrush like mom and dad. The only place though I can find the replacement heads in here on amazon.</li>
            <li> Although I am very happy with my Sonicare I bought at the same time with my daughter&#x27;s, her Sonicare for Kids has started to go off during use, although being fully charged. After a few weeks it has stopped working at full speed as if its battery was dying so we had no use for it after a few weeks. Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> Use one of these twice a day and I think you could actually skip seeing the dentist every 6 months.  No dentist would ever tell you that and there are other reasons to see a dentist, but regular cleanings seem almost pointless after using this.  Kids love it, although you may want to supervise younger ones to make sure it&#x27;s used properly.  Finally, it may not be as attractive as the adult versions, but the adult heads fit on this one and its quite a bit cheaper than the adult models.  Forget all the special settings; high and low work just fine.</li>
            <li> Great product for the kids to use.  Timer is ideal as it beeps ever 30 seconds for a total time of two minutes.  Still have to watch then brush but very little complaining about brushing time in the morning and evening!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s billed as a kids toothbrush but it has an adult setting and the adult heads fit on it. It&#x27;s also about 1/2 the price of the other models. Excellent toothbrush. I use it myself.</li>
            <li> My boy is loving bruhing his teeth now.  I have a flex care sonicare brush and he was itching to have one very similar, so for the price and function this toothbrush was ideal.  Now that he has it and is using it I know it was the right choice.  Not only is he brushing even more but I no longer have to send him back because he did it completed the process lighting fast. With the beeping tones to let him know when to switch to the next quadrant, I know he&#x27;s getting a better quality brushing experience.  I can see a difference as well and I am dont have to send him back to redo.  Would highly recommend for the youngsters.</li>
            <li> sent promptly. great product</li>
            <li> Got this after the dentist found cavities in my kid&#x27;s teeth.  After about 3 months of use, he got the &amp;#34;all clear&amp;#34; from the dentist.  The only complaint is that the rubber on the back of the brush head is a little brittle, so it cracks after about 6 weeks of use.</li>
            <li> bought Philips Sonicare HX6311/02 Sonicare for Kids Rechargeable Electric toothbrush for my kids in JUNE 2012 and in December 2012 it broke. we thought the battery died so we charged it for 24hrs. still did not work. changed it in another location, still did not work and it has not worked since. will not turn on at all.  i will recommend the toothbrush because it did what it was suppose to do but i don&#x27;t know what happen to the one i purchased. i wish i can get a replacement. due the the price and its durability, i will give it 1 star but 5 stars for the performance.</li>
            <li> I think this is the best toothbrush ever on market for kids. but I wish we could choose the size of head. I won&#x27;t need the big kid brush head until 6 years from now and rather buy them then.</li>
            <li> This item is great for kids.  It not only helps get a good brush in but it&#x27;s timed so each section of the mouth gets the same amount of cleaning.  This has helped put the fighting with my kid on brushing her teeth to bed.  Now she wants to brush her teeth!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Sonicare (for grown ups) for almost 15 years.  However, the kids&#x27; version is not as reliable.&lt;br /&gt;We had the handle replaced under warranty after just a month when it stopped working.  Then a few months later the shaft&lt;br /&gt;came loose on the handle, again replaced with warranty.  Now we have the same issue on the third.  Switching to Oral B for my daughter.</li>
            <li> in a sugar filled world, can&#x27;t hurt.  took a bit for girls to adjust to vibration but i bought a second one also.  kids do great and like them and rarely here any complaints when time to brush.</li>
            <li> Great for kids, easy to use if used properly really ensures clean teeth!</li>
            <li> Our Grandson has started losing his baby teeth and adult teeth are now coming in.  We sent this to him as a congratulations and incentive to take care of his new teeth.  He has always brushed, but as with all kids, it&#x27;s hard to stand there and brush as long as he should.  He loves it.</li>
            <li> Piece of junk!  Got a brand new system from my child&#x27;s orthodontist and after 2 months it stopped working!  I called Philips to ask for a new one or help figuring out the issue and all they could offer me was a discount code to buy a new one.  Yikes. The last thing I am going to do is buy a NEW one after the &amp;#34;old&amp;#34; one broke after 2 months of use.</li>
            <li> Great gift for grandsons.</li>
            <li> My 3 year old loves this!  It encourages him to brush longer!</li>
            <li> The only down side are the hard-to-find and/or expensive replacement heads. Other than that, it removes almost all plaque. My kids have been cavity-free since using these. (But remind them to floss!)</li>
            <li> Really great toothbrush so far no issues</li>
            <li> Great toothbrush for my kids..  They LOVE it..  Really wants to make them brush more often.</li>
            <li> got it for my daughter&#x27;s training.&lt;br /&gt;she wont use it often, I found it has high very high vibrations even in lower settings.&lt;br /&gt;we try to use it once a week atleast.</li>
            <li> Arrived on time and met all expectations.</li>
            <li> Although not recommended for children so young, we use this on our 2 year old daughter. It works wonderfully, quickly and efficiently removing stains and tartar that had built up on her teeth during her first years. She even enjoys (ineffectively) brushing her own teeth with it.  The brush takes a beating and keeps working.  I know of nothing else in the same league as this toothbrush.</li>
            <li> I like sonicare electronic toothbrushes. But this one I bought for my son was really a bad one. It stopped working after one year. Then I threw it away and ordered another one. Recently I heard that all sonicare toothbrush have two year warrantee. I am afraid I can not get a replacement if I don&#x27;t have the old broken one available. Too bad!</li>
            <li> My kids love it. Two speeds,for each child. I have a 5 and 8 year old.</li>
            <li> bought it as a gift hope my Granddaughter likkes it. She hasn&#x27;t tried it yet In think she will like it</li>
            <li> I love this tb, it is the best we had for the kids, it reaches all areas and removes all stains.</li>
            <li> Reccommended by my dentist. This is the kid version and works very well for adults with small mouths.&lt;br /&gt;The cleaning of this toothbrush is excellent! The timer on it makes it easy to know when to move to another part of your mouth. The battery stays charged for a very long time! It comes with two brushes so makes it even more economical if you have two children or two adults using it.&lt;br /&gt;Reccommend to anyone who wants better check ups at their dentist!</li>
            <li> My kids LOVE their new toothbrushes. Brushing was always a power struggle with my daughter and she loves the how the toothbrush chimes to indicate when to switch areas and when time is up. The brush does an excellent job, requiring minimal effort from the child.</li>
            <li> Our children needed more than our standing over them and telling them to brush more, brush longer!  We have an 8 yr old and a 3 1/2 yr old.  This works perfectly for them.  It came with a head for 4+ and one for 7+.  If we didn&#x27;t plan on using the 4+ one I probably wouldn&#x27;t have liked this, however, we made the choice to go ahead and let her do it too.  She loves her new toothbrush and we no longer have to fight with our eldest about how long she has to brush because the timer is built in.  So the first week or so we stood by and reminded her which &amp;#34;quadrant&amp;#34; to switch to and that was that.  It took some getting used to because of how it felt on her gums; she wasn&#x27;t a big fan of the vibrations.  We let our youngest brush by herself and then we come behind her once a day and do it for her.  She does a pretty good job and at least she enjoys brushing now!  The timer increases which is great because if it would have started at 2 minutes both of them would have caught on and disliked it from the beginning...I can hear them saying &amp;#34;THIS TAKES FOREVER!!&amp;#34;  It also has two settings on the brush which, again, is perfect for our girls.  This has been a great investment and I&#x27;m hoping our trip to the dentist soon will be proof!</li>
            <li> Have been using this with our 3.5 year old upon dentists rec. good product, both parents use adult sonic are. Plays a little song which is helpful.</li>
            <li> It is always a struggle to get my daughter to brush her teeth. We thought this sonic care tooth brush would be the answer. The directions say that you need to keep on brushing until the chime goes off, which is 2 to 3 minutes total. Unfortunately my daughter doesn&#x27;t have the patience and doesn&#x27;t use the brush anymore. I have seen brushes that play music when the kids brush their teeth, so maybe that is the answer. The Sonic Care does the job, but its not kid friendly enough.</li>
            <li> Our kid now loves brushing teeth.</li>
            <li> As much of a pain as it is to get kids to brush their teeth, with the Sonicare for Kids they tell me they are going to brush their teeth.  It works great mainly because it does the work for them when they can&#x27;t effectively create little circular motions with a normal brush.</li>
            <li> I purchased this for my 6 year old granddaughter, &amp; she loves it!  It works well, &amp; is small enough to fit into a little mouth!  (More often than not, she has a big mouth!). She loves having her own &amp;#34;electric&amp;#34; toothbrush, &amp; willingly brushes regularly!  Great purchase!</li>
            <li> This took all the battle away from brushing long enough (been using for about a month).  It also seems to be doing a great job keeping his teeth clean.  The major difference between this and mine is that it has a more fun jingle that it plays every 30 seconds when it&#x27;s time to move to the next section of your mouth.  That actually makes a big difference for kids.</li>
            <li> I like this but it can be painful for kids losing baby teeth.  The vibration is too much for my daughter so I&#x27;ve had to put the toothbrush up for when she finishes losing the more sensitive teeth.</li>
            <li> Nice kids toothbrush, recommended by my son&#x27;s dentist. Battery lasts for very long time upon each charge. I like the kidPacer feature, but it seems a little bit faster than what I expected.</li>
            <li> My son has had it for 4 years. He uses it as a backup tootbrush, when his primary brush needs a charge.  It is still going strong.</li>
            <li> Does a great job of getting the kids teeth cleaned.  Only drawback is the vibration was difficult for my kids to get used too.  They would complain that it &amp;#34;tickled&amp;#34; too much and not want to brush.  The unit does have 2 settings though which allows for a lesser vibration to start with and makes it easier to transition into the high setting which works best for dental care.</li>
            <li> Even my kids, who are not great brushers, enjoy using it and say their teeth feel clean. The dentist check-up went well, this brush works.</li>
            <li> We had this toothbrush for just over a year for our kids, and it broke.  The metal shaft that the brush snaps down on came loose and the brush would not sit correctly.  This made the brush vibrate terribly and was unusable.  I contacted customer service and they said because I didn&#x27;t save my reciept there was nothing they could do.  What a waste of money!!! I will not be buying another one and urge others to think twice.</li>
            <li> We use the adult Sonicare so I assumed the kid&#x27;s version will have the same type of charger. Well, incorrect. You need to balance both the base and the toothbrush (top) on top of a short stick, and it drives me crazy. I have already dropped the toothbrush on the floor because I didn&#x27;t stick it in right. Very annoying. The toothbrush functions well and is exactly what I expected though.</li>
            <li> We purchased these toothbrushes for our 5 and 7 year old.  They are awesome.  We would always have to stand there and supervise the kids to make sure they brushed for long enough, but these brushes automatically go for either 1 minute or 2 mintues.  The kids liked that they could choose the color for the outside of their brush.  We have been using these for 6 months now and the battery life is great.</li>
            <li> Bought this for our Grandkids who were not getting good results from the Dentist. Kids like it but it tickles their teeth. Expect that to stop the more they use it.</li>
            <li> Kids look forward to using it. We found the slow ramp-up to 2 minutes of brushing helpful. The kids&#x27; teeth are visibly cleaner.</li>
            <li> We are a huge sonic care family.  I bout is for my daughters ages 6 and 9.  Other reviewers said theirs kids sonic care toothbrushes died after a few months.  I should have listened.  Ours died as well.  Disappointing.</li>
            <li> My kids now love brushing their teeth!  Brush for much longer too;). Great purchase.  It is well worth the price.</li>
            <li> This is a GREAT purchase! My kids, like most, do not brush long enough and I am not always hovering over them to make sure they do the full 2 minutes.......and quite honestly a manual toothbrush just is not as reliable and you can spend oodles every year on the $9 battery operated cheapies........do not hesitate, your kids will love them......it is an investment in your childs oral health.....</li>
            <li> Great tootbrush for my son.  He loved it.</li>
            <li> My son has acclimated to brushing with this toothbrush.  It took him a while to get used to this, but he is better off using this instead of a manual brush.  I am happy that he is getting his two minutes in every time he brushes.  Quality is so much better than the knock of brands I had previously purchased that broke within a month of purchase</li>
            <li> My youngest grand daughter loved this gift last Christmas. Was the one thing she really wanted.  Surprising a kid would be so thrilled over getting a tooth brush.</li>
            <li> Boys really like to use this electric toothbrush.  We use the lower speed for my 5 year and the faster speed for the 7 year old.</li>
            <li> Long battery life. Indicator noise/song lets you know when to switch brush areas. Very well made!</li>
            <li> My kid loves to brush his teeth. Great investement! The brushes are kind of expensive. However, my son values the tooth brush more, so he takes brushing teeth very serious now. It seems that we are saving the money at the dentist.</li>
            <li> We&#x27;ve had these brushes for a few years now and they have held up really well. I love the noise notification every 15 seconds. It helps me keep track of whether they&#x27;ve turned it off early or not. And it helps my kids remember to move the brush around to ALL their teeth. So far they have been cavity free using this brush, mouthwash and occasional flossing.</li>
            <li> Overall I like the toothbrush and how it has timed cycles to control her brushing.  My child (7 years old) likes it also.  The unfortunate thing about his unit is that it stopped working after 7 months.  From the comments I see I am not the only one.</li>
            <li> We are very pleased with this sonicare for our sin. It arrived quickly and it is better than expected! A thumbs up from us!</li>
            <li> We LOVE this toothbrush!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Our child is 9, and he had has this toothbrush for a year and a half.  He is not a very thorough brusher, but he has had no cavities so far.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The toothbrush has a timer which beeps every thirty seconds, letting him know after two minutes when it&#x27;s time to stop brushing.  It lasts about two weeks on a single charge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The downside: The base of the refillable brush gets a little...gunky.  It&#x27;s a good idea every once in a while to take off the refillable and rinse around the base of the metal bar.  Outside of that, perfect brush!</li>
            <li> Took our kids a while to get used to the power in the brush but they are now 5 and 8 and use these every time they brush.</li>
            <li> Very glad we purchased this. Our daughter uses it at least twice a day. The &amp;#34;timed tones&amp;#34; are a great addition to this product to signal when its time to move on to a different &amp;#34;quadrant&amp;#34;. We&#x27;ll be buying another one for our son when he&#x27;s ready!</li>
            <li> Getting the kids to brush is always a chore.  Mine are 3 and 6 and now they&#x27;re fighting over who gets to brush first.  The HX6311/02 comes with interchangeable plates the kids love switching and there&#x27;s a small little musical interlude between brushing the kids actually listen for as a cue to move onto the next quadrant of teeth brushing.  Great product...***CAVEAT*** replacement heads are pricey.</li>
            <li> i bought this for my 20 month old grandaughter and she won&#x27;t put it down.  very, very happy with it!!!!  it was a great bargain.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Sonicare brush for quite a few years. The old model is too mess to clean.  This kind is much easier to clean. I&#x27;m happy to buy this one for my kid and he loves it. Besides, the battery seems last longer.</li>
            <li> Best tooth brush ever for children.  It is worth every penny.  my dentist recommended this for my children and they love their tooth brushes.</li>
            <li> I feel like such a better mom with these toothbrushes now. I actually feel assured that my kids teeth are clean when I&#x27;m done brushing. The timer on it is great, no more singing the ABC&#x27;s and getting distracted and having to start over, LOL! My kids actually look forward to brushing their teeth now whereas before it was an everyday battle. I don&#x27;t know what magically changed, maybe it tickles, who knows, but whatever it is, I&#x27;m happy and it was money well spent. I got one for each child and I&#x27;m so happy I did. There are 2 heads, one for age 3+ and one for age 7+. If your children fall into those 2 different categories, then you can easily purchase only one as the heads come off easily and you can just switch the heads between brushing. My kids unfortunately are both under 7, so I bought 2,but like I said, it made brushing time easy and enjoyable, so I really don&#x27;t even care about the extra money. There are 3 different faceplates that it comes with that you can chose from so the kids get to personalize it a little too, which is kind of nice. I have no complaints about this toothbrush whatsoever.</li>
            <li> I wad not expecting a Philips product would fail in less than a year! The Oral-B for adults did not have problem for several years. Don&#x27;t know if they have kid&#x27;s type.</li>
            <li> This is a great product and is visually pleasing enough to encourage a four year old to use it on a regular basis.  Fantastic product!  Great merchant to buy from.</li>
            <li> My grandaughter hated brushing her teeth but with this she is brushing day and night. It was well worth it to see her enjoy brushing her teeth.</li>
            <li> My kids love these toothbrushes so we&#x27;re planning on buying two more for the other bathroom - this way, they can Sonicare either upstairs or downstairs.  Because of the timer, they also brush to the max time recommended, so there&#x27;s no cheating!  Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I love having this toothbrush for my kids! I have a 9yr old and a 4yr old who both use this toothbrush and it has been a life saver for my 9yr old. She was not good at manual brushing and as many times as I tried to teach her she just never did a very good job (whether is was due to lack of knowledge or laziness I don&#x27;t know :) This toothbrush has a timer and I MIGHT have neglected to show her how to turn the thing off early so it forces her to brush for the entire 2 minutes which is great! I have noticed a huge difference in how clean her teeth are and it frees me up a little because I don&#x27;t feel like I have to watch her as often. Obviously we still brush our 4yr olds teeth for him but he does do some himself and its just so much easier then trying to show them how manually. Our youngest was a little intimidated by the vibration (even when we activated the switch that decreased the intensity for 2 weeks) but he did eventually get over it and now lets us brush them without hesitation. Its a great buy, I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> The brush was working really well - but the brush heads started falling out of the body of the toothbrush. It is currently unusable. I have asked sonicare to fix/replace given that it is still under the 24 month warranty. I will update this after they resolve this....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: They replaced it for free!  It&#x27;s now working again!</li>
            <li> I bought this for my kids when it was time for them to start brushing in their own! I love that the timer beeps every time they should switch brushing spots! My kids love to use it also!! Great product!!</li>
            <li> I got tired of buying a electric toothbrush for my son every 2 months and this is great.  He&#x27;s loving it and feels like a grown up.</li>
            <li> My kids love brushing with this electric toothbrush. The beep telling them when to move to another area really does work</li>
            <li> For some kids, this toothbrush feels a little different at first and could be tough to get used to using over a standard toothbrush.  But once you get them used to it, the kids will love it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had used the Sonicare Flexcare for a while, and this model seemed to be the perfect model to try and get my kid to do a better job brushing teeth.  For a couple of months, it was ignored and sat in the closet, even though I was told \\&quot;I like it, I&#x27;m just not using it right now\\&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After I got my wife a Flexcare+ model, interest peaked and the brush was being used every night. My kid loves it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is a bit different than the Adult models, more simplified in functions, but does just as good a job as any other toothbrush in the Sonicare line.  The best part about the brush is that it keeps them bushing for the appropriate amount of time, and ends the brushing cycle with a gentle kid friendly tone (I kind of like it better than some of the adult models, which simply stops - no tone).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some may think this is a bit of an expense for a child, but the benefits outweigh the cost by far.  Our pediatric dentist visits have been met with great comments and enthusiasm.  \\&quot;The teeth look great!\\&quot; he says.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The heads, as with all toothbrushes will eventually wear and need replacement, and the cost is certainly a little bit more than a cheap toothbrush off the grocery store shelf.  But, you don&#x27;t get many chances to make mistakes with the few teeth you have, so developing good brushing habits can save my kid from pain and discomfort down the road.  A great investment.</li>
            <li> I like these for kids, but there is a &amp;#34;ramp up&amp;#34; feature for which I followed the instructions to turn off (so that it would immediately go to the 2-minute timer mode rather than &amp;#34;ramping up&amp;#34; to it), but it doesn&#x27;t work.  My kids has to restart the toothbrush after 1 minute to go another round.</li>
