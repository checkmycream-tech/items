            <li>This is amazing.</li>
            <li>This seems to work just as well on my DSAP and the price is amazing.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t had any skin irritations of any kind.</li>
            <li>I have used this product before and liked what it did for my skin.  </li>
            <li>that was not the surprise, after a gentle exfoliating and using a good serum and a good moisturizer with spf 30</li>
            <li>It is VERY, VERY strong so make sure you follow directions.  </li>
            <li>Also use it on the top of my hands for those pesky brown spots from years of sun.</li>
            <li>make sure you follow the directions</li>
            <li>I will def order more.</li>
            <li>I just love what was happening to my skin and at this price compared to what prescription would cost for this</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s better to use together with your moisturizer.  </li>
            <li>It does what it claims and more.  </li>
            <li>I love this cream.</li>
            <li>My skin feels and looks much better, ..</li>
            <li>bought this from Better Complexions via Amazon thinking</li>
            <li>I kept reading \\&quot;it&#x27;s working because my skin is peeling and tingling\\&quot; over and over but that just made me more worried.  </li>
            <li>truly recommend this product, I am here ordering some more ,</li>
            <li>It is not as strong as the prescribed</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s fine.  </li>
            <li>and you will be wrinkle free..</li>
            <li>we were pleasantly surprised at how good it all looked.</li>
            <li>Works good helps me with adult acne...</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never been so excited like this.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not even a month yet and am seeing gradual and significant effects.  </li>
            <li>I wrote back (once again, using their online form) and asked when they were planning on addressing my original email and surprisingly, they didn&#x27;t respond again!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>After that I use alcohol free toner to calm the skin.</li>
            <li>So I wrote to Better Complexions using their website contact page and asked how they could sell this product legally.  </li>
            <li>its working pretty great for me.just follow the directions carefully and you&#x27;ll get great results.my mild millia is going away too,I&#x27;m only using it for a month</li>
            <li>retinA but much better, has the same effects but in a more mild manner.  </li>
            <li>It is very strong so if you have sensitive skin proceed with caution.</li>
            <li>I would still purchase from this sell though it as a fast and easy transaction.</li>
            <li>but like it MUCH better with the cream which offers some hydration.</li>
            <li>, I got my money&#x27;s worth and then some, plus.  </li>
            <li>This is so powerful stronger (than the 0.05%)</li>
            <li>This relatively inexpensive cream has done a nice job of exfoliating.</li>
            <li>It does smooth skin and take away blemishes, but apparently it was either too strong for me</li>
            <li>Over time how ever it became less effective, but to those just starting out this product is good for the face.</li>
            <li>It is very strong, so use VERY mildly, especially around the eye area.</li>
            <li>it was smooth, clear, and glowing.</li>
            <li>Great product, works very well and only need to use a tiny bit.  </li>
            <li>opened the product, smelled it and put the top back on the jar and read the reviews here on Amazon.  </li>
            <li>If you think more is better you could wake up with burned skin that is dry, red and itchy.</li>
            <li>U one have to use a small size and follow up with a good moisturizer with SPF.</li>
            <li>Stay away from the sun as much while using this or any retinol product &amp; would recommend Winter time (less sun) as a better time of the year to start on it, a weekend perhaps, so you skin has time to recover!</li>
            <li>If you use the cream sparingly, you start to notice your skin flaking...which stimulates new growth of fresh cells.</li>
            <li>It would help if they sent detailed instructions along with the product, especially since it is such a strong dose.</li>
            <li>much too harsh.&lt;br /&gt;thanks</li>
            <li>This was a lot thicker than I thought it would be it made my face really oily when I used it.</li>
            <li>I used to use straight Retinol</li>
            <li>and my face looks way clearer and tight.im using baby lotion as a moisturizer during the day because its very hypo allergenic and it lessen the burning feeling.</li>
            <li>I won&#x27;t really do much on the body though.</li>
            <li>And then some almond oil with a drop of orange essential oil to keep my skin moist and smooth.</li>
            <li>Be gentle to your skin when using this cream.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Making me very unhappy.&lt;br</li>
            <li>no acne at all for the whole time</li>
            <li>but they told me they were \\&quot;escalating\\&quot; the inquiry and getting their legal department to look at this.  </li>
            <li>This product works well with the Obagi line and the price is reasonable.  </li>
            <li>you start seeing the difference with time, nicer looking skin and my spots much lighter,&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Your skin WILL flake &amp; shed in sensitive areas for the first week,</li>
            <li>I love this cream, have used RetinA for years, but recently ran out, rather than go back to derm for refill decided to try this cream.  </li>
            <li>I experience my skin was actually pulsating, tingleling, super tightening, peeling scaling etc.</li>
            <li>This was my very first Retinol product, and I definitely did the job on my face and neck.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this.</li>
            <li>I will highly recommend it to anybody with severe acne problems.</li>
            <li>under the dead skin was very smooth and clear skin.</li>
            <li>I purchased this product about a month ago knowing that as I live in the US, I had to have a prescription to purchase this</li>
            <li>I would not waste my money and beware!</li>
            <li>But this one is WOW!</li>
            <li>cream makes your skin red and tender to the touch the first month, and peels every 3-4 days&lt;br /&gt;but</li>
            <li>It has the smell of old cream.</li>
            <li>I could not continue using because my skin is sensitive.</li>
            <li>If you don&#x27;t have sensitive skin I would recommend this product because it does what it claims.</li>
            <li>They seemed really laid back about this</li>
            <li>Please... do not waste your money on this...</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t use it everyday, maybe if the smell is better I will use it daily!</li>
            <li>Be sure to use it every few days, and only a pea sized amount.</li>
            <li>This product is illegal to be sold in the U.S. without a prescription, for good reason.  </li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m already seeing a major difference in my skin.</li>
            <li>first for milia cysts and the acne and dark spots were also in my criteria for buying it.  </li>
            <li>It only took two applications to completely ruin the skin under my eyes.</li>
            <li>I did have some mild redness and dryness in the surrounding areas, but nothing a little moisturizer didn&#x27;t fix!</li>

            <li> This product is illegal to be sold in the U.S. without a prescription, for good reason.  </li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m already seeing a major difference in my skin.</li>
            <li> first for milia cysts and the acne and dark spots were also in my criteria for buying it.  </li>
            <li> It only took two applications to completely ruin the skin under my eyes.</li>
            <li> I did have some mild redness and dryness in the surrounding areas, but nothing a little moisturizer didn&#x27;t fix!</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve had a hyperpigmintation spot on my left cheek for a long time.</li>
            <li> Use a gentle cleanser when cleaning your face and above all DON&#x27;T rub to hard.  </li>
            <li> use it with other skin products so your face/neck do not completely dry out</li>
            <li> Go gently when using the cream, don&#x27;t rub to hard when washing your face.  </li>
            <li> As the product says and everyone knows, one needs to use it at least six months to really know if it is working or not.</li>
            <li> bought this for my daughter who has minor acne.</li>
            <li> My skin is too sensitive for me to use it everyday, but I use it 2-3 times a week and my complexion has improved.</li>
            <li> The little milia are barely noticeable, the sun spots have lightened, and my face feels softer.</li>
            <li> Product was not sealed and found a SHORT DARK HAIR in cream.. who knows what else is in this &#x27;cream&#x27; ..</li>
            <li> Most health insurances no longer cover the expense of retin which makes it very expensive</li>
            <li> I had red blotchy raw spots all over my face for several days.  </li>
            <li> the first few applications did result in some peeling around my chin and nose, but that was slight and stopped after a few days.</li>
            <li> after 3 days her skin got very dry and started to tighten.</li>
            <li> all hell broke loose!</li>
            <li> Check back in a few months.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Follow a few basic rules when using this cream</li>
            <li> Literally, it left my face raw everywhere</li>
            <li> Just be careful!</li>
            <li> I have found that washing my face before bed, and using the cream every other night SPARINGLY, gives my skin a youthful look.</li>
            <li> I kid you not, you only need a small pea size</li>
            <li> Bought it for my teenage niece who has been fighting acne for over four years ,  after using it for four weeks there is no more acne or black spots.</li>
            <li> It helped with dark spots and enlarged pores.  </li>
            <li> Anyway I was searching for things to get rid of dark spots in the bikini area and I ran across this product.</li>
            <li> I have red/purple bags under my eyes that cannot even be hidden with makeup</li>
            <li> I was careful to apply a small amount and wash my hands after use.  </li>
            <li> It caused my skin to peel but after a few days of peeling, the skin underneath was lighter smoother and clearer.</li>
            <li> We used it twice and waited a few days to see how her skin would react to it.</li>
            <li> i told her to wash her face and remove the dead skin.</li>
            <li> are a few hints to help you if you do decide to try it.  </li>
            <li> I moisturnot order this item again,  too costly and very harsh.  </li>
            <li> I have bought all kinds of Retinol creams for pigmentation from occasional breakouts, I&#x27;ve hated them all so far.</li>
            <li> Seriously, I can smear a harsh floor cleaner all over my face and it will tingle and peel</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t let the negative comments stop you from trying it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Despite all of the negative reviews, I decided to give this product a chance.</li>
            <li> It is slowly peeling my skin.</li>
            <li> The wrinkles on my face are slowly disappearing.</li>
            <li> but that doesn&#x27;t mean it&#x27;s Tretinoin (Retin-A.)  </li>
            <li> The jar is very small comparing to the size showing on the picture.</li>
            <li> It can seriously damage your skin.  </li>
            <li> As it is your skin is going to turn red and peel as if you&#x27;ve gotten a bad sunburn.</li>
            <li> I used a washcloth and paid the price with some red, painful patches.</li>
            <li> I have terrible dark spot left over from ingrown hairs.</li>
            <li> DONT WASTE YOUR MONEY HERE.!!!</li>
            <li> But this product is still listed for sale on their website and some law is being broken</li>
            <li> It is greasy and make my face break out very badly, I apply it at a small pimple, next day the pimple become (two not one) very big horrible thing.</li>
            <li> i have purchased this item twice already - unbelievable!!!</li>
            <li> needless to say, panic set in, and we stopped.</li>
            <li> and you can&#x27;t go wrong.</li>
            <li> This product is difficult for me to rate.  </li>
            <li> The cream is evil, package and quality also can&#x27;t worst more, i will not buy it again</li>
            <li> Were they selling Tretinoin to me a US citizen illegally or was the product not legitimate?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I applied a very thin amount over mousturizer</li>
            <li> on the 4th day which was a Sunday, I started to notice her skin peeling and flaking really bad.</li>
            <li> had used everything out there that claimed to erase brown spots, but nothing else worked :(.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It is awful and could even be considered dangerous.  </li>
            <li> Painful spots too!</li>
            <li> This cream is horrible.  </li>
            <li> The itch was horrible.  </li>
            <li> I like it and it works, but the days of peeling are quite awful.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

            <li> This is amazing. I was battling melasma after my pregnancy and came across this product and was amazed at the results. It is very strong so if you have sensitive skin proceed with caution. It caused my skin to peel but after a few days of peeling, the skin underneath was lighter smoother and clearer.</li>
            <li> This product is illegal to be sold in the U.S. without a prescription, for good reason.  It can seriously damage your skin.  I have filed a report against the seller for selling prescription products without a license.  My wife ordered this product not realising it was a prescription product REPACKAGED in a generic jar.  It caused SEVERE redness, burning and peeling.</li>
            <li> I moisturnot order this item again,  too costly and very harsh.  I applied a very thin amount over mousturizer and I peeled for a week.  much too harsh.&lt;br /&gt;thanks you for asking.</li>
            <li> bought this for my daughter who has minor acne. We used it twice and waited a few days to see how her skin would react to it. after 3 days her skin got very dry and started to tighten. needless to say, panic set in, and we stopped. we made an appointment for the dermatologist, and just kept using regular skin lotion while we waited. on the 4th day which was a Sunday, I started to notice her skin peeling and flaking really bad. under the dead skin was very smooth and clear skin. i told her to wash her face and remove the dead skin. i could not believe the texture and smoothness of her skin after the wash. it was smooth, clear, and glowing. we were pleasantly surprised at how good it all looked. We cancelled the derm...Appointment. word of advice to anyone who buys this. just follow our accidental instructions and you can&#x27;t go wrong. GOOD LUCK</li>
            <li> This was a lot thicker than I thought it would be it made my face really oily when I used it. guess it just was not for my skin type. I would still purchase from this sell though it as a fast and easy transaction.</li>
            <li> This cream is horrible.  I bought it for several reasons.....first for milia cysts and the acne and dark spots were also in my criteria for buying it.  It did nothing for any of those things.  You want to know what it did do?  It burned my face!  Literally, it left my face raw everywhere I used it.  I ended up having to go to the doctor for it. I had red blotchy raw spots all over my face for several days.  Painful spots too! It is awful and could even be considered dangerous.  I contacted the seller and they were no help.  I would not waste my money and beware!</li>
            <li> I was hoping that the cream would get rid of my spots and brighten my skin but it did not</li>
            <li> I have used Retinol 1% off and on over the years and very happy I did. My generation ( in my 60s) loved an &amp;#34;ivory&amp;#34; complexion. If you use the cream sparingly, you start to notice your skin flaking...which stimulates new growth of fresh cells. Just be careful! If you think more is better you could wake up with burned skin that is dry, red and itchy. I used to use straight Retinol but like it MUCH better with the cream which offers some hydration. I have found that washing my face before bed, and using the cream every other night SPARINGLY, gives my skin a youthful look. Also use it on the top of my hands for those pesky brown spots from years of sun. &amp;#34;forever young&amp;#34; (as best I can be)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried buying this at the Pharmacy and it is $80 a tube! This seems to work just as well on my DSAP and the price is amazing. I will order this again for sure! A big savings.</li>
            <li> Awesome!!  Thank you.  Great product, works very well and only need to use a tiny bit.  I highly recommend this.</li>
            <li> Check back in a few months.</li>
            <li> It is slowly peeling my skin. I haven&#x27;t had any skin irritations of any kind. Definitely moisturize your skin while using this or you might get itchy from the skin peeling.</li>
            <li> it is a good product-especially for the price. use it with other skin products so your face/neck do not completely dry out</li>
            <li> its working pretty great for me.just follow the directions carefully and you&#x27;ll get great results.my mild millia is going away too,I&#x27;m only using it for a month and my face looks way clearer and tight.im using baby lotion as a moisturizer during the day because its very hypo allergenic and it lessen the burning feeling. I&#x27;m so happy I tried it.</li>
            <li> only used one time so at this time don,t know</li>
            <li> I got the cream about 3 weeks ago. I start using it on the first day, the smell of the cream is not refreshing at all. It has the smell of old cream. The jar is very small comparing to the size showing on the picture. I used it about 3 times each week but honestly didn&#x27;t see any difference !!&lt;br /&gt;Because of its smell I don&#x27;t use it everyday, maybe if the smell is better I will use it daily!</li>
            <li> i have purchased this item twice already - unbelievable!!! make sure you follow the directions and you will be wrinkle free..</li>
            <li> This was my very first Retinol product, and I definitely did the job on my face and neck. Over time how ever it became less effective, but to those just starting out this product is good for the face. I won&#x27;t really do much on the body though.</li>
            <li> I have bought all kinds of Retinol creams for pigmentation from occasional breakouts, I&#x27;ve hated them all so far. Either they did nothing or then made my skin red and break out like all hell broke loose! But this one is WOW! Been using it for 4 weeks now!&lt;br /&gt;How I use it:&lt;br /&gt;OK so you have to use it ever second day to (in my trial &amp; error experience), a very tiny amount that too. I use it at night only. Your skin WILL flake &amp; shed in sensitive areas for the first week, yes ouch, but don&#x27;t peel it please. I did, and then I realized I just needed to buff it in the shower (I use Clarisonic Mia). After that I use alcohol free toner to calm the skin. And then some almond oil with a drop of orange essential oil to keep my skin moist and smooth. My skin has stopped flaking and it&#x27;s clearing up everyday.&lt;br /&gt;Hope this helps, it&#x27;s helping me big time!&lt;br /&gt;PS: Stay away from the sun as much while using this or any retinol product &amp; would recommend Winter time (less sun) as a better time of the year to start on it, a weekend perhaps, so you skin has time to recover!</li>
            <li> I love this cream, have used RetinA for years, but recently ran out, rather than go back to derm for refill decided to try this cream.  It is not as strong as the prescribed retinA but much better, has the same effects but in a more mild manner.  I will def order more.</li>
            <li> I have used this product before and liked what it did for my skin.  It helped with dark spots and enlarged pores.  Will use again.</li>
            <li> It works splendidly. My skin is too sensitive for me to use it everyday, but I use it 2-3 times a week and my complexion has improved.</li>
            <li> they are not kidding when they say, &amp;#34; it&#x27;s the strongest 1% Retinol A Cream&amp;#34;.  Knowing what to expect and was well prepared and arm for defense I experience my skin was actually pulsating, tingleling, super tightening, peeling scaling etc. that was not the surprise, after a gentle exfoliating and using a good serum and a good moisturizer with spf 30 I wonder why  did I not start sooner.  Even my daughter notice a change and this morning did it for me I just love what was happening to my skin and at this price compared to what prescription would cost for this, I got my money&#x27;s worth and then some, plus.  I kid you not, you only need a small pea size but it&#x27;s better to use together with your moisturizer.  This is so powerful stronger (than the 0.05%) and you have to ease in and alternate till you can work it daily.  I&#x27;ve never been so excited like this.  It&#x27;s not even a month yet and am seeing gradual and significant effects.  Remember that everyone is not the same and will vary but it is said you have to stick with it to reap the benefits. Do your research, expect, stay and stick with it.  JUST LOVE IT!</li>
            <li> Product was not sealed and found a SHORT DARK HAIR in cream.. who knows what else is in this &#x27;cream&#x27; ..DONT WASTE YOUR MONEY HERE.!!!</li>
            <li> I am so happy I have found this product.  It truly works.  The wrinkles on my face are slowly disappearing.</li>
            <li> It is very strong, so use VERY mildly, especially around the eye area. I used it for about a week and two stubborn Milia were gone.  I did have some mild redness and dryness in the surrounding areas, but nothing a little moisturizer didn&#x27;t fix! I recommend, but use sparingly!</li>
            <li> This relatively inexpensive cream has done a nice job of exfoliating. The little milia are barely noticeable, the sun spots have lightened, and my face feels softer. the first few applications did result in some peeling around my chin and nose, but that was slight and stopped after a few days.</li>
            <li> very good product, does what it says.</li>
            <li> This cream works.  It does what it claims and more.  Don&#x27;t let the negative comments stop you from trying it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here are a few hints to help you if you do decide to try it.  Go gently when using the cream, don&#x27;t rub to hard when washing your face.  As it is your skin is going to turn red and peel as if you&#x27;ve gotten a bad sunburn. Use a gentle cleanser when cleaning your face and above all DON&#x27;T rub to hard.  I can&#x27;t stress this enough.  I used a washcloth and paid the price with some red, painful patches. Be gentle to your skin when using this cream.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve had a hyperpigmintation spot on my left cheek for a long time. I&#x27;ve tried everything to rid myself of this troublesome spot.  Some products lightened it alittle but nothing else.  I even went to the Doctor who gave me some stuff to try and all it did was make the spot spread. Making me very unhappy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; This cream has not only lightened it, it&#x27;s actually started breaking it up.  My sister (who is also using the cream) and I have noticed that if the hyperpigmintation has been on your skin for a while the cream takes longer to work on it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Follow a few basic rules when using this cream and you&#x27;ll be very pleased with the results. I am. (0:</li>
            <li> This product seem to work!! It is VERY, VERY strong so make sure you follow directions.  I could not continue using because my skin is sensitive.</li>
            <li> This product is difficult for me to rate.  It does smooth skin and take away blemishes, but apparently it was either too strong for me or  I was allergic to it.  I only used this product on my chin and around my mouth.  I was careful to apply a small amount and wash my hands after use.  Several days after the initial use my chest and neck broke out in a rash of tiny red spots.  The itch was horrible.  I doubled my daily dose of allergy medication and used cortisone cream several times a day until the rash healed.  I did experience the burning and peeling on my face and the results were excellent.  If you don&#x27;t have sensitive skin I would recommend this product because it does what it claims.</li>
            <li> It is greasy and make my face break out very badly, I apply it at a small pimple, next day the pimple become (two not one) very big horrible thing. The cream is evil, package and quality also can&#x27;t worst more, i will not buy it again</li>
            <li> It would help if they sent detailed instructions along with the product, especially since it is such a strong dose. I like it and it works, but the days of peeling are quite awful. Be sure to use it every few days, and only a pea sized amount.</li>
            <li> Have anyone ever used this product on there bikini area? I have terrible dark spot left over from ingrown hairs. It&#x27;s quite embarrassing. I can&#x27;t even wear a bathing suit or shorts for that matter. Anyway I was searching for things to get rid of dark spots in the bikini area and I ran across this product. Does anyone have any knowledge pertaining to this issue?</li>
            <li> I love this cream. Bought it for my teenage niece who has been fighting acne for over four years ,  after using it for four weeks there is no more acne or black spots. I will highly recommend it to anybody with severe acne problems.</li>
            <li> As the product says and everyone knows, one needs to use it at least six months to really know if it is working or not. I have used for about six weeks and looks like it is working. Do not be fooled by the size of the container, inside is a lot smaller.</li>
            <li> no acne at all for the whole time I used it. Hope to get it again!!!!</li>
            <li> Works good helps me with adult acne... My skin feels and looks much better, .. i have some skin problems and this works welll for me ..</li>
            <li> I purchased this product about a month ago knowing that as I live in the US, I had to have a prescription to purchase this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had bought it before from Canadian online pharmacies because in Canada, Tretinoin is an over the counter drug--no prescription required.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought this from Better Complexions via Amazon thinking this was a Canadian pharmacy operating through Amazon as one of their outside vendors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When the product arrived, I saw that the return label was from Oregon, not Canada and my antenna went up.  I know this prescription drug cannot be sold in the US without a prescription and yet here I was receiving it?  Were they selling Tretinoin to me a US citizen illegally or was the product not legitimate?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I opened the product, smelled it and put the top back on the jar and read the reviews here on Amazon.  I kept reading \\&quot;it&#x27;s working because my skin is peeling and tingling\\&quot; over and over but that just made me more worried.  Seriously, I can smear a harsh floor cleaner all over my face and it will tingle and peel but that doesn&#x27;t mean it&#x27;s Tretinoin (Retin-A.)  So I wrote to Better Complexions using their website contact page and asked how they could sell this product legally.  They ignored my inquiry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Next, I contacted Amazon via online chat and told them my tale.  They seemed really laid back about this but they told me they were \\&quot;escalating\\&quot; the inquiry and getting their legal department to look at this.  They suggested I file the A-Z refund request.  I decided that before doing that I would once again contact the company and ask for a refund.  They did reply almost immediately to this request and stated that as I&#x27;d opened the container they wouldn&#x27;t refund my money.  I wrote back (once again, using their online form) and asked when they were planning on addressing my original email and surprisingly, they didn&#x27;t respond again!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ten days passed and I checked the Amazon site to see if theescalated situation had resulted in this product being pulled from sale.  It was still here.  I once again chatted with them and they said it was still being processed but that I should apply for the A-Z refund.  I did and the next day Amazon refunded my money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Approximately another 10 days have passed and this product is still for sale.  When I last spoke with Amazon they said that even when they finished their inquiry they wouldn&#x27;t tell me the results as that information was proprietary.  That&#x27;s fine.  And I don&#x27;t know if they have finished their investigation yet or not.  But this product is still listed for sale on their website and some law is being broken and I&#x27;ve gotten no explanation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would just say that if you purchase this product be prepared that you are taking it on faith that the \\&quot;Retin-A\\&quot; they are hawking is the legitimate product.  You have no way of proving if it is.</li>
            <li> This product works well with the Obagi line and the price is reasonable.  Divine Order is the ideal merchant to purchase all products for your skin care needs.  I had a problem and Divine Order resolved the matter and I received the retinol and all is well.  I will continue to order from Divine Order in the future.</li>
            <li> Despite all of the negative reviews, I decided to give this product a chance. I truly regret that decision. It only took two applications to completely ruin the skin under my eyes. I have red/purple bags under my eyes that cannot even be hidden with makeup and it&#x27;s CONSTANTLY burning. Please... do not waste your money on this...</li>
            <li> I just received it two days ago and I&#x27;m already seeing a major difference in my skin. I love it! U one have to use a small size and follow up with a good moisturizer with SPF. Reminds me of the prescribed retin a or another prescribed retinol called tazorac. Most health insurances no longer cover the expense of retin which makes it very expensive but I&#x27;m happy I found this product. I&#x27;ll always use it every night</li>
            <li> I have been using it for a couple of months,&lt;br /&gt;my melasma( brown spots) in my face is finally disappearing,&lt;br /&gt;I had used everything out there that claimed to erase brown spots, but nothing else worked :(.&lt;br /&gt;This cream makes your skin red and tender to the touch the first month, and peels every 3-4 days&lt;br /&gt;but you start seeing the difference with time, nicer looking skin and my spots much lighter,&lt;br /&gt;I truly recommend this product, I am here ordering some more ,</li>
