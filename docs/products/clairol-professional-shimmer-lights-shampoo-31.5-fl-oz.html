            <li>The shampoo is very good.</li>
            <li>This is simply great shampoo, and the best part is it&#x27;s cheaper on amazon</li>
            <li>The packaging that it was sent in wasn&#x27;t ideal</li>
            <li>I loved this!</li>
            <li>Smells good!</li>
            <li>you want silver highlights, this product is definitely a good one!  </li>
            <li>Smells good &amp; lathers wonderfully!</li>
            <li>My hair is so beautiful now.  </li>
            <li>Keeps my 5th best feature looking good</li>
            <li>I always get compliments on how shiny and beautiful my hair looks.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It gave her beautiful silver highlights -</li>
            <li>I have used this shampoo for years with great results.</li>
            <li>Great value and great shampoo.</li>
            <li>I prefer the Loreal version of this, but the Clairol version is still a great product..</li>
            <li>Smells great, and works to tone my hair.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a great deal</li>
            <li>This shampoo is great for highlighting and excentuating the gray hair that I no longer can fight.  </li>
            <li>I am so happy I had this on hand.</li>
            <li>Using this shampoo twice a week keeps my hair looking great.  </li>
            <li>Works great at keeping the brass away but is rather drying to the hair.</li>
            <li>product works great to remove that &amp;#34;brashy&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>This is a great shampoo for gray hair but this bottle arrived with a non-working pump.  </li>
            <li>The smell is not the best, kind of reminds me of walking through the perfume counter at a department store but it does not linger after the shampoo is washed out, after conditioning I can not even smell it anymore.</li>
            <li>I found a great deal on it from Amazon.  </li>
            <li>Takes out the Orange pigment, highlights look great-</li>
            <li>great product..  </li>
            <li>But this does a great job with &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>This works great.  </li>
            <li>I will probably never stop using this stuff lol</li>
            <li>Shampoo is great but packaging exploded in the mail and product was all over the place.  </li>
            <li>Thought I&#x27;d give this shampoo because it got great ratings, plus it was the cheapest for the size youu get.</li>
            <li>But my hair does feel silky and great color to my hair.</li>
            <li>Great shampoo.</li>
            <li>Great shampoo for a great value.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s amazing!</li>
            <li>I was so happy to find this for my Son &amp; at a good price.</li>
            <li>IT LATHERS GREAT&#x27; SMELLS GOOD AND PROVIDES SOME CONDITIONING,</li>
            <li>Now I just need to bleach my roots :p</li>
            <li>Amazon prices are much cheaper, it came packaged perfectly, and the price was excellent.</li>
            <li>Great shampoo that I&#x27;ve used for many years!  </li>
            <li>For whatever reasons the top wasn&#x27;t on it very good and some of it leaked out into the packaging.  </li>
            <li>It is bright purple in color.  </li>
            <li>Did not need to redo my hair for a while, while using this shampoo and it kept my highlights bright for months.</li>
            <li>sometimes people do notice a purple cast but in a good way.</li>
            <li>It arrived on time and in good condition.</li>
            <li>It was shimmering white--and gorgeous.  </li>
            <li>so buy this shampoo and get a good conditioner</li>
            <li>lather &amp; good smell.  </li>
            <li>Good price also</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s a good product.  </li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re a guy that doesn&#x27;t like to die your hair (have you ever seen a guy with good looking dyed gray hair?</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s no longer a good deal.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve heard good things about this product, but I just got it this evening and 1/4 of it was ALL over the bag -</li>
            <li>Good value</li>
            <li>It smells like beauty salons, and not in a good way.</li>
            <li>This product makes my gray hair look good but...</li>
            <li>I use it about once a week leaving it on for 2-3 minutes, and conditioning with a good conditioner after (I haven&#x27;t used the matching conditioner).  </li>
            <li>good product but the bottle opened during transit and about 1/3 of it emptied out inside the box.  </li>
            <li>Good thing they sealed the conditioner in the bag</li>
            <li>and you&#x27;re good to go.</li>
            <li>Using them together is definitely a good idea.  </li>
            <li>Both of those work beautifully, leaving glossy hair with plenty of silver shine and a light, pleasant scent.</li>
            <li>Excellent product and economical in this size and from Amazon.</li>
            <li>Recommended by my hair stylist and I am very pleased.</li>
            <li>This is a product I have purchased before and am very pleased with it.  </li>
            <li>It is ok, not too great.</li>
            <li>Love this product!</li>
            <li>Love this stuff!</li>
            <li>This sure did the trick!  </li>
            <li>So glad I did!  </li>
            <li>This has made my transition so much better!</li>
            <li>Love this stuff!</li>
            <li>Love the pump!</li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>I tried it, I love it, and I&#x27;m sticking with it!</li>
            <li>I LOVE THIS STUFF!</li>
            <li>Love this shampoo!</li>
            <li>Love it!</li>

            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>Great product for a super price!</li>
            <li>This product works amazing.</li>
            <li>It is amazing.  </li>
            <li>, it is of great quality for being so cheap.</li>
            <li>Really nice product.</li>
            <li>Brightens up my silver hair and gives it nice body.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used many shampoos to keep my gray hair looking good.</li>
            <li>This shampoo keeps it from yellowing and gives it a nice shine.</li>
            <li>nice size</li>
            <li>Lathers up nicely, doesn&#x27;t stain my shower walls or floor.</li>
            <li>Nice toner.helps keep the brassy away.</li>
            <li>and it is a nice shampoo as well ...</li>
            <li>Nice lathering shampoo.  </li>
            <li>I was thrilled to find out I could order it through Amazon.</li>
            <li>Nice shampoo - gives blond/grey hair a nice shimmer</li>
            <li>do not use this on the ends of my hair, they turn kind of gray if i do.</li>
            <li>i couldn&#x27;t find a product i liked.  </li>
            <li>Nice shampoo that lasts.</li>
            <li>It really does help my hair color to keep their lighter tones longer, and even helps those silver streaks look their very best.</li>
            <li>I already have highlights in my hair, and this product enhanced my hair so nice</li>
            <li>It is great for highlights and full color.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>My hairdresser suggested this product, it really works great at keeping highlights bright.  </li>
            <li>The prices for those are better and, while I don&#x27;t love the scents (one smells somewhat of grape bubblegum!)</li>
            <li>make sure to get a really nice smelling conditioner</li>
            <li>It is excellent to use in keeping the cleanliness and color of the natural gray color of my hair and beard.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s an okay shampoo, but honestly I don&#x27;t see any changes in my hair color, the bronze is still there</li>
            <li>This by far is the cheapest and best shampoo!</li>
            <li>gives good shine and hair is clean in one application</li>
            <li>I have only used this shampoo once, it smells really great &amp; brought the highlights out very nicely.</li>
            <li>I am so glad that i can easily find it on Amazon!</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;d rather have a  very light lavender streak here</li>
            <li>and I got to the point of a very light tangerine color</li>
            <li>The smell is so strong it cancels out your own perfume.</li>
            <li>This shampoo worked great for taking the brassiness out of my blonde hair, but to me, the smell just wasn&#x27;t pleasant.</li>
            <li>Additionally, I ordered 3 huge bottles of it!  </li>
            <li>Works like magic.</li>
            <li>Make sure you leave the lather in for 5 minutes</li>
            <li>Keeps the brassy away and my color continues to look fresh and bright.</li>
            <li>especially if u blowdry it after wards... smells great also!</li>
            <li>I love the robo aid.  </li>
            <li>I just wish it smelled better.</li>
            <li>so I bought the biggest bottle I could :)</li>
            <li>I absolutely love it.</li>
            <li>although it says that it is a conditioning shampoo, I feel like it dries my hair out even more</li>
            <li>Be sure to read the instructions about leaving it on for 3-5 minutes.  </li>
            <li>My recommendation would be to not wash more than once a week if you already have dryer, damaged hair.  </li>
            <li>Once I got into a normal routine of once a week, it worked beautifully.  </li>
            <li>Smells great and cleans really well.</li>
            <li>, I like them better than the Clairol.</li>
            <li>Love this shampoo.</li>
            <li>Love this shampoo.</li>
            <li>Have been using this shampoo for 3 years now (as recommended by my stylist) - keeps my highlights in shape, not drying - lovely.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s a bit better.</li>
            <li>This awesome shampoo lightened my dyed blonde hair in one washing.  </li>
            <li>Leaves my hair feeling silky smooth!</li>
            <li>This stuff is phenomenal.</li>
            <li>Awesome to lighten/whiten blonde highlights!</li>
            <li>Pleased and will order again.</li>
            <li>I ordered it from Amazon and absolutely LOVE it.  </li>
            <li>My hair is even more managable - not so stubborn.</li>
            <li>I have had many, many compliments on my hair since using the shampoo.</li>
            <li>OK for removing brassiness.  </li>
            <li>I have been purchased many goods through amazon.com</li>
            <li>becareful and make sure you rinse your shower floor and tiles if it gets anywhere on them, it does tend to stain.&lt;br /&gt;Oh</li>
            <li>Love the way it turns my gray to silver.  </li>
            <li>I love this product.  </li>
            <li>the more gray</li>
            <li>I like the one from AG beauty a lot better.</li>
            <li>A better system needs to be found, so many reviews about spilled contents with this product.</li>
            <li>Love this stuff.</li>
            <li>but I prefer this one better</li>
            <li>I ended up leaving it for about 40 minutes, may be more.</li>
            <li>Works okay, just not a quality product.</li>
            <li>I love this product and have used it for sometime.  </li>
            <li>Not only did this product help, it gave my hair the beautiful ash blond I was going for!</li>
            <li>so make sure to wipe it off if it leaks anywhere</li>
            <li>Just make sure to not use it EVERY day for you hair will turn grayish/purple.</li>
            <li>I love this shampoo.</li>
            <li>Love this shampoo for gray or brassy hair.  </li>
            <li>My favorite shampoo to brighten my greying hair.  </li>
            <li>I really love this conditioner.</li>
            <li>I love the smell and the feel of the conditioner in my hair once it&#x27;s washed out.</li>
            <li>and I was glad that it made it safely to delivery.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t leave in more then 1 minute</li>
            <li>I love this product however-</li>
            <li>And I found a better deal all the way around.</li>
            <li>her salon sells Kevin Murphy products which i love.</li>
            <li>and it helps to her silver hair to look better.</li>
            <li>Love this shampoo.</li>
            <li>it,love it, love it</li>
            <li>The pump top is convenient.  </li>
            <li>Im very excited to buy this but received damage;(</li>
            <li>NIce and rich and works at taking all of that brassiness out of your hair.</li>
            <li>super favorite thing about this Shampoo?&lt;br /&gt;The smell!</li>
            <li>Best Shampoo for grey hair&lt;</li>
            <li>Not to mention the rich lather it provides!</li>
            <li>Amazing product and helps maintain a great blonde color.</li>
            <li>plus I had to clean it up!</li>
            <li>I have purchase other brand purple shampoos and this is the best because the shampoo is stronger and works better.</li>
            <li>Decent shampoo, ok &amp;#34;toner&amp;#34; but not as good as the matching conditioner.  </li>
            <li>When you dispense using the convenient pump, hold your hand there and wipe your fingers over the spout to get rid of drips...and wipe up any drips as soon as you are able to avoid a light staining that eventually wears away.</li>
            <li>..NEED TO MAKE SURE LID IS SECURE BEFORE MAILING..</li>
            <li>stylist told me &amp;#34;this shampoo does not coat your hair, like most cheap shampoos&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>Because of the good price and easy Prime shipping, I really wanted this to work.</li>
            <li>This shampoo works great keeping my very light blonde hair from getting too bronze.  </li>
            <li>Shimmer lights is my secret weapon for keeping my platinum bright and beautiful!</li>
            <li>Easy to rinse out.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t love the design and the hassle of clean up</li>
            <li>It is purple in color, but washes off tub easily- doesn&#x27;t stain.</li>
            <li>I am glad Clairol has something like this to keep my hair pretty/or lovely and fresh looking.  </li>
            <li>Customer service was very quick to resolve the problem with no issue.  </li>
            <li>It stains easily</li>
            <li>Easy to use, five minutes on hair two/three times a week</li>
            <li>This shampoo smells like really strong baby powder if you can imagine that.</li>
            <li>I use it once or twice weekly; it does have a strong odor, but no one else notices.</li>
            <li>I recommend using a strong conditioner.</li>
            <li>Hello beautiful blonde!</li>
            <li>but it turns out to make my blonde shine and beautiful.</li>
            <li>This one is the best, hands down.</li>
            <li>hair is fine</li>
            <li>product is fine, but the cap was not on all the way and even though it&#x27;s like they knew it and put it in a plastic bag, it leaked all over...</li>
            <li>As others have noted, there is a fairly strong medicinal smell that lingers lightly on the hair.</li>
            <li>Maravilhosooooo, super recomendo!</li>
            <li>I noticed a huge difference after 2 washes.</li>
            <li>and I notice a huge difference in color when she touches up my roots despite using this shampoo.</li>
            <li>It really brightens my whites, and really manages my fly away gray.</li>
            <li>Does a great job of removing brassiness from my blonde hair.</li>
            <li>fortunately, my grays are growing spradically</li>
            <li>time is important.</li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t afford to use it for three of us if not for the pricing available here.</li>
            <li>They are both fantastic.</li>
            <li>Shimmer lights does a great job getting a whiter blonde for my hair.</li>
            <li>It is quite a powerful shampoo, and you won&#x27;t want to use it more than once a week.</li>
            <li>Works fantastic on natrually blond hair that tends to get a bit of strwberry color to it.</li>
            <li>I waited a year to write my review because I wanted to really see how I liked</li>
            <li>Works great on my white hair.</li>
            <li>Great for blonde hair/ highlights.</li>
            <li>Great on my blonde highlighted hair.</li>
            <li>If you want to eliminate yellowish or \\&quot;mousy\\&quot; coloration in white or silver hair, this is a great product.  </li>
            <li>ask me if I got my hair done because it made it look so much brighter!!!</li>
            <li>I think the shimmer lights conditioner might be better, it won&#x27;t strip your hair so much!</li>
            <li>I only leave on for one minute because I don&#x27;t have much yellow now that i&#x27;ve had my hair this shade for over a year, but this does a great job of making my hair look as bright as it did when I just had it bleached.  </li>
            <li>Shimmer Lights Shampoo is a great product for my grey hair.  </li>
            <li>Yes it smells like old people, but it works wonderful to get the yellow out!</li>
            <li>Very nice when lathering onto my entire main of hair :)</li>
            <li>Love that I can order large bottle and not run out of product.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s delivered right to your door!</li>
            <li>and you want to keep it shining, bright and white</li>
            <li>so use a good conditioner and a moisturizing shampoo on alternate days.</li>
            <li>I often reach for this shampoo more than I really need to.</li>
            <li>Now im a true salt &amp; pepper.  </li>
            <li>For my hair, it is a bit drying, so I use a good conditioner with an occasional oil treatment.  </li>
            <li>Really good shampoo to use with your regular shampoo.</li>
            <li>This is ok shampoo but has a very chemical smell which I dislike.  </li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t really notice any changes to my hair but most of all I can&#x27;t stand the way it made my hair smell.</li>
            <li>This is my second bottle, the product is really good</li>
            <li>The shampoo is really good for people with white hair.</li>
            <li>I am right now using shimmer lights as a toner and omg its fantastic and</li>
            <li>This shampoo is too mild for my hair.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s so mild</li>
            <li>Luckily I decided to search for hair products that can help the orange.</li>
            <li>Smells very strong, if you are scent sensitive beware.  </li>
            <li>Most of the bottle remains (despite a good portion of it spilling in transit - mess!)</li>
            <li>So good for my grey hair, does not give it a purple sheen at all.  </li>
            <li>When I got it half of it had leaked out in the box but the product is great.</li>
            <li>Just use with a really good conditioner so your hair doesnt dry out.</li>
            <li>appreciate having a pump bottle - very convenient &amp; easy to use in the shower.  </li>
            <li>This product works really well!!</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s funny because I&#x27;m 67!</li>
            <li>Being a blonde cosmetologist i love this product!</li>
            <li>again, i strongly suggest to the manufacturer that they ship the pump separately and use a regular screw top to avoid leaks.  </li>
            <li>the shampoo was GREAT, however the lid wasn&#x27;t on tight and the package had shampoo in it................</li>
            <li>My hair was super pourous though so its taking the orange right out..</li>
            <li>AND THE PRICE IS GOOD FOR SUCH A LARGE BOTTLE WITH PUMP.</li>
            <li>Though it helped, it really didn&#x27;t make a huge change.</li>
            <li>The only reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is the smell, it just doesn&#x27;t have a nice shampoo smell.  </li>
            <li>It would probably be okay if you don&#x27;t mind smelling like an old lady, but I don&#x27;t want to...</li>
            <li>When you buy it from Amazon it is more reasonable and arrives very well packed in a timely  maner.</li>
            <li>I started dying my own hair recently</li>
            <li>Its been ok so far.  </li>
            <li>Worth it.</li>
            <li>I love Clairol&#x27;s Professional Shimmer Lights Shampoo and have been using it for a year now.</li>
            <li>This size it&#x27;s perfect and more convenient for my use, this product in small or large do the same job</li>
            <li>and it was dulling my highlights out pretty quickly.</li>
            <li>Super Fast shipping!</li>
            <li>saw it advertised on The View and ordered some right away and have used it twice a week</li>
            <li>This shampoo makes my hair the right texture.</li>
            <li>she is right</li>
            <li>Overall, I am very pleased with this shampoo and it works very well.</li>
            <li>you will first have to tone out the copper/orange hues with blue (buy a toner, Wella is amazing.)</li>
            <li>I only use it twice a week and use a good hydrating conditioner with it as it does have a tendency to make my hair drier than it normally is.</li>
            <li>It lathers really well and my hair feels clean.</li>
            <li>This is perfect for toning down any brassiness left in your hair from bleaching.</li>
            <li>Makes coarse hair easy to manage and silky smooth.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been buying shimmer lights for years at a local beauty store since going light blonde and this bottle was just as good</li>
            <li>Heard it works great, but can&#x27;t get past the smell.</li>
            <li>It does a good job of maintaining the silver color without it becoming yellow, but leaves my hair and scalp feeling dry (even after using a quality conditioner).  </li>
            <li>This does a great job of removing the yellow from my platinum blonde bleached hair.  </li>
            <li>If you want a platinum blonde or the color that you wanted like a silver or ashy blonde, it&#x27;s great.</li>
            <li>If you have blond high lights and pull brass this is a great product to cool your high lights down.</li>
            <li>my hair is graying very fast.  </li>
            <li>I have tried a few other purple shampoos that were okay, but Shimmer Lights is by far the best!</li>
            <li>Also it leaked everywhere when it first arrived in the box.  </li>
            <li>I only use once or twice a week, as suggested by hairdresser, she said if you use more than that it could give a purplish hue to your hair.  </li>
            <li>It is recommended that one use it once a week, but I do occasionally use it more than once with no ill effects.</li>
            <li>The first bottle I bought lasted me for over a year.</li>
            <li>Thanks Amazon!</li>
            <li>But anyways you&#x27;re most likely buying this for function, not the smell.</li>
            <li>Sure to last for months.</li>
            <li>Get&#x27;s the yellowy atmospheric grunge out of gray hair, and produces a better look.</li>
            <li>Works very well and is worth the money.</li>
            <li>I suppose I&#x27;d like that perhaps if I were younger, but it just doesn&#x27;t flow with my age. :)</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t measure the ratio, but more Shimmer Lights than regular shampoo.</li>
            <li>I used John frieda go blonde shampoo and conditioner to lighten it more.</li>
            <li>i got the more mousey yellow</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used this shampoo for many years, and like the way it enhances my gray hair, remiving any yellow tones.</li>
            <li>I love my white hair</li>
            <li>Mostly once per week..if I go too long and start seeing my hair go golden, I use it</li>
            <li>We left it in for one hour, and the results were stunning.  </li>
            <li>beware, it is pretty</li>
            <li>Took 8 5% of the yellowing out of my beard on the first wash.  </li>
            <li>My first time using it</li>
            <li>It really has helped to tone my hair!</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t use everyday or it will turn your hair a grayish color but good product.</li>
            <li>Only problem was it turned bright yellow!</li>
            <li>great shampoo seriously</li>
            <li>Seems to work fairly well as a shampoo for white hair, giving it a shiny white appearance.</li>
            <li>The yellow neutralizing purple toner part worked OK, but this shampoo smells absolutely REVOLTING.</li>
            <li>I only use it once or twice a week, but still decided to get this one since it&#x27;s such a good deal.</li>
            <li>Love this product as it keeps my white hair yellow streaks free.</li>
            <li>This shampoo keeps my grey hair from getting brassy  Love it have been using it for years</li>
            <li>Keeps the yellow that tarnishes white hair out, but use it more sparingly and use more natural shampoos in between.  </li>
            <li>It certainly does this for myself and my daughters.</li>
            <li>Also, it&#x27;s large.</li>
            <li>I ordered 3 of the &amp;#34;pump-style&amp;#34;, large bottles of shampoo.  </li>
            <li>color treated light blonde, and this shampoo REALLY helps to keep my color looking fresh and new in between salon visits!</li>
            <li>Clairol Shimmering Lights is the best on the market; yet, difficult for me to locate where I live.</li>
            <li>It smells like half of the bottle is filled with cheap men&#x27;s cologne.</li>
            <li>, mmm I don&#x27;t like it, the smell bothers after a couple times of usage, the chemical odor is strong, if I let it stand for 3 mins my hair turns out with purple light in it, not even shampooing it with another product helps; the conditioner is nothing but a waste of time and money, it does not condition my hair at all, it just adds the purple color to</li>
            <li>can smell it long after the shower is over.&lt;br /&gt;Leaves your hair feeling fresh and clean.</li>
            <li>Fast delivery.</li>
            <li>I really like this shampoo, it perks up my gray hair.  </li>
            <li>Yes it lightens hair pretty well as long as its not darker than yellow, if its more golden it will either make it brownish or greenish.</li>
            <li>Sometimes a detailed review is not necessary when a product meets ones expectations.</li>
            <li>Fast turn around.  </li>
            <li>Really like this shampoo.</li>
            <li>I have been using the for years, I really like they</li>
            <li>I will go back to Jhirmack or Pantene when this is used up if they are available.</li>
            <li>I leave it sitting on my hair to really get the purple stain.</li>
            <li>Very economical.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This stuff works but only if your hair is really light to begin with.</li>
            <li>how much leave-in product I use.</li>
            <li>thanks to shimmer lights.  </li>
            <li>result is a very frizzy, orangey-bluish, smelly hair yackk.&lt;br</li>
            <li>You know how sometimes when you get highlights or your hair dyed a light blonde and it ends up with the reddish tinge.......</li>
            <li>It really helped bring out the ashy tones in my hair.</li>
            <li>I really like it and would buy it again.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very upset by this</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t really know if this product works or not.  </li>
            <li>(light brown) and mix this with my regular shampoo and leave it on my hair while I shoer eg: wash my body and my face.</li>
            <li>Dyed it ultra light ash blonde (platinum) revlon box dye.</li>
            <li>Haha.</li>
            <li>It does lather very well.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very fragrant almost like perfume so even after the shower people can smell it.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very noticeable</li>
            <li>It really, really helped then.</li>
            <li>and after I use it, and try not to use it TOO much.</li>
            <li>I guess you don&#x27;t really want feedback.</li>
            <li>this one was recommended to me at sally&#x27;s beauty but now that i found it on amazon it is much easier to buy.  </li>
            <li>do it tooooo much or your hair will look greyish/</li>
            <li>You will need to start with light blonde hair - we use another hair dye to get her to light blonde, and then this gentle Shimmer Lights Shampoo to add the silver highlights.]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>item was sealed in plastic, but the top of product wasn&#x27;t closed</li>
            <li>Very dissapointed.</li>
            <li>It really does smell fantastic.&lt;br /&gt;You</li>
            <li>The shampoo doesn&#x27;t seem to have lightened it much at all</li>
            <li>The shipping was fast as well</li>
            <li>It did arrive opened and leaked into the plastic packaging, bottle not broken.</li>
            <li>It really softens the gray and makes my hair shine.  </li>
            <li>, I get so much</li>
            <li>It always makes my bath tub purple and kind of messy.</li>
            <li>and I was looking for a shampoo to use between tonings to keep my hair looking a more natural blonde color.  </li>
            <li>Then dyed it dark brown (at a hair salon with strong stuff!)</li>
            <li>Shampoo itself is fine, pretty drying, but that&#x27;s to be expected from a toning shampoo.</li>
            <li>I originally tried to do it myself, but finally ended up going to my salon to do a color correction.  </li>
            <li>Great for grey or white hair, especially when your water is &amp;#34;hard&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>There are other product out there that I like more.</li>
            <li>Works better than the other FOUR purple/blue shampoos I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using Shimmer lights for years; first with my blonde hair, and more recently with the gray!  </li>
            <li>this product keeps my gray hair clean and not yellow</li>
            <li>It is a great price for what I usually purchase the generic for...</li>
            <li>Really like this shampoo, highly recommend.  </li>
            <li>I used to really like this shampoo, but recently I feel like it has been leaving a lot more residue in my hair such that my hair is stiffer and feels oiler.</li>
            <li>Shampoo was fine, lid was loose so some spilled within the plastic cover.</li>
            <li>Although, I&#x27;ll admit, it turns a lot of my head into a light purple, but it doesn&#x27;t matter much since it meshes well with the pink</li>
            <li>This shampoo helps to keep the color in my hair vibrant.</li>
            <li>If you have your hair highlighted or colored blonde, using this product extends the blonde look...shiny and healthy looking to boot.</li>
            <li>and it would look all vibrant again after each use.</li>
            <li>I use this on my hair and it keeps the yellow out as my hair is all white and it makes it more lustrous and shiney.  </li>
            <li>The problem is this particular container.  </li>
            <li>and now I have platinum white blonde :)</li>
            <li>The lid was not on tight and shampoo leaked out all over,need to do a better job with packing.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend those who have white/gray hair to use it.</li>
            <li>I HIGHLY recommend this product for anyone with graying hair.  </li>
            <li>So I highly recommend this!&lt;br /&gt;Oh</li>
            <li>and I recomend it highly.</li>
            <li>I would purchase it again and highly recommend to anyone.</li>
            <li>She highly recommended it.</li>
            <li>so it&#x27;s always a little more orangy.</li>
            <li>A terrific product, does exactly as advertised!</li>
            <li>I saved a small size bottle and just refill it from the large pump bottle, makes more room in shower.</li>
            <li>Terribly strong chemical smell, as the other reviewers noted.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m hoping maybe a few more times it will.</li>
            <li>It brightens up my blonde highlighted hair and is helpful to remove the golden tones that it gets over time.</li>
            <li>..sometimes the shampoo drips out the pump (where it normally comes</li>
            <li>This removes the yellow that seems to creep in over time and leaves my hair a more natural blonde color.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using it for a few weeks and my hair feels healthy and undamaged.</li>
            <li>I am now a golden blonde</li>
            <li>I normally use Jhirmack shampoo for gray hair.  </li>
            <li>when a blonde finds her stylist, she has found the golden ticket.</li>
            <li>The brand they carried in the salon was not this colorists favorite - she recommended Clairol Professional Shimmer Lights ( go to Sally Beauty down the street she said)</li>
            <li>Keeps my white hair less yellow without turning it too brilliant a blue.</li>
            <li>It keeps our hair shiny and not dull looking .</li>
            <li>and it did make them more of a platnium it didn&#x27;t mess with my natural brown hair</li>
            <li>I have light pink hair, and as far as light pink hair goes, it often turns salmon or orange from standing out in the sun.</li>
            <li>(Now that I have dye resistant grey hairs, this shampoo is even more important keeping my greys from looking dull &amp;</li>
            <li>I was skeptical as first, but this is great product and will buy again if necessary.</li>
            <li>to so I can live with the smell.  </li>
            <li>We live in the country and have a well.  </li>
            <li>We bought this to add silver highlights to my teenage daughter&#x27;s light blonde hair.  </li>
            <li>It smells VERY old lady&amp;#34;ish&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li>It was yellow and white and while not unattractive, I thought it would look better without the yellow.  </li>
            <li>Amazon provided their usual outstanding service in fixing the situation, but I learned a lesson... and so, as mentioned, I now order this separately.</li>
            <li>and it brings out my pretty blonde again.</li>
            <li>This is really all I have to say except for saying it is ridiculous to tell people how many words they must write.  </li>
            <li>I recently started using this product to get rid of the yellow/orange tones in my hair, specially after I do my roots and also at the back of my hair, closest to the neck doesn&#x27;t seem to pick up the bleach as well as the rest of my hair</li>
            <li>And if you use it too often or leave it too long on really light blonde hair, it leaves silvery streaks (or it can turn purple).</li>
            <li>This most definitely tones it down.</li>
            <li>the smell honestly isn&#x27;t that bad it used to be really strong</li>
            <li>bleached my hair, and the ends were still a very pale/pastel apricot color, so I put this straight on my dry hair for 10 minutes, washed it out, and my hair is almost platinum</li>
            <li>I have platinum blonde hair that gets yellow really quick.</li>
            <li>So strong that when I used it 2 nights ago and slept with wet hair, I woke up the next day so nauseous to the point of throwing up all day.</li>
            <li>Not worth the headache or clean up.</li>
            <li>The size of the bottle is large and should last me for months!  </li>
            <li>I use this shampoo to help to clear any residual product build up on my hair.</li>
            <li>Seeing it on Amazon, at a reasonable  price, and larger size, I ordered a twin pack..</li>
            <li>Came one day early.</li>
            <li>and it really does help if you have gray hair (to brighten and white it).  </li>
            <li>Clairol Professional Shimmer Lights Shampoo has the quality one expects from Clairol.</li>
            <li>If it&#x27;s orange at all or really yellow, it won&#x27;t do much of anything.</li>
            <li>I purchased this to remove the yellowing to the tips of my otherwise naturally SILVER hair.</li>
            <li>the only complains is it Made my hair really greasy.</li>
            <li>it literally smells like 80 year old woman.</li>
            <li>I am NOT a blue haired lady thanks to this product.</li>
            <li>Arrived early and intact.</li>
            <li>it does remove the brassiness from the blonde and whitens the gray, but it also is a very drying shampoo, so condition well after using</li>
            <li>Like an old lady.</li>
            <li>This is the only toning shampoo that I&#x27;ve tried that really works.</li>
            <li>I am going to mix in my regular shampoo with it to see if that cuts the smell, otherwise I don&#x27;t know if I would use this much longer.</li>
            <li>Clairol Professional Shimmer Lights Shampoo was recommended to my wife by her beautician.</li>
            <li>It really gives gray hair a shine and takes any yellow tinges away.  </li>
            <li>either also I would recommend only using twice a week maximum because it it very damaging to the hair.  </li>
            <li>Thankfully nothing was damaged, but the cap was almost completely screwed off.</li>
            <li>She was really surprised as that would have helped keep my highlights from yellowing.</li>
            <li>It has helped keep my light brown store box hair dye from turning brassy, orange, or green.</li>
            <li>keeps  it soft as well as allowing it to have its natural body.</li>
            <li>completely-</li>
            <li>I am a natural brunette with bleached blonde/toned hair</li>
            <li>My hair is naturally silver and this shampoo keeps it from yellowing.</li>
            <li>I have recommended this to all of my friends who have highlights, weaves or natural streaks.</li>
            <li>Used once or twice a week, it really brings out the highlights without creating that \\&quot;blue-hair\\&quot; look that seems to result with some similar products.</li>
            <li>I thought it might be a bit old lady</li>
            <li>Also it does work in terms of making golden blonde hair into ashy blonde ( platinum).</li>
            <li>I am poor and do my own hair coloring ...</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend to any blondes who have natural red tones in their hair to help control the brassiness.  </li>
            <li>a messy clean up since the shampoo is purple.  </li>
            <li>main reason for this shampoo is to remove the yellowing that can occur in your hair, if white headed.  </li>
            <li>A purple mess in a plastic bag, top was loose and spilled</li>
            <li>The cap was on loose, who packages things without making sure the lid is tight?  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend it to anyone who has blonde hair and mineral water.</li>
            <li>It has a strange smell to it and is very purple in color.</li>
            <li>I have honestly never loved my hair more than I do now.</li>
            <li>I recently went from dyed  copper red hair all the way to white blonde ( thanks to a salon), Sadly not all the orange could be lifted after 3 treatments .This</li>
            <li>I used it just like regular shampoo, not leaving it in any longer than normal and noticed a result immediately.  </li>
            <li>The shop where I normally purchase told me to hold off purchasing because it was going on sale the next week.</li>
            <li>not  dull yellow.</li>
            <li>This is the only new thing that I have added to my shower and it has dryed my hair a lot.</li>
            <li>Plus, I have read that if you use it too much, it can dry your hair.</li>
            <li>At least it comes in a really big bottle :-)</li>
            <li>it really works if you use it in your DRY hair, about half-hour before you wash, dont wet your hair before because it will not give the same results, it helped my highlights to get lighter and brighter, less yellowish, more platinum look.</li>
            <li>This hair product I&#x27;ve used for year, having turned WHITE at a young age.  </li>
            <li>I have naturally brown hair and bleach it blonde.</li>
            <li>It leaves my blonde looking really natural and shiny</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a darker ash blonde naturally, so I am prone to brassiness.</li>
            <li>This barely makes a change.</li>
            <li>My natural blonde hair that is on the darker side but gets lighter streaks during the summer.</li>
            <li>I purchased Shimmer Lights back in summer 2011 (it is now nearly summer 2012).</li>
            <li>(recently lightened from dark brown dyed from a box to a full foil of blonde highlights).</li>
            <li>so didn&#x27;t receive full bottle. :\</li>
            <li>I layered it on my ends and midshaft on dry hair ,not expecting too much because those parts just would not lift  the left over orange tones</li>
            <li>Because this shampoo is very purple, it can stain other items.</li>
            <li>We have hard water and this product keeps the blonde color light without looking brassy or orange.  </li>
            <li>Not good if you have fine hair.  </li>
            <li>I ALWAYS get compliments on my hair color from others who say it has such a natural look, or they wish they could achieve this type of blonde.</li>
            <li>I only have to use 2-3 pumps also as it lathers up very well unlike other brands I have tried.</li>
            <li>This stuff is great--it really helps tone down the lingering brassiness in my hair</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t smoke, so I don&#x27;t really know why it yellows slightly with age</li>
            <li>In order to get any suds, I have to use twice as much of the product as I needed to use with my previous shampoo.  </li>

            <li> The shampoo is very good.</li>
            <li> This is simply great shampoo, and the best part is it&#x27;s cheaper on amazon</li>
            <li> The packaging that it was sent in wasn&#x27;t ideal</li>
            <li> I loved this!</li>
            <li> Smells good!</li>
            <li> you want silver highlights, this product is definitely a good one!  </li>
            <li> Smells good &amp; lathers wonderfully!</li>
            <li> My hair is so beautiful now.  </li>

            <li> I always get compliments on how shiny and beautiful my hair looks.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It gave her beautiful silver highlights -</li>
            <li> I have used this shampoo for years with great results.</li>
            <li> Great value and great shampoo.</li>
            <li> I prefer the Loreal version of this, but the Clairol version is still a great product..</li>
            <li> Smells great, and works to tone my hair.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great deal</li>
            <li> This shampoo is great for highlighting and excentuating the gray hair that I no longer can fight.  </li>
            <li> I am so happy I had this on hand.</li>
            <li> Using this shampoo twice a week keeps my hair looking great.  </li>
            <li> Works great at keeping the brass away but is rather drying to the hair.</li>
            <li> product works great to remove that &amp;#34;brashy&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> This is a great shampoo for gray hair but this bottle arrived with a non-working pump.  </li>
            <li> The smell is not the best, kind of reminds me of walking through the perfume counter at a department store but it does not linger after the shampoo is washed out, after conditioning I can not even smell it anymore.</li>
            <li> I found a great deal on it from Amazon.  </li>
            <li> Takes out the Orange pigment, highlights look great-</li>
            <li> great product..  </li>
            <li> But this does a great job with &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> This works great.  </li>
            <li> I will probably never stop using this stuff lol</li>
            <li> Shampoo is great but packaging exploded in the mail and product was all over the place.  </li>
            <li> Thought I&#x27;d give this shampoo because it got great ratings, plus it was the cheapest for the size youu get.</li>
            <li> But my hair does feel silky and great color to my hair.</li>
            <li> Great shampoo.</li>
            <li> Great shampoo for a great value.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s amazing!</li>
            <li> I was so happy to find this for my Son &amp; at a good price.</li>
            <li> IT LATHERS GREAT&#x27; SMELLS GOOD AND PROVIDES SOME CONDITIONING,</li>
            <li> Now I just need to bleach my roots :p</li>
            <li> Amazon prices are much cheaper, it came packaged perfectly, and the price was excellent.</li>
            <li> Great shampoo that I&#x27;ve used for many years!  </li>
            <li> For whatever reasons the top wasn&#x27;t on it very good and some of it leaked out into the packaging.  </li>
            <li> It is bright purple in color.  </li>
            <li> Did not need to redo my hair for a while, while using this shampoo and it kept my highlights bright for months.</li>
            <li> sometimes people do notice a purple cast but in a good way.</li>
            <li> It arrived on time and in good condition.</li>
            <li> It was shimmering white--and gorgeous.  </li>
            <li> so buy this shampoo and get a good conditioner</li>
            <li> lather &amp; good smell.  </li>
            <li> Good price also</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s a good product.  </li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re a guy that doesn&#x27;t like to die your hair (have you ever seen a guy with good looking dyed gray hair?</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s no longer a good deal.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve heard good things about this product, but I just got it this evening and 1/4 of it was ALL over the bag -</li>
            <li> Good value</li>
            <li> It smells like beauty salons, and not in a good way.</li>
            <li> This product makes my gray hair look good but...</li>
            <li> I use it about once a week leaving it on for 2-3 minutes, and conditioning with a good conditioner after (I haven&#x27;t used the matching conditioner).  </li>
            <li> good product but the bottle opened during transit and about 1/3 of it emptied out inside the box.  </li>
            <li> Good thing they sealed the conditioner in the bag</li>
            <li> and you&#x27;re good to go.</li>
            <li> Using them together is definitely a good idea.  </li>
            <li> Both of those work beautifully, leaving glossy hair with plenty of silver shine and a light, pleasant scent.</li>
            <li> Excellent product and economical in this size and from Amazon.</li>
            <li> Recommended by my hair stylist and I am very pleased.</li>
            <li> This is a product I have purchased before and am very pleased with it.  </li>
            <li> It is ok, not too great.</li>
            <li> Love this product!</li>
            <li> Love this stuff!</li>
            <li> This sure did the trick!  </li>
            <li> So glad I did!  </li>
            <li> This has made my transition so much better!</li>
            <li> Love this stuff!</li>
            <li> Love the pump!</li>
            <li> Love it!</li>
            <li> I tried it, I love it, and I&#x27;m sticking with it!</li>
            <li> I LOVE THIS STUFF!</li>
            <li> Love this shampoo!</li>
            <li> Love it!</li>
            <li> /&gt;Great product - we are both extremely pleased with it!</li>
            <li> Love it!</li>
            <li> Love it!</li>
            <li> Great product for a super price!</li>
            <li> This product works amazing.</li>
            <li> It is amazing.  </li>
            <li> , it is of great quality for being so cheap.</li>
            <li> Really nice product.</li>
            <li> Brightens up my silver hair and gives it nice body.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used many shampoos to keep my gray hair looking good.</li>
            <li> This shampoo keeps it from yellowing and gives it a nice shine.</li>
            <li> nice size</li>
            <li> Lathers up nicely, doesn&#x27;t stain my shower walls or floor.</li>
            <li> Nice toner.helps keep the brassy away.</li>
            <li> and it is a nice shampoo as well ...</li>
            <li> Nice lathering shampoo.  </li>
            <li> I was thrilled to find out I could order it through Amazon.</li>
            <li> Nice shampoo - gives blond/grey hair a nice shimmer</li>
            <li> do not use this on the ends of my hair, they turn kind of gray if i do.</li>
            <li> i couldn&#x27;t find a product i liked.  </li>
            <li> Nice shampoo that lasts.</li>
            <li> It really does help my hair color to keep their lighter tones longer, and even helps those silver streaks look their very best.</li>
            <li> I already have highlights in my hair, and this product enhanced my hair so nice</li>
            <li> It is great for highlights and full color.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> My hairdresser suggested this product, it really works great at keeping highlights bright.  </li>
            <li> The prices for those are better and, while I don&#x27;t love the scents (one smells somewhat of grape bubblegum!)</li>
            <li> make sure to get a really nice smelling conditioner</li>
            <li> It is excellent to use in keeping the cleanliness and color of the natural gray color of my hair and beard.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s an okay shampoo, but honestly I don&#x27;t see any changes in my hair color, the bronze is still there</li>
            <li> This by far is the cheapest and best shampoo!</li>
            <li> gives good shine and hair is clean in one application</li>
            <li> I have only used this shampoo once, it smells really great &amp; brought the highlights out very nicely.</li>
            <li> I am so glad that i can easily find it on Amazon!</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;d rather have a  very light lavender streak here</li>
            <li> and I got to the point of a very light tangerine color</li>
            <li> The smell is so strong it cancels out your own perfume.</li>
            <li> This shampoo worked great for taking the brassiness out of my blonde hair, but to me, the smell just wasn&#x27;t pleasant.</li>
            <li> Additionally, I ordered 3 huge bottles of it!  </li>
            <li> Works like magic.</li>
            <li> Make sure you leave the lather in for 5 minutes</li>
            <li> Keeps the brassy away and my color continues to look fresh and bright.</li>
            <li> especially if u blowdry it after wards... smells great also!</li>
            <li> I love the robo aid.  </li>
            <li> I just wish it smelled better.</li>
            <li> so I bought the biggest bottle I could :)</li>
            <li> I absolutely love it.</li>
            <li> although it says that it is a conditioning shampoo, I feel like it dries my hair out even more</li>
            <li> Be sure to read the instructions about leaving it on for 3-5 minutes.  </li>
            <li> My recommendation would be to not wash more than once a week if you already have dryer, damaged hair.  </li>
            <li> Once I got into a normal routine of once a week, it worked beautifully.  </li>
            <li> Smells great and cleans really well.</li>
            <li> , I like them better than the Clairol.</li>
            <li> Love this shampoo.</li>
            <li> Love this shampoo.</li>
            <li> Have been using this shampoo for 3 years now (as recommended by my stylist) - keeps my highlights in shape, not drying - lovely.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s a bit better.</li>
            <li> This awesome shampoo lightened my dyed blonde hair in one washing.  </li>
            <li> Leaves my hair feeling silky smooth!</li>
            <li> This stuff is phenomenal.</li>
            <li> Awesome to lighten/whiten blonde highlights!</li>
            <li> Pleased and will order again.</li>
            <li> I ordered it from Amazon and absolutely LOVE it.  </li>
            <li> My hair is even more managable - not so stubborn.</li>
            <li> I have had many, many compliments on my hair since using the shampoo.</li>
            <li> OK for removing brassiness.  </li>
            <li> I have been purchased many goods through amazon.com</li>
            <li> becareful and make sure you rinse your shower floor and tiles if it gets anywhere on them, it does tend to stain.&lt;br /&gt;Oh</li>
            <li> Love the way it turns my gray to silver.  </li>
            <li> I love this product.  </li>
            <li> the more gray</li>
            <li> I like the one from AG beauty a lot better.</li>
            <li> A better system needs to be found, so many reviews about spilled contents with this product.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff.</li>
            <li> but I prefer this one better</li>
            <li> I ended up leaving it for about 40 minutes, may be more.</li>
            <li> Works okay, just not a quality product.</li>
            <li> I love this product and have used it for sometime.  </li>
            <li> Not only did this product help, it gave my hair the beautiful ash blond I was going for!</li>
            <li> so make sure to wipe it off if it leaks anywhere</li>
            <li> Just make sure to not use it EVERY day for you hair will turn grayish/purple.</li>
            <li> I love this shampoo.</li>
            <li> Love this shampoo for gray or brassy hair.  </li>
            <li> My favorite shampoo to brighten my greying hair.  </li>
            <li> I really love this conditioner.</li>
            <li> I love the smell and the feel of the conditioner in my hair once it&#x27;s washed out.</li>
            <li> and I was glad that it made it safely to delivery.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t leave in more then 1 minute</li>
            <li> I love this product however-</li>
            <li> And I found a better deal all the way around.</li>
            <li> her salon sells Kevin Murphy products which i love.</li>
            <li> and it helps to her silver hair to look better.</li>
            <li> Love this shampoo.</li>
            <li> it,love it, love it</li>
            <li> The pump top is convenient.  </li>
            <li> Im very excited to buy this but received damage;(</li>
            <li> NIce and rich and works at taking all of that brassiness out of your hair.</li>
            <li> super favorite thing about this Shampoo?&lt;br /&gt;The smell!</li>
            <li> Best Shampoo for grey hair&lt;</li>
            <li> Not to mention the rich lather it provides!</li>
            <li> Amazing product and helps maintain a great blonde color.</li>
            <li> plus I had to clean it up!</li>
            <li> I have purchase other brand purple shampoos and this is the best because the shampoo is stronger and works better.</li>
            <li> Decent shampoo, ok &amp;#34;toner&amp;#34; but not as good as the matching conditioner.  </li>
            <li> When you dispense using the convenient pump, hold your hand there and wipe your fingers over the spout to get rid of drips...and wipe up any drips as soon as you are able to avoid a light staining that eventually wears away.</li>
            <li> ..NEED TO MAKE SURE LID IS SECURE BEFORE MAILING..</li>
            <li> stylist told me &amp;#34;this shampoo does not coat your hair, like most cheap shampoos&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> Because of the good price and easy Prime shipping, I really wanted this to work.</li>
            <li> This shampoo works great keeping my very light blonde hair from getting too bronze.  </li>
            <li> Shimmer lights is my secret weapon for keeping my platinum bright and beautiful!</li>
            <li> Easy to rinse out.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t love the design and the hassle of clean up</li>
            <li> It is purple in color, but washes off tub easily- doesn&#x27;t stain.</li>
            <li> I am glad Clairol has something like this to keep my hair pretty/or lovely and fresh looking.  </li>
            <li> Customer service was very quick to resolve the problem with no issue.  </li>
            <li> It stains easily</li>
            <li> Easy to use, five minutes on hair two/three times a week</li>
            <li> This shampoo smells like really strong baby powder if you can imagine that.</li>
            <li> I use it once or twice weekly; it does have a strong odor, but no one else notices.</li>
            <li> I recommend using a strong conditioner.</li>
            <li> Hello beautiful blonde!</li>
            <li> but it turns out to make my blonde shine and beautiful.</li>
            <li> This one is the best, hands down.</li>
            <li> hair is fine</li>
            <li> product is fine, but the cap was not on all the way and even though it&#x27;s like they knew it and put it in a plastic bag, it leaked all over...</li>
            <li> As others have noted, there is a fairly strong medicinal smell that lingers lightly on the hair.</li>
            <li> Maravilhosooooo, super recomendo!</li>
            <li> I noticed a huge difference after 2 washes.</li>
            <li> and I notice a huge difference in color when she touches up my roots despite using this shampoo.</li>
            <li> It really brightens my whites, and really manages my fly away gray.</li>
            <li> Does a great job of removing brassiness from my blonde hair.</li>
            <li> fortunately, my grays are growing spradically</li>
            <li> time is important.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t afford to use it for three of us if not for the pricing available here.</li>
            <li> They are both fantastic.</li>
            <li> Shimmer lights does a great job getting a whiter blonde for my hair.</li>
            <li> It is quite a powerful shampoo, and you won&#x27;t want to use it more than once a week.</li>
            <li> Works fantastic on natrually blond hair that tends to get a bit of strwberry color to it.</li>
            <li> I waited a year to write my review because I wanted to really see how I liked</li>
            <li> Works great on my white hair.</li>
            <li> Great for blonde hair/ highlights.</li>
            <li> Great on my blonde highlighted hair.</li>
            <li> If you want to eliminate yellowish or \\&quot;mousy\\&quot; coloration in white or silver hair, this is a great product.  </li>
            <li> ask me if I got my hair done because it made it look so much brighter!!!</li>
            <li> I think the shimmer lights conditioner might be better, it won&#x27;t strip your hair so much!</li>
            <li> I only leave on for one minute because I don&#x27;t have much yellow now that i&#x27;ve had my hair this shade for over a year, but this does a great job of making my hair look as bright as it did when I just had it bleached.  </li>
            <li> Shimmer Lights Shampoo is a great product for my grey hair.  </li>
            <li> Yes it smells like old people, but it works wonderful to get the yellow out!</li>
            <li> Very nice when lathering onto my entire main of hair :)</li>
            <li> Love that I can order large bottle and not run out of product.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s delivered right to your door!</li>
            <li> and you want to keep it shining, bright and white</li>
            <li> so use a good conditioner and a moisturizing shampoo on alternate days.</li>
            <li> I often reach for this shampoo more than I really need to.</li>
            <li> Now im a true salt &amp; pepper.  </li>
            <li> For my hair, it is a bit drying, so I use a good conditioner with an occasional oil treatment.  </li>
            <li> Really good shampoo to use with your regular shampoo.</li>
            <li> This is ok shampoo but has a very chemical smell which I dislike.  </li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t really notice any changes to my hair but most of all I can&#x27;t stand the way it made my hair smell.</li>
            <li> This is my second bottle, the product is really good</li>
            <li> The shampoo is really good for people with white hair.</li>
            <li> I am right now using shimmer lights as a toner and omg its fantastic and</li>
            <li> This shampoo is too mild for my hair.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s so mild</li>
            <li> Luckily I decided to search for hair products that can help the orange.</li>
            <li> Smells very strong, if you are scent sensitive beware.  </li>
            <li> Most of the bottle remains (despite a good portion of it spilling in transit - mess!)</li>
            <li> So good for my grey hair, does not give it a purple sheen at all.  </li>
            <li> When I got it half of it had leaked out in the box but the product is great.</li>
            <li> Just use with a really good conditioner so your hair doesnt dry out.</li>
            <li> appreciate having a pump bottle - very convenient &amp; easy to use in the shower.  </li>
            <li> This product works really well!!</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s funny because I&#x27;m 67!</li>
            <li> Being a blonde cosmetologist i love this product!</li>
            <li> again, i strongly suggest to the manufacturer that they ship the pump separately and use a regular screw top to avoid leaks.  </li>
            <li> the shampoo was GREAT, however the lid wasn&#x27;t on tight and the package had shampoo in it................</li>
            <li> My hair was super pourous though so its taking the orange right out..</li>
            <li> AND THE PRICE IS GOOD FOR SUCH A LARGE BOTTLE WITH PUMP.</li>
            <li> Though it helped, it really didn&#x27;t make a huge change.</li>
            <li> The only reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is the smell, it just doesn&#x27;t have a nice shampoo smell.  </li>
            <li> It would probably be okay if you don&#x27;t mind smelling like an old lady, but I don&#x27;t want to...</li>
            <li> When you buy it from Amazon it is more reasonable and arrives very well packed in a timely  maner.</li>
            <li> I started dying my own hair recently</li>
            <li> Its been ok so far.  </li>
            <li> Worth it.</li>
            <li> I love Clairol&#x27;s Professional Shimmer Lights Shampoo and have been using it for a year now.</li>
            <li> This size it&#x27;s perfect and more convenient for my use, this product in small or large do the same job</li>
            <li> and it was dulling my highlights out pretty quickly.</li>
            <li> Super Fast shipping!</li>
            <li> saw it advertised on The View and ordered some right away and have used it twice a week</li>
            <li> This shampoo makes my hair the right texture.</li>
            <li> she is right</li>
            <li> Overall, I am very pleased with this shampoo and it works very well.</li>
            <li> you will first have to tone out the copper/orange hues with blue (buy a toner, Wella is amazing.)</li>
            <li> I only use it twice a week and use a good hydrating conditioner with it as it does have a tendency to make my hair drier than it normally is.</li>
            <li> It lathers really well and my hair feels clean.</li>
            <li> This is perfect for toning down any brassiness left in your hair from bleaching.</li>
            <li> Makes coarse hair easy to manage and silky smooth.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been buying shimmer lights for years at a local beauty store since going light blonde and this bottle was just as good</li>
            <li> Heard it works great, but can&#x27;t get past the smell.</li>
            <li> It does a good job of maintaining the silver color without it becoming yellow, but leaves my hair and scalp feeling dry (even after using a quality conditioner).  </li>
            <li> This does a great job of removing the yellow from my platinum blonde bleached hair.  </li>
            <li> If you want a platinum blonde or the color that you wanted like a silver or ashy blonde, it&#x27;s great.</li>
            <li> If you have blond high lights and pull brass this is a great product to cool your high lights down.</li>
            <li> my hair is graying very fast.  </li>
            <li> I have tried a few other purple shampoos that were okay, but Shimmer Lights is by far the best!</li>
            <li> Also it leaked everywhere when it first arrived in the box.  </li>
            <li> I only use once or twice a week, as suggested by hairdresser, she said if you use more than that it could give a purplish hue to your hair.  </li>
            <li> It is recommended that one use it once a week, but I do occasionally use it more than once with no ill effects.</li>
            <li> The first bottle I bought lasted me for over a year.</li>
            <li> Thanks Amazon!</li>
            <li> But anyways you&#x27;re most likely buying this for function, not the smell.</li>
            <li> Sure to last for months.</li>
            <li> Get&#x27;s the yellowy atmospheric grunge out of gray hair, and produces a better look.</li>
            <li> Works very well and is worth the money.</li>
            <li> I suppose I&#x27;d like that perhaps if I were younger, but it just doesn&#x27;t flow with my age. :)</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t measure the ratio, but more Shimmer Lights than regular shampoo.</li>
            <li> I used John frieda go blonde shampoo and conditioner to lighten it more.</li>
            <li> i got the more mousey yellow</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this shampoo for many years, and like the way it enhances my gray hair, remiving any yellow tones.</li>
            <li> I love my white hair</li>
            <li> Mostly once per week..if I go too long and start seeing my hair go golden, I use it</li>
            <li> We left it in for one hour, and the results were stunning.  </li>
            <li> beware, it is pretty</li>
            <li> Took 8 5% of the yellowing out of my beard on the first wash.  </li>
            <li> My first time using it</li>
            <li> It really has helped to tone my hair!</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t use everyday or it will turn your hair a grayish color but good product.</li>
            <li> Only problem was it turned bright yellow!</li>
            <li> great shampoo seriously</li>
            <li> Seems to work fairly well as a shampoo for white hair, giving it a shiny white appearance.</li>
            <li> The yellow neutralizing purple toner part worked OK, but this shampoo smells absolutely REVOLTING.</li>
            <li> I only use it once or twice a week, but still decided to get this one since it&#x27;s such a good deal.</li>
            <li> Love this product as it keeps my white hair yellow streaks free.</li>
            <li> This shampoo keeps my grey hair from getting brassy  Love it have been using it for years</li>
            <li> Keeps the yellow that tarnishes white hair out, but use it more sparingly and use more natural shampoos in between.  </li>
            <li> It certainly does this for myself and my daughters.</li>
            <li> Also, it&#x27;s large.</li>
            <li> I ordered 3 of the &amp;#34;pump-style&amp;#34;, large bottles of shampoo.  </li>
            <li> color treated light blonde, and this shampoo REALLY helps to keep my color looking fresh and new in between salon visits!</li>
            <li> Clairol Shimmering Lights is the best on the market; yet, difficult for me to locate where I live.</li>
            <li> It smells like half of the bottle is filled with cheap men&#x27;s cologne.</li>
            <li> , mmm I don&#x27;t like it, the smell bothers after a couple times of usage, the chemical odor is strong, if I let it stand for 3 mins my hair turns out with purple light in it, not even shampooing it with another product helps; the conditioner is nothing but a waste of time and money, it does not condition my hair at all, it just adds the purple color to</li>
            <li> can smell it long after the shower is over.&lt;br /&gt;Leaves your hair feeling fresh and clean.</li>
            <li> Fast delivery.</li>
            <li> I really like this shampoo, it perks up my gray hair.  </li>
            <li> Yes it lightens hair pretty well as long as its not darker than yellow, if its more golden it will either make it brownish or greenish.</li>
            <li> Sometimes a detailed review is not necessary when a product meets ones expectations.</li>
            <li> Fast turn around.  </li>
            <li> Really like this shampoo.</li>
            <li> I have been using the for years, I really like they</li>
            <li> I will go back to Jhirmack or Pantene when this is used up if they are available.</li>
            <li> I leave it sitting on my hair to really get the purple stain.</li>
            <li> Very economical.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This stuff works but only if your hair is really light to begin with.</li>
            <li> how much leave-in product I use.</li>
            <li> thanks to shimmer lights.  </li>
            <li> result is a very frizzy, orangey-bluish, smelly hair yackk.&lt;br</li>
            <li> You know how sometimes when you get highlights or your hair dyed a light blonde and it ends up with the reddish tinge.......</li>
            <li> It really helped bring out the ashy tones in my hair.</li>
            <li> I really like it and would buy it again.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very upset by this</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really know if this product works or not.  </li>
            <li> (light brown) and mix this with my regular shampoo and leave it on my hair while I shoer eg: wash my body and my face.</li>
            <li> Dyed it ultra light ash blonde (platinum) revlon box dye.</li>
            <li> Haha.</li>
            <li> It does lather very well.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very fragrant almost like perfume so even after the shower people can smell it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very noticeable</li>
            <li> It really, really helped then.</li>
            <li> and after I use it, and try not to use it TOO much.</li>
            <li> I guess you don&#x27;t really want feedback.</li>
            <li> this one was recommended to me at sally&#x27;s beauty but now that i found it on amazon it is much easier to buy.  </li>
            <li> do it tooooo much or your hair will look greyish/</li>
            <li> You will need to start with light blonde hair - we use another hair dye to get her to light blonde, and then this gentle Shimmer Lights Shampoo to add the silver highlights.]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> item was sealed in plastic, but the top of product wasn&#x27;t closed</li>
            <li> Very dissapointed.</li>
            <li> It really does smell fantastic.&lt;br /&gt;You</li>
            <li> The shampoo doesn&#x27;t seem to have lightened it much at all</li>
            <li> The shipping was fast as well</li>
            <li> It did arrive opened and leaked into the plastic packaging, bottle not broken.</li>
            <li> It really softens the gray and makes my hair shine.  </li>
            <li> , I get so much</li>
            <li> It always makes my bath tub purple and kind of messy.</li>
            <li> and I was looking for a shampoo to use between tonings to keep my hair looking a more natural blonde color.  </li>
            <li> Then dyed it dark brown (at a hair salon with strong stuff!)</li>
            <li> Shampoo itself is fine, pretty drying, but that&#x27;s to be expected from a toning shampoo.</li>
            <li> I originally tried to do it myself, but finally ended up going to my salon to do a color correction.  </li>
            <li> Great for grey or white hair, especially when your water is &amp;#34;hard&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> There are other product out there that I like more.</li>
            <li> Works better than the other FOUR purple/blue shampoos I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Shimmer lights for years; first with my blonde hair, and more recently with the gray!  </li>
            <li> this product keeps my gray hair clean and not yellow</li>
            <li> It is a great price for what I usually purchase the generic for...</li>
            <li> Really like this shampoo, highly recommend.  </li>
            <li> I used to really like this shampoo, but recently I feel like it has been leaving a lot more residue in my hair such that my hair is stiffer and feels oiler.</li>
            <li> Shampoo was fine, lid was loose so some spilled within the plastic cover.</li>
            <li> Although, I&#x27;ll admit, it turns a lot of my head into a light purple, but it doesn&#x27;t matter much since it meshes well with the pink</li>
            <li> This shampoo helps to keep the color in my hair vibrant.</li>
            <li> If you have your hair highlighted or colored blonde, using this product extends the blonde look...shiny and healthy looking to boot.</li>
            <li> and it would look all vibrant again after each use.</li>
            <li> I use this on my hair and it keeps the yellow out as my hair is all white and it makes it more lustrous and shiney.  </li>
            <li> The problem is this particular container.  </li>
            <li> and now I have platinum white blonde :)</li>
            <li> The lid was not on tight and shampoo leaked out all over,need to do a better job with packing.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend those who have white/gray hair to use it.</li>
            <li> I HIGHLY recommend this product for anyone with graying hair.  </li>
            <li> So I highly recommend this!&lt;br /&gt;Oh</li>
            <li> and I recomend it highly.</li>
            <li> I would purchase it again and highly recommend to anyone.</li>
            <li> She highly recommended it.</li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s always a little more orangy.</li>
            <li> A terrific product, does exactly as advertised!</li>
            <li> I saved a small size bottle and just refill it from the large pump bottle, makes more room in shower.</li>
            <li> Terribly strong chemical smell, as the other reviewers noted.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m hoping maybe a few more times it will.</li>
            <li> It brightens up my blonde highlighted hair and is helpful to remove the golden tones that it gets over time.</li>
            <li> ..sometimes the shampoo drips out the pump (where it normally comes</li>
            <li> This removes the yellow that seems to creep in over time and leaves my hair a more natural blonde color.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for a few weeks and my hair feels healthy and undamaged.</li>
            <li> I am now a golden blonde</li>
            <li> I normally use Jhirmack shampoo for gray hair.  </li>
            <li> when a blonde finds her stylist, she has found the golden ticket.</li>
            <li> The brand they carried in the salon was not this colorists favorite - she recommended Clairol Professional Shimmer Lights ( go to Sally Beauty down the street she said)</li>
            <li> Keeps my white hair less yellow without turning it too brilliant a blue.</li>
            <li> It keeps our hair shiny and not dull looking .</li>
            <li> and it did make them more of a platnium it didn&#x27;t mess with my natural brown hair</li>
            <li> I have light pink hair, and as far as light pink hair goes, it often turns salmon or orange from standing out in the sun.</li>
            <li> (Now that I have dye resistant grey hairs, this shampoo is even more important keeping my greys from looking dull &amp;</li>
            <li> I was skeptical as first, but this is great product and will buy again if necessary.</li>
            <li> to so I can live with the smell.  </li>
            <li> We live in the country and have a well.  </li>
            <li> We bought this to add silver highlights to my teenage daughter&#x27;s light blonde hair.  </li>
            <li> It smells VERY old lady&amp;#34;ish&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li> It was yellow and white and while not unattractive, I thought it would look better without the yellow.  </li>
            <li> Amazon provided their usual outstanding service in fixing the situation, but I learned a lesson... and so, as mentioned, I now order this separately.</li>
            <li> and it brings out my pretty blonde again.</li>
            <li> This is really all I have to say except for saying it is ridiculous to tell people how many words they must write.  </li>
            <li> I recently started using this product to get rid of the yellow/orange tones in my hair, specially after I do my roots and also at the back of my hair, closest to the neck doesn&#x27;t seem to pick up the bleach as well as the rest of my hair</li>
            <li> And if you use it too often or leave it too long on really light blonde hair, it leaves silvery streaks (or it can turn purple).</li>
            <li> This most definitely tones it down.</li>
            <li> the smell honestly isn&#x27;t that bad it used to be really strong</li>
            <li> bleached my hair, and the ends were still a very pale/pastel apricot color, so I put this straight on my dry hair for 10 minutes, washed it out, and my hair is almost platinum</li>
            <li> I have platinum blonde hair that gets yellow really quick.</li>
            <li> So strong that when I used it 2 nights ago and slept with wet hair, I woke up the next day so nauseous to the point of throwing up all day.</li>
            <li> Not worth the headache or clean up.</li>
            <li> The size of the bottle is large and should last me for months!  </li>
            <li> I use this shampoo to help to clear any residual product build up on my hair.</li>
            <li> Seeing it on Amazon, at a reasonable  price, and larger size, I ordered a twin pack..</li>
            <li> Came one day early.</li>
            <li> and it really does help if you have gray hair (to brighten and white it).  </li>
            <li> Clairol Professional Shimmer Lights Shampoo has the quality one expects from Clairol.</li>
            <li> If it&#x27;s orange at all or really yellow, it won&#x27;t do much of anything.</li>
            <li> I purchased this to remove the yellowing to the tips of my otherwise naturally SILVER hair.</li>
            <li> the only complains is it Made my hair really greasy.</li>
            <li> it literally smells like 80 year old woman.</li>
            <li> I am NOT a blue haired lady thanks to this product.</li>
            <li> Arrived early and intact.</li>
            <li> it does remove the brassiness from the blonde and whitens the gray, but it also is a very drying shampoo, so condition well after using</li>
            <li> Like an old lady.</li>
            <li> This is the only toning shampoo that I&#x27;ve tried that really works.</li>
            <li> I am going to mix in my regular shampoo with it to see if that cuts the smell, otherwise I don&#x27;t know if I would use this much longer.</li>
            <li> Clairol Professional Shimmer Lights Shampoo was recommended to my wife by her beautician.</li>
            <li> It really gives gray hair a shine and takes any yellow tinges away.  </li>
            <li> either also I would recommend only using twice a week maximum because it it very damaging to the hair.  </li>
            <li> Thankfully nothing was damaged, but the cap was almost completely screwed off.</li>
            <li> She was really surprised as that would have helped keep my highlights from yellowing.</li>
            <li> It has helped keep my light brown store box hair dye from turning brassy, orange, or green.</li>
            <li> keeps  it soft as well as allowing it to have its natural body.</li>
            <li> completely-</li>
            <li> I am a natural brunette with bleached blonde/toned hair</li>
            <li> My hair is naturally silver and this shampoo keeps it from yellowing.</li>
            <li> I have recommended this to all of my friends who have highlights, weaves or natural streaks.</li>
            <li> Used once or twice a week, it really brings out the highlights without creating that \\&quot;blue-hair\\&quot; look that seems to result with some similar products.</li>
            <li> I thought it might be a bit old lady</li>
            <li> Also it does work in terms of making golden blonde hair into ashy blonde ( platinum).</li>
            <li> I am poor and do my own hair coloring ...</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend to any blondes who have natural red tones in their hair to help control the brassiness.  </li>
            <li> a messy clean up since the shampoo is purple.  </li>
            <li> main reason for this shampoo is to remove the yellowing that can occur in your hair, if white headed.  </li>
            <li> A purple mess in a plastic bag, top was loose and spilled</li>
            <li> The cap was on loose, who packages things without making sure the lid is tight?  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend it to anyone who has blonde hair and mineral water.</li>
            <li> It has a strange smell to it and is very purple in color.</li>
            <li> I have honestly never loved my hair more than I do now.</li>
            <li> I recently went from dyed  copper red hair all the way to white blonde ( thanks to a salon), Sadly not all the orange could be lifted after 3 treatments .This</li>
            <li> I used it just like regular shampoo, not leaving it in any longer than normal and noticed a result immediately.  </li>
            <li> The shop where I normally purchase told me to hold off purchasing because it was going on sale the next week.</li>
            <li> not  dull yellow.</li>
            <li> This is the only new thing that I have added to my shower and it has dryed my hair a lot.</li>
            <li> Plus, I have read that if you use it too much, it can dry your hair.</li>
            <li> At least it comes in a really big bottle :-)</li>
            <li> it really works if you use it in your DRY hair, about half-hour before you wash, dont wet your hair before because it will not give the same results, it helped my highlights to get lighter and brighter, less yellowish, more platinum look.</li>
            <li> This hair product I&#x27;ve used for year, having turned WHITE at a young age.  </li>
            <li> I have naturally brown hair and bleach it blonde.</li>
            <li> It leaves my blonde looking really natural and shiny</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a darker ash blonde naturally, so I am prone to brassiness.</li>
            <li> This barely makes a change.</li>
            <li> My natural blonde hair that is on the darker side but gets lighter streaks during the summer.</li>
            <li> I purchased Shimmer Lights back in summer 2011 (it is now nearly summer 2012).</li>
            <li> (recently lightened from dark brown dyed from a box to a full foil of blonde highlights).</li>
            <li> so didn&#x27;t receive full bottle. :\</li>
            <li> I layered it on my ends and midshaft on dry hair ,not expecting too much because those parts just would not lift  the left over orange tones</li>
            <li> Because this shampoo is very purple, it can stain other items.</li>
            <li> We have hard water and this product keeps the blonde color light without looking brassy or orange.  </li>
            <li> Not good if you have fine hair.  </li>
            <li> I ALWAYS get compliments on my hair color from others who say it has such a natural look, or they wish they could achieve this type of blonde.</li>
            <li> I only have to use 2-3 pumps also as it lathers up very well unlike other brands I have tried.</li>
            <li> This stuff is great--it really helps tone down the lingering brassiness in my hair</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t smoke, so I don&#x27;t really know why it yellows slightly with age</li>
            <li> In order to get any suds, I have to use twice as much of the product as I needed to use with my previous shampoo.  </li>
            <li> Other than a professional movie actor...)</li>
            <li> luckily the mess was contained in the bag but quite a bit was wasted.  </li>
            <li> This product was recommended by my new hair colorist after she read my notes from previous visits to the salon.</li>
            <li> I started out with natural dark blonde.</li>
            <li> I have tried maybe 5 different &amp;#34;shimmer&amp;#34; or &amp;#34;for grey and blonde hair&amp;#34; shampoos.</li>
            <li> I would definitely recommend it for grey hair.</li>
            <li> I will continue to use this as long as my hair is blonde.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re a blonde or have grey hair this is the shampoo for you.</li>
            <li> Does a terrific job of &amp;#34;brightening&amp;#34; my silver grey hair</li>
            <li> If you are looking for a shampoo for your Grey&#x27;s &amp; whites look no further</li>
            <li> i used it several times a week all year long</li>
            <li> Product arrived on time - BUT - The pump top had twisted loose and allowed some of  the shamppoo to spill into the plastic bag that the product was sealed in.</li>
            <li> Washes away yellow tone and leaves grey sparkling!</li>
            <li> This bottle will last me a very long time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The smell is still present in my dry hair today.</li>
            <li> The only problem is that I have dry hair and</li>
            <li> and it doesn&#x27;t turn my hair white or dry it out either.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this stuff every single time I have gone blonde, and I swear by it.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> so I used this again except I let my run underthe water long after all the shampoo was out</li>
            <li> It makes grey hair shine.</li>
            <li> I have grey hair that is highlighted.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t leave it on for too long through</li>
            <li> I plan to use it as long as Clairol keeps making it.  </li>
            <li> I get lots of complements on my long silver hair.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> This shampoo (along with shimmer lights conditioner) keeps my grey looking beautiful.&lt;br /&gt;Now</li>
            <li> My hairdresser introduced this product to me after Pantene stopped producing their shampoo for grey hair.&lt;br /&gt;My</li>
            <li> just that Grey&#x27;s &amp; whites.</li>
            <li> I washed with this today and my hair, even when wet, brightened up instantly.</li>
            <li> I think I had to leave it so long because it was really, i mean, REALLY REALLY brassy.  </li>
            <li> I also mix a little bit of Shimmer Lights shampoo with my regular shampoo, and I mix a little Shimmer Lights conditioner with my regular conditioner, but it leaves my hair feeling soft and silky.</li>
            <li> Works so well, much nicer than other purple shampoos that I have used in the past.</li>
            <li> the other big plus is the price.  </li>
            <li> I made this mistake of using it every time I washed and it did dry out the hair.  </li>
            <li> Also, it makes your hair SO dry.</li>
            <li> It is SO tangly and frizzy and dry no matter</li>
            <li> Can dry the scalp/hair over time</li>
            <li> It does dry out the hair</li>
            <li> I do like that after a few washes my hair went from blonde to almost white</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t work right away though you need to use the shampoo on the regular and that&#x27;s difficult because of the smell.</li>
            <li> I then put a dark blonde box dye over that.</li>
            <li> If you are a platinum blonde, (not golden.)</li>
            <li> /&gt;Do be careful, it can turn your hair a bit grey or purple if you use it too often.</li>
            <li> It tones down white hair.  </li>
            <li> Cuts down on yellowing, but leaves no blue trace.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;The only down side on this shampoo</li>
            <li> /&gt;Bonus: I purchased this in June 2014, use it every day, and in February 2015, I still have half a bottle left.</li>
            <li> Although it is a larger size than what is sold at the salon, it appears that this product had been previously used.  </li>
            <li> as now there&#x27;s maybe half a bottle left</li>
            <li> I am a veteran of hair dye remorse and i always dye it then change my mind, well this time it was black</li>
            <li> The bottle came half way open and conditioner all over the bag.</li>
            <li> I usually buy this product locally for close to the same price.</li>
            <li> What a big purple sticky mess AND</li>
            <li> I noticed the box was too large for the 3 bottles of shampoo, and there was nothing but a thin sheet of paper to &amp;#34;pack&amp;#34; the bottles.</li>
            <li> I feel these alternate products are far less irritating to hair and skin and tone brassy notes as well as this without leaving a \\&quot;blue haired lady\\&quot; tint.</li>
            <li> I tried this shampoo just for something a little different.  </li>
            <li> It may be a little drying so just use extra conditioner.</li>
            <li> I only use it when I feel my hair is starting to dull</li>
            <li> Product as expected.</li>
            <li> It also dried out my hair big time.</li>
            <li> It is a &amp;#34;blueing&amp;#34; shampoo, so be careful to use in the shower, not at the sink.</li>
            <li> Lo and behold, in just a few days, I walked by him outside and the sun was shining on his hair.  </li>
            <li> It tones out the orangey pink colors too.</li>
            <li> I was worried that the chlorine would yellow (or even green) my hair.</li>
            <li> I have heavy bleach blonde highlights.</li>
            <li> We live in a small town &amp; I was having trouble finding it.</li>
            <li> Plain and simple.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not certain that it works.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Usually I use this about twice a week once my hair is the blonde/white that I want it to be just to keep out all of the yellow and orange tones that usually try to come back a few weeks after bleaching.&lt;br</li>
            <li> But, it isn&#x27;t a bad smell, just different, but I have quickly gotten used to it.</li>
            <li> Other than that</li>
            <li> Not sure how these other people were left with silky hair.</li>
            <li> I use it every other shampoo</li>
            <li> and I wash my hair every other day.</li>
            <li> I was worried about the smell from some other reviews--it smells like shampoo.</li>
            <li> I use it every other wash.</li>
            <li> The yellowing can come from medicines and other shampoos.</li>
            <li> I have tried other gray hair products when I couldn&#x27;t find Shimmering Lights</li>
            <li> and it got all over the other stuff I ordered.</li>
            <li> which in turn got all over my other items in the box.</li>
            <li> She asked if any of the other stylists/colorists had recommended a purple shampoo</li>
            <li> Im not sure if it actually works or</li>
            <li> Once it was included with a number of other items, the bottle leaked (ALOT), and almost everything else in the box was ruined.  </li>
            <li> otherwise it would be all over the box with other items.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve read other reviews that said the Clairol turned their hair purple or stained the tile in their shower, but I have had none of those problems.  </li>
            <li> When I returned the entire line was on sale except for this particular product, they would not honor the sale price, so I am not feeling bad about not keeping this purchase local.</li>
            <li> It is difficult to find this product in stores - unless you go to a beauty supply - and then they frequently carry the smaller size without the pump.  </li>
            <li> I have very pale yellow hair.</li>
            <li> When delivered, the pump was not locked down and even though the bottle was in a plastic bag, the product leaked out on other products and the box.  </li>
            <li> I work really hard at keeping my hair deep conditioned at all times.</li>
            <li> Well, it did not help keep the color looking bright and the smell was horrible.</li>
            <li> i have graying dark brown hair.  </li>
            <li> I lost at least a third of the product</li>
            <li> My only complaint was the packaging.</li>
            <li> I have thick asian hair</li>
            <li> and it helped tone down the overpowering smell.</li>
            <li> BUT LID HAD LEAKED IN BOX DOWN</li>
            <li> but I think they toned the perfume down</li>
            <li> Other than that tho!</li>
            <li> I live in an extremely dry climate, and my hair never looks dried out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used to buy this over the counter, but now it is even difficult to find it at beauty supply stores.</li>
            <li> I agree with a previous reviewer, it might have worked as descibed</li>
            <li> A bottle jus half that size if around $12 dollars at the barber.  </li>
            <li> Going to contact Amazon and see what they can do for me because now that over half the product is gone</li>
            <li> If you have processed hair, then you might have to leave it on for less time since your hair may be porous and prone to taking on a purple tint.  </li>
            <li> when I received it exploded and half was gone.</li>
            <li> However, the pump on the bottle was broken, which led to the shampoo leaking out and onto other products shipped in the same package.</li>
            <li> it seemed like the cap wasn&#x27;t on tight</li>
            <li> It is my go to shampoo when my hair needs a little brightening.  </li>
            <li> It became a little whiter than before.</li>
            <li> Gives my gray hair a little sparkle and shine.</li>
            <li> a little bit so I condition before</li>
            <li> Yes, it is dark purple out of the bottle, but don&#x27;t worry; I doubt if you&#x27;ll turn into a &amp;#34;blue-haired&amp;#34; lady - or man!  </li>
            <li> The color is a very dark purple.</li>
            <li> Despite thorough rinsing and conditioning, it left behind a purple haze of residue on my pillow case.</li>
            <li> What a waste for me.</li>
            <li> It will fade after a few days though.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Leaves a heavy film on the hair.  </li>
            <li> I have dark brown hair and usually have lighter highlights.</li>
            <li> If you havent tried this conditioner, your are missing out.</li>
            <li> My hair was totally brassy after making maaaany dying mistakes, really, it was yellow and orange, horrible.</li>
            <li> I was very skeptical at first that it would work.  </li>
            <li> Messy....</li>
            <li> I just used what leaked into the plastic bag, waste not, want not...</li>
            <li> Really lightens the blonde and keeps my ashy base ashy.</li>
            <li> Be wary of shipping this product with other items in the same box</li>
            <li> I live in an area with very hard water, which means my hair has always been an awkward brassy, gross reddish-brown color.</li>
            <li> Being from a small rural community, I cannot always find this product locally and if I do it is in a salon and is  expensive!</li>
            <li> Scalp felt very tight and itchy.</li>
            <li> Over time, the iron content in our water will leave my hair looking dull and a little brassy.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve ordered this item in the past and have advised that the product leaks during shipping.  </li>
            <li> then I can get locally (sad for my local beauty shop)</li>
            <li> When I use this I leave it in for 5-7 minutes and even with copious amounts of conditioner my hair is usually a rat&#x27;s nest after.</li>
            <li> it until past the time toreturn</li>
            <li> I usually get it from my barber.  </li>
            <li> I can not get past the smell.  </li>
            <li> I did NOT love the way it arrived.</li>
            <li> If someone had handled it some roughly, it would probably have broken and spilled everywhere.</li>
            <li> absolutely recommend this for those with hard water who are sick of living with brassy hair.</li>
            <li> Not a very pleasant smell</li>
            <li> The smell isnt disgusting just EXTREMELY strong.</li>
            <li> I have worked hard at home on my hair care routine.</li>
            <li> IT&#x27;S HARD TO FIND AN</li>
            <li> It never looks dull.  </li>
            <li> However all the gunk can builed up and make your hair look dull.</li>
            <li> HIGHLIGHTED HAIR MIGHT WANT TO USE THIS AT LEAST WEEKLY TO ELIMINATE THE YELLOWING THAT CAN BE SEEN ON LIGHTER HAIR.</li>
            <li> biggest complaint is the SCENT.</li>
            <li> at least 25 years.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t bother me in the least</li>
            <li> for the negative part of my review....</li>
            <li> I thought it was unavoidable and that I&#x27;d be forced to use demi-permanent color on my hair for the rest of my life.</li>
            <li> I looked like slim shady!</li>
            <li> A real MESS!</li>
            <li> But you can seriously feel the shine.</li>
            <li> but a lot less expensive.</li>
            <li> Seriously works.</li>
            <li> I have complained to hair dressers in the past that I hate that my blonde turns yellow-y...</li>
            <li> Frankly I am very disappointed in this in that my grey hair has never looked so grey before.</li>
            <li> I am a double process (base color &amp; highlights)</li>
            <li> I have not experienced this at all, but</li>
            <li> was broken upon arrival and some of the contents leaked all over the place</li>
            <li> This shampoo is very thick and leaves my hair silky and shiny!  </li>
            <li> It is difficult to find shampoo for gray hair.</li>
            <li> but if you have any lowlights in your hair it will strip the color because of all the sulfates in it which I didn&#x27;t realize it had unfortunately.  </li>
            <li> br /&gt;packaging failed and one of the containers had leaked purple shampoo inside of box.</li>
            <li> if its merely the placebo effect</li>
            <li> weird.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m afraid.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s quite unpleasant</li>
            <li> They can be a bit drying (though nowhere as bad as this Clairol product)</li>
            <li> It was bad, so I rushed to Sally&#x27;s and got this.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t seem so bad in the shower but the residual scent stays in my hair overnight and makes me feel nauseous: I&#x27;d describe it as a charcoal/chemical scent.</li>
            <li> Lathers well, smell is not to bad</li>
            <li> Just bad business.</li>
            <li> I still use it to keep my gray from turning ugly.  </li>
            <li> It was ugly.</li>
            <li> I HATE the smell of this product.</li>
            <li> I really hate this shampoo though.</li>
            <li> The smell is very unpleasant, overpowering and lingers all day.</li>
            <li> I hated my yellowish hair after having it done until someone had me try this.  </li>
            <li> I was very disappointed.</li>
            <li> but I could not get over the horrible chemical smell that stays with you.  </li>
            <li> Horrible shipping.</li>
            <li> HORRIBLE</li>

            <li> I have used this item before and it meets my expectations.</li>
            <li> Works like magic. Make sure you leave the lather in for 5 minutes</li>
            <li> Fast delivery. Product as expected.</li>
            <li> Love this product! Keeps the brassy away and my color continues to look fresh and bright.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff! Took all the red out of my bleach blonde highlights... especially if u blowdry it after wards... smells great also!</li>
            <li> I have used this shampoo for years with great results. The gray hair stays as silvery highlights, not  dull yellow. A friend recommended it who is a hair color specialist.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use the shampoo daily and the conditioner weekly. I live in an extremely dry climate, and my hair never looks dried out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used to buy this over the counter, but now it is even difficult to find it at beauty supply stores. Whenever i would see it on a store shelf, I would buy all that they had. I am so glad that i can easily find it on Amazon!</li>
            <li> I really like this shampoo, it perks up my gray hair.  The only reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is the smell, it just doesn&#x27;t have a nice shampoo smell.  Other than that, it is great!</li>
            <li> I love the robo aid.  This is my second one.  I like the shampoo also but I haven&#x27;t had t.ime to read the books but I will like them also.</li>
            <li> Yes it lightens hair pretty well as long as its not darker than yellow, if its more golden it will either make it brownish or greenish. The smell isnt disgusting just EXTREMELY strong. So strong that when I used it 2 nights ago and slept with wet hair, I woke up the next day so nauseous to the point of throwing up all day. The smell is still present in my dry hair today. So if you have a sensitivity to scents DO NOT BUY. It also dried out my hair big time. Not sure how these other people were left with silky hair. Also it leaked everywhere when it first arrived in the box.  I might try again but I dont know, but i definitely won&#x27;t buy this ever again.  UPDATE: so I used this again except I let my run underthe water long after all the shampoo was out and it helped tone down the overpowering smell. I do like that after a few washes my hair went from blonde to almost white like I want so I give this product 3 stars instead of 2. Just use with a really good conditioner so your hair doesnt dry out.</li>
            <li> My hairdresser suggested this product, it really works great at keeping highlights bright.  I only use once or twice a week, as suggested by hairdresser, she said if you use more than that it could give a purplish hue to your hair.  You can get this at Sallys Beauty supply as well, but they only carry the regular sized bottles.</li>
            <li> I really didn&#x27;t notice any color difference and it totally dried out my hair whenever I did use it. I dread using this and eventually I just stopped all together with 3/4 the bottle left.</li>
            <li> My Mother in Law wanted me to search out this product because her hair dresser uses it and she loves it.</li>
            <li> gives good shine and hair is clean in one application</li>
            <li> Sometimes a detailed review is not necessary when a product meets ones expectations.</li>
            <li> Great value and great shampoo.</li>
            <li> Local hairdresser charges twice the price. What a great deal!</li>
            <li> Does a great job of removing brassiness from my blonde hair.</li>
            <li> Best blonding for hair there is. Yes it smells like old people, but it works wonderful to get the yellow out!</li>
            <li> Helped prevent my blonde from turning brassy. Really nice product. Gave 4 starts bc I prefer the Loreal version of this, but the Clairol version is still a great product..</li>
            <li> LOVE THIS SHAMPOO!!! I am a double process (base color &amp; highlights) color treated light blonde, and this shampoo REALLY helps to keep my color looking fresh and new in between salon visits! We have hard water and this product keeps the blonde color light without looking brassy or orange.  Not to mention the rich lather it provides! If you have BLONDE or SILVER hair, this product is truly a must have! Amazon&#x27;s price is the best!!!</li>
            <li> Fast turn around.  Great product for a super price!</li>
            <li> Product was delivered on time.  I&#x27;ve ordered this item in the past and have advised that the product leaks during shipping.  this delivery was no exception.  the only difference was the bottle was sealed in plastic so the product leaked inside the plastic covering, not in the box.  a messy clean up since the shampoo is purple.  again, i strongly suggest to the manufacturer that they ship the pump separately and use a regular screw top to avoid leaks.  if i didn&#x27;t like this product i would not continue to order.  i have graying dark brown hair.  fortunately, my grays are growing spradically so they look like highlights.  sometimes people do notice a purple cast but in a good way.</li>
            <li> Really like this shampoo. Brightens up my silver hair and gives it nice body. Would recommend to any one with silver hair.</li>
            <li> This shampoo helps to keep the color in my hair vibrant.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used many shampoos to keep my gray hair looking good. This shampoo keeps it from yellowing and gives it a nice shine. I get lots of compliments about my salt and pepper hair and always give the credit too shimmer lights.</li>
            <li> This hair product I&#x27;ve used for year, having turned WHITE at a young age.  Seeing it on Amazon, at a reasonable  price, and larger size, I ordered a twin pack.. I think I&amp;#34;m set for life with this order.</li>
            <li> Came one day early. Very nice when lathering onto my entire main of hair :)</li>
            <li> This product works really well!! If you have your hair highlighted or colored blonde, using this product extends the blonde look...shiny and healthy looking to boot. When we have our hair done, it is really expensive, so getting the most for your money/time is important. It certainly does this for myself and my daughters. It is recommended that one use it once a week, but I do occasionally use it more than once with no ill effects. The price is superb! Try pricing it away from Amazon...ouch!!! I couldn&#x27;t afford to use it for three of us if not for the pricing available here. It is a &amp;#34;blueing&amp;#34; shampoo, so be careful to use in the shower, not at the sink. When you dispense using the convenient pump, hold your hand there and wipe your fingers over the spout to get rid of drips...and wipe up any drips as soon as you are able to avoid a light staining that eventually wears away. It is not a shampoo that lathers up a lot...and I do a follow up shampoo with my regular shampoo, followed with conditioner to get whatever effects I need from them. Excellent product and economical in this size and from Amazon.</li>
            <li> Amazing product and helps maintain a great blonde color. It is great for highlights and full color.&lt;br /&gt;I use this product when I get highlights and the product for brunettes too. They are both fantastic.</li>
            <li> Terribly strong chemical smell, as the other reviewers noted. My heavy-duty conditioner wasn&#x27;t enough to counteract how brittle it left my hair. Scalp felt very tight and itchy. Despite thorough rinsing and conditioning, it left behind a purple haze of residue on my pillow case. Finally, I came to realize the scalp itching had gotten out of hand, and indeed, my allergies flared up after using this product. Most of the bottle remains (despite a good portion of it spilling in transit - mess!) but I will not be passing the leftovers to family members. Because of the good price and easy Prime shipping, I really wanted this to work. But after my experience, I cannot recommend this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are considering this product, read reviews and compare with AG Hair Cosmetics Silver and Matrix Solutionists So Silver. Both of those work beautifully, leaving glossy hair with plenty of silver shine and a light, pleasant scent. They can be a bit drying (though nowhere as bad as this Clairol product) so use a good conditioner and a moisturizing shampoo on alternate days. I feel these alternate products are far less irritating to hair and skin and tone brassy notes as well as this without leaving a \\&quot;blue haired lady\\&quot; tint.</li>
            <li> I use this shampoo to help to clear any residual product build up on my hair. Works well. It arrived on time and in good condition.</li>
            <li> The shampoo was sent with per knowledge it leaks. There was shampoo all over everything in the box. The shampoo had been taped in hopes to prevent leakage but it didn&#x27;t even phase it. Not worth the headache or clean up.</li>
            <li> I have been using this shampoo for years and I will never stop purchasing it!  It is my go to shampoo when my hair needs a little brightening.  I even had a guy at work ask me if I got my hair done because it made it look so much brighter!!! It is a must buy for blondes!</li>
            <li> It works. It has a strange smell to it and is very purple in color. I use it once a week just so my hair doesn&#x27;t turn yellow. I just wish it smelled better.</li>
            <li> When I got it half of it had leaked out in the box but the product is great.</li>
            <li> I HATE the smell of this product. It would probably be okay if you don&#x27;t mind smelling like an old lady, but I don&#x27;t want to...</li>
            <li> My hair is salt-and-pepper and the white parts are my favorites.  Shimmer Lights keeps these strands as white as they can possibly be, and I never want to be without this products so I bought the biggest bottle I could :)</li>
            <li> Perfect for by silver (not gray!) hair... it highlights the silver and shines.  Makes coarse hair easy to manage and silky smooth.</li>
            <li> I have naturally brown hair and bleach it blonde. I recently started using this product to get rid of the yellow/orange tones in my hair, specially after I do my roots and also at the back of my hair, closest to the neck doesn&#x27;t seem to pick up the bleach as well as the rest of my hair so it&#x27;s always a little more orangy. This product works amazing. It leaves my blonde looking really natural and shiny I absolutely love it. The only problem is that I have dry hair and although it says that it is a conditioning shampoo, I feel like it dries my hair out even more so I only use it about once a week and I use the shimmer lights blonde &amp; silver conditioner with it as well.</li>
            <li> Smells very strong, if you are scent sensitive beware.  Seems to reduce the brassiness.</li>
            <li> Be sure to read the instructions about leaving it on for 3-5 minutes.  But you can seriously feel the shine.</li>
            <li> It is difficult to find shampoo for gray hair. Clairol Shimmering Lights is the best on the market; yet, difficult for me to locate where I live. Amazon is a great source for finding this product!</li>
            <li> This sure did the trick!  Every time I washed my hair with this shampoo, it neutralized the blonde brass.  I have thick asian hair so I had a lot of red to take out to get that ash blonde affect.  I originally tried to do it myself, but finally ended up going to my salon to do a color correction.  I purchased this based on a recommendation from a youtube video.  So glad I did!  My recommendation would be to not wash more than once a week if you already have dryer, damaged hair.  I made this mistake of using it every time I washed and it did dry out the hair.  Once I got into a normal routine of once a week, it worked beautifully.  My hair retained that ashy color I was going for.  I am now going back to brunette, but if I ever go blonde again, I will be repurchasing!</li>
            <li> I have been using the for years, I really like they way it takes out the yellow for my gray/blonde hair. Smells great and cleans really well.</li>
            <li> This product is awesome!  I would highly recommend to any blondes who have natural red tones in their hair to help control the brassiness.  Smells good &amp; lathers wonderfully!</li>
            <li> I did research and finally zeroed in on this product.  It is amazing.  I bought it for my husband who is letting his hair grow out.  It was yellow and white and while not unattractive, I thought it would look better without the yellow.  Lo and behold, in just a few days, I walked by him outside and the sun was shining on his hair.  It was shimmering white--and gorgeous.  [He would prefer this product without any scent though].  I bought both the shampoo and the conditioner.  He uses the shampoo three times a week, and the conditioner every day. It works!</li>
            <li> I have a hereditary white mane and have been using Shimmer Lights for years.&lt;br /&gt;I will not use anything else.&lt;br /&gt;Shimmer, shine, white, and mine.&lt;br /&gt;Perfect.</li>
            <li> Seems to work fairly well as a shampoo for white hair, giving it a shiny white appearance. As others have noted, there is a fairly strong medicinal smell that lingers lightly on the hair. I will go back to Jhirmack or Pantene when this is used up if they are available. The prices for those are better and, while I don&#x27;t love the scents (one smells somewhat of grape bubblegum!), I like them better than the Clairol.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t imagine what is in this product that it does what it does to my hair - ugh. What a waste for me.</li>
            <li> I agree with a previous reviewer, it might have worked as descibed but I could not get over the horrible chemical smell that stays with you.  I kept trying to ignore it but finally ended up having to wash my hair numerous times to finally get rid of the smell.</li>
            <li> I have worked hard at home on my hair care routine. A coworker asked me if my hair was naturally blonde. It&#x27;s a darker ash blonde naturally, so I am prone to brassiness. Shimmer lights is my secret weapon for keeping my platinum bright and beautiful! The first bottle I bought lasted me for over a year.</li>
            <li> nice size and it really does help if you have gray hair (to brighten and white it).  Can&#x27;t find this size and/or both shampoo-conditioner together at any store around here.</li>
            <li> Excellent shampoo for gray hair, leaves hair silky and silver colored!</li>
            <li> Love this shampoo. It makes grey hair shine.</li>
            <li> Clairol Professional Shimmer Lights Shampoo has the quality one expects from Clairol. I would definitely recommend it for grey hair.</li>
            <li> A purple mess in a plastic bag, top was loose and spilled</li>
            <li> Love this shampoo. Smells great, and works to tone my hair. I leave it sitting on my hair to really get the purple stain. It tones out the orangey pink colors too. Has lasted forever!</li>
            <li> When I had blonde hair, this would restore the color so well and it would look all vibrant again after each use.</li>
            <li> Really lightens the blonde and keeps my ashy base ashy. Lathers up nicely, doesn&#x27;t stain my shower walls or floor. Easy to rinse out.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been buying shimmer lights for years at a local beauty store since going light blonde and this bottle was just as good but a lot less expensive. Shimmer lights does a great job getting a whiter blonde for my hair.</li>
            <li> Shampoo itself is fine, pretty drying, but that&#x27;s to be expected from a toning shampoo. However, the pump on the bottle was broken, which led to the shampoo leaking out and onto other products shipped in the same package.</li>
            <li> I was so happy to find this for my Son &amp; at a good price. We live in a small town &amp; I was having trouble finding it. Thanks Amazon!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the only product I&#x27;ve found that doesn&#x27;t &amp;#34;yellow&amp;#34; my white hair! I use it in combination with the cream rinse.</li>
            <li> I live in an area with very hard water, which means my hair has always been an awkward brassy, gross reddish-brown color. I thought it was unavoidable and that I&#x27;d be forced to use demi-permanent color on my hair for the rest of my life. Then I read an article online about this miracle shampoo. Within a week of using it, my hair was brass-free, shiny and beautiful! I have honestly never loved my hair more than I do now. I will never not use this shampoo again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bonus: I purchased this in June 2014, use it every day, and in February 2015, I still have half a bottle left. Very economical.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I absolutely recommend this for those with hard water who are sick of living with brassy hair.</li>
            <li> This is simply great shampoo, and the best part is it&#x27;s cheaper on amazon then I can get locally (sad for my local beauty shop) but for this size and price I cant beat it!</li>
            <li> I have very pale yellow hair. My roots are virtually white without toner. This barely makes a change. I was very disappointed.</li>
            <li> I have only used this shampoo once, it smells really great &amp; brought the highlights out very nicely. My hair felt really soft and silky afterwards, but it did not remove the brassiness from my hair as I expected. I&#x27;m hoping maybe a few more times it will.</li>
            <li> I use this every day and it keeps my hair from having any brassiness. Love it!!! Great service, too! A+</li>
            <li> ANYBODY WITH GRAY/BLONDE/HIGHLIGHTED HAIR MIGHT WANT TO USE THIS AT LEAST WEEKLY TO ELIMINATE THE YELLOWING THAT CAN BE SEEN ON LIGHTER HAIR. IT BRIGHTENS HIGHLIGHTS. IT LATHERS GREAT&#x27; SMELLS GOOD AND PROVIDES SOME CONDITIONING, ENOUGH FOR ME. IT&#x27;S HARD TO FIND AN AND THE PRICE IS GOOD FOR SUCH A LARGE BOTTLE WITH PUMP.</li>
            <li> Leaky pump. It always makes my bath tub purple and kind of messy. I don&#x27;t love the design and the hassle of clean up</li>
            <li> Have been using this shampoo for 3 years now (as recommended by my stylist) - keeps my highlights in shape, not drying - lovely.</li>
            <li> Bought it for my mom. It&#x27;s a great deal</li>
            <li> This stuff works but only if your hair is really light to begin with. If it&#x27;s orange at all or really yellow, it won&#x27;t do much of anything. And if you use it too often or leave it too long on really light blonde hair, it leaves silvery streaks (or it can turn purple). (This happened to my sister). Also, it makes your hair SO dry. When I use this I leave it in for 5-7 minutes and even with copious amounts of conditioner my hair is usually a rat&#x27;s nest after. It is SO tangly and frizzy and dry no matter how much leave-in product I use. I think the shimmer lights conditioner might be better, it won&#x27;t strip your hair so much!</li>
            <li> I have grey hair that is highlighted. I have tried maybe 5 different &amp;#34;shimmer&amp;#34; or &amp;#34;for grey and blonde hair&amp;#34; shampoos. This one is the best, hands down. Leaves your hair silvery and sparkly. I am called &amp;#34;The Silver Fox&amp;#34;, thanks to shimmer lights.  That&#x27;s funny because I&#x27;m 67! I tried the conditioner and didn&#x27; like it at all. so buy this shampoo and get a good conditioner and you are all set - unless you have brown hair.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t use everyday or it will turn your hair a grayish color but good product.</li>
            <li> Nice toner.helps keep the brassy away.</li>
            <li> I purchased this to remove the yellowing to the tips of my otherwise naturally SILVER hair. I don&#x27;t smoke, so I don&#x27;t really know why it yellows slightly with age...I have since switched to another brand and it&#x27;s a bit better.</li>
            <li> This does take the orange/yellow tones out of bleached hair I have highlights and it did make them more of a platnium it didn&#x27;t mess with my natural brown hair the only complains is it Made my hair really greasy.</li>
            <li> I was looking for an affordable purple/toning shampoo for blondes. After doing my research I decided on Shimmer Lights. This stuff is great--it really helps tone down the lingering brassiness in my hair (recently lightened from dark brown dyed from a box to a full foil of blonde highlights). I will continue to use this as long as my hair is blonde. I use it every other shampoo and I wash my hair every other day. I was worried about the smell from some other reviews--it smells like shampoo. But anyways you&#x27;re most likely buying this for function, not the smell.</li>
            <li> I used to really like this shampoo, but recently I feel like it has been leaving a lot more residue in my hair such that my hair is stiffer and feels oiler.</li>
            <li> This shampoo is great for highlighting and excentuating the gray hair that I no longer can fight.  This has made my transition so much better! Great price too!!!</li>
            <li> I bought this at Sally&#x27;s however I thought I would still leave a review. I recently went from dyed  copper red hair all the way to white blonde ( thanks to a salon), Sadly not all the orange could be lifted after 3 treatments .This stuff saved my sanity! I layered it on my ends and midshaft on dry hair ,not expecting too much because those parts just would not lift  the left over orange tones but I thought \\&quot; why not?\\&quot;, after an hour I rinsed it out. I am impressed ! There are some purple streaks where my hair soaked it up and kept it  but I&#x27;d rather have a  very light lavender streak here and there vs.the yellow-orange ends I did have. I am so happy I had this on hand.</li>
            <li> I have been home lightening my hair for over 10 years.  Over time, bleached hair can take on an orange or brassy tone.  Using this shampoo twice a week keeps my hair looking great.  (Now that I have dye resistant grey hairs, this shampoo is even more important keeping my greys from looking dull &amp; yukky.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I appreciate having a pump bottle - very convenient &amp; easy to use in the shower.  This bottle will last me a very long time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good lather &amp; good smell.  I often reach for this shampoo more than I really need to.</li>
            <li> Works great at keeping the brass away but is rather drying to the hair. This is the only new thing that I have added to my shower and it has dryed my hair a lot. I recommend alternating between this and a moisturizing shampoo.</li>
            <li> This awesome shampoo lightened my dyed blonde hair in one washing.  It tends to get brassy looking and needs to be Malibu treated every month....hopefully not anymore!!</li>
            <li> Love this stuff! Leaves my hair feeling silky smooth! It is purple in color, but washes off tub easily- doesn&#x27;t stain.</li>
            <li> I use this on my hair and it keeps the yellow out as my hair is all white and it makes it more lustrous and shiney.  Good price also and this will last me along time.  I am glad Clairol has something like this to keep my hair pretty/or lovely and fresh looking.  Highly recommend those who have white/gray hair to use it.</li>
            <li> it didn&#x27;t make my hair ashier but it does prevent it from getting brassy. biggest complaint is the SCENT. it literally smells like 80 year old woman. make sure to get a really nice smelling conditioner so people don&#x27;t think you just signed up for AARP.</li>
            <li> Works great on my silver hair!  I use it every other wash. Sure to last for months. Love the pump!</li>
            <li> Really like this shampoo, highly recommend.  Great seller!</li>
            <li> This does a great job of removing the yellow from my platinum blonde bleached hair.  The smell is a bit off putting, but this shampoo does what it is supposed to so I can live with the smell.  I only leave on for one minute because I don&#x27;t have much yellow now that i&#x27;ve had my hair this shade for over a year, but this does a great job of making my hair look as bright as it did when I just had it bleached.  It never looks dull.  Don&#x27;t leave it on for too long through or you could turn your hair purple.  Great product!</li>
            <li> Shimmer lights takes the yellow out converting gray hair to silver hair.  Only need to use it once a week.</li>
            <li> Keeps my white hair less yellow without turning it too brilliant a blue. Wouldn&#x27;t mistake me for my grandma. Also, it&#x27;s large.</li>
            <li> This stuff is phenomenal. I had orange/yellow hair from a box-dye kit. It was bad, so I rushed to Sally&#x27;s and got this. I noticed a huge difference after 2 washes. Essential for blondes who have brassiness/orange tones in their hair.</li>
            <li> The shampoo product is EXCELLENT.  I&#x27;ve used it on my blonde hair for over a year and it&#x27;s a good product.  The problem is this particular container.  A number of people have posted that the pump on this container does not work.  For that reason alone, this item should be removed from Amazon.</li>
            <li> This shampoo worked great for taking the brassiness out of my blonde hair, but to me, the smell just wasn&#x27;t pleasant. I only used this for about a week and then stopped because I couldn&#x27;t handle the smell</li>
            <li> I am poor and do my own hair coloring ... so sometimes i can get the orangey blonde color&lt;br /&gt;this product works great to remove that &amp;#34;brashy&amp;#34; blond color and make your hair look more&lt;br /&gt;natural .... and it is a nice shampoo as well ... I always use this shampoo when I have colored&lt;br /&gt;my hair</li>
            <li> Shimmer Lights is the ONLY purple shampoo I use to keep my blond ashy and brass-free. The Amazon price is the best out there!</li>
            <li> I bought this because I needed something to keep my blonde looking... blonde. Well, it did not help keep the color looking bright and the smell was horrible. I guess you get what you pay for.</li>
            <li> It brightens up my blonde highlighted hair and is helpful to remove the golden tones that it gets over time.</li>
            <li> Product arrived on time - BUT - The pump top had twisted loose and allowed some of  the shamppoo to spill into the plastic bag that the product was sealed in.</li>
            <li> It is quite a powerful shampoo, and you won&#x27;t want to use it more than once a week. Get&#x27;s the yellowy atmospheric grunge out of gray hair, and produces a better look. If you&#x27;re a guy that doesn&#x27;t like to die your hair (have you ever seen a guy with good looking dyed gray hair? Other than a professional movie actor...) this is a shampoo you will appreciate.</li>
            <li> Works very well and is worth the money. I recently got a pixie cut and had it bleached. But instead of an ashy blonde, I got a yellow-orangey color.. It may have been because I dyed it red months before that. So I found this product from a girl who used it on YouTube. I bought it and used it after one wash with color conditioner, and I saw instant results. It became a little whiter than before. Each wash I leave it on for five minutes and it gets whiter and whiter. If you want a platinum blonde or the color that you wanted like a silver or ashy blonde, it&#x27;s great. Now I just need to bleach my roots :p</li>
            <li> I read the reviews and I thought to give a try, mmm I don&#x27;t like it, the smell bothers after a couple times of usage, the chemical odor is strong, if I let it stand for 3 mins my hair turns out with purple light in it, not even shampooing it with another product helps; the conditioner is nothing but a waste of time and money, it does not condition my hair at all, it just adds the purple color to it.&lt;br /&gt;The result is a very frizzy, orangey-bluish, smelly hair yackk.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m back to AG sterling Silver Toning,!</li>
            <li> This is perfect for toning down any brassiness left in your hair from bleaching. I&#x27;ve used this stuff every single time I have gone blonde, and I swear by it.&lt;br /&gt;I bleached my hair, and the ends were still a very pale/pastel apricot color, so I put this straight on my dry hair for 10 minutes, washed it out, and my hair is almost platinum already.&lt;br /&gt;Usually I use this about twice a week once my hair is the blonde/white that I want it to be just to keep out all of the yellow and orange tones that usually try to come back a few weeks after bleaching.&lt;br /&gt;Do be careful, it can turn your hair a bit grey or purple if you use it too often. It will fade after a few days though.&lt;br /&gt;Awesome shampoo!</li>
            <li> Awesome to lighten/whiten blonde highlights!</li>
            <li> You know how sometimes when you get highlights or your hair dyed a light blonde and it ends up with the reddish tinge.......yeah that. This most definitely tones it down. Plain and simple.</li>
            <li> Love this product as it keeps my white hair yellow streaks free. Love that I can order large bottle and not run out of product. I am NOT a blue haired lady thanks to this product. Arrived early and intact. Pleased and will order again.</li>
            <li> it does remove the brassiness from the blonde and whitens the gray, but it also is a very drying shampoo, so condition well after using</li>
            <li> This is a great shampoo for gray hair but this bottle arrived with a non-working pump.  My old bottle wasn&#x27;t empty so I didn&#x27;t&lt;br /&gt;Discover it until past the time toreturn</li>
            <li> This shampoo works great keeping my very light blonde hair from getting too bronze.  I used it just like regular shampoo, not leaving it in any longer than normal and noticed a result immediately.  The smell is not the best, kind of reminds me of walking through the perfume counter at a department store but it does not linger after the shampoo is washed out, after conditioning I can not even smell it anymore. I only have to use 2-3 pumps also as it lathers up very well unlike other brands I have tried. Overall, I am very pleased with this shampoo and it works very well.</li>
            <li> My hairstylist recommended this to me after getting blonde highlights. I have well water and it was dulling my highlights out pretty quickly. She does my hair monthly and I notice a huge difference in color when she touches up my roots despite using this shampoo. I&#x27;m not certain that it works. It does have a funky smell, too. Like an old lady.</li>
            <li> I loved this! Works fantastic on natrually blond hair that tends to get a bit of strwberry color to it. It really helped bring out the ashy tones in my hair. Will buy again</li>
            <li> I have premature white/gray hair.  I read about this shampoo in a woman&#x27;s magazine but couldn&#x27;t find it anywhere in our community.  I ordered it from Amazon and absolutely LOVE it.  My hair is so beautiful now.  It is shiny, silver and feels thicker. My hair is even more managable - not so stubborn. I have had many, many compliments on my hair since using the shampoo. I plan to use it as long as Clairol keeps making it.  I HIGHLY recommend this product for anyone with graying hair.  I will never have to color again!</li>
            <li> I have used this product for years.  I usually get it from my barber.  I found a great deal on it from Amazon.  I had to go for it.  A bottle jus half that size if around $12 dollars at the barber.  LIke I said my hair iis white.  It turned that way when I was only 30.  I know this product works because I have used it for at least 25 years.&lt;br /&gt;The main reason for this shampoo is to remove the yellowing that can occur in your hair, if white headed.  The yellowing can come from medicines and other shampoos.</li>
            <li> This is the only toning shampoo that I&#x27;ve tried that really works.</li>
            <li> Great for grey or white hair, especially when your water is &amp;#34;hard&amp;#34;. It tones down white hair.  I&#x27;ve had a lot of compliments on my hair color since I started using it.</li>
            <li> Leaves a heavy film on the hair.  Not good if you have fine hair.  OK for removing brassiness.  There are other product out there that I like more.</li>
            <li> What a big purple sticky mess AND this item is not eligible for return!! I lost at least a third of the product plus I had to clean it up!</li>
            <li> The yellow neutralizing purple toner part worked OK, but this shampoo smells absolutely REVOLTING. It smells like half of the bottle is filled with cheap men&#x27;s cologne. The smell is so strong it cancels out your own perfume. I threw it out after using it twice, it literally made me gag!</li>
            <li> Does what I need it to</li>
            <li> My natural blonde hair that is on the darker side but gets lighter streaks during the summer. I bought the shampoo and conditioner and after using it I did notice my hair looked a bit brighter and lighter, but I personally can&#x27;t get over the smell. It didn&#x27;t seem so bad in the shower but the residual scent stays in my hair overnight and makes me feel nauseous: I&#x27;d describe it as a charcoal/chemical scent. I am going to mix in my regular shampoo with it to see if that cuts the smell, otherwise I don&#x27;t know if I would use this much longer.</li>
            <li> Clairol Professional Shimmer Lights Shampoo was recommended to my wife by her beautician. It keeps our hair shiny and not dull looking .</li>
            <li> This product works well for highlighted hair and helps keep out the yellow/brassy tones.  Nice lathering shampoo.  I would recommend it to others with highlights or blonde hair.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re a blonde or have grey hair this is the shampoo for you. It&#x27;ll make your hair appear brighter and lighter.</li>
            <li> Takes the yellow out of my platinum hair!</li>
            <li> It gives my hair a purple color. I suppose I&#x27;d like that perhaps if I were younger, but it just doesn&#x27;t flow with my age. :)</li>
            <li> I have used this shampoo for years.  It really gives gray hair a shine and takes any yellow tinges away.  I have tried other gray hair products when I couldn&#x27;t find Shimmering Lights and they just don&#x27;t do the job.  It is difficult to find this product in stores - unless you go to a beauty supply - and then they frequently carry the smaller size without the pump.  I was thrilled to find out I could order it through Amazon.</li>
            <li> NIce and rich and works at taking all of that brassiness out of your hair. I always run red when I dye my hair blond or streak it and this shampoo eliminates that!! Love it!</li>
            <li> This is the BEST purple shampoo going! It takes the brass look out of my hair. Both my daughter &amp; I use it &amp; are very happy. Also, the bottle was damaged in shipping. Customer service was very quick to resolve the problem with no issue.  I will buy from them again.</li>
            <li> Works so well, much nicer than other purple shampoos that I have used in the past.Lathers well, smell is not to bad but it does the trick getting the brassy look out of color treated hair.</li>
            <li> Controls brassiness perfectly. Recommended by my hair stylist and I am very pleased.</li>
            <li> I have bleached blonde hair and I like to maintain that \\&quot;cool\\&quot; tone. I have tried a few other purple shampoos that were okay, but Shimmer Lights is by far the best! Just after one use I could notice a difference in my hair color. I use this shampoo 4-5 times a week and it doesn&#x27;t turn my hair white or dry it out either. I ALWAYS get compliments on my hair color from others who say it has such a natural look, or they wish they could achieve this type of blonde. It definitely keeps the brassiness out of my hair. I will only be using this purple shampoo from now on! A++</li>
            <li> I have been using this shampoo for about five years and have been purchasing it from Amazon about the last two years. The product adds shine to my graying hair. When you buy it from Amazon it is more reasonable and arrives very well packed in a timely  maner. Will continue buying from Amazon.</li>
            <li> This shampoo is very thick and leaves my hair silky and shiny!  I really like it and would buy it again.  The size of the bottle is large and should last me for months!  I would buy it again.</li>
            <li> I received this product yesterday and there was leakage in the box it came in.  Although it is a larger size than what is sold at the salon, it appears that this product had been previously used.  I have been purchased many goods through amazon.com and I have never recieved goods that look used or come damaged.</li>
            <li> EXCELLENT PRODUCT..BUT LID HAD LEAKED IN BOX DOWN ABOUT 4-5&amp;#34;..NEED TO MAKE SURE LID IS SECURE BEFORE MAILING..HAD LEAKED OUT ON LAPTOP CASE I&#x27;D ORDER WAS IN THE BOX ALSO.</li>
            <li> This arrived opened &amp; spilled out in the box. A real MESS!</li>
            <li> I just had my hubby purchase this for me from his amazon acct. And I have to say when it came in the mail it exploded in the box the entire bottle was soaked in it and it kept oozing out. The pump doesn&#x27;t work so it seemed like the cap wasn&#x27;t on tight that&#x27;s why it was leaking. I&#x27;m very upset by this as now there&#x27;s maybe half a bottle left and it got all over the other stuff I ordered. Going to contact Amazon and see what they can do for me because now that over half the product is gone it&#x27;s no longer a good deal. So now about the shampoo I think it does work well but if you have any lowlights in your hair it will strip the color because of all the sulfates in it which I didn&#x27;t realize it had unfortunately.  Not a very pleasant smell either also I would recommend only using twice a week maximum because it it very damaging to the hair.  Hope this helps</li>
            <li> Nice shampoo - gives blond/grey hair a nice shimmer</li>
            <li> Best Shampoo for grey hair&lt;br /&gt;packaging failed and one of the containers had leaked purple shampoo inside of box.</li>
            <li> Bought for someone else.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve heard good things about this product, but I just got it this evening and 1/4 of it was ALL over the bag - which in turn got all over my other items in the box. Thankfully nothing was damaged, but the cap was almost completely screwed off. Be wary of shipping this product with other items in the same box</li>
            <li> Works better than the other FOUR purple/blue shampoos I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> This product was recommended by my new hair colorist after she read my notes from previous visits to the salon. I always say I don&#x27;t want my highlights to be YELLOW.  She asked if any of the other stylists/colorists had recommended a purple shampoo - - Noooooo they hadn&#x27;t! She was really surprised as that would have helped keep my highlights from yellowing. The brand they carried in the salon was not this colorists favorite - she recommended Clairol Professional Shimmer Lights ( go to Sally Beauty down the street she said) I tried it, I love it, and I&#x27;m sticking with it! I&#x27;ll be purchasing from Amazon the next time though!!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really know if this product works or not.  I can not get past the smell.  If I had known it was so smelly I would never have purchased it.  I tried several times, trying to get use to the odor, but I could not.  I don&#x27;t like it and will never use it again.</li>
            <li> I purchased Shimmer Lights back in summer 2011 (it is now nearly summer 2012). I have gray hair and I also swim 3-5 days a week. I was worried that the chlorine would yellow (or even green) my hair. Initially I was worried about my gray/white hair turning yellow. I only use this product once a week. I also mix a little bit of Shimmer Lights shampoo with my regular shampoo, and I mix a little Shimmer Lights conditioner with my regular conditioner, but it leaves my hair feeling soft and silky. I don&#x27;t measure the ratio, but more Shimmer Lights than regular shampoo. I do that just to help extend my usage of Shimmer Lights. Plus, I have read that if you use it too much, it can dry your hair. I have not experienced this at all, but like I stated, I only use it once a week. It really brightens my whites, and really manages my fly away gray. I wouldn&#x27;t be without it anymore. I waited a year to write my review because I wanted to really see how I liked it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was put off by the smell in the beginning as well. Matter of fact I was a bit concerned about that after reading some reviews. But, it isn&#x27;t a bad smell, just different, but I have quickly gotten used to it. It doesn&#x27;t bother me in the least anymore.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have gray hair and you want to keep it shining, bright and white, then this is the product for you!</li>
            <li> My stylist has always recommeded that I use this product on lighlighted hair. I have dark brown hair and usually have lighter highlights. I started dying my own hair recently (light brown) and mix this with my regular shampoo and leave it on my hair while I shoer eg: wash my body and my face. It has helped keep my light brown store box hair dye from turning brassy, orange, or green. So I highly recommend this!&lt;br /&gt;Oh becareful and make sure you rinse your shower floor and tiles if it gets anywhere on them, it does tend to stain.&lt;br /&gt;Oh by the way I have a beauty card to a well known beauty supply store and still at that it is only 15-20 cents more expensive to order through here, but hey beats traffic and it&#x27;s delivered right to your door!</li>
            <li> Been using this for years.  My hair dresser recommended it when I was coloring my hair.  Now that I no longer color my hair I still use it to keep my gray from turning ugly.  Can&#x27;t beat the product for the price.</li>
            <li> I started out with natural dark blonde. Dyed it ultra light ash blonde (platinum) revlon box dye. Then dyed it dark brown (at a hair salon with strong stuff!) Then it turned maroon after a while! It was ugly. So I used color oops which turned it orange. I then put a dark blonde box dye over that. I used John frieda go blonde shampoo and conditioner to lighten it more. Well I wanted it back to platinum! So I used loreal colorist hair color remover and it worked! Only problem was it turned bright yellow! I looked like slim shady! Haha. Well that&#x27;s where this stuff comes in. I didn&#x27;t want to buy a toner bc I didn&#x27;t want it darker. Anyways I put this stuff on my hair 3 days in a row and now I have platinum white blonde :) I drenched it with this stuff every time and left it for 5-15 min. Then washed it again in the shower. I LOVE THIS STUFF! Don&#x27;t forget to use coconut oil! My second fav!</li>
            <li> Does a terrific job of &amp;#34;brightening&amp;#34; my silver grey hair</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s alright, thought it would last longer between washes. Maybe I should leave it on for longer than the recommended 5 minutes...</li>
            <li> Keeps my 5th best feature looking good</li>
            <li> Works great on my white hair.</li>
            <li> Love the way it turns my gray to silver.  I get lots of complements on my long silver hair.&lt;br /&gt;I saw it advertised on The View and ordered some right away and have used it twice a week&lt;br /&gt;for over a year and I recomend it highly.</li>
            <li> If you have blond high lights and pull brass this is a great product to cool your high lights down. It has been around forever but it&#x27;s not for blue haired grannies!</li>
            <li> Shimmer Lights Shampoo is a great product for my grey hair.  We live in the country and have a well.  Over time, the iron content in our water will leave my hair looking dull and a little brassy.  This shampoo (along with shimmer lights conditioner) keeps my grey looking beautiful.&lt;br /&gt;Now for the negative part of my review....This was shipped USPS.  I ordered 3 of the &amp;#34;pump-style&amp;#34;, large bottles of shampoo.  When they arrived the box was smashed in, and shampoo was leaking all over the inside of the box.  I noticed the box was too large for the 3 bottles of shampoo, and there was nothing but a thin sheet of paper to &amp;#34;pack&amp;#34; the bottles. No peanut styrofoam or popcorn wrap. I love this product.  I did NOT love the way it arrived. Horrible shipping. HORRIBLE</li>
            <li> This is a product I have purchased before and am very pleased with it.  It is excellent to use in keeping the cleanliness and color of the natural gray color of my hair and beard.  I would purchase it again and highly recommend to anyone.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for years. Great for blonde hair/ highlights. Takes out the Orange pigment, highlights look great- whitish/silver and not yellow! Use it everytime I wash my hair.</li>
            <li> Maravilhosooooo, super recomendo!</li>
            <li> have been using this product for a while.  my hair is graying very fast.  I had blak/brown hair.  the more gray i got the more mousey yellow my hair looked.  Now im a true salt &amp; pepper.  If you havent tried this conditioner, your are missing out.</li>
            <li> Great shampoo that I&#x27;ve used for many years!  My only complaint was the packaging. For whatever reasons the top wasn&#x27;t on it very good and some of it leaked out into the packaging.  That&#x27;s my only reason for not giving it 5 stars!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this shampoo for many years, and like the way it enhances my gray hair, remiving any yellow tones. My hair stylist recommended it.</li>
            <li> Yellow still shows, and the product leaves a smell on my hair that bothers me.  It does lather very well.</li>
            <li> Its been ok so far.  Smells good! Im not sure if it actually works or if its merely the placebo effect</li>
            <li> My hairdresser introduced this product to me after Pantene stopped producing their shampoo for grey hair.&lt;br /&gt;My hair is fine so I don&#x27;t need a conditioner with this. I always get compliments on how shiny and beautiful my hair looks.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m very happy with it. This bottle lasts almost a year.</li>
            <li> It is ok, not too great. I have platinum blonde hair that gets yellow really quick. This shampoo is too mild for my hair. I like the one from AG beauty a lot better.</li>
            <li> Shimmer lights is what you get on a gray hair. Worth it.</li>
            <li> Shampoo was fine, lid was loose so some spilled within the plastic cover. A better system needs to be found, so many reviews about spilled contents with this product.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff. Gives my gray hair a little sparkle and shine.</li>
            <li> This size it&#x27;s perfect and more convenient for my use, this product in small or large do the same job but I prefer this one better</li>
            <li> This shampoo smells like really strong baby powder if you can imagine that. And the smell sticks with you. It&#x27;s very fragrant almost like perfume so even after the shower people can smell it. It&#x27;s very noticeable and I didnt like it! This shampoo however does lather well. Also it does work in terms of making golden blonde hair into ashy blonde ( platinum). It doesn&#x27;t work right away though you need to use the shampoo on the regular and that&#x27;s difficult because of the smell.</li>
            <li> Does the job!  Cuts down on yellowing, but leaves no blue trace.  I use it once or twice weekly; it does have a strong odor, but no one else notices.</li>
            <li> it really works if you use it in your DRY hair, about half-hour before you wash, dont wet your hair before because it will not give the same results, it helped my highlights to get lighter and brighter, less yellowish, more platinum look.</li>
            <li> My hair was totally brassy after making maaaany dying mistakes, really, it was yellow and orange, horrible. I decided to try this shampoo. I left it on for about 3 minutes, I didn&#x27;t want my hair to turn purple or gray. Though it helped, it really didn&#x27;t make a huge change. The day after, I decided to give it another try, leaving it longer. I ended up leaving it for about 40 minutes, may be more. It really, really helped then. I think I had to leave it so long because it was really, i mean, REALLY REALLY brassy.  I noticed my hair starts getting brassy again, so I&#x27;m using this product every 2, 3 days and my hair colour is great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do not use this on the ends of my hair, they turn kind of gray if i do.</li>
            <li> This shampoo helps keep those greys &amp; whites just that Grey&#x27;s &amp; whites. Use once a week. I love my white hair this shampoo keeps it from turning yellow. If you are looking for a shampoo for your Grey&#x27;s &amp; whites look no further this is it.</li>
            <li> The only hair shampoo that I use. The cost was very good.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for my gray hair for years to keep it from yellowing. My hairdresser recommended it and it does the trick. Can find it anymore around town. Good value</li>
            <li> So good for my grey hair, does not give it a purple sheen at all.  Makes it kinda silvery and shiny.</li>
            <li> I am a veteran of hair dye remorse and i always dye it then change my mind, well this time it was black and i went back to blonde and I got to the point of a very light tangerine color but i already bleached it 3 times and my scalp threatened to kill me if i did anymore so i quit.. I am right now using shimmer lights as a toner and omg its fantastic and the smell honestly isn&#x27;t that bad it used to be really strong but I think they toned the perfume down and now i like the smell. My hair was super pourous though so its taking the orange right out.. i just misted my hair with water and lathered in a heaping helping of the shampoo and let it sit.. great shampoo seriously for violet shampoo its the best.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s an okay shampoo, but honestly I don&#x27;t see any changes in my hair color, the bronze is still there I don&#x27;t think the purple is doing anything except staining my bathtub.</li>
            <li> My hair is foiled and has been for years.  This is the best &#x27;purple&#x27; shampoo I have every used and it&#x27;s so mild I can use it every day for extra body.</li>
            <li> Works okay, just not a quality product.</li>
            <li> Does the job. Don&#x27;t like the granny smell though!</li>
            <li> great product..  would recommend to anyone.</li>
            <li> Keeps the yellow that tarnishes white hair out, but use it more sparingly and use more natural shampoos in between.  Can dry the scalp/hair over time</li>
            <li> Keeps brassiness out of my highlights, and don&#x27;t have to use it too often. It does dry out the hair a little bit so I condition before and after I use it, and try not to use it TOO much.</li>
            <li> I love this product and have used it for sometime.  This is really all I have to say except for saying it is ridiculous to tell people how many words they must write.  I guess you don&#x27;t really want feedback.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product over the years because I have blond highlights in my hair. I only use it once or twice a week, but still decided to get this one since it&#x27;s such a good deal. It&#x27;s much more expensive in a salon and Target.</li>
            <li> I went to a salon and those jerks made my hair orange. Luckily I decided to search for hair products that can help the orange. Not only did this product help, it gave my hair the beautiful ash blond I was going for! Love this shampoo! It stains easily so make sure to wipe it off if it leaks anywhere it&#x27;s not supposed to. Other than that tho! It&#x27;s amazing!</li>
            <li> the shampoo was GREAT, however the lid wasn&#x27;t on tight and the package had shampoo in it................so I didn&#x27;t get all of it, oh well, guess those things happen</li>
            <li> When delivered, the pump was not locked down and even though the bottle was in a plastic bag, the product leaked out on other products and the box.  Because this shampoo is very purple, it can stain other items.</li>
            <li> Item as described and shipped on time</li>
            <li> I have complained to hair dressers in the past that I hate that my blonde turns yellow-y...No one ever told me about purple shampoo/conditioner. I was told to use this once per week. I use 1-2 times per week. Mostly once per week..if I go too long and start seeing my hair go golden, I use it and it&#x27;s GONE!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only down side on this shampoo..sometimes the shampoo drips out the pump (where it normally comes out)..It does not do it a lot.. just like a drop every 2-3 weeks.</li>
            <li> The smell is very unpleasant, overpowering and lingers all day. It smells like beauty salons, and not in a good way. We dumped this shampoo after just one washing and recycled the bottle.</li>
            <li> (do you remember that ad.....for pepsodent?)  But this isn&#x27;t for toothpaste.  I&#x27;ve been using Shimmer lights for years; first with my blonde hair, and more recently with the gray!  For my hair, it is a bit drying, so I use a good conditioner with an occasional oil treatment.  (I don&#x27;t use the Shimmer Lights conditioner; I think the combination is too drying.)  But this does a great job with &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; coloring... Yes, it is dark purple out of the bottle, but don&#x27;t worry; I doubt if you&#x27;ll turn into a &amp;#34;blue-haired&amp;#34; lady - or man!  However, when I order from Amazon, I always order this separately.  Once it was included with a number of other items, the bottle leaked (ALOT), and almost everything else in the box was ruined.  Amazon provided their usual outstanding service in fixing the situation, but I learned a lesson... and so, as mentioned, I now order this separately.</li>
            <li> after nexxus simply silver was discontinued i couldn&#x27;t find a product i liked.  this one was recommended to me at sally&#x27;s beauty but now that i found it on amazon it is much easier to buy.  i alternate with pantene&#x27;s silver expressions which i found at drugstore.com after i couldn&#x27;t find it in stores anymore.  both work well for me and make my hair shine.  the other big plus is the price.  avoid the dreaded blue hair by rinsing promptly.</li>
            <li> Love it! Easy to use, five minutes on hair two/three times a week helps tone the brassiness we all fear.&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t do it tooooo much or your hair will look greyish/darkish.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shimmer away!</li>
            <li> This product makes my gray hair look good but... It is bright purple in color.  If you miss any on the shower or bathtub tiles after you wash your hair, it leaves a purple stain that won&#x27;t come off. I have tried Windex, Softscrub and bleach but still have a stain on the floor of my ivory covered shower.  It also stains your clothes if you wash your hair in the sink and get some on your pjs.</li>
            <li> We bought this to add silver highlights to my teenage daughter&#x27;s light blonde hair.  I was very skeptical at first that it would work.  We left it in for one hour, and the results were stunning.  It gave her beautiful silver highlights - she looks like an Elven Princess or something.  She then uses this shampoo for washing her hair daily and that keeps up the silver look.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you want silver highlights, this product is definitely a good one!  [Note:  You will need to start with light blonde hair - we use another hair dye to get her to light blonde, and then this gentle Shimmer Lights Shampoo to add the silver highlights.]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great product - we are both extremely pleased with it!</li>
            <li> This shampoo makes my hair the right texture. I have gray hair and this shampoo keeps  it soft as well as allowing it to have its natural body.</li>
            <li> This is a must have to all blonds....or those of us that want to be blond.  I find myself wanting to recommend this product to women on the street that have that brassy color.</li>
            <li> Keeps my hair from getting brassy</li>
            <li> item was sealed in plastic, but the top of product wasn&#x27;t closed completely- so didn&#x27;t receive full bottle. :\</li>
            <li> Really good shampoo to use with your regular shampoo. Did not need to redo my hair for a while, while using this shampoo and it kept my highlights bright for months.</li>
            <li> I am a natural brunette with bleached blonde/toned hair and I was looking for a shampoo to use between tonings to keep my hair looking a more natural blonde color.  This works great.  I use it about once a week leaving it on for 2-3 minutes, and conditioning with a good conditioner after (I haven&#x27;t used the matching conditioner).  This removes the yellow that seems to creep in over time and leaves my hair a more natural blonde color.  I&#x27;ve been using it for a few weeks and my hair feels healthy and undamaged.</li>
            <li> If you are a platinum blonde, (not golden.) or your hair is bleached and now yellow, go out and buy this NOW! I am now a golden blonde but when I was trying to get platinum a year ago, this was a gift from heaven for me.. I also bought it from Sally&#x27;s beauty supply for around 20 bucks.  Just make sure to not use it EVERY day for you hair will turn grayish/purple. If your hair is still at a orange/copper stage, then purple will not get rid of it.. you will first have to tone out the copper/orange hues with blue (buy a toner, Wella is amazing.) and then once your hair is at that banana peel yellow stage, use this shampoo!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just a tip for anyone who is unexpirienced with going blonde :&lt;br /&gt;Purple will cancel out yellow.&lt;br /&gt;Blue will cancel out orange.</li>
            <li> good product but the bottle opened during transit and about 1/3 of it emptied out inside the box.  Messy....</li>
            <li> Nice shampoo that lasts.</li>
            <li> I have light pink hair, and as far as light pink hair goes, it often turns salmon or orange from standing out in the sun. So this shampoo helps a lot. Although, I&#x27;ll admit, it turns a lot of my head into a light purple, but it doesn&#x27;t matter much since it meshes well with the pink strands.&lt;br /&gt;But beware, it is pretty, I don&#x27;t want to say watery, but it drips everywhere and will stain.</li>
            <li> Very dissapointed. The bottle came half way open and conditioner all over the bag. Had to throw it away. I guess I have to blame the UPS.  Good thing they sealed the conditioner in the bag otherwise it would be all over the box with other items.</li>
            <li> I love this shampoo. Great on my blonde highlighted hair. And I use this daily to shave with --- it&#x27;s perfect for that!!!!</li>
            <li> I tried this shampoo just for something a little different.  I normally use Jhirmack shampoo for gray hair.  The Clairol shampoo is a darker purple and has a stronger scent.  I&#x27;ve read other reviews that said the Clairol turned their hair purple or stained the tile in their shower, but I have had none of those problems.  If you have processed hair, then you might have to leave it on for less time since your hair may be porous and prone to taking on a purple tint.  My hair is naturally silver and this shampoo keeps it from yellowing.</li>
            <li> Being from a small rural community, I cannot always find this product locally and if I do it is in a salon and is  expensive! Amazon prices are much cheaper, it came packaged perfectly, and the price was excellent.</li>
            <li> I tried a bunch of shampoos of my ash blonde/silver hair. This by far is the cheapest and best shampoo! It&#x27;s literally purple and combats again the brassiness that appears after some time when hair color fades. Try this w/ a hair mast a couple times a week and you&#x27;re good to go.</li>
            <li> I love Clairol&#x27;s Professional Shimmer Lights Shampoo and have been using it for a year now. It really does help my hair color to keep their lighter tones longer, and even helps those silver streaks look their very best. I only use it twice a week and use a good hydrating conditioner with it as it does have a tendency to make my hair drier than it normally is. I have recommended this to all of my friends who have highlights, weaves or natural streaks.</li>
            <li> I purchased this shampoo based upon the recommendation of my hair stylist when I began to have silver highlights added to my hair.  It does a good job of maintaining the silver color without it becoming yellow, but leaves my hair and scalp feeling dry (even after using a quality conditioner).  In order to get any suds, I have to use twice as much of the product as I needed to use with my previous shampoo.  I am going to look for an alternative.</li>
            <li> Love this shampoo for gray or brassy hair.  Softens and brightens at once.  Vendor ships promptly and packs product well.</li>
            <li> Washes away yellow tone and leaves grey sparkling!</li>
            <li> My favorite shampoo to brighten my greying hair.  Love it!</li>
            <li> I have heavy bleach blonde highlights. I work really hard at keeping my hair deep conditioned at all times. However all the gunk can builed up and make your hair look dull. I washed with this today and my hair, even when wet, brightened up instantly. It lathers really well and my hair feels clean. It may be a little drying so just use extra conditioner. Does what it says. I will buy it again</li>
            <li> Seriously works. I will probably never stop using this stuff lol</li>
            <li> Keeps the yellow brassiness out of your hair.&lt;br /&gt;But super favorite thing about this Shampoo?&lt;br /&gt;The smell! It really does smell fantastic.&lt;br /&gt;You can smell it long after the shower is over.&lt;br /&gt;Leaves your hair feeling fresh and clean.</li>
            <li> use it all the time gray has not turned yellow</li>
            <li> My dad loves this shampoo and has been using it for years!</li>
            <li> product is fine, but the cap was not on all the way and even though it&#x27;s like they knew it and put it in a plastic bag, it leaked all over...luckily the mess was contained in the bag but quite a bit was wasted.  The cap was on loose, who packages things without making sure the lid is tight?  weird.</li>
            <li> Im very excited to buy this but received damage;(</li>
            <li> was broken upon arrival and some of the contents leaked all over the place</li>
            <li> This shampoo keeps my grey hair from getting brassy  Love it have been using it for years</li>
            <li> Shampoo is great but packaging exploded in the mail and product was all over the place.  As for the shampoo...I hated my yellowish hair after having it done until someone had me try this.  Hello beautiful blonde!</li>
            <li> Took 8 5% of the yellowing out of my beard on the first wash.  The next wash took out the rest.  Very good and doesn&#x27;t smell all perfumey.</li>
            <li> Frankly I am very disappointed in this in that my grey hair has never looked so grey before. The shampoo doesn&#x27;t seem to have lightened it much at all I&#x27;m afraid.  Additionally, I ordered 3 huge bottles of it!  I have to look into the possibility of returning the 2 unused bottles.</li>
            <li> This is ok shampoo but has a very chemical smell which I dislike.  I will use it off and on to maintain shine.</li>
            <li> Thought I&#x27;d give this shampoo because it got great ratings, plus it was the cheapest for the size youu get. I really hate this shampoo though. Didn&#x27;t really notice any changes to my hair but most of all I can&#x27;t stand the way it made my hair smell. It&#x27;s quite unpleasant</li>
            <li> Excellent product. I have used it for several years.</li>
            <li> I like the way this shampoo leaves my hair but do not like the odor that is left in my hair. My allergies bother me and I can smell the scent from this prduct. I do not use it as often as I should because of that odor.  But my hair does feel silky and great color to my hair.</li>
            <li> I really love this conditioner. I love the smell and the feel of the conditioner in my hair once it&#x27;s washed out. The packaging that it was sent in wasn&#x27;t ideal and I was glad that it made it safely to delivery. If someone had handled it some roughly, it would probably have broken and spilled everywhere. But the product is great!</li>
            <li> A terrific product, does exactly as advertised!</li>
            <li> this product keeps my gray hair clean and not yellow i used it several times a week all year long</li>
            <li> Decent shampoo, ok &amp;#34;toner&amp;#34; but not as good as the matching conditioner.  Using them together is definitely a good idea.  At least it comes in a really big bottle :-)</li>
            <li> The lid was not on tight and shampoo leaked out all over,need to do a better job with packing.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t leave in more then 1 minute it&#x27;s so damaging! But it works</li>
            <li> This is my second bottle, the product is really good</li>
            <li> I love this product however- when I received it exploded and half was gone. And watch out- this stuff STAINS basically anything it touches</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it for years. Once a week keeps the yellow out .Every day I use a regular shampoo and conditioner.</li>
            <li> The shampoo is really good for people with white hair. My mom used it and it gives a silky, shining look to the hair. I was skeptical as first, but this is great product and will buy again if necessary. The shipping was fast as well</li>
            <li> keeps the orange tones out of my blonde died hair.  Use it three times a week to maintain the color</li>
            <li> Being a blonde cosmetologist i love this product! I highly recommend it to anyone who has blonde hair and mineral water.</li>
            <li> recommended by hair dresser but I can&#x27;t see where it makes a difference</li>
            <li> I usually buy this product locally for close to the same price. Have been using it for quite sometime. I am prematurely gray trying to be blonde. It is a great price for what I usually purchase the generic for... I saved a small size bottle and just refill it from the large pump bottle, makes more room in shower. The shop where I normally purchase told me to hold off purchasing because it was going on sale the next week. When I returned the entire line was on sale except for this particular product, they would not honor the sale price, so I am not feeling bad about not keeping this purchase local. Just bad business. And I found a better deal all the way around. It did arrive opened and leaked into the plastic packaging, bottle not broken. I just used what leaked into the plastic bag, waste not, want not...no harm no foul</li>
            <li> Wife loves this product.</li>
            <li> The shampoo is very good. The color is a very dark purple. I have purchase other brand purple shampoos and this is the best because the shampoo is stronger and works better. Very happy!</li>
            <li> Great shampoo. Does the job but don&#x27;t use daily</li>
            <li> when a blonde finds her stylist, she has found the golden ticket. i trust everything she says and everything she recommends. her salon sells Kevin Murphy products which i love. but when i asked about using a blue shampoo, she recommended the clairol shimmer lights. i use it about twice a month and sometimes mix it with my Kevin Murphy shampoo. I even use it one my white bulldog and she almost glows in the dark!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;my stylist told me &amp;#34;this shampoo does not coat your hair, like most cheap shampoos&amp;#34;. she is right, it is of great quality for being so cheap.</li>
            <li> Got this for my mother in law. She likes it because it smooths her hair and it helps to her silver hair to look better.</li>
            <li> Took the orange out of my blonde hi-lights but did not lighten hair at all.</li>
            <li> My first time using it and it is making a noticeable difference.  I recommend using a strong conditioner. Super Fast shipping! I&#x27;m very happy</li>
            <li> Love this shampoo. I only use it when I feel my hair is starting to dull and it brings out my pretty blonde again.</li>
            <li> It really has helped to tone my hair!</li>
            <li> Love it! I did like the directions say. Wash once rinse and the put on again and leave for 5 min. It got the orange out of my highlights wonderfully it looks like I just had my hair done. And I swear my low lights are darker. Not just because the contrast of the lighter highlights either.</li>
            <li> If you want to eliminate yellowish or \\&quot;mousy\\&quot; coloration in white or silver hair, this is a great product.  Used once or twice a week, it really brings out the highlights without creating that \\&quot;blue-hair\\&quot; look that seems to result with some similar products.</li>
            <li> Only 1/2 bottle of conditioner received usable.  It smells VERY old lady&amp;#34;ish&amp;#34;.  Heard it works great, but can&#x27;t get past the smell.</li>
            <li> This was recommend by my beautician.  It really softens the gray and makes my hair shine.  i get a lot of compliments on my hair since I have been using it</li>
            <li> I bought this upon hearing about it from my hair stylist. She highly recommended it. I thought it might be a bit old lady like but it turns out to make my blonde shine and beautiful. Will defiantly buy again.</li>
            <li> I am very happy with this product.</li>
            <li> I already have highlights in my hair, and this product enhanced my hair so nice, I get so much complimennts.&lt;br /&gt;Love it,love it, love it</li>
            <li> Great shampoo for a great value.  The pump top is convenient.  We like it a lot and will order it again.</li>
    </ol>
