            <li>THIS PRODUCT IS AMAZING; I HAVE BEEN USING IT FOR A LONG TIME; I HAVE A VERY SENSITIVE SKIN AND WORKS PERFECTLY</li>
            <li>The Milk Cleanser is great for daily cleansing and for taking off eye makeup.</li>
            <li>The emulsion I put on at night and still feel smooth and moisurized in the morning.</li>

            <li>This product good from sensitive skin</li>
            <li>It smells fabulous and makes my skin feel clean, refreshed and so smoothe.</li>
            <li>I originally bought this product from one of those kiosks in an upscale mall.  </li>
            <li>So gentle and moisturizing on my 46-year-old face! :)</li>
            <li>I originally purchased this product at a kiosk in the mall.</li>
            <li>This stuff leaves my skin feeling clean but moist as well.  </li>
            <li>I am so glad and fortunate that I can now buy and enjoy high quality affordable face creams here at Amazon.</li>
            <li>My super dry skin feels great after using it.   </li>
            <li>It has a nice soft scent too.  </li>
            <li>This is a good quality product and it is the only product I ever use on my face.</li>
            <li>This is Not a bad product.</li>
            <li>Just give me a good mild cleanser such as Purpose</li>
            <li>so my skin feels clean and fresh.</li>
            <li>Very creamy cleanser does not dry out my skin, pleasant scent.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I found something so simple and easy to solve my problem.</li>
            <li>Good for expected which clean skin very clear and not dry for skin, it is good choice for four seasons</li>
            <li>At the Mall in Albuquerque I purchased about 2,000 dollars worth of this product.</li>
            <li>My face looks smooth, feels clean and soft.</li>
            <li>and she promised to make it right with me.</li>
            <li>This stuff makes my wife&#x27;s skin so smooth and soft!  </li>
            <li>VERY PRICEY!</li>
            <li>I love the creamy texture of the cream and when you apply it to your skin you can instantly feel it hydrating.</li>
            <li>When I use this to take off my make up my skin feels so soft and smooth afterwards.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s leaves your skin feeling soft and wonderfully smooth.  </li>
            <li>It might be better if used after a regular cleanser to moisturize since you don&#x27;t rinse it off</li>
            <li>It leaves my skin clean, soft and supple!</li>
            <li>It leaves my skin clean and soft.</li>
            <li>This cleaners makes your skin so soft and clean.  </li>
            <li>real reason I love this is because it only takes like 2 minutes</li>
            <li>I will continue to buy it as long as it is available!</li>
            <li>I have used many high end facial cleansers.  </li>
            <li>I dont use it for much else tho.</li>
            <li>Please make sure your tops are closed before sending them out.</li>
            <li>hahaha.</li>
            <li>I really have no idea how anybody can recommend this product.</li>
            <li>At any rate, the milk cleanser does seem to smooth out my facial skin texture so putting on subsequent moisturizer and light tint</li>
            <li>Really.</li>
            <li>The process for cleaning your face is also very clunky.</li>
            <li>Thanks so much</li>
            <li>So much easier to have it delivered to my home rather than fight the parking and people at the mall.</li>
            <li>It is nice and creamy, but heavily scented and never feels rinsed off.</li>
            <li>I am copy pasting this to the other products so that I can try to help others to make a more informed purchase.</li>
            <li>Very subtle nice clean smell too.</li>
            <li>IT CAME WITH A STICKER OVER THE LABEL, HAND WRITTEN, NOT LOOKING VERY NEW.</li>
            <li>There are so many other products out there that do better at less cost.</li>
            <li>And it is truly amazing to see the grime that comes off on the small cotton-ball used for application.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Also very important it not only removes all of the makeup but does not leave and trace of amounts of make up way use properly.    </li>
            <li>Thank you for such a quick service on the Premier Milk Cleanser.  </li>
            <li>I was very surprised to find the product in Amazon and at a reasonable price.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it to others.</li>
            <li>I love all of the Premier Dead Sea producst.  </li>
            <li>It is a moisturizing cream that removes make-up easy and fast, but then must use a toner to remove that feeling a little fat.</li>
            <li>I have been using Premier Dead Sea products on and off for the past 3 years and it rivals many of the top moisturizers in the business.</li>
            <li>It was time to get a new bottle</li>
            <li>Live and learn.</li>
            <li>Received product earlier than expected and I love this product.  </li>
            <li>IT DIDN&#x27;T LOOK VERY PROFESSIONAL.</li>
            <li>They named this produst correctly as it is the first product that I can&#x27;t live without using daily.</li>
            <li>Since using the creams, toner, and moisturizers for the past 15 days many people have complemented that they have seen a glow in my face.  </li>
            <li>It was and my face feels soft!  </li>
            <li>I have been using this cleaner for the past four years and absolutely love it.    </li>
            <li>Now that I am approaching 50, I wanted a cleanser that left my face feeling moisturized and clean.</li>
            <li>The person that said it doesn&#x27;t feel clean, obviously didn&#x27;t check to see if her skin actually was clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>But the cleanser itself is genuinely terrific, and at this price --- which might seem high, but is less than half its former retail tag --- this is also a great buy.</li>
            <li>There is nothing natural about these products and they are a huge waste of money.</li>
            <li>Leaves your skin soft and moist.    </li>
            <li>AND THIS IS BY FAR</li>
            <li>IT MAKES MY FACE FEEL SO SOFT.  </li>
            <li>It is cheap and heavily  perfume.</li>
            <li>Leaves the skin soft and hydrated.</li>
            <li>I originally bought this item at the mall off 1 of their little carts.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m rather bummed I spent so much on these products.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the only moisturizer that has cleared up my adult acne.</li>
            <li>Only have to use a little at a time, thick cleanser very refreshing.</li>
            <li>I HIGHLY recomend the dead sea products to everyone, all skin types, young and old.</li>
            <li>A dab goes a very very long way, and is far preferable to drying soap.</li>
            <li>I have very dry and sensitive skin.  </li>

            <li> Very subtle nice clean smell too.</li>
            <li> IT CAME WITH A STICKER OVER THE LABEL, HAND WRITTEN, NOT LOOKING VERY NEW.</li>
            <li> There are so many other products out there that do better at less cost.</li>
            <li> And it is truly amazing to see the grime that comes off on the small cotton-ball used for application.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Also very important it not only removes all of the makeup but does not leave and trace of amounts of make up way use properly.    </li>
            <li> Thank you for such a quick service on the Premier Milk Cleanser.  </li>
            <li> I was very surprised to find the product in Amazon and at a reasonable price.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it to others.</li>
            <li> I love all of the Premier Dead Sea producst.  </li>
            <li> It is a moisturizing cream that removes make-up easy and fast, but then must use a toner to remove that feeling a little fat.</li>
            <li> I have been using Premier Dead Sea products on and off for the past 3 years and it rivals many of the top moisturizers in the business.</li>
            <li> It was time to get a new bottle</li>
            <li> Live and learn.</li>
            <li> Received product earlier than expected and I love this product.  </li>
            <li> IT DIDN&#x27;T LOOK VERY PROFESSIONAL.</li>
            <li> They named this produst correctly as it is the first product that I can&#x27;t live without using daily.</li>
            <li> Since using the creams, toner, and moisturizers for the past 15 days many people have complemented that they have seen a glow in my face.  </li>
            <li> It was and my face feels soft!  </li>
            <li> I have been using this cleaner for the past four years and absolutely love it.    </li>
            <li> Now that I am approaching 50, I wanted a cleanser that left my face feeling moisturized and clean.</li>
            <li> The person that said it doesn&#x27;t feel clean, obviously didn&#x27;t check to see if her skin actually was clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> But the cleanser itself is genuinely terrific, and at this price --- which might seem high, but is less than half its former retail tag --- this is also a great buy.</li>
            <li> There is nothing natural about these products and they are a huge waste of money.</li>
            <li> Leaves your skin soft and moist.    </li>
            <li> AND THIS IS BY FAR</li>
            <li> IT MAKES MY FACE FEEL SO SOFT.  </li>
            <li> It is cheap and heavily  perfume.</li>
            <li> Leaves the skin soft and hydrated.</li>
            <li> I originally bought this item at the mall off 1 of their little carts.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m rather bummed I spent so much on these products.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the only moisturizer that has cleared up my adult acne.</li>
            <li> Only have to use a little at a time, thick cleanser very refreshing.</li>
            <li> I HIGHLY recomend the dead sea products to everyone, all skin types, young and old.</li>
            <li> A dab goes a very very long way, and is far preferable to drying soap.</li>
            <li> I have very dry and sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li> Due to economic struggles I have had to use other store brand names to clean my face, which resulted in my face being dry, dull, and lackluster.</li>
            <li> and they lasted a long time.  </li>
            <li> If you have dry skin I recommend using this product line.</li>
            <li> At my local mall this cream along with the other products was $30.00 each!</li>
            <li> Works very well at removing the makeup that&#x27;s left behind, I like the feeling of going to bed knowing I wont wake up with black eyes in the morning.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I was also duped into purchasing the refining facial peeling mask and the Dead Sea bar soap.</li>
            <li> The jury is still out on whether or not I really, really like it.  </li>
            <li> There is very little about them on the net too.</li>
            <li> I tryed this product as a replacement for my other milk cleaser.</li>
            <li> I use this and two other products by Dead Sea Premier.</li>
            <li> I paid a small fortune for it along with some other Premier Dead Sea products</li>
            <li> I will never buy Premier Dead Sea products thru amazon again.</li>
            <li> Here&#x27;s another of the Premier Dead Sea products --- once upon a time sold exclusively at high-priced mall kiosks --- that I bought from one of those kiosks at an ultra-high price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have dried skin.</li>
            <li> In the mean time I opened some of the other products to use them.</li>
            <li> I didnt do any research which I usually do, about these products, or I probably wouldnt have ever even tried them.</li>
            <li> My skin is very picky :(</li>
            <li> I hate washing my face before bed, usually I just skip the whole thing.</li>
            <li> At least they didnt with me.  </li>
            <li> They do not stand behind what they are selling in the least.</li>
            <li> However, you pay extra for shipping when you buy this line from Amazon and the shipping stinks!</li>
            <li> I was wrong...</li>
            <li> It is possibly one of the worst skincare lines I have ever used.</li>
            <li> The instructions (albeit faint and difficult to read) say to massage the milk cleanser over a washed face, then wipe off the excess.  </li>
            <li> I know it&#x27;s not good to sleep with makeup on and that it ages the skin, but I just hate it.</li>
            <li> Both were absolutely awful as well, leaving my skin tight and irritated feeling.</li>
            <li> Unhappy with shippers.</li>
            <li> It reminded me of Ponds Cold Cream, but with a heavier scent (do they even make that anymore?).</li>
            <li> VERY EXPENSIVE!</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

            <li> I love this product. My super dry skin feels great after using it.   However, you pay extra for shipping when you buy this line from Amazon and the shipping stinks! About a third of the product had leaked into the box. I will never buy Premier Dead Sea products thru amazon again. Unhappy with shippers.</li>
            <li> I love all of the Premier Dead Sea producst.  The Milk Cleanser is great for daily cleansing and for taking off eye makeup. Leaves your skin soft and moist.    I originally bought this product from one of those kiosks in an upscale mall.  I paid a small fortune for it along with some other Premier Dead Sea products but I loved them all and they lasted a long time.  When I ran out of the Milk Cleanser, I checked Amazon to see if they carried the product and they did at a better price.</li>
            <li> I originally bought this item at the mall off 1 of their little carts. BIG MISTAKE! VERY PRICEY! The product was amazing though. My sKin never looked or felt better. It was time to get a new bottle and I found amazon, Thank God! It allowed me to buy 7of their products for 1/2of what I had paid at that cart. They are all eqaually amazing. I HIGHLY recomend the dead sea products to everyone, all skin types, young and old. I am 38, but have brown spots from tanning, wrinkling on my upper chest, starting wrinkles around my eyes, larger pores on my cheeks. There is nothing this stuff can&#x27;t fix. Try it, you&#x27;ll love it. The emulsion I put on at night and still feel smooth and moisurized in the morning. Very subtle nice clean smell too. Buy them.</li>
            <li> Here&#x27;s another of the Premier Dead Sea products --- once upon a time sold exclusively at high-priced mall kiosks --- that I bought from one of those kiosks at an ultra-high price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t say I&#x27;m happy to have paid what I did, but the cleanser itself is an amazing item that I have used for years. A dab goes a very very long way, and is far preferable to drying soap. And it is truly amazing to see the grime that comes off on the small cotton-ball used for application.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The delivery issues with this provider, I can&#x27;t address. But the cleanser itself is genuinely terrific, and at this price --- which might seem high, but is less than half its former retail tag --- this is also a great buy.</li>
            <li> Works very well at removing the makeup that&#x27;s left behind, I like the feeling of going to bed knowing I wont wake up with black eyes in the morning. I dont use it for much else tho.</li>
            <li> I would purchase Premier Milk Cleanser again.  It is creamy feeling, smells great, and provides gentle cleansing for my face and neck.</li>
            <li> This product good from sensitive skin</li>
            <li> I have been using Premier Dead Sea products on and off for the past 3 years and it rivals many of the top moisturizers in the business. I love the creamy texture of the cream and when you apply it to your skin you can instantly feel it hydrating. Due to economic struggles I have had to use other store brand names to clean my face, which resulted in my face being dry, dull, and lackluster. Since using the creams, toner, and moisturizers for the past 15 days many people have complemented that they have seen a glow in my face.  I was very surprised to find the product in Amazon and at a reasonable price. At my local mall this cream along with the other products was $30.00 each! I am so glad and fortunate that I can now buy and enjoy high quality affordable face creams here at Amazon.</li>
            <li> The cleaner was open and spilled out into the box and all over the bottle. Please make sure your tops are closed before sending them out.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this store and the product is awesome ....more power to your store.  I surely will buy from this store again</li>
            <li> THIS PRODUCT IS AMAZING; I HAVE BEEN USING IT FOR A LONG TIME; I HAVE A VERY SENSITIVE SKIN AND WORKS PERFECTLY</li>
            <li> OK I HAVE TRIED MANY FACE WASHES AND THIS IS BY FAR THE BEST AND I LOVE THE SMELL. IT MAKES MY FACE FEEL SO SOFT.  THANK YOU</li>
            <li> I use it as a cleanser in the morning and at night. It&#x27;s the only cleanser I&#x27;ve used on my face for over three years now! So gentle and moisturizing on my 46-year-old face! :)</li>
            <li> At the Mall in Albuquerque I purchased about 2,000 dollars worth of this product. When I got home over 200 miles away I found that I had not made it home with all of the things I was supposed to have. I called the representative to let her know and she promised to make it right with me. She didnt.  In the mean time I opened some of the other products to use them. One was opened and used, one had the seal broke and had leaked in the box.   I contacted the company and told them what had happened and have had no reply what so ever. This was in September or October, and there still isnt any word from any of them. If you decide to purchase any of these products don&#x27;t depend on any one helping  you with what ever is the matter. They do not stand behind what they are selling in the least. At least they didnt with me.  I might have had better to say if they had just made an effort to help me in any way. I would not recommend these products. There is very little about them on the net too. I didnt do any research which I usually do, about these products, or I probably wouldnt have ever even tried them. I am copy pasting this to the other products so that I can try to help others to make a more informed purchase.</li>
            <li> Very creamy cleanser does not dry out my skin, pleasant scent. Only have to use a little at a time, thick cleanser very refreshing.</li>
            <li> I WASN&#x27;T HAPPY. IT CAME WITH A STICKER OVER THE LABEL, HAND WRITTEN, NOT LOOKING VERY NEW. IT DIDN&#x27;T LOOK VERY PROFESSIONAL.</li>
            <li> I used to buy this cleanser from a booth in my local mall.  I have very dry and sensitive skin.  This stuff leaves my skin feeling clean but moist as well.  My order came all the way from Israel.  Thank goodness for our global economy!</li>
            <li> I have rosacea and this is the only cleanser that I have found that does not irritate my skin. I have used it for 3 years and love it, love it, love it. My face looks smooth, feels clean and soft. I have always received the product before the estimated arrival time which is always a plus for me.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like how it leave a film residue on my skin. I use the creams and I love them so I thought this would be a great addition I was wrong...</li>
            <li> As with the toner, I don&#x27;t get what the hype is about this cleanser. I so wanted to love this. It is nice and creamy, but heavily scented and never feels rinsed off. In addition, I have to wash my hands with another soap to get the cleanser off. Otherwise my hands feel greasy, so of course it doesn&#x27;t feel rinsed off my face. It reminded me of Ponds Cold Cream, but with a heavier scent (do they even make that anymore?). I&#x27;m rather bummed I spent so much on these products. Live and learn.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t like the way this product feels on my skin.  Just give me a good mild cleanser such as Purpose so my skin feels clean and fresh.</li>
            <li> I like the Premier line, and am very happy with this cleanser. I do wish it worked a bit better on mascara, but we cant have everything now, can we? hahaha. Very satisfied with prompt delivery and quality of this product.</li>
            <li> Love this product. Now that I am approaching 50, I wanted a cleanser that left my face feeling moisturized and clean. I was impressed with how clean this left my skin. I used a toner afterwards just to make sure all the dirt and makeup was gone! It was and my face feels soft!  This is a home run for me!</li>
            <li> I really have no idea how anybody can recommend this product. It is possibly one of the worst skincare lines I have ever used. It is cheap and heavily  perfume. I would rather put dollar store cleanser on my face than any of the products from this line.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was also duped into purchasing the refining facial peeling mask and the Dead Sea bar soap. Both were absolutely awful as well, leaving my skin tight and irritated feeling. And the perfume smell of these products is overwhelming! There is nothing natural about these products and they are a huge waste of money. You are better off buying lotion from CVS.</li>
            <li> Here&#x27;s a product that actually seems to smooth my skin, although I am still confused over whether I&#x27;m using it correctly or not.  The instructions (albeit faint and difficult to read) say to massage the milk cleanser over a washed face, then wipe off the excess.  I always rinsed off cleansers before, so if this is supposed to be a &amp;#34;cleanser&amp;#34; than why am I leaving the residue on my face?  At any rate, the milk cleanser does seem to smooth out my facial skin texture so putting on subsequent moisturizer and light tint goes on smoothly.  The jury is still out on whether or not I really, really like it.  There are so many other products out there that do better at less cost.</li>
            <li> This is the only cleanser I use to take makeup off. I have been using this cleaner for the past four years and absolutely love it.    I have dried skin. When I use this to take off my make up my skin feels so soft and smooth afterwards. Also very important it not only removes all of the makeup but does not leave and trace of amounts of make up way use properly.    I use this and two other products by Dead Sea Premier. If you have dry skin I recommend using this product line.</li>
            <li> Thank you for such a quick service on the Premier Milk Cleanser.  I have used this product for two or three years now with amazing results.  The price was amazing as was the delivery of the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sincerely&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Carol Baker</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for about 8 years. It&#x27;s the only moisturizer that has cleared up my adult acne. My teenager uses it also. I use it as a cleanser and apply on my face in the evening and wipe it off with a cotton pad. Then after washing my face in the morning I apply as a moisturizer. My skin has never looked better. Really.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a but unused to cleansers you wipe off rather than wash off! I love the scent of the product and it is effective.</li>
            <li> This cleanser is the best I have ever used in my life. It smells fabulous and makes my skin feel clean, refreshed and so smoothe. I have been using this product (along with the eye serum) for about four years and will never use anything different. They named this produst correctly as it is the first product that I can&#x27;t live without using daily.</li>
            <li> I love this product for a good clean moisturized feel. I never used it with the toner of the same brand but would use it with the Clinique brand toner.</li>
            <li> FANTASTIC product!&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think it cleans as well as I thought it would. The process for cleaning your face is also very clunky. Probably won&#x27;t buy again.</li>
            <li> I love this cleanser!  It&#x27;s leaves your skin feeling soft and wonderfully smooth.  I will definitely order again. Thanks so much</li>
            <li> I like this cleanser because you don&#x27;t have to rinse it off - just wipe it with tissues.  Therefore, it is very  easy to use.</li>
            <li> It is a moisturizing cream that removes make-up easy and fast, but then must use a toner to remove that feeling a little fat.</li>
            <li> Broke my skin out.....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Brenda K Chandler</li>
            <li> I am on my second bottle of the Milk Cleanser. The creamy formula does a great job of removing my makeup and leaves my face very soft. It has a nice soft scent too.  My only issue with the product is that the plastic bottle tends to tip over from time to time.</li>
            <li> I really love this product. This is my favourite thing from Premier. All you do is smear a layer of it on your face and wipe it off with a towel. It removes all dirt and makeup from you face. The reason I know this works is because I use a cotton ball saturated with toner afterward and the cotton ball reveals to be cleaner than when I was my face with water. The person that said it doesn&#x27;t feel clean, obviously didn&#x27;t check to see if her skin actually was clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The real reason I love this is because it only takes like 2 minutes and I don&#x27;t have to use water. I hate washing my face before bed, usually I just skip the whole thing. If I wear eye makeup, I&#x27;ll just rinse my eyes with water, but not actually wash my face. I know it&#x27;s not good to sleep with makeup on and that it ages the skin, but I just hate it. I&#x27;m glad I found something so simple and easy to solve my problem. If I could, I would buy a life time supply of this so I&#x27;ll never have to be without.</li>
            <li> I have used many high end facial cleansers.  Nothing compares to this one.  It is great for sensitive skin and makes your skin feel great.  Removes makeup well.</li>
            <li> This is Not a bad product. It just doesn&#x27;t work for me. Removes makeup easily and leaves skin amazingly&lt;br /&gt;Soft. But made me break out. My skin is very picky :(</li>
            <li> I love Premier products</li>
            <li> I love this product and I have purchased this item many times. This is a good quality product and it is the only product I ever use on my face.</li>
            <li> This is the best cleanser I have ever used. I love it! Creaminess lasts after dirt is gone.&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Good for expected which clean skin very clear and not dry for skin, it is good choice for four seasons</li>
            <li> I originally purchased this product at a kiosk in the mall. VERY EXPENSIVE! I just happened to find this on line and ordered it thinking it could not possibly be the same. Well it was so I will be buying it this way from now on. Great product, great price! So much easier to have it delivered to my home rather than fight the parking and people at the mall.</li>
            <li> Received product earlier than expected and I love this product.  No problems of ay kind.</li>
            <li> I tryed this product as a replacement for my other milk cleaser. DSC products becoming too pricey...but I&#x27;ll keep looking for sales.</li>
            <li> I love it. Just what I ordered.</li>
            <li> I love this product. My sister recommended it to me a year ago and I&#x27;ve been buying&lt;br /&gt;it ever since. It leaves my skin clean and soft.</li>
            <li> I love this cleanser. It leaves my skin clean, soft and supple! This may be the best cleanser thst I have ever used.</li>
            <li> This cleanser did not make my skin feel very clean. It might be better if used after a regular cleanser to moisturize since you don&#x27;t rinse it off (only wipe it away- not for acne prone skin).</li>
            <li> thank you it an honour to shop with you. Do add me on instagram: usana9884025</li>
            <li> This is a top quality product.  It leave your face feeling nourished and replenished.  I would recommend this products to anyone who enjoys gentle yet effective skin care.</li>
            <li> Love this product. I have purchased it many times. And will continue to purchase it. I highly recommend it to others.</li>
            <li> This stuff makes my wife&#x27;s skin so smooth and soft!  We love it!  I will continue to buy it as long as it is available!</li>
            <li> This cleaners makes your skin so soft and clean.  I bought it in the store and found I get a better price buying on line.&lt;br /&gt;I get the cleaners within two to three days.  I buy two at a time.  Great stuff....</li>
            <li> this milk cleanser is refreshing I use it regularly as a cleanser and it works great&lt;br /&gt;not oily and wipes of easy with a tissue</li>
            <li> Leaves the skin soft and hydrated. Smells really nice too.</li>
