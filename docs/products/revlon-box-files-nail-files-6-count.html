            <li>Adorable design!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a great way to keep files in my purse without them scratching everything, and the small shape is perfect for nails</li>
            <li>; good deal; quick ship.  </li>
            <li>Cute and mini just what I wanted.</li>
            <li>They also are perfect size for my newborns tiny fingers :)</li>
            <li>I bought this as a stocking stuffer so it&#x27;s okay by me</li>
            <li>Cute.</li>

            <li>Perfect to fit in small purse!</li>
            <li>Thank you so much for your quick service !!</li>
            <li>I needed mini, colorful nail files to include in my bridesmaid gifts.</li>
            <li>This was exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li>Very upset not the right color.</li>
            <li>and these are the perfect size to file without accidentally rubbing on other little fingers in the process.</li>
            <li>Good for a small purse then.</li>
            <li>handy little files</li>
            <li>thanks a bunch.</li>
            <li>Files are smaller than expected, but they seem to work good.</li>
            <li>Love these little files...going to attach each one to a bottle of nail polish to give as a gift.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t know that I would use them for anything else though since they are pretty tiny.</li>
            <li>They are also too soft, so they bend too much making imposible to properly shape a nail.</li>
            <li>The baby files were too soft to do anything</li>
            <li>Thought they were going to be NORMAL size filers - they are smaller than my pinkie finger GRRRRRRRRR</li>
            <li>Hard to recommend these unless there&#x27;s nothing else.&lt;br /&gt;Difficult to get my nails smooth.</li>
            <li>Not for adult nails, can&#x27;t even get through a single filing session with one, takes two.</li>

            <li> very disapointed,too late to order something else.</li>
            <li> ordered for 30-35 people and only 2 of the boxes of six even had pink on them.</li>
            <li> 3boxes are red and maroon and 1 box is blue and black.</li>
            <li> The lime breaks and falls with a single nail.</li>
            <li> got them for part of a baby girl shower favor because of the pink design.</li>
            <li> These are so small they can barely be used.</li>
            <li> but I had thought that the files are be larger than what they are which is small.  </li>
            <li> (there&#x27;s always that awkward, unused middle space in large boards, anyway).</li>
            <li> I got these for my daughter because she wanted little ones that she could take to school.  </li>
            <li> BTY, my nails are very thin and soft!</li>
            <li> These files are a bit small</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m making small goodie bags with mini sized polishes and lotions so they will work.</li>
            <li> Too small and awkward to use properly.</li>
            <li> hard to use because of size.</li>
            <li> Too expensive for what you get.</li>

            <li> these files don&#x27;t look at all like the picture. got them for part of a baby girl shower favor because of the pink design. ordered for 30-35 people and only 2 of the boxes of six even had pink on them. 3boxes are red and maroon and 1 box is blue and black. doesn&#x27;t say in the ad they are assorted designs and you take what you get. very disapointed,too late to order something else.</li>
            <li> Total RIP OFF! Thought they were going to be NORMAL size filers - they are smaller than my pinkie finger GRRRRRRRRR</li>

            <li> Perfect to fit in small purse!</li>
            <li> The lime breaks and falls with a single nail. No corner left after one session. They are also too soft, so they bend too much making imposible to properly shape a nail. BTY, my nails are very thin and soft!</li>
            <li> Cute. Easy to keep one in the makeup bag for nail emergencies.</li>
            <li> I actually use these to file my baby&#x27;s nails!  The baby files were too soft to do anything and these are the perfect size to file without accidentally rubbing on other little fingers in the process.</li>
            <li> These are so small they can barely be used.</li>
