            <li>but I do :)</li>
            <li>Plus, the body mist comes at a better price.  </li>
            <li>Have used it for many years.</li>
            <li>One of my favorite scents.</li>
            <li>Love this stuff.</li>
            <li>I just loved and use everyday ;) one of the best from Victoria Secrets!</li>
            <li>It smells clean and very fresh!</li>
            <li>Smells fantastic.</li>
            <li>its true to the color and its smells super sexy</li>
            <li>Exactly what I wanted without having to drive to the mall!!  </li>
            <li>i used it for date nights and special occasions</li>
            <li>Bombshell is a powerfully sweet, distinctive scent.</li>
            <li>Fresh, clean</li>
            <li>It came well packaged and arrived quickly.  </li>
            <li>I have no idea if its worth the $$</li>
            <li>Totally worth</li>
            <li>Never a disappointment.</li>
            <li>This is the only fragrance I have used consistently through many bottles--and I still love it as much as the first time I bought it.</li>
            <li>Great price for such a big bottle</li>
            <li>and i really do need to get another one!</li>
            <li>I bought the perfume, and for some reason like the way the body mist smells better than the actual perfume.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s the real deal.</li>
            <li>but I do love this fragrance and it was money well spent</li>
            <li>delivery was very prompt.</li>
            <li>i used this whole bottle up</li>
            <li>BUT TOO MUCH MAKES IT SMELL</li>
            <li>SO USE SPARINGLY UNLESS THIS IS YOUR ABSOLUTE SCENT.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t smell the same as the perfume, but it is similar and still nice.</li>
            <li>This was definitely a knock off of original.</li>
            <li>We received a second bottle, but you could smell that it was not the original scent when compared side by side; it had clearly been cut with alcohol.</li>
            <li>Product was just what I expected and delivered quickly!</li>
            <li>I just can&#x27;t get enough of the amazingly fresh smell it has.</li>
            <li>satisfied with product, however the scent doesn&#x27;t last as long as I thought it would have.</li>
            <li>I was very surprised by the size and the price.</li>
            <li>This product is the exact same thing sold in the stores.</li>
            <li>Have purchased  same scent before from store, scent stays much longer than this particular bottle...</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t last a long time, but because it has such a strong scent, you&#x27;ll smell it even after it&#x27;s faded.</li>
            <li>I like this body mist, it is actually one of the few body mists that is strong enough to leave a scent later on in the day.</li>

            <li> The scent doesn&#x27;t wear off all day and is not overwhelming.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s my little secret.</li>
            <li> After 5min, this particular bottle&#x27;s scent goes away..VERY unhappy!!</li>
            <li> I have ordered the Victoria&#x27;s secret Bombshell Body Mist from Amazon before.  </li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t go wrong here!</li>
            <li> When you find it here, it is very expensive.</li>

            <li> Nice size amazing fresh scent</li>
            <li> This item is exactly as I have purchased in the past. It&#x27;s not a knock off, not watered down.. it&#x27;s the real deal. The scent doesn&#x27;t wear off all day and is not overwhelming. A very good clean smelling scent. II could have bought this bottle directly from Victoria Secret for twice the money if not more!</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t last a long time, but the smell makes up for it. This product is the exact same thing sold in the stores.</li>

            <li> This is my signature scent. I just can&#x27;t get enough of the amazingly fresh smell it has. I&#x27;ve been wearing it for a few years now &amp; I still get compliments on my smell. It&#x27;s my little secret.</li>
            <li> Love bombshell! Smells fantastic. And its a huge bottle!</li>
            <li> This was NOT a signature brand. .. This was definitely a knock off of original. Have purchased  same scent before from store, scent stays much longer than this particular bottle...After 5min, this particular bottle&#x27;s scent goes away..VERY unhappy!!</li>
            <li> When I got the package I could tell it had been tampered with and was not what I was expecting AT ALL!!</li>
            <li> I just loved and use everyday ;) one of the best from Victoria Secrets! A great shopping that I recommend!</li>
            <li> Just like the one they have in the store but $5 cheaper! Can&#x27;t go wrong here! Looove this scent. It&#x27;s my favorite.</li>
            <li> My daughter loves this stuff.  I have no idea if its worth the $$ but I can tell you it was a lot cheaper here than anywhere else I looked- online or in stores.  It came well packaged and arrived quickly.  For great smelling teens, this  does the trick.</li>
            <li> Product was just what I expected and delivered quickly!</li>
            <li> One of my favorite scents!</li>

            <li> I bought this as a gift and it was delivered to the recipient.  But the person I bought it for was very happy with it.  I know that it did arrive on time.</li>
            <li> I like this body mist, it is actually one of the few body mists that is strong enough to leave a scent later on in the day. I would deff. order again</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s nice but it smells like something for a man</li>
            <li> Bombshell is a powerfully sweet, distinctive scent. It&#x27;s not for everyone, but it works with my body chemistry, and my husband loves it, too. It doesn&#x27;t last a long time, but because it has such a strong scent, you&#x27;ll smell it even after it&#x27;s faded. I would recommend going to VS and trying it before buying it online to see if the fragrance is for you. This is the only fragrance I have used consistently through many bottles--and I still love it as much as the first time I bought it.</li>
            <li> satisfied with product, however the scent doesn&#x27;t last as long as I thought it would have. but I do love this fragrance and it was money well spent</li>

            <li> Love it! Never a disappointment. This is my favorite VS scent. Not everyone will like it but I do :)</li>
            <li> My husband ordered this as a gift after he read all the rave reviews. When we received the package, it had been opened, so we informed the seller. We received a second bottle, but you could smell that it was not the original scent when compared side by side; it had clearly been cut with alcohol. Low quality product, shady store owner, etc. Would not recommend buying.</li>
            <li> I LIKE THIS SCENT BUT TOO MUCH MAKES IT SMELL A BIT MANLY.  SO USE SPARINGLY UNLESS THIS IS YOUR ABSOLUTE SCENT.</li>

            <li> Great sent light and  lasts forever. Have used it for many years. Type of fragrance that can be worn anytime.</li>
            <li> One of my favorite scents. Love this stuff.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this before and absolutely love the smell! For $25.00 you get a huge 8.4 once bottle! It smells clean and very fresh! Great for after a shower. I am very satisfied! &#x3D;)</li>
