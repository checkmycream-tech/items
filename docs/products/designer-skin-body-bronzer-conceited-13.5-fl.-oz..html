            <li>Perfect for someone who doesn&#x27;t tan easily.</li>
            <li>Not one person said, \\&quot;you look good have you been to the tanning salon?\\</li>
            <li>&quot; Everyone says \\&quot;you look good, been to the beach lately?\\&quot;  </li>
            <li>In spite of all that, I&#x27;m tanning fairly well.  </li>
            <li>It smells good when you put it on and while you&#x27;re tanning, but give it about 2 hours.</li>
            <li>It just didn&#x27;t work for my skin type which was fair before I started tanning.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m fair skinned</li>
            <li>These lotions just wouldn&#x27;t work for me because I am quite fair.</li>
            <li>This smells sooo good.</li>
            <li>It also smells good.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s smells good even after tanning.  </li>
            <li>No steaking, good consistency.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s a good price.</li>
            <li>This lotion smells wonderful and doesn&#x27;t leave you smelling like you just walked out of the tanning bed in the case you need to run by the store right after tanning!</li>
            <li>; I think this is the start of a beautiful friendship :)&amp;#34;</li>

            <li>Smells nice</li>

            <li>The best part is that the smell doesn&#x27;t really change after tanning either.</li>
            <li>I loved using this lotion, it got me tan quick and smells good.</li>
            <li>This lotion smells great, which is a huge plus; but I got better color results from a lotion called Euphoria.  </li>
            <li>lotion isn&#x27;t overly strong but it does a good job of keeping my skin moisturized and helping a tan develop faster.</li>
            <li>Started using this product and got a great tan really quickly.</li>
            <li>The bottle is a nice size and the lotion is really smooth and feels good on.  </li>

            <li>and I notice a huge difference!</li>

            <li>and tanning is ok.</li>
            <li>Great lotion at a much cheaper rate than the tanning salon.</li>
            <li>This is my daughter&#x27;s favorite.  </li>

            <li>I love this</li>
            <li>I am pleased with this purchase.</li>
            <li>, isn&#x27;t overwhelming.</li>
            <li>Love it,love it</li>
            <li>n love</li>
            <li>Love this bronzer.</li>
            <li>-Love this smell!&lt;br /&gt;-Smooth texture&lt;</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m not as in love w/ it.</li>
            <li>Love this lotion.  </li>
            <li>I love designer skin.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>But not terrible.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m in love.</li>
            <li>And to top it off I kept getting darker as the day went on.</li>
            <li>It also has bronzing in it which I love.</li>
            <li>I used this lotion many times and just bought another bottle of it today because it works so well with my skin</li>
            <li>It smells amazing, for any girls who like silky smooth skin and</li>
            <li>Tan lotions shouldn&#x27;t be bought on line because most of the time they&#x27;re expired or have been replaced with something else.</li>
            <li>I took a chance on this one and was pleased.</li>
            <li>it is an ok indoor tanning lotion, bronzer, but doesn&#x27;t work better than others</li>
            <li>and I feel like I could have found another lotion that did more.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used a lot of lotions and this is currently my favorite.</li>
            <li>this lotion is more of a cosmetic bronzer that washes off if you shower a lot and gives a temporary color.</li>
            <li>but I like the consistency of the snooki lotion better</li>
            <li>I LOVE THIS LOTION.</li>
            <li>but then i tried a packette of this and fell in love.</li>
            <li>and the bottle is so cute and girly.</li>
            <li>but it does smell amazing and is streak free.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never found a DS lotion I didn&#x27;t love.</li>
            <li>I plan on comparing it to lotion from the salon to make sure.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>Concieded smells so good when you put it on and never stinks afterwards.</li>
            <li>I love the price on their products.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;d better not miss a day</li>
            <li>Smells great, but did not do much for me in the tanning bed.</li>
            <li>love the color-</li>
            <li>I love this tanning lotion.</li>

            <li>Definitely an authentic product and</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s an ok lotion, wasn&#x27;t my favorite.</li>
            <li>THe shipment was fast and the service was great.</li>
            <li>Gave this lotion 5 stars, because it works very well and leaves me with great color.  </li>
            <li>This is my all time favorite lotion.</li>
            <li>and I smelled great the whole time.</li>
            <li>I love this lotion.</li>
            <li>Luminary is my all time favorite and would give it 5 stars.</li>
            <li>lotion smells okay.</li>
            <li>is okay.</li>
            <li>Glad I didn&#x27;t pay salon prices and then find out.</li>
            <li>It smells much better than Splurge(which</li>
            <li>I would recommend this to family and friends, so that is saying something. :)</li>
            <li>I will be purchasing more.</li>
            <li>I love this lotion.</li>
            <li>glad i bought it</li>
            <li>but i found myself going tanning more often to achieve a deeper tan-</li>
            <li>Beats paying $80+ at the tanning salon :-)</li>
            <li>It really helps to get a great tanning</li>
            <li>It smells pretty pleasant.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very please with this product and the service!!!!</li>
            <li>The sales girl said this lotion is awesome and since it&#x27;s my first day using it, I don&#x27;t have too much input yet-</li>
            <li>However, I haven&#x27;t seen a huge result in color, I also tan very easily.  </li>
            <li>And of course the lotion itself work great because all designer skin products are high quality.</li>
            <li>It goes on very smoothly, and is easy to apply evenly.</li>
            <li>Gives a good color fast!</li>
            <li>this smells pretty good</li>
            <li>For the price it was pretty good.</li>
            <li>This one worked pretty good</li>
            <li>the lotion goes on easily and the citrus scent is not too overwhelming.</li>
            <li>and so far it seems pretty great!  </li>
            <li>I really enjoyed the fruity smell of this lotion and light bronzing effects.  </li>
            <li>Good color really fast.</li>
            <li>smells good no streaking and not very expensive</li>
            <li>BLACK is my all time favorite, but the color I get from Conceited is definitely awesome.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t tan a lot as I retain it easily</li>
            <li>It smells great and makes my skin feel soft &amp; smooth afterwards.</li>
            <li>The scent is great, and after my tanning session, it actually smells even better on my skin.</li>
            <li>and I strongly agree you wont regret getting this lotion</li>
            <li>Great lotion provided dark color, great scent, &amp; loved the air-brushed effect my skin was left with after each use</li>
            <li>I really liked it first, because of the smell.</li>
            <li>I have a beautiful color to my skin and will definitely purchase again.</li>
            <li>They normally smell good</li>
            <li>something in it made my face burn under the tanning bed but fine for the rest of my body.</li>
            <li>Light weight and easy to rub in.</li>
            <li>This lotion surprised me because it turned out to be one of the juice formulas by designer skin which was a pleasant surprise.</li>
            <li>Makes my skin feel tightened, yet smooth and moisturized.</li>
            <li>This lotion really has given me an amazing bronze finish.</li>
            <li>It seems yummy, goes on smooth.</li>
            <li>it has more of a fresh scent.</li>
            <li>It smells like cheap walmart tanning lotion.</li>
            <li>Great lotion, I&#x27;ll totally buy this again!</li>
            <li>Works great to achieve a deep tan.</li>
            <li>Goes on smooth.</li>
            <li>Conceited really gave me a nice bronze color.</li>
            <li>and I used this product and had a great looking tan just in time for the big day!  </li>
            <li>Love the smell of this and love that it works but doesn&#x27;t have too much bronzer in it.</li>
            <li>I needed something that would work fast for Memorial day weekend and used the &amp;#34;Conceited&amp;#34; only a handful of times and it works great!.</li>
            <li>I am super dark and it smells great!</li>
            <li>My new favorite tanning product!</li>
            <li>but it smells amazing so far!!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m never disappointed.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been a tanner for 7 years, and I love DS lotion, and this is the first time I&#x27;ve bought lotion off amazon.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s not the original product.</li>
            <li>I saw it originally at my tanning salon</li>
            <li>but it was worth it!</li>
            <li>and when I went to the store and checked theirs, it does appear to be the original product.  </li>
            <li>Definitely worth it!</li>
            <li>but then after you tan your body smells nothing like the tanning lotion you originally put on</li>
            <li>This lotion first off smells great--not at first when you smell the bottle--but once on--I LOVE IT!</li>
            <li>The most important part about having a lotion is that it helps the skin absorb the UV rays so really any non SPF lotion would work.</li>
            <li>Loving it so far!</li>
            <li>I am a light skinned red head who is always looking for a good tanning product that not only works, but also smells good.</li>
            <li>I also like how nice it feels on your skin, super soft and smooth.  </li>
            <li>I do not tan easily and only went 8 minutes top!</li>
            <li>I heard great things about this lotion, but it really is not all that.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m quite fair with blue eyes and blond hair.  </li>
            <li>The smell is sweet and doesn&#x27;t leave that &amp;#34;after tanning&amp;#34; burnt smell.</li>
            <li>I even took it in and the manager made sure it was the real deal.</li>
            <li>Thanks :-)</li>
            <li>it really works. :)</li>
            <li>but it smells good and the bronzer definitely works!</li>
            <li>Overall a good product</li>
            <li>Smells nice and leaves me soft.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very peel and mostly burn in the sun.</li>
            <li>It smells sweet, and reminds me of an apple.&lt;br /&gt;Results--I&#x27;ve purchased this lotion twice.</li>
            <li>Overall I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s a good starter lotion.</li>
            <li>I have red hair, fair skin, and have managed a tan before with a lot of money and exposure.</li>
            <li>and that is the only good thing i can say about it.</li>
            <li>I really wanted because of the cute bottle)</li>
            <li>What more can I say it smells amazing, goes on smoothly, my skin feels so soft afterwords, leaves no streaks, leaves a natural looking tan...</li>
            <li>I have used many many products and I also worked in a salon and this is the only product I raved about.</li>
            <li>Super tan super quick....</li>
            <li>Item arrived quickly &amp; was as described.</li>
            <li>Make sure you purchase from Amazon directly (I honestly wouldn&#x27;t trust any other sellers).</li>
            <li>Came very fast!  </li>
            <li>There are not enough things I can say about how much I love this product!</li>
            <li>It was exactly like the one I bought from Amazon for WAY cheaper!</li>
            <li>I am very sensitive to smells, but this has such a soft scent that smells great!</li>
            <li>A great dark bronzing lotion!  </li>
            <li>It feels great on my skin, not greasy or heavy.</li>
            <li>but I was pretty light when I first tried it and never looked orange.</li>
            <li>By far my favorite lotion.  </li>
            <li>By second use I already had a nice sun kissed glow.</li>
            <li>My favorite lotion so far.</li>
            <li>this is the lotion for you, I love itt so far</li>
            <li>arrived fast and as expected saved me over $70 from not having to pay salon price get great color</li>
            <li>With that being said, I think I&#x27;m going to give the new 2014 collection&#x27;s Adore pretty soon, hoping that it&#x27;ll give me better color without that smell afterwards.</li>
            <li>I  am so happy with this lotion I fell in love with it at suntan city but sadly couldn&#x27;t pay full price</li>
            <li>the color just wasn&#x27;t right for me and even though I wiped it off my palms they still changed color.</li>
            <li>Price is right considering salons selling for 65.00 and up.</li>
            <li>I usually have great luck buying tanning products from amazon</li>
            <li>I always get a good dark tan from this product.</li>
            <li>It is a little runnier then most I have used and the smell is ok.  </li>
            <li>It did exactly what it was supposed to do and at the right price.</li>
            <li>I get good natural color from it... will definitely buy again.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t beat price or super fast delivery.</li>
            <li>Super fast shipping from Amazon, like 1 day.</li>
            <li>The first time around I loved it, I think because I wasn&#x27;t dark to begin with.</li>
            <li>The price is very reasonable.</li>
            <li>Got in the mail very fast.  </li>
            <li>Most frequently a JWOW Black Bronzer brand and Passion Fruit Splash kind with 30x bronxer.</li>
            <li>The scent is amazing, and the after-tanning smell is minimal.</li>
            <li>I may try out the Jwoww next time and then decide which I like better.</li>
            <li>I will be a regular customer. :)</li>
            <li>I was interested in this</li>
            <li>It lasts quite a while too and shipped so fast!</li>
            <li>The first time I used a sample lotion an employee recommended to me</li>
            <li>It does have a definite scent like most of these lotions do, but not offensive to me.  </li>
            <li>Bought this in the tanning salons at a much higher price.</li>
            <li>also prefer Juicy if you tan outside more than inside</li>
            <li>The product had the exact smell that it should have</li>
            <li>People consistently comment on how even my color is.</li>
            <li>Just tried this lotion today for the first time.......</li>
            <li>It goes on perfect, no streaks or weird residue.</li>
            <li>Shipping was fast as well!</li>
            <li>this lotion definitely makes me conceited :)</li>
            <li>I love everything about this lotion, especially the softness of my skin after tanning.</li>
            <li>Thanks Amazon!</li>
            <li>Not the real thing at all!</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve bought several of these for friends and they all love them too.</li>
            <li>The only thing that makes it stand out is the cute bottle</li>
            <li>favorite thing about Designer Lotions is how it sinks into your skin and is very silky and light.</li>
            <li>I was hoping for more of a instant bronze color after tanning</li>
            <li>Leaves your skin so soft and smooth.  </li>
            <li>but I really wanted to try!</li>
            <li>I noticed a difference after my first tan.</li>
            <li>It came... so fast!</li>
            <li>\\&quot;Love this lotion already and have only used twice!</li>
            <li>Has a nice scent &amp; the silicone in it helped find lines whereas other products seem to make them worsen</li>
            <li>I have been using this for a few weeks and it is very good for instant results.  </li>
            <li>Thanks All American Tanning! :)</li>
            <li>so what you get is your natural brown and not orange like the cheap stuff that have too much bronzer.  </li>
            <li>It goes on nice and smooth--no smeared lines or streaking---and like I said I only tanned twice so far</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m fine with cheap expired lotion if the bronzers are still active.</li>
            <li>I love the smell, it got me dark quickly</li>
            <li>I always order thru Amazon to avoid frauds, but I&#x27;m not sure it did any good this time.</li>
            <li>Fruity scent, works great for deep, dark tanning.</li>
            <li>And my skin feels super soft afterwards.</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m pretty sure this is not a real Designer Skin product.</li>
            <li>so I really havent been getting too tan with designer skin lotions which i find strange because i have used them forever and always love them.  </li>
            <li>Makes me evenly tan, soft skin right after tanning due to the silicon, AND makes me smell heavenly amazing.</li>
            <li>This lotion smells pretty good, it&#x27;s different from other lotions I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li>Want to be nicely bronzed in as little as 2 tanning sessions?</li>
            <li>Good Product, hard to get all out of the bottle</li>
            <li>Great lotion, Smells ok until you get the tan, then smells bad</li>
            <li>I really did enjoy this lotion throughout the entire summer though!</li>
            <li>and I really like it.</li>
            <li>, this lotion seems like the real stuff.</li>
            <li>I really like this lotion.</li>
            <li>After a couple of weeks though, it won&#x27;t do much but help you maintain your color.</li>
            <li>I really like the smell of this lotion too.</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m ready to move on to something that will help me continue to get darker.</li>
            <li>Bought this lotion about a week ago so nervous because I&#x27;ve heard so much about how these lotions are tampered with.</li>
            <li>This lotion really holds color.</li>
            <li>Kinda bummed was really looking forward to this.</li>
            <li>It was very strong.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I highly recommend!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m wondering if I got the real thing</li>
            <li>I came home to look it up on Amazon and found it to be very affordable on here.</li>
            <li>Seems to be the real thing.  </li>
            <li>I can go to work after using it and it works really well.  </li>
            <li>so I don&#x27;t doubt that it&#x27;s real.</li>
            <li>I really like this lotion.</li>
            <li>Tanning lotion really depends on preference of the person.</li>
            <li>Found it so much cheaper and imbglad</li>
            <li>Fast shipping, product as described.</li>
            <li>I would much rather pay $30 compared to Sun Tan City&#x27;s $90 some.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very moisturizing.</li>
            <li>and it was so much cheaper.</li>
            <li>Really accelerates my tanning results.</li>
            <li>and i already look so much darker.</li>
            <li>** Thanks .</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t really care for the product</li>
            <li>Fast delivery</li>
            <li>I had gone tanning a couple times with no lotion before using this and didn&#x27;t get much of a tan.</li>
            <li>my color fades so much faster with this lotion.</li>
            <li>Works very well to rehydrate skin when tanning indoors.</li>
            <li>and i did use up the whole bottle</li>
            <li>I am italian and have light olive skintone</li>
            <li>I really like it\\&quot;).</li>
            <li>(nice color, but disliked the smell</li>
            <li>It does not leave your skin super smooth like the black tanning lotion did, even if you cake it on.</li>
            <li>The bronzers are nothing special, and the lotion doesn&#x27;t leave my skin feeling super moisturized like other lotions I have used.  </li>
            <li>It caused me a little irritation/itching with the first use, but it got better.  </li>
            <li>Got the most color I did with this lotion than any other.</li>
            <li>more affordable then other tanning bed lotions</li>
            <li>I originally thought this was not the actual product</li>
            <li>I decided to try something new and less of a bronzer because I wanted to focus more on getting a nice dark color and not so much on a bronzer that could make me orange.</li>
            <li>I would recommend it  highly and it was shipped extremely fast.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t usually like strong sweet scents I tend to prefer citrus-y scents but this scent, even though sweeter</li>
            <li>shipping took a little longer than expected, but great product.</li>
            <li>I had only tanned 3 times before using this, and although I had a good base tan going, this made my tan so much better!!</li>
            <li>I still LOVE the smell of it, but you still get that \\&quot;after-tan-odor\\&quot; after half an hour or so.</li>
            <li>Bronzers can make you look orange if you are super white, I don&#x27;t know if this product is like that</li>
            <li>They did however include a sample that was a decent size.</li>
            <li>and I definitely will be back :)</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this lotion I&#x27;m giving it 5 stars.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend trying this bronzer</li>
            <li>I would like to see a little more color with each use.</li>
            <li>I use it in the tanning bed and in the natural sun!!</li>
            <li>but for me, I was willing to look past the smell because of the amazing color it left!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a natural bronze, but still very noticeable.</li>
            <li>Totally well worth the price....</li>
            <li>This product is normally around $70-$80 in stores</li>
            <li>Not terrible but not fabulous either.</li>
            <li>I have bought this lotion before and it was thick and smelt nice.</li>
            <li>Came wrapped in a new bottle.</li>
            <li>But I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll ever do this again, the lotion just seems really runny, and really light for it to be a heavy bronzer.</li>
            <li>I used this lotion only a few times and saw amazing results.</li>
            <li>Smells fruity and does not have that gross after tan smell, gives good color and has a thick consistency.  </li>
            <li>I usually use lotion with 50x or more bronzers so I am used to seeing a faster color change, but I chose this because I wanted to cut out that orange look.</li>
            <li>I usually buy Designer Skin products, however this lotion is just ok.</li>
            <li>Same scent, feel, consistently, look, color and results.</li>
            <li>But, like I said, it&#x27;s the EXACT SAME product that the tanning salon was trying to rip me off for.</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t beat this price, rather than paying the mark up price in the tanning salon for the exact same thing.</li>
            <li>I have tried many high end tanning lotions such as pink is the new black, black and gold, steamy confessions, Ed hardy baby got black, escapade, snooki, jwoww, and so many more</li>
            <li>A little musky, a little fruity--its good (even my bf asked \\&quot;did you get a new perfume-</li>
            <li>Wow just wow!</li>
            <li>This is the same lotion at my tanning salon at more than half of the price.</li>
            <li>Even though it smelled great in the bottle, after tanning it left a really weird smell...</li>
            <li>The after smell is apparent, but again, not horrible like some we&#x27;ve all used in the past</li>
            <li>it looks so natural.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used it a handful of times so far</li>
            <li>My tanning salon sells this same lotion for twice as much.</li>
            <li>worked on my mother who has naturally darker skin.</li>
            <li>Maybe it was old.</li>
            <li>I returned to buying on the shelf drug store brands that really work and instantly at 1/2 the cost.</li>
            <li>Gives a natural bronzing tone and not that orange look...</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t really tanned enough with it yet to see the benefits from the tanning bed</li>
            <li>Its very watery and doesnt smell the same.</li>
            <li>to get a natural color you need something that will bring out the melanin in your skin and darken naturally instead of adding color.</li>
            <li>Not real thick.</li>
            <li>My skin is silky soft after applying this lotion.  </li>
            <li>It is a natural looking tan as well</li>
            <li>Wouldn&#x27;t really recommend this product and will try something else next time.</li>
            <li>I used an entire bottle of Conceited that I bought for WAY too much at the tanning salon.</li>
            <li>in all it&#x27;s an okay lotion, but I wish I would have spent the extra ten and got the Luminary.</li>
            <li>Color results are so natural.  </li>
            <li>The consistency is perfect too, not too thick and not too thin to where its runny and streaky.</li>
            <li>(I can&#x27;t comment on how well it will help someone with a pale complexion since I already have a light tan naturally).  </li>
            <li>For 25% of the salon price I expected something to not be quite right.</li>
            <li>This product is pretty good, it makes me fairly dark quickly and doesn&#x27;t smell bad which is always a concern.</li>
            <li>and this has always made me the darkest especially for the decent price.</li>
            <li>pretty sure its fake...</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t work as fast as I would have liked, but I do have a ghostly complexion, so it did help be get my base tan a little faster than doing it on my own.</li>
            <li>I would get embarrassed sometimes going to the gym right after tanning due to the smell.</li>
            <li>Color Me Happy several other including Conceited, which is by fair the worst.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used several Designer Skin products (Bombshell, Luminary, Ruby), and this is my least favorite.  </li>
            <li>thing to mention though, before I started tanning I was super pale</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it and it is 3 times more expensive in salons.</li>
            <li>That sounds NOTHING like my lotion, or a Designer Skin productproduct in general.</li>
            <li>This lotion helped me get dark fast!</li>
            <li>Gets you dark fast!</li>
            <li>the other bottle ran out WAY too fast.</li>
            <li>I have used different tanning lotions from Designer Skin and also used CT Cypher ($$) previously, but the last lotion I used was Black 20X from Designer Skin which was okay</li>
            <li>I used to use a different lotion and was pretty dark from it</li>
            <li>i have purchased several bottles of lotion everything from SpellBound,Black to White, J WOW,</li>
            <li>She loves the smell and it gets her dark fast.  </li>
            <li>The bronzers are barely there when you open the bottle you can see it.</li>
            <li>Just be careful with who you buy it from, I suggest Giselle cosmetics or directly from Amazon, no other vendors.</li>
            <li>Really helps give you a deep dark tan</li>
            <li>I was using Solid Black by Millenium and it got me really orange.  </li>
            <li>So, I&#x27;d recommend giving it a try since it&#x27;s way cheaper than it used to be (basically half off) with all their new stuff that&#x27;s launching!</li>

            <li> &quot; Everyone says \\&quot;you look good, been to the beach lately?\\&quot;  </li>
            <li> In spite of all that, I&#x27;m tanning fairly well.  </li>
            <li> It smells good when you put it on and while you&#x27;re tanning, but give it about 2 hours.</li>
            <li> It just didn&#x27;t work for my skin type which was fair before I started tanning.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m fair skinned</li>
            <li> These lotions just wouldn&#x27;t work for me because I am quite fair.</li>
            <li> This smells sooo good.</li>
            <li> It also smells good.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s smells good even after tanning.  </li>

            <li> This lotion smells wonderful and doesn&#x27;t leave you smelling like you just walked out of the tanning bed in the case you need to run by the store right after tanning!</li>

            <li> Smells wonderful and works very well.</li>
            <li> Smells nice</li>
            <li> so it is honestly how your skin reacts to lotions.</li>

            <li> I loved using this lotion, it got me tan quick and smells good.</li>
            <li> This lotion smells great, which is a huge plus; but I got better color results from a lotion called Euphoria.  </li>
            <li> lotion isn&#x27;t overly strong but it does a good job of keeping my skin moisturized and helping a tan develop faster.</li>
            <li> Started using this product and got a great tan really quickly.</li>
            <li> The bottle is a nice size and the lotion is really smooth and feels good on.  </li>

            <li> This is my daughter&#x27;s favorite.  </li>
            <li> but I would buy this again for sure.</li>
            <li> I have used better bronzers before, but this one is okay for what you pay.</li>
            <li> I love this</li>
            <li> I am pleased with this purchase.</li>
            <li> , isn&#x27;t overwhelming.</li>
            <li> Love it,love it</li>
            <li> n love</li>
            <li> Love this bronzer.</li>
            <li> -Love this smell!&lt;br /&gt;-Smooth texture&lt;</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m not as in love w/ it.</li>
            <li> Love this lotion.  </li>
            <li> I love designer skin.</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> But not terrible.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in love.</li>
            <li> And to top it off I kept getting darker as the day went on.</li>
            <li> It also has bronzing in it which I love.</li>
            <li> I used this lotion many times and just bought another bottle of it today because it works so well with my skin</li>
            <li> It smells amazing, for any girls who like silky smooth skin and</li>
            <li> Tan lotions shouldn&#x27;t be bought on line because most of the time they&#x27;re expired or have been replaced with something else.</li>
            <li> I took a chance on this one and was pleased.</li>
            <li> it is an ok indoor tanning lotion, bronzer, but doesn&#x27;t work better than others</li>
            <li> and I feel like I could have found another lotion that did more.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used a lot of lotions and this is currently my favorite.</li>
            <li> this lotion is more of a cosmetic bronzer that washes off if you shower a lot and gives a temporary color.</li>
            <li> but I like the consistency of the snooki lotion better</li>
            <li> I LOVE THIS LOTION.</li>
            <li> but then i tried a packette of this and fell in love.</li>
            <li> and the bottle is so cute and girly.</li>
            <li> but it does smell amazing and is streak free.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never found a DS lotion I didn&#x27;t love.</li>
            <li> I plan on comparing it to lotion from the salon to make sure.</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> Concieded smells so good when you put it on and never stinks afterwards.</li>
            <li> I love the price on their products.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;d better not miss a day</li>
            <li> Smells great, but did not do much for me in the tanning bed.</li>
            <li> love the color-</li>
            <li> I love this tanning lotion.</li>
            <li> It works so well and leaves your skin feeling soooo smooth!</li>
            <li> I love the smell</li>
            <li> Definitely an authentic product and</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s an ok lotion, wasn&#x27;t my favorite.</li>
            <li> THe shipment was fast and the service was great.</li>
            <li> Gave this lotion 5 stars, because it works very well and leaves me with great color.  </li>
            <li> This is my all time favorite lotion.</li>
            <li> and I smelled great the whole time.</li>
            <li> I love this lotion.</li>
            <li> Luminary is my all time favorite and would give it 5 stars.</li>
            <li> lotion smells okay.</li>
            <li> is okay.</li>
            <li> Glad I didn&#x27;t pay salon prices and then find out.</li>
            <li> It smells much better than Splurge(which</li>
            <li> I would recommend this to family and friends, so that is saying something. :)</li>
            <li> I will be purchasing more.</li>
            <li> I love this lotion.</li>
            <li> glad i bought it</li>
            <li> but i found myself going tanning more often to achieve a deeper tan-</li>
            <li> Beats paying $80+ at the tanning salon :-)</li>
            <li> It really helps to get a great tanning</li>
            <li> It smells pretty pleasant.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very please with this product and the service!!!!</li>
            <li> The sales girl said this lotion is awesome and since it&#x27;s my first day using it, I don&#x27;t have too much input yet-</li>
            <li> However, I haven&#x27;t seen a huge result in color, I also tan very easily.  </li>
            <li> And of course the lotion itself work great because all designer skin products are high quality.</li>
            <li> It goes on very smoothly, and is easy to apply evenly.</li>
            <li> Gives a good color fast!</li>
            <li> this smells pretty good</li>
            <li> For the price it was pretty good.</li>
            <li> This one worked pretty good</li>
            <li> the lotion goes on easily and the citrus scent is not too overwhelming.</li>
            <li> and so far it seems pretty great!  </li>
            <li> I really enjoyed the fruity smell of this lotion and light bronzing effects.  </li>
            <li> Good color really fast.</li>
            <li> smells good no streaking and not very expensive</li>
            <li> BLACK is my all time favorite, but the color I get from Conceited is definitely awesome.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t tan a lot as I retain it easily</li>
            <li> It smells great and makes my skin feel soft &amp; smooth afterwards.</li>
            <li> The scent is great, and after my tanning session, it actually smells even better on my skin.</li>
            <li> and I strongly agree you wont regret getting this lotion</li>
            <li> Great lotion provided dark color, great scent, &amp; loved the air-brushed effect my skin was left with after each use</li>
            <li> I really liked it first, because of the smell.</li>
            <li> I have a beautiful color to my skin and will definitely purchase again.</li>
            <li> They normally smell good</li>
            <li> something in it made my face burn under the tanning bed but fine for the rest of my body.</li>
            <li> Light weight and easy to rub in.</li>
            <li> This lotion surprised me because it turned out to be one of the juice formulas by designer skin which was a pleasant surprise.</li>
            <li> Makes my skin feel tightened, yet smooth and moisturized.</li>
            <li> This lotion really has given me an amazing bronze finish.</li>
            <li> It seems yummy, goes on smooth.</li>
            <li> it has more of a fresh scent.</li>
            <li> It smells like cheap walmart tanning lotion.</li>
            <li> Great lotion, I&#x27;ll totally buy this again!</li>
            <li> Works great to achieve a deep tan.</li>
            <li> Goes on smooth.</li>
            <li> Conceited really gave me a nice bronze color.</li>
            <li> and I used this product and had a great looking tan just in time for the big day!  </li>
            <li> Love the smell of this and love that it works but doesn&#x27;t have too much bronzer in it.</li>
            <li> I needed something that would work fast for Memorial day weekend and used the &amp;#34;Conceited&amp;#34; only a handful of times and it works great!.</li>
            <li> I am super dark and it smells great!</li>
            <li> My new favorite tanning product!</li>
            <li> but it smells amazing so far!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m never disappointed.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been a tanner for 7 years, and I love DS lotion, and this is the first time I&#x27;ve bought lotion off amazon.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s not the original product.</li>
            <li> I saw it originally at my tanning salon</li>
            <li> but it was worth it!</li>
            <li> and when I went to the store and checked theirs, it does appear to be the original product.  </li>
            <li> Definitely worth it!</li>
            <li> but then after you tan your body smells nothing like the tanning lotion you originally put on</li>
            <li> This lotion first off smells great--not at first when you smell the bottle--but once on--I LOVE IT!</li>
            <li> The most important part about having a lotion is that it helps the skin absorb the UV rays so really any non SPF lotion would work.</li>
            <li> Loving it so far!</li>
            <li> I am a light skinned red head who is always looking for a good tanning product that not only works, but also smells good.</li>
            <li> I also like how nice it feels on your skin, super soft and smooth.  </li>
            <li> I do not tan easily and only went 8 minutes top!</li>
            <li> I heard great things about this lotion, but it really is not all that.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m quite fair with blue eyes and blond hair.  </li>
            <li> The smell is sweet and doesn&#x27;t leave that &amp;#34;after tanning&amp;#34; burnt smell.</li>
            <li> I even took it in and the manager made sure it was the real deal.</li>
            <li> Thanks :-)</li>
            <li> it really works. :)</li>
            <li> but it smells good and the bronzer definitely works!</li>
            <li> Overall a good product</li>
            <li> Smells nice and leaves me soft.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very peel and mostly burn in the sun.</li>
            <li> It smells sweet, and reminds me of an apple.&lt;br /&gt;Results--I&#x27;ve purchased this lotion twice.</li>
            <li> Overall I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s a good starter lotion.</li>
            <li> I have red hair, fair skin, and have managed a tan before with a lot of money and exposure.</li>
            <li> and that is the only good thing i can say about it.</li>
            <li> I really wanted because of the cute bottle)</li>
            <li> What more can I say it smells amazing, goes on smoothly, my skin feels so soft afterwords, leaves no streaks, leaves a natural looking tan...</li>
            <li> I have used many many products and I also worked in a salon and this is the only product I raved about.</li>
            <li> Super tan super quick....</li>
            <li> Item arrived quickly &amp; was as described.</li>
            <li> Make sure you purchase from Amazon directly (I honestly wouldn&#x27;t trust any other sellers).</li>
            <li> Came very fast!  </li>
            <li> There are not enough things I can say about how much I love this product!</li>
            <li> It was exactly like the one I bought from Amazon for WAY cheaper!</li>
            <li> I am very sensitive to smells, but this has such a soft scent that smells great!</li>
            <li> A great dark bronzing lotion!  </li>
            <li> It feels great on my skin, not greasy or heavy.</li>
            <li> but I was pretty light when I first tried it and never looked orange.</li>
            <li> By far my favorite lotion.  </li>
            <li> By second use I already had a nice sun kissed glow.</li>
            <li> My favorite lotion so far.</li>
            <li> this is the lotion for you, I love itt so far</li>
            <li> arrived fast and as expected saved me over $70 from not having to pay salon price get great color</li>
            <li> With that being said, I think I&#x27;m going to give the new 2014 collection&#x27;s Adore pretty soon, hoping that it&#x27;ll give me better color without that smell afterwards.</li>
            <li> I  am so happy with this lotion I fell in love with it at suntan city but sadly couldn&#x27;t pay full price</li>
            <li> the color just wasn&#x27;t right for me and even though I wiped it off my palms they still changed color.</li>
            <li> Price is right considering salons selling for 65.00 and up.</li>
            <li> I usually have great luck buying tanning products from amazon</li>
            <li> I always get a good dark tan from this product.</li>
            <li> It is a little runnier then most I have used and the smell is ok.  </li>
            <li> It did exactly what it was supposed to do and at the right price.</li>
            <li> I get good natural color from it... will definitely buy again.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t beat price or super fast delivery.</li>
            <li> Super fast shipping from Amazon, like 1 day.</li>
            <li> The first time around I loved it, I think because I wasn&#x27;t dark to begin with.</li>
            <li> The price is very reasonable.</li>
            <li> Got in the mail very fast.  </li>
            <li> Most frequently a JWOW Black Bronzer brand and Passion Fruit Splash kind with 30x bronxer.</li>
            <li> The scent is amazing, and the after-tanning smell is minimal.</li>
            <li> I may try out the Jwoww next time and then decide which I like better.</li>
            <li> I will be a regular customer. :)</li>
            <li> I was interested in this</li>
            <li> It lasts quite a while too and shipped so fast!</li>
            <li> The first time I used a sample lotion an employee recommended to me</li>
            <li> It does have a definite scent like most of these lotions do, but not offensive to me.  </li>
            <li> Bought this in the tanning salons at a much higher price.</li>
            <li> also prefer Juicy if you tan outside more than inside</li>
            <li> The product had the exact smell that it should have</li>
            <li> People consistently comment on how even my color is.</li>
            <li> Just tried this lotion today for the first time.......</li>
            <li> It goes on perfect, no streaks or weird residue.</li>
            <li> Shipping was fast as well!</li>
            <li> this lotion definitely makes me conceited :)</li>
            <li> I love everything about this lotion, especially the softness of my skin after tanning.</li>
            <li> Thanks Amazon!</li>
            <li> Not the real thing at all!</li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve bought several of these for friends and they all love them too.</li>
            <li> The only thing that makes it stand out is the cute bottle</li>
            <li> favorite thing about Designer Lotions is how it sinks into your skin and is very silky and light.</li>
            <li> I was hoping for more of a instant bronze color after tanning</li>
            <li> Leaves your skin so soft and smooth.  </li>
            <li> but I really wanted to try!</li>
            <li> I noticed a difference after my first tan.</li>
            <li> It came... so fast!</li>
            <li> \\&quot;Love this lotion already and have only used twice!</li>
            <li> Has a nice scent &amp; the silicone in it helped find lines whereas other products seem to make them worsen</li>
            <li> I have been using this for a few weeks and it is very good for instant results.  </li>
            <li> Thanks All American Tanning! :)</li>
            <li> so what you get is your natural brown and not orange like the cheap stuff that have too much bronzer.  </li>
            <li> It goes on nice and smooth--no smeared lines or streaking---and like I said I only tanned twice so far</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m fine with cheap expired lotion if the bronzers are still active.</li>
            <li> I love the smell, it got me dark quickly</li>
            <li> I always order thru Amazon to avoid frauds, but I&#x27;m not sure it did any good this time.</li>
            <li> Fruity scent, works great for deep, dark tanning.</li>
            <li> And my skin feels super soft afterwards.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m pretty sure this is not a real Designer Skin product.</li>
            <li> so I really havent been getting too tan with designer skin lotions which i find strange because i have used them forever and always love them.  </li>
            <li> Makes me evenly tan, soft skin right after tanning due to the silicon, AND makes me smell heavenly amazing.</li>
            <li> This lotion smells pretty good, it&#x27;s different from other lotions I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> Want to be nicely bronzed in as little as 2 tanning sessions?</li>
            <li> Good Product, hard to get all out of the bottle</li>
            <li> Great lotion, Smells ok until you get the tan, then smells bad</li>
            <li> I really did enjoy this lotion throughout the entire summer though!</li>
            <li> and I really like it.</li>
            <li> , this lotion seems like the real stuff.</li>
            <li> I really like this lotion.</li>
            <li> After a couple of weeks though, it won&#x27;t do much but help you maintain your color.</li>
            <li> I really like the smell of this lotion too.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m ready to move on to something that will help me continue to get darker.</li>
            <li> Bought this lotion about a week ago so nervous because I&#x27;ve heard so much about how these lotions are tampered with.</li>
            <li> This lotion really holds color.</li>
            <li> Kinda bummed was really looking forward to this.</li>
            <li> It was very strong.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I highly recommend!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m wondering if I got the real thing</li>
            <li> I came home to look it up on Amazon and found it to be very affordable on here.</li>
            <li> Seems to be the real thing.  </li>
            <li> I can go to work after using it and it works really well.  </li>
            <li> so I don&#x27;t doubt that it&#x27;s real.</li>
            <li> I really like this lotion.</li>
            <li> Tanning lotion really depends on preference of the person.</li>
            <li> Found it so much cheaper and imbglad</li>
            <li> Fast shipping, product as described.</li>
            <li> I would much rather pay $30 compared to Sun Tan City&#x27;s $90 some.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very moisturizing.</li>
            <li> and it was so much cheaper.</li>
            <li> Really accelerates my tanning results.</li>
            <li> and i already look so much darker.</li>
            <li> ** Thanks .</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t really care for the product</li>
            <li> Fast delivery</li>
            <li> I had gone tanning a couple times with no lotion before using this and didn&#x27;t get much of a tan.</li>
            <li> my color fades so much faster with this lotion.</li>
            <li> Works very well to rehydrate skin when tanning indoors.</li>
            <li> and i did use up the whole bottle</li>
            <li> I am italian and have light olive skintone</li>
            <li> I really like it\\&quot;).</li>
            <li> (nice color, but disliked the smell</li>
            <li> It does not leave your skin super smooth like the black tanning lotion did, even if you cake it on.</li>
            <li> The bronzers are nothing special, and the lotion doesn&#x27;t leave my skin feeling super moisturized like other lotions I have used.  </li>
            <li> It caused me a little irritation/itching with the first use, but it got better.  </li>
            <li> Got the most color I did with this lotion than any other.</li>
            <li> more affordable then other tanning bed lotions</li>
            <li> I originally thought this was not the actual product</li>
            <li> I decided to try something new and less of a bronzer because I wanted to focus more on getting a nice dark color and not so much on a bronzer that could make me orange.</li>
            <li> I would recommend it  highly and it was shipped extremely fast.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t usually like strong sweet scents I tend to prefer citrus-y scents but this scent, even though sweeter</li>
            <li> shipping took a little longer than expected, but great product.</li>
            <li> I had only tanned 3 times before using this, and although I had a good base tan going, this made my tan so much better!!</li>
            <li> I still LOVE the smell of it, but you still get that \\&quot;after-tan-odor\\&quot; after half an hour or so.</li>
            <li> Bronzers can make you look orange if you are super white, I don&#x27;t know if this product is like that</li>
            <li> They did however include a sample that was a decent size.</li>
            <li> and I definitely will be back :)</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this lotion I&#x27;m giving it 5 stars.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend trying this bronzer</li>
            <li> I would like to see a little more color with each use.</li>
            <li> I use it in the tanning bed and in the natural sun!!</li>
            <li> but for me, I was willing to look past the smell because of the amazing color it left!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a natural bronze, but still very noticeable.</li>
            <li> Totally well worth the price....</li>
            <li> This product is normally around $70-$80 in stores</li>
            <li> Not terrible but not fabulous either.</li>
            <li> I have bought this lotion before and it was thick and smelt nice.</li>
            <li> Came wrapped in a new bottle.</li>
            <li> But I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll ever do this again, the lotion just seems really runny, and really light for it to be a heavy bronzer.</li>
            <li> I used this lotion only a few times and saw amazing results.</li>
            <li> Smells fruity and does not have that gross after tan smell, gives good color and has a thick consistency.  </li>
            <li> I usually use lotion with 50x or more bronzers so I am used to seeing a faster color change, but I chose this because I wanted to cut out that orange look.</li>
            <li> I usually buy Designer Skin products, however this lotion is just ok.</li>
            <li> Same scent, feel, consistently, look, color and results.</li>
            <li> But, like I said, it&#x27;s the EXACT SAME product that the tanning salon was trying to rip me off for.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t beat this price, rather than paying the mark up price in the tanning salon for the exact same thing.</li>
            <li> I have tried many high end tanning lotions such as pink is the new black, black and gold, steamy confessions, Ed hardy baby got black, escapade, snooki, jwoww, and so many more</li>
            <li> A little musky, a little fruity--its good (even my bf asked \\&quot;did you get a new perfume-</li>
            <li> Wow just wow!</li>
            <li> This is the same lotion at my tanning salon at more than half of the price.</li>
            <li> Even though it smelled great in the bottle, after tanning it left a really weird smell...</li>
            <li> The after smell is apparent, but again, not horrible like some we&#x27;ve all used in the past</li>
            <li> it looks so natural.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it a handful of times so far</li>
            <li> My tanning salon sells this same lotion for twice as much.</li>
            <li> worked on my mother who has naturally darker skin.</li>
            <li> Maybe it was old.</li>
            <li> I returned to buying on the shelf drug store brands that really work and instantly at 1/2 the cost.</li>
            <li> Gives a natural bronzing tone and not that orange look...</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t really tanned enough with it yet to see the benefits from the tanning bed</li>
            <li> Its very watery and doesnt smell the same.</li>
            <li> to get a natural color you need something that will bring out the melanin in your skin and darken naturally instead of adding color.</li>
            <li> Not real thick.</li>
            <li> My skin is silky soft after applying this lotion.  </li>
            <li> It is a natural looking tan as well</li>
            <li> Wouldn&#x27;t really recommend this product and will try something else next time.</li>
            <li> I used an entire bottle of Conceited that I bought for WAY too much at the tanning salon.</li>
            <li> in all it&#x27;s an okay lotion, but I wish I would have spent the extra ten and got the Luminary.</li>
            <li> Color results are so natural.  </li>
            <li> The consistency is perfect too, not too thick and not too thin to where its runny and streaky.</li>
            <li> (I can&#x27;t comment on how well it will help someone with a pale complexion since I already have a light tan naturally).  </li>
            <li> For 25% of the salon price I expected something to not be quite right.</li>
            <li> This product is pretty good, it makes me fairly dark quickly and doesn&#x27;t smell bad which is always a concern.</li>
            <li> and this has always made me the darkest especially for the decent price.</li>
            <li> pretty sure its fake...</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t work as fast as I would have liked, but I do have a ghostly complexion, so it did help be get my base tan a little faster than doing it on my own.</li>
            <li> I would get embarrassed sometimes going to the gym right after tanning due to the smell.</li>
            <li> Color Me Happy several other including Conceited, which is by fair the worst.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used several Designer Skin products (Bombshell, Luminary, Ruby), and this is my least favorite.  </li>
            <li> thing to mention though, before I started tanning I was super pale</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it and it is 3 times more expensive in salons.</li>
            <li> That sounds NOTHING like my lotion, or a Designer Skin productproduct in general.</li>
            <li> This lotion helped me get dark fast!</li>
            <li> Gets you dark fast!</li>
            <li> the other bottle ran out WAY too fast.</li>
            <li> I have used different tanning lotions from Designer Skin and also used CT Cypher ($$) previously, but the last lotion I used was Black 20X from Designer Skin which was okay</li>
            <li> I used to use a different lotion and was pretty dark from it</li>
            <li> i have purchased several bottles of lotion everything from SpellBound,Black to White, J WOW,</li>
            <li> She loves the smell and it gets her dark fast.  </li>
            <li> The bronzers are barely there when you open the bottle you can see it.</li>
            <li> Just be careful with who you buy it from, I suggest Giselle cosmetics or directly from Amazon, no other vendors.</li>
            <li> Really helps give you a deep dark tan</li>
            <li> I was using Solid Black by Millenium and it got me really orange.  </li>
            <li> So, I&#x27;d recommend giving it a try since it&#x27;s way cheaper than it used to be (basically half off) with all their new stuff that&#x27;s launching!</li>
            <li> This lotion really did help me achieve a deeper darker tan in less time!</li>
            <li> I purchased this lotion at my local tanning salon for $50 back when it first launched, because I hadn&#x27;t checked Amazon before purchasing and felt bad since the girl seemed to really need commission and threw in a few red light treatments with my purchase.</li>
            <li> First let me start off by saying I am very pale and it takes me forever to tan</li>
            <li> the smell is SO amazing and all designer skin products never seem to go wrong!</li>
            <li> I was previously using HD Marilyn before this one, but wanted something new bc</li>
            <li> The consistency of the lotion was a little more thin than I remember when I last purchased at an overpriced tanning salon.</li>
            <li> not sure how much it helps you tan yet,</li>
            <li> Really Tanning Lotion.......noticed a tan in a few trips!</li>
            <li> Long lasting bronze color.</li>
            <li> However, it isn&#x27;t long lasting.  </li>
            <li> using any kind of moisturizer will boosten your tan so if you want actual results go with a non-bronzer lotion and it has a bad smell after you tan.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m skeptical buying tanning lotion from anywhere online because a lot of places just put different lotions in used bottles and sell it for cheap (know from experience)</li>
            <li> Same as the kind you get from the salon but less expensive!  </li>
            <li> The only negative thing I have to say about it is that I don&#x27;t feel like it gave me a dark tan fast, I used it for several months</li>
            <li> Great base and am getting dark already.</li>
            <li> I have been using this lotion for a long time and</li>
            <li> Lasts her a long time, too.</li>
            <li> Maybe they would work at some point but certainly not when starting.</li>
            <li> Everybody&#x27;s skin is different, so what stinks on me, may smell fine on you.</li>
            <li> I was already dark and didn&#x27;t notice any extra color.</li>
            <li> would recommend to use if your looking for a deep dark tan!</li>
            <li> It has only a little bronzer</li>
            <li> The smell isn&#x27;t as bad as most lotions.</li>
            <li> I stopped tanning for a few months and just started up again, so I am currently</li>
            <li> Not much color.</li>
            <li> In my opinion the lotion is too overpriced for the minimal color results.</li>
            <li> The 10x bronzers don&#x27;t streak even on pale skin when you&#x27;re just starting to tan.</li>
            <li> The smell was right, but everything else felt wrong.</li>
            <li> Definitely a legit product, same as at the salon but for SO much less money!!!</li>
            <li> A little goes A LONG way.</li>
            <li> I bought this one due to the reviews.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never had a problem with any other tanning lotion.  </li>
            <li> bronzer (doesn&#x27;t leave brown residue on your skin like other tanning lotions)&lt;br /&gt;-Way</li>
            <li> I was like absolutely not!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never used any other tanning lotion/bronzer except Designr Skin - Conceited</li>
            <li> I have a test spot going to see if there was anything concerning added to the product or if any of the bronzers are still active.</li>
            <li> Farrar I hate to tell you, but I&#x27;m pretty sure you got a fake lotion.</li>
            <li> Good bronzer, definitely can&#x27;t go wrong with this lotion!!!</li>
            <li> because I and a little pink from yesterday..</li>
            <li> Just as we&#x27;ll as some of the other ones in its class like Phoenician, Black etc.</li>
            <li> I have used it four times in the past week, along with juicy tan extender, and I have to cut back on tanning because it has gotten me a little too dark for my preference.</li>
            <li> , I truly believe that I received a fake... Very runny, smells like nail polish remover, and no color after two uses.</li>
            <li> Average tanning lotion.</li>
            <li> I was getting really dark with snookies lotion</li>
            <li> I also use \\&quot;Pauly D unleash the dark side\\</li>
            <li> but it was average.</li>
            <li> and im not that dark.  </li>
            <li> It gets me the dark tan I always wanted and</li>
            <li> Gave me a good base in no time!</li>
            <li> I bought it based off of the other reviews!</li>
            <li> I used it 3 times and it changed my color by maybe half a level.</li>
            <li> but there was i slight after bake smell.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve purchased this lotion from Amazon about a year and a half ago</li>
            <li> This bottle was slightly runny.</li>
            <li> and you see results immediatly and its half the price..</li>
            <li> (Paint it Black literally smells like burnt hair after a 10 minute session!!!).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> There is little to no bronzer in it &amp; takes a while to get you dark</li>
            <li> so I started out with a natural product with no bronzers to establish a decent base tan.</li>
            <li> I get a dark, golden tan with this, without a bad odor after tanning.  </li>
            <li> It was a waste of time and money.</li>
            <li> I am thankful I didn&#x27;t bite the bullet and purchase this at retail price for $70 because I might have killed someone since it&#x27;s non-refundable.</li>
            <li> We will see how it works after I&#x27;ve tanned with it a few times.</li>
            <li> I tan everyday</li>
            <li> The Solid Black also left a bad smell.</li>
            <li> The price is at least half of what they would charge if I would have bought this in the tanning salon.</li>
            <li> but if i were to go back, i would choose a maximizer or accelerator to get a natural base tan.</li>
            <li> Not true, at least in this case.</li>
            <li> And as usual it was a killer price here on Amazon.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve seen reviews saying that this product and others like it must be fake because Designer Skin products are only sold in tanning salons.</li>
            <li> I will compare this lotion to Luminary since that is usually my &#x27;splurge&#x27; lotion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> used for a few days and NO RESULTS!</li>
            <li> I hardly ever write reviews on products but with this one I just had to.</li>
            <li> This is a common scam people pull on others when selling tanning lotion online</li>
            <li> The product was runny compared to the thick lotion from the salon.</li>
            <li> Definitely not amazing.</li>
            <li> This lotion is not runny, watery or fake like previous reviews.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical because of the $50 price difference, especially after reading reviews claiming it&#x27;s fake (probably written by tanning salon owners).</li>
            <li> Has subtle bronzers and doesn&#x27;t leave the palms of your hand discolored</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if I got fake lotion</li>
            <li> I know a lot of people have complained about this lotion because they received a fake.</li>
            <li> The nasty, old school orange self tanner.</li>
            <li> BY FAR, not the worst though.  </li>
            <li> the seller sent it to me in the wrong size shipping pouch, so I then had to pay the post office $.65 cents to pick it up in addition to the shipping I&#x27;d already paid.</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s silly.  </li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t go wrong with any DS lotion.</li>
            <li> I am addicted!</li>
            <li> Not impressed at all.</li>
            <li> The lotion all over the bottle was a bit disappointing.</li>
            <li> I cant believe i recieved a fake lotion !</li>
            <li> /&gt;The bad news...</li>
            <li> I will still use this product, but switch it up with one that doesn&#x27;t smell so bad afterwards.</li>
            <li> Some tanning lotions make you smell really bad after, this one doesnt.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m really disappointed in conceited.  </li>
            <li> Its crazy the prices they put on LOTION!</li>
            <li> You will not be disappointed.</li>
            <li> I used this product preparing for a trip (pre-trip) to Hawaii (getting a base tan).</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d hate for someone to miss out on its awesomeness because of a liar/cheat.</li>
            <li> and I hate the smell of tanning lotions.</li>
            <li> I have nothing bad to say about the product I received and it even came with a sample pack of a self tanner!</li>
            <li> It also provided me with a base in just 1-2 sessions!</li>
            <li> This lotion is horrible.</li>
            <li> Also it smells horrible after tanning.</li>
            <li> FAKE!!!!</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Made my skin turn splotchy colors. Had to throw it away.</li>
            <li> There are not enough things I can say about how much I love this product! It smells wonderful before and after tanning, it feels light and keeps my skin healthy and well moisturized. And the color! Omg I get so many conpliments on my skin it looks so natural.  Not one person said, \\&quot;you look good have you been to the tanning salon?\\&quot; Everyone says \\&quot;you look good, been to the beach lately?\\&quot;  Lol but anyways I will always use this lotion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One thing to mention though, before I started tanning I was super pale so I started out with a natural product with no bronzers to establish a decent base tan. Bronzers can make you look orange if you are super white, I don&#x27;t know if this product is like that but I was pretty light when I first tried it and never looked orange.</li>
            <li> The lotion is great. Makes my skin feel tightened, yet smooth and moisturized. The scent is amazing, and the after-tanning smell is minimal. I get good natural color from it... will definitely buy again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bad news... the seller sent it to me in the wrong size shipping pouch, so I then had to pay the post office $.65 cents to pick it up in addition to the shipping I&#x27;d already paid. Totally unprofessional. They did however include a sample that was a decent size.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this twice and so far it seems pretty great!  I was unsure of the quality but once I came out of the bed holy darkness!  I get darker after an hour and there&#x27;s no ATO!  Loving it so far!</li>
            <li> I was debating over this lotion and Jwoww One and Done, and I chose this. I&#x27;ve used it a handful of times so far and I really like it. It&#x27;s really smooth and silky and it smells so good! The only reason I didn&#x27;t give it five stars is because it has low bronzers. I would like to see a little more color with each use. I usually use lotion with 50x or more bronzers so I am used to seeing a faster color change, but I chose this because I wanted to cut out that orange look. You definitely do not get orange with this stuff. I may try out the Jwoww next time and then decide which I like better. I would definitely buy this again!!&lt;br /&gt;Also, this lotion seems like the real stuff. I compared this to a bottle in my tanning salon and they smell the same and have the same color. Thanks All American Tanning! :)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure it works well for some people, but not for me.  I&#x27;m quite fair with blue eyes and blond hair.  In spite of all that, I&#x27;m tanning fairly well.  I tried Conceited, and I am so orange, it&#x27;s silly.  I almost didn&#x27;t go to work the next day because I was so embarrassed by my orange-y glow.</li>
            <li> Great bronzer!  No horrible scent after.</li>
            <li> It caused me a little irritation/itching with the first use, but it got better.  It moisturizes okay and tanning is ok.</li>
            <li> I am a light skinned red head who is always looking for a good tanning product that not only works, but also smells good. I read all the reviews on this product and thought I may have found it here! It works well. Just as we&#x27;ll as some of the other ones in its class like Phoenician, Black etc. It smells good when you put it on and while you&#x27;re tanning, but give it about 2 hours. All I smell then is self tanner. The nasty, old school orange self tanner. Everybody&#x27;s skin is different, so what stinks on me, may smell fine on you. I will still use this product, but switch it up with one that doesn&#x27;t smell so bad afterwards. On a positive note... It&#x27;s a really good moisturizer!</li>
            <li> This lotion really did help me achieve a deeper darker tan in less time! It does not make my skin orange and it has a very pleasant smell. Great price too, it goes for around $65  at the tanning salons around here. I will be buying again!</li>
            <li> Smells legit, but when I took it to the salon they said it had been tampered with.  The product was runny compared to the thick lotion from the salon.</li>
            <li> I really like this lotion. It does what it says. The price is very reasonable. My tanning salon sells this same lotion for twice as much. I have been using this lotion for a long time and I&#x27;m never disappointed.</li>
            <li> Smells like heaven and works well!</li>
            <li> Smells good and seems to work okay tanning</li>
            <li> Great lotion, Smells ok until you get the tan, then smells bad LOL&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good stuff overall, I suggest using inclusive  i think it&#x27;s called</li>
            <li> Excellent lotion. They sell this for $75.00 in my tanning salon.  Smells great and has a pretty shade of bronzer in it.</li>
            <li> Bought it for a cruise to the Bahamas, and what an awesome TAN I got!!!! Totally well worth the price....</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re using this lotion to build a base tan, it&#x27;s great. I know a lot of people have complained about this lotion because they received a fake. Make sure you purchase from Amazon directly (I honestly wouldn&#x27;t trust any other sellers). The real lotion will definitely give you a nice base tan. After a couple of weeks though, it won&#x27;t do much but help you maintain your color. I really like the smell of this lotion too. It&#x27;s also quite moisturizing and doesn&#x27;t leave your skin feeling sticky. All in all I like this lotion a lot but I&#x27;m ready to move on to something that will help me continue to get darker.</li>
            <li> (Ashley) Bought this at the salon for $72!  This product is just as good as the Salons!  By far my favorite lotion.  Gives a good color fast!</li>
            <li> I purchase this in hopes that it would give me a tan without the sun.  I find that when applying it, there is no difference.</li>
            <li> Bought this lotion about a week ago so nervous because I&#x27;ve heard so much about how these lotions are tampered with. This is the same lotion at my tanning salon at more than half of the price. Just be careful with who you buy it from, I suggest Giselle cosmetics or directly from Amazon, no other vendors. The smell is sweet and doesn&#x27;t leave that &amp;#34;after tanning&amp;#34; burnt smell. Not streaky and goes on evenly. And of course the lotion itself work great because all designer skin products are high quality. I was suppose to relieve between June 3rd, and June 9th and received on May 27th! I have nothing bad to say about the product I received and it even came with a sample pack of a self tanner!</li>
            <li> Personally didnt lke the smell and definitly left a smell afterwards.  This is the only designer skin I have tried that made me feel like I wanted to shower ASAP.</li>
            <li> Great lotion at a much cheaper rate than the tanning salon.</li>
            <li> I bought this one due to the reviews. Smell is wonderful and no after tan smell. It just didn&#x27;t work for my skin type which was fair before I started tanning. Still on the search for the best lotion for me. This one didn&#x27;t give me any extra color.</li>
            <li> This lotion really holds color. They also threw in a packet of brown sugar tanning lotion. I will be a regular customer. :)</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t go wrong with any DS lotion. I was interested in this and I&#x27;m glad I did because I love it! BLACK is my all time favorite, but the color I get from Conceited is definitely awesome.</li>
            <li> This lotion is not runny, watery or fake like previous reviews. It is the same as what I have from salon, which cost me $70. Can&#x27;t beat price or super fast delivery. The lotion works amazingly, smells great and bronzes very naturally yet promidently.</li>
            <li> This item is great!!!!  It&#x27;s the best bronzer I have used so far.  I was very pleased with the tan I received after using product.</li>
            <li> I have used many many products and I also worked in a salon and this is the only product I raved about.</li>
            <li> By second use I already had a nice sun kissed glow. Worked very nice moisturizing my skin as well. My favorite lotion so far.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never used this brand but with it&#x27;s great reputation, I truly believe that I received a fake... Very runny, smells like nail polish remover, and no color after two uses.</li>
            <li> Received my order the next day. I&#x27;ve been a tanner for 7 years, and I love DS lotion, and this is the first time I&#x27;ve bought lotion off amazon. But I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll ever do this again, the lotion just seems really runny, and really light for it to be a heavy bronzer. Kinda bummed was really looking forward to this.</li>
            <li> This is my daughter&#x27;s favorite.  She loves the smell and it gets her dark fast.  Lasts her a long time, too.</li>
            <li> This product is pretty good, it makes me fairly dark quickly and doesn&#x27;t smell bad which is always a concern. And as usual it was a killer price here on Amazon. I don&#x27;t tan a lot as I retain it easily but I would buy this again for sure.</li>
            <li> I have used better bronzers before, but this one is okay for what you pay. Doesn&#x27;t leave you orange after tanning. It doesn&#x27;t work as fast as I would have liked, but I do have a ghostly complexion, so it did help be get my base tan a little faster than doing it on my own.</li>
            <li> This product did nothing for my tan. I used it 3 times and it changed my color by maybe half a level. I used it on Level 3 - 6 tanning beds. It was a waste of time and money. I am thankful I didn&#x27;t bite the bullet and purchase this at retail price for $70 because I might have killed someone since it&#x27;s non-refundable. This is garbage. Don&#x27;t buy it. Back to JWOW One and Done.</li>
            <li> I love this cuz I didn&#x27;t wanna pay out the butt at the tanning salon for it.  It smells great and accelerates your tan.</li>
            <li> Fruity scent, works great for deep, dark tanning.</li>
            <li> This is the best lotion ive ever used!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m fair skinned n I orange easy, this lotion was perfect. Helped me get the COLOR I wanted.</li>
            <li> Great color with great scent.</li>
            <li> Smells fruity and does not have that gross after tan smell, gives good color and has a thick consistency.  I am pleased with this purchase.</li>
            <li> I ordered this one for a third of the cost it would have cost me at my tanning salon! I even took it in and the manager made sure it was the real deal. I got excellent color, it smells amazing and doesn&#x27;t leave your skin smelling burnt of sweaty. It lasts quite a while too and shipped so fast! I would order this again and again!</li>
            <li> This lotion helped me get dark fast! It feels great on my skin, not greasy or heavy. It has a very pleasant scent and doesn&#x27;t smell like I just got out of the tanning bed. I love it!</li>
            <li> I like the smell and consistency of this tanning lotion.  A great dark bronzing lotion!  Would recommend trying this lotion.</li>
            <li> This lotion really has given me an amazing bronze finish. Even though it smelled great in the bottle, after tanning it left a really weird smell... but for me, I was willing to look past the smell because of the amazing color it left!</li>
            <li> I was looking for an indoor tanning lotion that was a low &amp;#34;X&amp;#34; number.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Many lotions I saw were 25X, 50X...100X!  These lotions just wouldn&#x27;t work for me because I am quite fair. Maybe they would work at some point but certainly not when starting. I don&#x27;t want to turn orange accidentally. The first time I used a sample lotion an employee recommended to me the color just wasn&#x27;t right for me and even though I wiped it off my palms they still changed color. It was very strong.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This lotion isn&#x27;t overly strong but it does a good job of keeping my skin moisturized and helping a tan develop faster. The bonus with this lotion is it&#x27;s smell. I don&#x27;t usually like strong sweet scents I tend to prefer citrus-y scents but this scent, even though sweeter, isn&#x27;t overwhelming. It lingers for awhile but not too long.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this lotion to others who want a &amp;#34;mild&amp;#34; lotion.</li>
            <li> Great lotion! It did exactly what it was supposed to do and at the right price.</li>
            <li> Great tanning lotion, it works amazing! Wonderful results after just one use. Best fragrance ever for tanning lotion and very silky. Love it,love it n love it.&lt;br /&gt;Definitely I would buy again and again, and I will recommend it to everybody.</li>
            <li> I really love this lotion! I bought it based off of the other reviews! It really does have a great scent, and you don&#x27;t come out of the tanning bed smelling like burnt flesh! It also provided me with a base in just 1-2 sessions! I highly recommend!</li>
            <li> great product Love the way it makes my skin feel and look. Love this bronzer. I just received my 2nd bottle.</li>
            <li> I usually buy Designer Skin products, however this lotion is just ok. What I do like about it is that is smells wonderful and it stays smelling wonderful all day on your skin. After tanning people always compliment me. I also like how nice it feels on your skin, super soft and smooth.  However, I haven&#x27;t seen a huge result in color, I also tan very easily.  I was using a Jwoww product before this and tanning once a week may be once every 2 wks and seeing great results.  I now tan 2-3x a week and and not noticing any result from the lotion. So if you are looking for a nice fragrance a and moisturizer I&#x27;d say go for it!</li>
            <li> Love love l9ve this!! smells good no streaking and not very expensive</li>
            <li> great color, great scent, great texture, pretty good scent. Got the most color I did with this lotion than any other. would def purchase again. worked on my mother who has naturally darker skin.</li>
            <li> I used this product preparing for a trip (pre-trip) to Hawaii (getting a base tan). It does have a definite scent like most of these lotions do, but not offensive to me.  I began seeing color within a couple of sessions and then after a few weeks I was really tanned.  I will use again before a beach trip.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m wondering if I got the real thing cause everytime I&#x27;ve used it I break out in a read itchy rash. I also don&#x27;t seem to be getting tan. I&#x27;ve never had a problem with any other tanning lotion.  Shame on you if this is your business practice!!!</li>
            <li> -Love this smell!&lt;br /&gt;-Smooth texture&lt;br /&gt;-Nice bronzer (doesn&#x27;t leave brown residue on your skin like other tanning lotions)&lt;br /&gt;-Way more affordable then other tanning bed lotions</li>
            <li> Smells amazing Love it</li>
            <li> Best tanning lotion ever</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing!  It gives me a nice bronzed glow immediately upon leaving the tanning bed!!  I won&#x27;t even try anything else.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used several Designer Skin products (Bombshell, Luminary, Ruby), and this is my least favorite.  The product consistency is thinner than most (possible that it&#x27;s a fake, who knows).  The bronzers are nothing special, and the lotion doesn&#x27;t leave my skin feeling super moisturized like other lotions I have used.  Smell is nothing to write home about. I wouldn&#x27;t buy this again.</li>
            <li> Quality lotion, goes on smooth and smells really good after tanning. I smelled this lotion in the salon but didn&#x27;t want to pay $70.. I came home to look it up on Amazon and found it to be very affordable on here. Thanks :-)</li>
            <li> I purchased this lotion at my local tanning salon for $50 back when it first launched, because I hadn&#x27;t checked Amazon before purchasing and felt bad since the girl seemed to really need commission and threw in a few red light treatments with my purchase. I really liked it first, because of the smell. I was previously using HD Marilyn before this one, but wanted something new bc the other bottle ran out WAY too fast. I stopped tanning for a few months and just started up again, so I am currently but I&#x27;m not as in love w/ it. I still LOVE the smell of it, but you still get that \\&quot;after-tan-odor\\&quot; after half an hour or so. With that being said, I think I&#x27;m going to give the new 2014 collection&#x27;s Adore pretty soon, hoping that it&#x27;ll give me better color without that smell afterwards. I really did enjoy this lotion throughout the entire summer though! So, I&#x27;d recommend giving it a try since it&#x27;s way cheaper than it used to be (basically half off) with all their new stuff that&#x27;s launching! Hopefully this was helpful.</li>
            <li> Love this lotion.  I get a dark, golden tan with this, without a bad odor after tanning.  It smells pretty pleasant.</li>
            <li> Bought this in the tanning salons at a much higher price. This is my favorite lotion! I will be a return customer</li>
            <li> very good fast  shipping will buy again</li>
            <li> I was so dissapointed I love designer skin. The smell of this lotion after you tan is gross. It does not leave your skin super smooth like the black tanning lotion did, even if you cake it on.</li>
            <li> I got this lotion last summer &amp; bought it again this summer. It seems yummy, goes on smooth. It doesn&#x27;t leave you feeing sticky after. I always get a good dark tan from this product.</li>
            <li> Great Color, Smooth and Great Smell. Came wrapped in a new bottle. Ive used a variety of lotion and this one is one of my favorites!</li>
            <li> There is little to no bronzer in it &amp; takes a while to get you dark</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m skeptical buying tanning lotion from anywhere online because a lot of places just put different lotions in used bottles and sell it for cheap (know from experience) but I know Amazon&#x27;s awesome customer service so I figured I&#x27;d try it and this is definitely Conceited! The smell and texture is perfect and the color I got from this was insane. I&#x27;m obsessed with this lotion, as I am with most Designer Skin products.&lt;br /&gt;I also prefer Juicy if you tan outside more than inside it has more of a fresh scent.</li>
            <li> The consistency of the lotion was a little more thin than I remember when I last purchased at an overpriced tanning salon. But, the smell is the same and it works just as well. Can&#x27;t beat the price.</li>
            <li> shipping took a little longer than expected, but great product.</li>
            <li> I am very sensitive to smells, but this has such a soft scent that smells great!</li>
            <li> Seems to be the real thing.  And it works really great!  I chose this product because I knew it smelled great.</li>
            <li> I heard great things about this lotion, but it really is not all that. It smells great but I didn&#x27;t see great results tanning with this product.</li>
            <li> It goes on smooth, but the smell is not as good as others. It smells like cheap walmart tanning lotion.</li>
            <li> Love it. Smells wonderful and works very well. It gives your body a bronze firm soft glow that looks natural.</li>
            <li> I was looking forward to this product since it claims to be a great bronzer.  No color at all. I used this product for a week and never saw a color change. Maybe it was old. I returned to buying on the shelf drug store brands that really work and instantly at 1/2 the cost.</li>
            <li> It works great for me plus I love the scent!!!</li>
            <li> Love this lotion! I use it in the tanning bed and in the natural sun!! Gives a natural bronzing tone and not that orange look... smells good and feels good on the skin!</li>
            <li> I love it! Super tan super quick.... it only takes one tan session for results to show.... a def must get!</li>
            <li> Love the smell of this and love that it works but doesn&#x27;t have too much bronzer in it. 10x is just perfect.</li>
            <li> Designer skin all the way this stuff rocks!!!!  Perfectly bronze tan for my trip to Maui !!! Smells great too</li>
            <li> this bronzer smells sooooo good! I can go to work after using it and it works really well.  would recommend to use if your looking for a deep dark tan!</li>
            <li> Very effective and great scented,  I love the moisture contents and how my skin feels after tanning,  Doesnt leave a stinky smell!</li>
            <li> Smells great but it&#x27;s not the original product. I have used this product before and had never gotten burned with it and and this one did the opposite.</li>
            <li> at my tanning salon this lotion was twice the price i paid. it took about two weeks to arrive. the lotion goes on easily and the citrus scent is not too overwhelming. it doesn&#x27;t streak or leave an orange color but there was i slight after bake smell.</li>
            <li> No complaints, all good!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve purchased this lotion from Amazon about a year and a half ago and it was amazing. This time the bottle came and there was lotion all over it so it had obviously been opened before it came to me or the product was severely thinned out. The product had the exact smell that it should have so I don&#x27;t doubt that it&#x27;s real. The consistency is actually a bit off so I expect this is an expired lotion that expired earlier this year. I have a test spot going to see if there was anything concerning added to the product or if any of the bronzers are still active. The most important part about having a lotion is that it helps the skin absorb the UV rays so really any non SPF lotion would work. For 25% of the salon price I expected something to not be quite right. I&#x27;m fine with cheap expired lotion if the bronzers are still active. The lotion all over the bottle was a bit disappointing. We will see how it works after I&#x27;ve tanned with it a few times.</li>
            <li> Came very fast!  Gives good color and leaves skin feeling great.</li>
            <li> Alright smell. Alright lotion. Not much color.I&#x27;m olive skinned. Eh probably won&#x27;t buy again. But not terrible. Definitely not amazing.</li>
            <li> This smells sooo good. And I got another tanning lotionsent to me in the mail with this one. So I basically got 2 for the price of one!!! I&#x27;m very please with this product and the service!!!! And my boyfriend loves the lotion that came with it.</li>
            <li> People consistently comment on how even my color is. I use this in both outdoor tanning and indoor tanning. My color always is richer when I use this product. Smells great as well.</li>
            <li> This lotion smells great and leaves skin silky smooth. I haven&#x27;t really tanned enough with it yet to see the benefits from the tanning bed but so far it is great!</li>
            <li> Just tried this lotion today for the first time.......I&#x27;m in love. What more can I say it smells amazing, goes on smoothly, my skin feels so soft afterwords, leaves no streaks, leaves a natural looking tan...so no orange YAY!!!!, And to top it off I kept getting darker as the day went on. I definitely give this lotion 5 stars! I hope this review helps with choosing a lotion, I search and try to find the best lotion that gives the best results and I strongly agree you wont regret getting this lotion it really works. :)</li>
            <li> Bought this as a gift for my daughter.  Loves it. Smells great</li>
            <li> I really like this lotion. I don&#x27;t care for the smell of it once I get out of the tanning bed tho...</li>
            <li> Average tanning lotion. Smells nice</li>
            <li> This is amazing! Makes me evenly tan, soft skin right after tanning due to the silicon, AND makes me smell heavenly amazing. I dont need a perfume cause this acts as one. Some tanning lotions make you smell really bad after, this one doesnt. The consistency is perfect too, not too thick and not too thin to where its runny and streaky. It also has bronzing in it which I love.</li>
            <li> Tanning lotion really depends on preference of the person. I used this lotion many times and just bought another bottle of it today because it works so well with my skin but I heard a girl come in after me in the tanning salon and say it doesn&#x27;t do anything for her so it is honestly how your skin reacts to lotions. I have tried many high end tanning lotions such as pink is the new black, black and gold, steamy confessions, Ed hardy baby got black, escapade, snooki, jwoww, and so many more and this has always made me the darkest especially for the decent price.</li>
            <li> Perfect for someone who doesn&#x27;t tan easily.</li>
            <li> I received my lotion in TWO days with standard shipping. Wow just wow! Very impressed!</li>
            <li> Love this lotion! I saw it originally at my tanning salon and it was like $70! I was like absolutely not! So to Amazon I went! Found it so much cheaper and imbglad I bought it! It goes on perfect, no streaks or weird residue. Smells awesome, you don&#x27;t smell like you just went tanning. And my skin feels super soft afterwards. Great lotion, I&#x27;ll totally buy this again! Shipping was fast as well!</li>
            <li> Been using this lotion for over a year. It is great value!</li>
            <li> not sure how much it helps you tan yet, but oh my god!! It smells amazing, for any girls who like silky smooth skin and a fruity ishh smell this is the lotion for you, I love itt so far</li>
            <li> nice color, but it is not last longer!! just like spray tanning. i like this lotion because no greasy, but don&#x27;t like the smell like string after tanning bed.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping, product as described.</li>
            <li> This lotion is amazing. Tan lotions shouldn&#x27;t be bought on line because most of the time they&#x27;re expired or have been replaced with something else. I took a chance on this one and was pleased.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my friend and she loves it. I have bought this for her 3 more times and she wont use anything else I also get it at a great price here at Amazon!</li>
            <li> Took forever to ship but it was worth it! I would much rather pay $30 compared to Sun Tan City&#x27;s $90 some. Have yet to see if it pro-longs my tan but it smells good and the bronzer definitely works!</li>
            <li> Smells great and tans you really fast! Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> it is an ok indoor tanning lotion, bronzer, but doesn&#x27;t work better than others</li>
            <li> I love this lotion! I had only tanned 3 times before using this, and although I had a good base tan going, this made my tan so much better!! I am addicted! Oh it is smells good too!!</li>
            <li> This tanning lotion smells amazing and did not leave residue on my clothes like many others I&#x27;ve used. It&#x27;s very moisturizing. The only negative thing I have to say about it is that I don&#x27;t feel like it gave me a dark tan fast, I used it for several months and I feel like I could have found another lotion that did more. Overall a good product and I would purchase it again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used a lot of lotions and this is currently my favorite. Smells and feels great. Gets you dark fast!</li>
            <li> This product is normally around $70-$80 in stores and I looked on here and it was so much cheaper. It works really good!!!!</li>
            <li> I have bought this lotion before and it was thick and smelt nice. I purchased this order through &amp;#34;city source&amp;#34; and the lotion came in 2 days but is diluted with something. Its very watery and doesnt smell the same. When i shake the bottle i can hear the lotion moving inside thats how watery it is. It smelt similar so i decided to use it but i did not tan the same. I cant believe i recieved a fake lotion !</li>
            <li> I like this as a bronzer but if i were to go back, i would choose a maximizer or accelerator to get a natural base tan. this lotion is more of a cosmetic bronzer that washes off if you shower a lot and gives a temporary color. to get a natural color you need something that will bring out the melanin in your skin and darken naturally instead of adding color. so the color you see isnt actually how tan you have gotten from the bed, its the bronzer. using any kind of moisturizer will boosten your tan so if you want actual results go with a non-bronzer lotion and it has a bad smell after you tan.</li>
            <li> This product smells good and works great. I have a beautiful color to my skin and will definitely purchase again.</li>
            <li> Great product! Long lasting bronze color. Smells great. Enhances your tan with a deep bronze color that continues to build after you tan. Definitely recommend this product and will purchase again.</li>
            <li> definitley a must buy for people who want the best lotion for a good price, its 90$ in the store, much cheaper online</li>
            <li> I absolutely LOVE this product! It smells great and makes my skin feel soft &amp; smooth afterwards. Really accelerates my tanning results.</li>
            <li> I like this but I like the consistency of the snooki lotion better this smells pretty good</li>
            <li> pretty sure its fake...</li>
            <li> I LOVE THIS LOTION. i only used it once and i already look so much darker. I used to use a different lotion and was pretty dark from it but then i tried a packette of this and fell in love. the smell is SO amazing and all designer skin products never seem to go wrong! i am definitely purchasing this lotion over and over again. and the bottle is so cute and girly. this lotion definitely makes me conceited :)</li>
            <li> Designer Skin has done it again.Clean,fresh smelling, not greasy.Giving that brown tan.Not real thick. Price is right considering salons selling for 65.00 and up. I&#x27;m giving it a 4.5 rating **** Thanks .</li>
            <li> Not impressed at all. Not for semi tan people</li>
            <li> Some people said the product wasn&#x27;t what it was suppose to be... However I just came from the tanning salon and me and the girl working compared my lotion to theirs. My &amp;#34;Conceited&amp;#34; was 100% identical to the &amp;#34;Conceited&amp;#34; at the salon. Very happy! The sales girl said this lotion is awesome and since it&#x27;s my first day using it, I don&#x27;t have too much input yet- but it does smell amazing and is streak free. &amp;#34; I think this is the start of a beautiful friendship :)&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> My skin is silky soft after applying this lotion.  It also smells good.  I&#x27;m having great results with this lotion.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t really care for the product</li>
            <li> I have been using this for a few weeks and it is very good for instant results.  However, it isn&#x27;t long lasting.  I originally thought this was not the actual product and when I went to the store and checked theirs, it does appear to be the original product.  It is a little runnier then most I have used and the smell is ok.  It is fruity and almost smells like a rotten apple.  I do not think that I would use it again.  As a person that tans often and has tried others, this is not the best I have used..BY FAR, not the worst though.  It will give you great immediate results.</li>
            <li> This lotion is awesome because it moisturizes your skin and helps make your skin not smell like tanning after you are done! I highly recommend it and it is 3 times more expensive in salons.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if I got fake lotion or if I just don&#x27;t like this kind. I&#x27;ve never found a DS lotion I didn&#x27;t love. This bottle was slightly runny. It made me feel greasy. The smell was right, but everything else felt wrong. I always order thru Amazon to avoid frauds, but I&#x27;m not sure it did any good this time. I plan on comparing it to lotion from the salon to make sure.</li>
            <li> I love everything about this lotion, especially the softness of my skin after tanning. Fast delivery and I even got a sample pack of another tanning product. Thank you!!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s smells good even after tanning.  It has only a little bronzer so what you get is your natural brown and not orange like the cheap stuff that have too much bronzer.  I love it. I was using Solid Black by Millenium and it got me really orange.  I couldn&#x27;t tell if I was actually tanning or it was just the bronzer until people started telling me I looked orange.  The Solid Black also left a bad smell. I would get embarrassed sometimes going to the gym right after tanning due to the smell. Concieded smells so good when you put it on and never stinks afterwards.</li>
            <li> I usually have great luck buying tanning products from amazon but I&#x27;m pretty sure this is not a real Designer Skin product. It was runny and didn&#x27;t feel or smell at all like a bottle of this I bought at an authorized retailer.</li>
            <li> I tan everyday and I couldn&#x27;t love this anymore! Awesome smell too :)</li>
            <li> Great lotion provided dark color, great scent, &amp; loved the air-brushed effect my skin was left with after each use</li>
            <li> This lotion surprised me because it turned out to be one of the juice formulas by designer skin which was a pleasant surprise. The 10x bronzers don&#x27;t streak even on pale skin when you&#x27;re just starting to tan. It smells nice and there is a lot of product for the money in this cute bottle. I have had no issues with my pores when using it on my face.</li>
            <li> I had gone tanning a couple times with no lotion before using this and didn&#x27;t get much of a tan. Started using this product and got a great tan really quickly. It smells great also. The price is at least half of what they would charge if I would have bought this in the tanning salon. Definitely worth it!</li>
            <li> I love the price on their products. This stuff works great! The tanning salon was trying to sell it to me for $85.00.</li>
            <li> I have tanned two days in a row with this lotion and before those two days I haven&#x27;t gone to a salon in a year. I have amazing color just after two days! It is a natural looking tan as well it is not orange in any way. Smells nice and leaves me soft.I highly recommend this lotion I&#x27;m giving it 5 stars.</li>
            <li> I have used different tanning lotions from Designer Skin and also used CT Cypher ($$) previously, but the last lotion I used was Black 20X from Designer Skin which was okay (nice color, but disliked the smell and it would flake off after a tan)....anyways I wanted to try something different and bought this bronzer.  Conceited smells wonderful and it did even out my tan (I can&#x27;t comment on how well it will help someone with a pale complexion since I already have a light tan naturally).  The seller provided the product at a great cost savings and the product was shipped promptly.  I highly recommend trying this bronzer and I definitely will be back :)</li>
            <li> Item arrived quickly &amp; was as described. Works great to achieve a deep tan. Has a nice scent &amp; the silicone in it helped find lines whereas other products seem to make them worsen</li>
            <li> I was using the snookie 70xs bronzer before this and I&#x27;m really disappointed in conceited.  I was getting really dark with snookies lotion but now that I&#x27;m using conceited I feel like I&#x27;m losing my tan and I&#x27;d better not miss a day tanning b/c my color fades so much faster with this lotion. boo!</li>
            <li> Great smell. Didn&#x27;t tan as well as I had hoped. For the price it was pretty good. No steaking, good consistency.</li>
            <li> Smells great, but did not do much for me in the tanning bed. Wouldn&#x27;t really recommend this product and will try something else next time.</li>
            <li> love the color- something in it made my face burn under the tanning bed but fine for the rest of my body. really nice smell</li>
            <li> Would not buy again from here.too runny.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve seen reviews saying that this product and others like it must be fake because Designer Skin products are only sold in tanning salons. Not true, at least in this case. I&#x27;ve never used any other tanning lotion/bronzer except Designr Skin - Conceited so, I can&#x27;t compare it to others. I used an entire bottle of Conceited that I bought for WAY too much at the tanning salon. It was exactly like the one I bought from Amazon for WAY cheaper! Same scent, feel, consistently, look, color and results. Definitely a legit product, same as at the salon but for SO much less money!!! Highly satisfied, would buy again! Super fast shipping from Amazon, like 1 day. I was skeptical because of the $50 price difference, especially after reading reviews claiming it&#x27;s fake (probably written by tanning salon owners). But, like I said, it&#x27;s the EXACT SAME product that the tanning salon was trying to rip me off for. There&#x27;s no way I was going to pay $70-something for this! Thanks Amazon!</li>
            <li> I love this tanning lotion. It has the best and lightest smell. I got so many compliments on how wonderful I smelled hours after I tanned. Goes on smooth. And what a great price. would def buy again!</li>
            <li> This lotion is amazing! It works so well and leaves your skin feeling soooo smooth! The fragrance is nice as well.  Really helps give you a deep dark tan</li>
            <li> This lotion smells great, which is a huge plus; but I got better color results from a lotion called Euphoria.  In my opinion the lotion is too overpriced for the minimal color results.</li>
            <li> I love the smell and I have been very happy with the color I have gotten so far! I am very happy with this product!</li>
            <li> Not the real thing at all!</li>
            <li> Absolutely perfect! I bought this at an eighth of the cost that my tanning salon was charging for it. Definitely an authentic product and I am very happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li> this lotion is amazing...smells great...I absolutely love it....and love that I can get it almost have price on amazon !</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s an ok lotion, wasn&#x27;t my favorite. Left me streaky.</li>
            <li> Amazing!! Works great and smells great also no orange tones just a great natural glow in the sun or tanning bed</li>
            <li> THis product was everything it said it was.THe shipment was fast and the service was great. AWESOME job guys Thanks!</li>
            <li> Gave this lotion 5 stars, because it works very well and leaves me with great color.  Also smells great and doesn&#x27;t stain skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very peel and mostly burn in the sun. I have to go in the tanning bed for like 2 weeks for only 5 minutes at a time so I don&#x27;t burn. Conceited really gave me a nice bronze color.</li>
            <li> arrived fast and as expected saved me over $70 from not having to pay salon price get great color and it smells amazing</li>
            <li> I only went tanning for three weeks leading up to my wedding and I used this product and had a great looking tan just in time for the big day!  I do not tan easily and only went 8 minutes top!</li>
            <li> This is my all time favorite lotion. I love the smell, it got me dark quickly and it&#x27;s a good price. I&#x27;ve bought several of these for friends and they all love them too.</li>
            <li> This vendor is scamming customers. Lotion was definitely tampered with. Bronzer is not as dark as the normal product should be and the smell is off. This is a common scam people pull on others when selling tanning lotion online</li>
            <li> Best indoor tanning lotion I&#x27;ve used so far!  The scent is great, and after my tanning session, it actually smells even better on my skin.</li>
            <li> The bottle is a nice size and the lotion is really smooth and feels good on.  The bronzer is nice and the lotion smells good.&lt;br /&gt;Thank You!</li>
            <li> Is as advertised. Works very well to rehydrate skin when tanning indoors. A great remedy and prevents that leather look ya can get from tanning indoors. Has subtle bronzers and doesn&#x27;t leave the palms of your hand discolored</li>
            <li> Good Product, hard to get all out of the bottle</li>
            <li> Scent--This lotion smells pretty good, it&#x27;s different from other lotions I&#x27;ve tried. It smells sweet, and reminds me of an apple.&lt;br /&gt;Results--I&#x27;ve purchased this lotion twice. The first time around I loved it, I think because I wasn&#x27;t dark to begin with. The second time I bought it I didn&#x27;t care for it. I was already dark and didn&#x27;t notice any extra color. Overall I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s a good starter lotion.</li>
            <li> I used this lotion only a few times and saw amazing results. It smells great, and that doesn&#x27;t change even after 5 hours (I got called into work for 7 hours as I was leaving the salon) and I smelled great the whole time. Color 5 stars, texture 5 stars, scent 5 stars, ATO 5 stars, overall 5 stars. I have no complaints with this lotion and even bought a bottle over Splurge. I have red hair, fair skin, and have managed a tan before with a lot of money and exposure. I&#x27;ve gone tanning 6 times with this and Rue La La and have. Great base and am getting dark already. MUST HAVE LOTION OF 2013!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nicole Farrar I hate to tell you, but I&#x27;m pretty sure you got a fake lotion. That sounds NOTHING like my lotion, or a Designer Skin productproduct in general. A little goes A LONG way. I would try a packet from a salon and give it another try. I&#x27;d hate for someone to miss out on its awesomeness because of a liar/cheat.</li>
            <li> This lotion is horrible. I&#x27;ve been a devoted tanner for 5 years and in thoses five years i have purchased several bottles of lotion everything from SpellBound,Black to White, J WOW,Color Me Happy several other including Conceited, which is by fair the worst.The consistancy is like water, you have got to use a ton of it and it still feels like you have nothing on. The bronzers are barely there when you open the bottle you can see it. Also it smells horrible after tanning. The only thing that makes it stand out is the cute bottle and that is the only good thing i can say about it. I also use \\&quot;Pauly D unleash the dark side\\&quot; my bottle has lasted me 3 months and all you need is about a quarter size to cover the entire body and you see results immediatly and its half the price.. Trust me on this on folks!</li>
            <li> Designer Skin has done it again!! This lotion is amazing! Definitely got the results I was looking for in a tanning lotion. My new favorite tanning product!</li>
            <li> I love this lotion. I would recommend it  highly and it was shipped extremely fast. Any an excellent price on it.</li>
            <li> I will compare this lotion to Luminary since that is usually my &#x27;splurge&#x27; lotion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My favorite thing about Designer Lotions is how it sinks into your skin and is very silky and light. Luminary is my all time favorite and would give it 5 stars. For me, perfect color, awesome smell, tans great with all types of beds, no bad after smell and doesn&#x27;t clog my pores or make me break out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This lotion smells okay. Not terrible but not fabulous either. The after smell is apparent, but again, not horrible like some we&#x27;ve all used in the past (Paint it Black literally smells like burnt hair after a 10 minute session!!!).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Conceited dosen&#x27;t turn my hands orange and the bronze in it is okay. I was hoping for more of a instant bronze color after tanning but it was average. As for all the &#x27;airbrush technology&#x27;.. I can&#x27;t say I noticed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all it&#x27;s an okay lotion, but I wish I would have spent the extra ten and got the Luminary.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used designer skin for several years without a problem until this year....The product smells great,not sure the bronzer is wonderful but I ended up being allergic to something in it anyway. Glad I didn&#x27;t pay salon prices and then find out. I will still use designer skin products but the ones I know I can already use.</li>
            <li> I purchased this lotion after getting it in a sample packet with a variety of others as a gift. It smells much better than Splurge(which I really wanted because of the cute bottle) I ordered it on a Tuesday and received it that Thursday. The package was sealed and smelled the same as the package so I assume it&#x27;s legit. I have used it four times in the past week, along with juicy tan extender, and I have to cut back on tanning because it has gotten me a little too dark for my preference. This is an awesome lotion and has shown great results!</li>
            <li> I bought this because of the candy smell description.  Couldnt be more happy. The smell is amazing and so is the price compared to in the tanning salon prices!</li>
            <li> I  am so happy with this lotion I fell in love with it at suntan city but sadly couldn&#x27;t pay full price so glad I found it on here smells delish and makes your skin feel awesome!</li>
            <li> I am really happy with this product! It shipped very quickly, and was in good shape when it arrived. The product smells wonderful, its very fruity, it also smells wonderful even after tanning.  My friend even complimented me on the smell. This product definitely works, its a low bronzer so it doesn&#x27;t leave your hands streaky or anything. It goes on very smoothly, and is easy to apply evenly. I would recommend this to family and friends, so that is saying something. :)</li>
            <li> This is a great bronzer. Can&#x27;t beat this price, rather than paying the mark up price in the tanning salon for the exact same thing. I will be purchasing more.</li>
            <li> I love designer skin lotions, they make so many good ones. This lotion gave me a nice tan along with wonderful moisturizers. The smell is so pleasant. Good bronzer, definitely can&#x27;t go wrong with this lotion!!!</li>
            <li> I love this lotion. It&#x27;s a natural bronze, but still very noticeable. The smell isn&#x27;t as bad as most lotions. I&#x27;m very happy with it.</li>
            <li> Love it...smells great!  Color results are so natural.  Leaves your skin so soft and smooth.  Would recommend to this product to others.</li>
            <li> I loved using this lotion, it got me tan quick and smells good. It also doesnt leave lotion stains or tan marks on your clothes ....glad i bought it and id buy it again</li>
            <li> Awesome lotion! Smells great and absorbs well. Great color!</li>
            <li> Really Tanning Lotion.......noticed a tan in a few trips!</li>
            <li> Got in the mail very fast.  I work at a tanning salon but we dont carry this but I really wanted to try! I love it! I got color I wanted after 2 days.</li>
            <li> Want to be nicely bronzed in as little as 2 tanning sessions? - buy this product it is an amazing lotion!</li>
            <li> This lotion smells wonderful and doesn&#x27;t leave you smelling like you just walked out of the tanning bed in the case you need to run by the store right after tanning!</li>
            <li> Very good tannig lotion. I needed something that would work fast for Memorial day weekend and used the &amp;#34;Conceited&amp;#34; only a handful of times and it works great!. I am super dark and it smells great!</li>
            <li> I really enjoyed the fruity smell of this lotion and light bronzing effects.  The last year or so I really havent been getting too tan with designer skin lotions which i find strange because i have used them forever and always love them.  This one worked pretty good and i did use up the whole bottle but i found myself going tanning more often to achieve a deeper tan- and im not that dark.  I may just stop buying designer skin all together.</li>
            <li> I love to tan and this lotion is great! It gets me the dark tan I always wanted and it smells great...I get compliments every time I use it. And I am super happy with the price! Beats paying $80+ at the tanning salon :-)</li>
            <li> First let me start off by saying I am very pale and it takes me forever to tan and I hate the smell of tanning lotions. I was amazed at the scent of this lotion even after I tanned. They normally smell good but then after you tan your body smells nothing like the tanning lotion you originally put on and I have to go home and shower. Others are right when they say it smells amazing! It smells just like bath &amp; body cucumber lotion even hours after you tan. It&#x27;s not oily and moisturizes your skin. I hardly ever write reviews on products but with this one I just had to. I noticed a difference after my first tan.</li>
            <li> Same as the kind you get from the salon but less expensive!  You can&#x27;t beat that!</li>
            <li> Smells great all day after tanning, doesn&#x27;t make you look orange!!  Very happy with this purchase!!  I would recommend this product to anyone!</li>
            <li> Great deal! Just like the $60 bottle I had purchased in store.</li>
            <li> This one has great bronzers. Good color really fast. Wont leave skin looking orange. Smells so great. The best part is that the smell doesn&#x27;t really change after tanning either. So you can wear it all day. In my salon this bottle is sold for about $60! Its crazy the prices they put on LOTION! I would order this again, and recommend this to everyone.</li>
            <li> Smells amazing! Non-streaky. Light weight and easy to rub in. Great price! I would order again.</li>
            <li> It really helps to get a great tanning</li>
            <li> It came... so fast! I ordered it yesterday, and it&#x27;s already here. I have yet to use it because I and a little pink from yesterday.. but it smells amazing so far!! Can&#x27;t wait to actually try it!</li>
            <li> FAKE!!!! used for a few days and NO RESULTS! Actually lost color over the time. Looks like conceited. Ms meld like conceited. ITS NOT DESIGNER SKIN CONCEITED!</li>
            <li> \\&quot;Love this lotion already and have only used twice! I tan about 4 times a week for 15mins and have been for years. I am italian and have light olive skintone so I do tan easily but its always great to use a lotion. I have used them all! Most frequently a JWOW Black Bronzer brand and Passion Fruit Splash kind with 30x bronxer. I decided to try something new and less of a bronzer because I wanted to focus more on getting a nice dark color and not so much on a bronzer that could make me orange. This lotion first off smells great--not at first when you smell the bottle--but once on--I LOVE IT! A little musky, a little fruity--its good (even my bf asked \\&quot;did you get a new perfume-I really like it\\&quot;). It goes on nice and smooth--no smeared lines or streaking---and like I said I only tanned twice so far and I notice a huge difference! Darker tan, softer skin! I would recommend it--even my tanning salon said \\&quot;its very popular and works great!\\&quot;\\&quot;</li>
            <li> This is a great starter lotion to get your base tan on. I used this to get mine going and it works great! Gave me a good base in no time! It smells great while putting it on.  The only thing that I didn&#x27;t care for was the after tan smell. ucky! But all in all, give this a try. You will not be disappointed. Designer Skin have some of the best tanning lotions out there! @_@</li>
