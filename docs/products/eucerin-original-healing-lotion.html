            <li>I include some foot care tips below, but let me first describe how I found this wonderful product, and what makes it work for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>: Be sure to shop around for the best price, as the seller linked to this review may not necessarily offer the best bargain ... and always check the shipping and handling.</li>
            <li>I love it!</li>
            <li>I love this stuff!</li>
            <li>I love it!</li>
            <li>Good price, great delivery, for the Original Eucerin</li>
            <li>My favorite hand cream!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s amazing</li>
            <li>This stuff is amazing.</li>
            <li>AMAZING...</li>
            <li>This works amazingly well for me overnight.  </li>
            <li>Her skin stayed nice and moisturized.</li>
            <li>It also provides a nice variety.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this for decades, and it continues to keep my skin nice.  </li>
            <li>Leaves skin with a nice glow, without looking oily.</li>
            <li>You might need to warm it up in your hands before rubbing it on during the colder months.</li>
            <li>I am thrilled I found it and have no intention of ever being without it or the foot cream.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m thrilled.</li>
            <li>Fantasic product with fast delivery and excellent communication.  </li>
            <li>This cream is the best in the market that i have tried so far without any reservation.</li>
            <li>Best online price I&#x27;ve found so far.</li>
            <li>Eucerin creme contains Methylisothiazolinone and Methylchloroisothiazolinone, both of which are controversial because they&#x27;ve been linked to nerve damage and neuron destruction in studies, one of which was conducted by the University of Pittsburgh.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>By far this is the best price we have ever found.</li>
            <li>This is by far the best moisturizing creme I have ever used.  </li>
            <li>This stuff works great and you can&#x27;t beat the price for delivery right to your door.</li>
            <li>Honestly, this has been my favorite, most indispensable skin creme for years!</li>
            <li>Takes care of itchy skin in winter and isn&#x27;t too greasy, but it is more like a paste than a cream.  </li>
            <li>i really love it.</li>
            <li>If it didn&#x27;t, the National Enquirer wouldn&#x27;t have so many cover headlines about the \\&quot;cosmetic surgery of the stars\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li>This offered the added blessing of making my hands look better than they had in years.</li>
            <li>I love eucerin products but this creme is too think.</li>
            <li>The calming cream spreads and absorbs better.</li>
            <li>It works on your Sympathetic nervous system, which controls everything we don&#x27;t.</li>
            <li>This, is magical.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m truly thankful that it&#x27;s available OTC, and I can get it!  </li>
            <li>The cream is best for body and limbs, the lotion is better for hands only.  </li>
            <li>Maybe it does magic</li>
            <li>but it sure makes my skin feel softer and looks nicer too.</li>
            <li>I feel as if she touches Eucerin more than she touches me.</li>
            <li>I decided to look for something more heavy-duty, specifically for treating my eczema and found Eucerin on here.</li>
            <li>and they love it</li>
            <li>Try it and you will love it as well.</li>
            <li>Was recommended by doctor and glad he did.</li>
            <li>i love this cream and love i can buy 2 at a time i use this stuff every day and now i got my daughter using this.</li>
            <li>The Eucerin healing lotion works better for me.</li>
            <li>OK, I guess [[ASIN:</li>
            <li>I am very much satisfied with the results.</li>
            <li>I love Eucerin creme.  </li>
            <li>but now I love this.</li>
            <li>We tried coconut oil, Aquaphor, cetaphil, urea, and many, many, many others (including a bunch of Eczema creams from pharmacies in Germany).</li>
            <li>Bought this as when I worked in dermatologist office we used this as a &amp;#34;base&amp;#34; for many of the prescription cremes we made.  </li>
            <li>In short, for me, it&#x27;s perfect.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;You&#x27;re better off looking for an organic skin creme that doesn&#x27;t contain any unnatural chemical</li>
            <li>and I absolutely love this cream for my legs.</li>
            <li>It does an amazing and better job of keeping my skin smooth and healed than any cream I have ever purchased.</li>
            <li>The price is better than cetaphil too</li>
            <li>every so often to keep my hands healthy.  </li>
            <li>Unscented (which I love) and one tub has lasted months.</li>
            <li>Most pediatricians would recommend Aquaphor which I&#x27;d tried on my daughter.</li>
            <li>And more so you&#x27;d feel a bit greasy on your skin.</li>
            <li>I am, however using it to moisturize my hands :-)</li>
            <li>And it really works great.</li>
            <li>I love this creme.</li>
            <li>Favorite lip balm.</li>
            <li>certainly glad we used this and still use this.</li>
            <li>I really love this product.</li>
            <li>Since then I&#x27;ve been able to control my eczema</li>
            <li>Love that it is unscented.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Best eczema cream out there, especially if you&#x27;re not a fragrance person.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m sure my therapist has thoroughly researched healing creams and decided on this one.  </li>
            <li>Otherwise this is a top quality product.</li>
            <li>This is what we use in the hospital, and it is the best not only for diabetics but for everyone.</li>
            <li>it does take more time to put on</li>
            <li>Love this product.  </li>
            <li>I am okay to deal with that</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure this lotion helps some people</li>
            <li>Pump lotions have mostly water in them, and that is what you are paying for.  </li>
            <li>love it -- it work better than others</li>
            <li>This is closer to Desitin, definitely more of an ointment than a cream.</li>
            <li>I used so many lotions and oils to treat the flaky dryness but nothing worked.</li>
            <li>Mom loves it and so do I. :)</li>
            <li>It is what I needed and have had it before, so found it very great, especially to get 2 of them rather than just one.  </li>
            <li>Not so sure of the hand wash</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this for many years off and on.</li>
            <li>But I always come back to it because it&#x27;s the best for my eczema prone skin.</li>
            <li>I would say don&#x27;t trust sample which contains better formula to impress people.</li>
            <li>My favorite moisturizer for feet</li>
            <li>In one week my face looks and feels 100% better.  </li>
            <li>My best friend&#x27;s son is graduating from nursing school next month</li>
            <li>I just like better ingredients.  </li>
            <li>I spend about $10.79 or more.  </li>
            <li>BEST TOPICAL CREME ON MARKET</li>
            <li>I love this body cream  </li>
            <li>I love this repair creme by Eucerin.  </li>
            <li>But I don&#x27;t think I would be buying more.</li>
            <li>My doctor recommended Eucerin and it worked like a magic.  </li>
            <li>This is a very rich cream.</li>
            <li>This cream is great, better than the one we normally use (Cetaphil)</li>
            <li>always thought I had been pretty good about moisturizing....</li>
            <li>I see significant improvement in my skin every time I use it!</li>
            <li>It is not always easy to get a good selection of Eucerin products where I live, so was thrilled to find them on Amazon.</li>
            <li>The best product ever for dry skin.</li>
            <li>I think the best dry skin cream on the market.</li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t use this all over my body, but for hands, elbows, seat bone pressure points, knees, any really dry patches, and feet, it is EXCELLENT!</li>
            <li>This is the best for dry skin.</li>
            <li>This is the best cream for extremely dry skin.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s excellent for dry, cracked feet - put in a sock overnight and</li>
            <li>And an awesome bargain compared to the 2-4 oz tube available in local retail stores.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used various cremes from very good, well-known lines but none of them rises to the benefits of Eucerin.</li>
            <li>Very good especially for my burns.</li>
            <li>i cried in joy knowing that my skin felt so young again.</li>
            <li>My skin is smooth and healthy.</li>
            <li>He still itches but not as much as before and his skin looks and feels really good.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using the Eucerin for some years, and the nice thing about it is that it doesn&#x27;t change and stays the same over the years, providing excellent moisturizing cream over and over, for a decent price.</li>
            <li>The item came very fast, excellent quality, better than the local grocery shop from where we used to get it.</li>
            <li>but now that I have discovered the Eucerin original, I use it most of the time just before bed.</li>
            <li>I believe Eucerin Original is still the most hydrating and healing creme on the market.</li>
            <li>This is the same great product for a much better price.</li>
            <li>It tends to be greasy, but that is easily taken care of with blotting my hands after rubbing the cream in with a paper towel.  </li>
            <li>We used this cream on his skin for couple of days and the eczema and rashes are clearing up very quickly.</li>
            <li>You don&#x27;t need to apply a lot for it to work well, and the lid is easy to undo.</li>
            <li>I have had fairly severe eczema on my hands, and particularly fingers, for about 40 years now.  </li>
            <li>It actually feels like you have a layer of something on your skin all day (in kind of a good way) not saying greasy</li>
            <li>For solving the problem of dry winter skin, Eucerin is ideal.</li>
            <li>Previous good experience and good results.</li>
            <li>Works best to use a little in excess of what you think you will need, an tissue off the excess.</li>
            <li>This one is clearly the best for us and completely cleared up our skin problems.  </li>
            <li>B001FB5IP0 Aquaphor Healing Ointment  Advanced Therapy, 14-Ounce Jars (Pack of 2)]]is</li>
            <li>My skin becomes much smooth after a couples of months.&lt;br /&gt;It</li>
            <li>Once I learned how to apply it sparingly to my skin just after drying off from a shower I found it indispensable.  </li>
            <li>I use oil free moisture</li>
            <li>Fantastic for eczema prone skin.</li>
            <li>The only thing I can say about this product is that it is indeed great.  </li>
            <li>B001FB5IP0 Aquaphor Healing Ointment  Advanced Therapy, 14-Ounce Jars (Pack of 2)]],</li>
            <li>But, on Amazon everything can be found and its pack-of-2 deal is fantastic.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It is a bit greasy, and it&#x27;s definitely not light - but the staying factor of this moisturizer is the best.</li>
            <li>I apply this daily during the fall and winter months and her skin looks and feels great.  </li>
            <li>bathe everyday (as it&#x27;s best to use after your skin is damp to retain moisture)</li>
            <li>This product is fantastic.</li>
            <li>I love this, love it love love it - can&#x27;t say it enough.  </li>
            <li>Be ware, you must smooth this out on your face or body so it will not show screaks.</li>
            <li>I thought this would be smooth and creamy.</li>
            <li>The skin will absorb what is on it, and if you put more on there, it will keep absorbing more product until you take it off.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a frequent user and this has been consistently good.</li>
            <li>Apply just after shower to get the best effect-soft, smooth and silky skin-because the skin absorbs the moisture more readily than any other time.</li>
            <li>This works the best of anything we have tried for my hubby&#x27;s carpenter hands, which get really raw in winter weather.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s rich.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried numerous skin creams and hand lotions, including all of the most popular fragrance free and hypoallergenic ones.  </li>
            <li>I know it&#x27;s not the original purpose for the creme</li>
            <li>so I was totally excited when I saw the price for TWO jars.  </li>
            <li>This is the original skin repair cream formula.  </li>
            <li>too rich, but my mother like it.</li>
            <li>This cream does a great job at keeping my skin moist in the dry winter air.</li>
            <li>but it does not get absorbed into the skin very quickly.</li>
            <li>There are some days when I am drywalling, and I spend hours using joint compound, washing it off my hands, sanding it off walls, and scrubbing clean my tools.</li>
            <li>Great cream for dry cuticles and feet.</li>
            <li>This is great for dry hands.</li>
            <li>A good moisturizer, but only in the fall and winter when it comfortable to use</li>
            <li>and this is a great nighttime lip balm for the dry</li>
            <li>Amazon is now offering a nice value on two pack, better price than my local store.</li>
            <li>Great product for dry and irritated skin with Eczema.</li>
            <li>I have psoriasis and cremes (not lotions as they dry out) are a great non-RX addition to help moisturize your skin.  </li>
            <li>This Eucerin cream is great for dry skin and eczema.</li>
            <li>This a a great product for severely dry skin.</li>
            <li>I wash a lot of dishes (you can&#x27;t always wear rubber gloves), do a lot of handwashing, from changing diapers and just trying to be a clean person.  </li>
            <li>This is great stuff for my eczema and dry winter months.</li>
            <li>your feet will be super smooth.</li>
            <li>Great for very dry skin.</li>
            <li>So I suppose it would be better to say that if you are hypersensitive to allergens in general, or more specifically allergic to lanolin alcohol, methylisothiazolinone (MI) or methychloroisothiazolinone (MCI), than you might want to avoid using this product.</li>
            <li>This is an amazing cr eam for babies with sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>True story.)</li>
            <li>This is a really good deal &amp; is the same sold in stores.</li>
            <li>I love this creme,it works very well on my baby skin since he was born</li>
            <li>Nothing I&#x27;ve tried is anywhere near as effective.</li>
            <li>It is by far the best over-the-counter for dry, cracked skin.  </li>
            <li>I bought it due to its richness, which will work great for my feet.</li>
            <li>This has petroleum and mineral oil and other not so great ingredients.  </li>
            <li>And on top of that, we&#x27;ve come a LONG way finding the right kind of diet.</li>
            <li>I have a mild case of Eczema.</li>
            <li>This really isn&#x27;t a quick lotion to put on before you go out the door.</li>
            <li>Otherwise, her hair gets super greasy.</li>
            <li>I love this particular Eucerin lotion</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve also found it much better at keeping my heals soft and smooth than any of the foot creams I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried numerous heel balms, including ones with lanolin (which irritates me), tea tree and/or eucalyptus oil (good anti-fungal properties, but too strongly scented for me), peppermint oil (horrifically overwhelming scent), bees wax (which can clog pores of not emulsified properly),</li>
            <li>I have tried many, many, many other lotions and creams to address this issue, and none of them have ever given consistent results like this one.</li>
            <li>i recently purchased eucerin creme from amazon and im very pleased</li>
            <li>Also, no unpleasant odor.</li>
            <li>this stuff works on dry hands and these are a great price and size and the original is the best, very thick!</li>
            <li>Perfect for those stubborn dry spots that need more than the average moisturizing lotion.</li>
            <li>I usually use the medicine underneath and then put some Eucerin on top for good measure like my dermatologist recommended.</li>
            <li>If you have very sensitive skin as I have you will really love this cream  </li>
            <li>But this IS thanks to Eucerin!!</li>
            <li>It is, however, AWESOME for extra dry, cracking skin on my feet and hands this winter.</li>
            <li>Love Eucerin products, this is nice and thick, but easy to Rub between your hands to apply.</li>
            <li>and this seems to work very well for me.i ordered it and received a 2 pack with free shipping and 2 day delivery since i upgraded to prime membership.</li>
            <li>It is fragrance free and very soothing.</li>
            <li>Since he had surgery on his back and couldn&#x27;t apply the cream to his own legs, I had to do it.</li>
            <li>if not longer&lt;br /&gt;Unscented, no crazy smelly oils</li>
            <li>But the time it takes to rub it in is well worth it.</li>
            <li>This product works better than any lotion I have tried, and better than any other creme I have tried.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve also tried other lotions, including another eucerin cream, but this one was definitely the best.</li>
            <li>This is pure and clean feeling, no irritation.</li>
            <li>It is thick but it is good!</li>
            <li>So I decided to try Eucerin Original Healing Creme and really be diligent about using it every day.  </li>
            <li>&quot; right when you put it on</li>
            <li>(I put my socks on right after applying it with no problems or slippage)</li>
            <li>and this clears it right up.</li>
            <li>Price is right.</li>
            <li>I was going to order this from AMZN, but decided I needed it right away, and went to Walgreens.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve found it to be a huge help in protecting damaged skin (rash, chafed, etc) from becoming further inflamed and damaged.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I use it primarily on ny hands and elbows, it also works great on dry lips (will make them temporarily white until it absorbs).</li>
            <li>Love it - there is no other cream or lotion I want.</li>
            <li>We got this for our baby&#x27;s dry skin and it did a great job making him baby soft.</li>
            <li>For sure, this cream is more like a paste, thick and rich.</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s why I buy it in the large tubs!  </li>
            <li>Eucerin does an amazing job on severely dry hands.</li>
            <li>It really does a nice job of keeping my skin moist and younger looking.  </li>
            <li>I experimented with a number of different types, and settled on this as the best for me because it provides a heavy layer without feeling slimy or causing staining of clothes.</li>
            <li>This product is great for someone needing extra moisture like on the bottom of feet or someone with psoriasis or any skin condition that requires extra moisture.</li>
            <li>It spreads no so easy at first, feels soft and moisture after fully applying.</li>
            <li>After undergoing  wound care treatments at a special medical facility, the medical staff recommended this product to my husband  as being superior to most others in the same category.   </li>
            <li>Exactly as described.  </li>
            <li>It is about the same price in the local drug store, but Amazon is so much more convenient, and we get to open a package , sort of like a Christmas present (:D).</li>
            <li>Much more affordable, especially as a lightning deal.</li>
            <li>but they retreved it and if you see a young looking TSA employee with smooth skin...</li>
            <li>It can really work wonders!</li>
            <li>Being allergic to many chemicals in hand cremes, Eucerin is the only product that doesn&#x27;t make my hands break out.  </li>
            <li>Finally a lotion that means rich when they say rich.</li>
            <li>It does exactly what it is suppose to do</li>
            <li>I highly recommend Eucerin to anyone with eczema!!</li>
            <li>Her skin was &amp;#34;normal&amp;#34; within 24 hours of the first dose of antibiotics, and has been for 3 years now.</li>
            <li>Her skin was &amp;#34;normal&amp;#34; within 24 hours of the first dose of antibiotics, and has been for 3 years now.</li>
            <li>It helped with the dryness of her skin for about the first 3 weeks</li>
            <li>Has been around for years and does exactly as advertised.  </li>
            <li>We have used this by the recommendation from our first son&#x27;s allergist.</li>
            <li>8 more words bs either it works in ten words</li>
            <li>It moisturizes really well!</li>
            <li>It is thick and works great for the winter.</li>
            <li>and I find it&#x27;s easier to put on after massaging in the palms of your hand first.</li>
            <li>Product exactly as described.</li>
            <li>There is nothing out there that works better, brand name or generic.  </li>
            <li>Yes, It makes skin soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>Instead my bride rubs this stuff in, and it stops itching and a few days of use puts me in a good way for a month.</li>
            <li>So, yeah Eucerin is amazing for just about any dry skin issue for our whole family.</li>
            <li>Great lotion, especially in the dry winter.</li>
            <li>When I put the product on in the night the next day my skin feels very soft and nice.</li>
            <li>Other preparations are not as effective.</li>
            <li>I have very dry skin and am very sensitive to many products that are available today.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very thick, not like a lotion, and works better and more quickly than any lotion I&#x27;ve ever tried.</li>
            <li>It does not irritate my sensitive skin like so many lotions do, and it keeps my skin soft and scale-free IF I use it every day.  </li>
            <li>He really swears by this product and was glad to get a larger supply of it.</li>
            <li>This is why it is marked as rich instead of light-weight.&lt;br /&gt;Second, if you want real results, use a LOT.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s pretty much all they use at the hospital.</li>
            <li>Although it is thick and can be a pain to put on, I found it is the best OTC remedy for my eczema; especially in sensitive areas, such as around the eyes.</li>
            <li>Eucerin is the best moisturizing its lays on a bit thick initially but then it really lasts.  </li>
            <li>Cetaphil and most of the other creams marketed as eczema creams, especially if they have colloidal oatmeal in them, make our daughter&#x27;s eczema flare up even more.</li>
            <li>love Eucerin for dry skin</li>
            <li>His skin is super soft and its almost glowing.</li>
            <li>Make sure you use it as soon as you dry off from the shower, otherwise it doesn&#x27;t spread well</li>
            <li>Of course, for extremely dry skin applying more is beneficial.</li>
            <li>This works better for my wife&#x27;s dry and cracking finger tips than the prescription medication prescribed by her dermatologist.  </li>
            <li>My skin is super sensitive to begin with.</li>
            <li>mostly, andI prefer the calming cream for everyday full body use.</li>
            <li>I have 2 large jars that I cannot use.</li>
            <li>Shop smart.</li>
            <li>LEAVES YOUR SKIN SOOO SOFT AMAZING FOR EZMA AND OR DRY SKIN</li>
            <li>When I&#x27;m in bed, at least I know I won&#x27;t be touching anything that can&#x27;t be easily washed.</li>
            <li>The medication worked fine, but after I ran out of medication the irritation and redness was back.</li>
            <li>I choose the first, older title.  </li>
            <li>This is my favorite moisturizing creme when my skin gets very dry.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great for very dry skin and sensitive skin, a terrific moisturizer.  </li>
            <li>The large containers In a two pack are very economical compared to purchasing the local drug store size.</li>
            <li>This great for your skin, especially if you have trouble with it pealing.</li>
            <li>It seems to absorb fairly fast too.</li>
            <li>I like the fact that it has no scent, is hypoallergenic and really works.</li>
            <li>It is really soothing, but be prepared to spend some time getting it off your hands.</li>
            <li>my skin used to be very ashy.</li>
            <li>I tried it and it works very well.</li>
            <li>you don&#x27;t need much</li>
            <li>this product really works.</li>
            <li>If you want something fast, this isn&#x27;t it.</li>
            <li>It will work, but don&#x27;t expect fast results.</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>it doesn&#x27;t take much to do the job.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended!</li>
            <li>Highly recommended!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very soothing and calming to my skin.  </li>
            <li>We have to lather her often and it really helps to keep the dryness and rashes in control.  </li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>every two, three weeks because she would very often break out in hives and rash up and ooze and bleed from head to toe.</li>
            <li>Really appreciate .  </li>
            <li>I really like this product.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s really really greasy.</li>
            <li>but if you want really greasy cream then this is for you</li>
            <li>I set it up for standard 5 to 7 days shipping since it was free for my order</li>
            <li>With his hands in papers/inks all day this has brought so much relief/healing to his hands.</li>
            <li>excellent for protection during cold winter months.</li>
            <li>much as I like this</li>
            <li>Very dense but will use for elbows and heels ths winter</li>
            <li>and then you have to really manually move it around to get an area covered.  </li>
            <li>After trying eight or nine lotions and creams, the Cetaphil Restoraderm really was the winner.</li>
            <li>It is very greasy but helped with eczema problem.</li>
            <li>This product works really well on the hands and feet.  </li>
            <li>I have tried many however this always keeps my skin feeling soft and not greasy throughout the entire day!</li>
            <li>The only reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is because for as much as my kids use (about one tub every two to three weeks!!!)</li>
            <li>This is what we have always used to get deep in the dry skin and help it to heal.&lt;br /&gt;It does not disappear quickly but we keep gently rubbing it until it gets in good enough.</li>
            <li>It is thicker and requires a little more \\&quot;rubbing in\\&quot; and perhaps that moves it down the popular list in this \\&quot;everything must happen</li>
            <li>Aquaphor was super gross, like applying Vaseline straight from the tub, and didn&#x27;t really do much either.</li>
            <li>This is definitely a good product to use on your feet if they are rough and dry out always put socks on after applying foot doctor recommended</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried just about all kinds of common and uncommon remedies, weak to extremely strong topical steroids and none of them worked on my daughter who I had the most difficulties with in terms of her skin.</li>
            <li>It is good because it is simple and free of unnecessary chemicals.  </li>
            <li>After trying many products, this is the only one that&#x27;s really made a big difference.&lt;br</li>
            <li>No more breakouts and my neck stays nicely moisturized.  </li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t take many applications before the scales were whittled down to nothing.</li>
            <li>It even works on the little bumps on the back of my arm (k. pilaris) to a good degree.  </li>
            <li>It s very creamy and kind of hard to blend</li>
            <li>Less a moisturizer, more a waterproofer.</li>
            <li>Decent value.</li>
            <li>But if you want something that will work, and you are okay with having a big glob of white paste on your face/body for hours at a time, this is it.</li>
            <li>For my kids, less chicken/poultry, washing all the fruit and veggies with fruit and vegetable wash, buying organic produce or at least all the root vegetables, and good quality beef and really avoid any food dyes and colorings are all important factors in their skin health.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>My doctor recommended this for my eczema and this is just high quality.</li>
            <li>It isn&#x27;t as gross and greasy to apply as Aquaphor, and it really makes our daughter&#x27;s skin super soft.</li>
            <li>my skin is very dry and my doctor advised me to use Eucerin to smooth my skin.</li>
            <li>I love to use a little bit of this on my hands.</li>
            <li>My dermatologist recommended it to me for sensitive, easily irritated, and sometimes dry skin.</li>
            <li>Very thick and takes a while to rub in to the skin but is good moisture.</li>
            <li>I originally bought it for my son&#x27;s extremely dry skin.</li>
            <li>It is hard to rub in and sticky afterwards, but a very good moisturizer none the less.</li>
            <li>It goes on thick and creamy and feels soothing and amazing.</li>
            <li>Heavy, soothing and most of all,  protective.  </li>
            <li>I have tried so many creams over the years, from Nivea to Lubriderm to JJ baby lotion to Vaseline lotion to plain vaseline and Aquaphore.  </li>
            <li>In addition, I still find it helpful by lotioning them up RIGHT after shower because this way, it gives my kids&#x27; skins extra moisture for a longer period of time.  </li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t live without it.</li>
            <li>I cannot live without Eucerin.  </li>
            <li>So overall, we wish we didn&#x27;t have to have this cream in our daily care routine, but since it really helps our daughter&#x27;s skin, we are super grateful Eucerin USA makes this cream</li>
            <li>For my kids&#x27; super dry skins, lotions including Eucerin lotions are too runny and would evaporate within minutes.</li>
            <li>but when you have super dry skin or scaly patches, you need something that will stay with you.  </li>
            <li>I also use this cream on my feet and they keep them very soft.</li>
            <li>So, so far this product has been a daily routine application on my kids right after a bath/shower and even before they enter a swimming pool as a barrier from the chlorine.</li>
            <li>guess it might be a good cream if you are using it on a small dry spot</li>
            <li>(im a 47 year old man!)</li>
            <li>That said, when I DO happen to use it, it seems to repair my skin better than any other topical lotion I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li>It only comes out if you wash them hot, but even then, it leaves a residue that will give fabrics a greasy feeling over time.</li>
            <li>This original crème is the one suggested from the time I started treating my feet for dryness due to Type 2 diabetes.  </li>
            <li>And no reaction from my sensitive skin!</li>
            <li>wow!</li>
            <li>The creme is VERY heavy and there are better alternatives that have since come out which make application easier.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s very expensive in most stores, so we were glad to find it on amazon where we could get the subscribe and save discount.  </li>
            <li>I have also being able to cut down on the topical steroids since I started this product.</li>
            <li>Best stuff on the planet - I literally sigh with pleasure when I put this on my poor old dried out hands!</li>
            <li>The huge 16-ounce tubs will last a very long time.</li>
            <li>And on spots that start getting crusty from all the scratching, we apply this cream throughout the day, plus Hydrocortisone Valerate twice a day, and usually that helps heal her skin pretty quickly.</li>

            <li>It&#x27;s a very heavy thick cream, it doesn&#x27;t seem to absorb very quickly, but so long as you have nothing to do, and have the time to sit and wait, it works GREAT on really severely dry, chapped, or cracking skin.</li>
            <li>It keeps my skin moisturized for ~12 hours, unlike other lotions (even more-viscous Eucerin lotions) that wear off quickly.  </li>
            <li>The cream is extremely hard to spread more than a couple inches at a time.</li>
            <li>Product: Eucerin Dry Skin Therapy Original Moisturizing Creme (White Jar)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think most people would use this on a regular basis since it&#x27;s very thick, but I&#x27;ve had a very positive experience with it.</li>
            <li>great for cold weather</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great for the cold winters</li>
            <li>and it is do much longer lasting than any lotion I used to use.</li>
            <li>people now mistake me for a 13 year old girl.</li>
            <li>As far as a fountain of youth...</li>
            <li>It stays on well, but not heavy, throughout the night.</li>
            <li>We&#x27;ve been using this on our baby boy since he was a month or two months old.  </li>
            <li>So far my experience with this product has made me a believer.</li>
            <li>This is the only lotion that really helps my husband&#x27;s psoriasis.  </li>
            <li>really does its job based on my personal treatment.</li>
            <li>After washing my face, I slather it on, I also use it every day on my hands after washing dishes.and on my feet to keep them soft.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this stuff every day for nearly 40 years.  </li>
            <li>No bubble baths, only Cetaphil Gentle Skin Cleanser.  </li>
            <li>No bubble baths, only Cetaphil Gentle Skin Cleanser.  </li>
            <li>Keeps my skin extremely soft.  </li>
            <li>By morning my feet are so soft.</li>
            <li>My hands and feet feel soft and hydrated after one use.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin</li>
            <li>My feet are always soft.</li>
            <li>This is the first treatment I&#x27;ve found that stops dry-skin itch all day long without needing reapplication.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin</li>
            <li>but then my hands are sensitive to even water.</li>
            <li>Leaves my hands soft for hours after use.</li>
            <li>and that formula was so soft to apply...</li>
            <li>This is the first cream to give luxurious, comforting moisture all day long .</li>
            <li>This creme makes our daughter&#x27;s skin so soft and does help heal scratches and scrapes.  </li>
            <li>This product keep the skin soft and moist.</li>
            <li>Accutane can be a godsend if you&#x27;ve suffered from adult</li>
            <li>product is fantastic for moisturizing any skin on my hands or body that has dried out as a side effect of Accutane usage.  </li>
            <li>I keep it soft using Eucerin  Healing cream.  </li>
            <li>old age</li>
            <li>and my hands are soft again.  </li>
            <li>Keeps my hands soft.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s more like a thick paste.</li>
            <li>My sister thinks this is as good as La Mer (something ridiculously expensive)</li>
            <li>Everyone knows that for eczema and problematically dry skin, Eucerin is the only things that works at all, and it&#x27;s true</li>
            <li>Although it is a pain to take the time everyday to apply lotion, it would be a greater pain to live with extremely dry skin.  </li>
            <li>Usually you slather it on and can rub in easily, but this cream will go on your skin in a &amp;#34;clump&amp;#34; (wherever you put it)</li>
            <li>Very creamy and a thick, rich, unscented creme.  </li>
            <li>And because Aquaphor doesn&#x27;t necessarily moisturize the skin but mainly seals in moisture; so if my daughter&#x27;s skin doesn&#x27;t have any moisture on it, like right after a shower and before drying her up with a towel, then applying Aquaphor wouldn&#x27;t do much on a very dry skin person.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s definitely not a good cream for full body or large area!</li>
            <li>I apply it whenever my skin feels dry and itchy and it&#x27;s a solid blast of moisturization and brings healing to the skin quickly.</li>
            <li>I use it to calm psoriasis patches along with other meds.</li>
            <li>Other reviews suggesting this is a an extra-rich cream are right on.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it for anyone with the same problem</li>
            <li>Eucerin Original Healing Soothing Repair Creme is the only cream or lotion I&#x27;ve found that manages to actually get rid of dry skin and prevent chafing in problem areas.</li>
            <li>It has really helped out with some long time dryness problems.</li>
            <li>Namely, that if a moisturizer comes out of a bottle or tube, it&#x27;s not thick enough!  </li>
            <li>But it has certainly helped with dry skin/eczema I&#x27;ve been having on my face.  </li>
            <li>I wash my hands very often all day and I  get cracked dry hands.  </li>
            <li>However, I did find that it&#x27;s really worked wonders for my dry heels.</li>
            <li>Works very well on dry skin.</li>
            <li>It worked very well on my dry chapped hands.  </li>
            <li>I love Eucerin but this lotion is too thick and sticky for daily use.</li>
            <li>The cream is thick but keeps skin moisturized and pores open to better absorb ointments.</li>
            <li>Second, you need to apply a THICK layer if you want this to work, preferably a couple times a day or more.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very thick and greasy but the greasiness goes away pretty quickly.</li>
            <li>It works great, but is so thick he sometimes acts like he&#x27;s uncomfortable during application - even after we first rub it thoroughly in our palms.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not a traditional lotiony feeling and it does not have a floral scent which sensitive skin users will appreciate!  </li>
            <li>one day I used one small tube of Eucerin (original) sample which I got from skin specialist..</li>
            <li>Our first son dealt with minor skin issues from being slightly allergic to certain foods and having eczema.</li>
            <li>Eucerin fixed them right up just after a few days of use.  </li>
            <li>But overall, her skin is not as dry, cracked and red as it used to be, unless we forget to put it on (we rarely forget).</li>
            <li>But overall, her skin is not as dry, cracked and red as it used to be, unless we forget to put it on (we rarely forget).</li>
            <li>Is does really work well for very dry skin but</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also very economical, because a little goes a long way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Otherwise, after a few days of this kind of work, the skin on my hands is so badly chapped and cracked that I don&#x27;t like them touching anything at all.</li>
            <li>(Boy, will they be soft when you finally do.)</li>
            <li>And doesn&#x27;t cause itchiness that some others products do, so apparently doesn&#x27;t have some things in it that I might be allergic to.</li>
            <li>My dermatologist says that only the Eucerin and the Cetaphil are pure enough to use on my dry, sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>We have 3 boys who have eczema, one very badly, and this is the best product we&#x27;ve found.  </li>
            <li>We usually put it on in the morning and have her sit on a towel and read a book till the cream is soaked in (it soaks in rather quickly, as compared to Aquaphor).</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s so thick and hard packed in the jar that I couldn&#x27;t even get a good whip on my fingers not to mention to leather over her body....</li>
            <li>We bought this to use on our new baby&#x27;s dry patches on his cheeks, thighs and elbows.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re not allergic to the aforementioned ingredients, than I&#x27;d highly recommend giving this a try if you have dry, chafed or otherwise irritated skin.</li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t put this on &amp; feel comfortable using the computer, it is a little greasy, but I expect that with something so extremely moisturizing.</li>
            <li>My mom has dry sensitive skin and also she has eczema and this helps it from drying and getting her breakouts.</li>
            <li>An old standby product that works on dry skin.</li>
            <li>Bashfulness son&#x27;s skin is very dry, with a lot of skin care products are useless until you find the Eucerin Original Healing Soothing Repair Creme, very moisturizing, cold weather began, this is a wise choice.</li>
            <li>I keep a large jar of this in my bedroom, so I use a little before leaving home.</li>
            <li>I know it&#x27;s difficult (if not impossible) to get rid of eczema without corticosteroids and this product didn&#x27;t do much by itself in this regard.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Very hard to smooth into skin.</li>

            <li> I include some foot care tips below, but let me first describe how I found this wonderful product, and what makes it work for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> : Be sure to shop around for the best price, as the seller linked to this review may not necessarily offer the best bargain ... and always check the shipping and handling.</li>
            <li> I love it!</li>
            <li> I love this stuff!</li>
            <li> I love it!</li>
            <li> Good price, great delivery, for the Original Eucerin</li>
            <li> My favorite hand cream!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s amazing</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing.</li>
            <li> AMAZING...</li>
            <li> This works amazingly well for me overnight.  </li>
            <li> Her skin stayed nice and moisturized.</li>
            <li> It also provides a nice variety.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for decades, and it continues to keep my skin nice.  </li>
            <li> Leaves skin with a nice glow, without looking oily.</li>
            <li> You might need to warm it up in your hands before rubbing it on during the colder months.</li>
            <li> I am thrilled I found it and have no intention of ever being without it or the foot cream.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m thrilled.</li>
            <li> Fantasic product with fast delivery and excellent communication.  </li>
            <li> This cream is the best in the market that i have tried so far without any reservation.</li>
            <li> Best online price I&#x27;ve found so far.</li>
            <li> Eucerin creme contains Methylisothiazolinone and Methylchloroisothiazolinone, both of which are controversial because they&#x27;ve been linked to nerve damage and neuron destruction in studies, one of which was conducted by the University of Pittsburgh.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> By far this is the best price we have ever found.</li>
            <li> This is by far the best moisturizing creme I have ever used.  </li>
            <li> This stuff works great and you can&#x27;t beat the price for delivery right to your door.</li>
            <li> Honestly, this has been my favorite, most indispensable skin creme for years!</li>
            <li> Takes care of itchy skin in winter and isn&#x27;t too greasy, but it is more like a paste than a cream.  </li>
            <li> i really love it.</li>
            <li> If it didn&#x27;t, the National Enquirer wouldn&#x27;t have so many cover headlines about the \\&quot;cosmetic surgery of the stars\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li> This offered the added blessing of making my hands look better than they had in years.</li>
            <li> I love eucerin products but this creme is too think.</li>
            <li> The calming cream spreads and absorbs better.</li>
            <li> It works on your Sympathetic nervous system, which controls everything we don&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> This, is magical.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m truly thankful that it&#x27;s available OTC, and I can get it!  </li>
            <li> The cream is best for body and limbs, the lotion is better for hands only.  </li>
            <li> Maybe it does magic</li>
            <li> but it sure makes my skin feel softer and looks nicer too.</li>
            <li> I feel as if she touches Eucerin more than she touches me.</li>
            <li> I decided to look for something more heavy-duty, specifically for treating my eczema and found Eucerin on here.</li>
            <li> and they love it</li>
            <li> Try it and you will love it as well.</li>
            <li> Was recommended by doctor and glad he did.</li>
            <li> i love this cream and love i can buy 2 at a time i use this stuff every day and now i got my daughter using this.</li>
            <li> The Eucerin healing lotion works better for me.</li>
            <li> OK, I guess [[ASIN:</li>
            <li> I am very much satisfied with the results.</li>
            <li> I love Eucerin creme.  </li>
            <li> but now I love this.</li>
            <li> We tried coconut oil, Aquaphor, cetaphil, urea, and many, many, many others (including a bunch of Eczema creams from pharmacies in Germany).</li>
            <li> Bought this as when I worked in dermatologist office we used this as a &amp;#34;base&amp;#34; for many of the prescription cremes we made.  </li>
            <li> In short, for me, it&#x27;s perfect.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;You&#x27;re better off looking for an organic skin creme that doesn&#x27;t contain any unnatural chemical</li>
            <li> and I absolutely love this cream for my legs.</li>
            <li> It does an amazing and better job of keeping my skin smooth and healed than any cream I have ever purchased.</li>
            <li> The price is better than cetaphil too</li>
            <li> every so often to keep my hands healthy.  </li>
            <li> Unscented (which I love) and one tub has lasted months.</li>
            <li> Most pediatricians would recommend Aquaphor which I&#x27;d tried on my daughter.</li>
            <li> And more so you&#x27;d feel a bit greasy on your skin.</li>
            <li> I am, however using it to moisturize my hands :-)</li>
            <li> And it really works great.</li>
            <li> I love this creme.</li>
            <li> Favorite lip balm.</li>
            <li> certainly glad we used this and still use this.</li>
            <li> I really love this product.</li>
            <li> Since then I&#x27;ve been able to control my eczema</li>
            <li> Love that it is unscented.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Best eczema cream out there, especially if you&#x27;re not a fragrance person.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m sure my therapist has thoroughly researched healing creams and decided on this one.  </li>
            <li> Otherwise this is a top quality product.</li>
            <li> This is what we use in the hospital, and it is the best not only for diabetics but for everyone.</li>
            <li> it does take more time to put on</li>
            <li> Love this product.  </li>
            <li> I am okay to deal with that</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure this lotion helps some people</li>
            <li> Pump lotions have mostly water in them, and that is what you are paying for.  </li>
            <li> love it -- it work better than others</li>
            <li> This is closer to Desitin, definitely more of an ointment than a cream.</li>
            <li> I used so many lotions and oils to treat the flaky dryness but nothing worked.</li>
            <li> Mom loves it and so do I. :)</li>
            <li> It is what I needed and have had it before, so found it very great, especially to get 2 of them rather than just one.  </li>
            <li> Not so sure of the hand wash</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for many years off and on.</li>
            <li> But I always come back to it because it&#x27;s the best for my eczema prone skin.</li>
            <li> I would say don&#x27;t trust sample which contains better formula to impress people.</li>
            <li> My favorite moisturizer for feet</li>
            <li> In one week my face looks and feels 100% better.  </li>
            <li> My best friend&#x27;s son is graduating from nursing school next month</li>
            <li> I just like better ingredients.  </li>
            <li> I spend about $10.79 or more.  </li>
            <li> BEST TOPICAL CREME ON MARKET</li>
            <li> I love this body cream  </li>
            <li> I love this repair creme by Eucerin.  </li>
            <li> But I don&#x27;t think I would be buying more.</li>
            <li> My doctor recommended Eucerin and it worked like a magic.  </li>
            <li> This is a very rich cream.</li>
            <li> This cream is great, better than the one we normally use (Cetaphil)</li>
            <li> always thought I had been pretty good about moisturizing....</li>
            <li> I see significant improvement in my skin every time I use it!</li>
            <li> It is not always easy to get a good selection of Eucerin products where I live, so was thrilled to find them on Amazon.</li>
            <li> The best product ever for dry skin.</li>
            <li> I think the best dry skin cream on the market.</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t use this all over my body, but for hands, elbows, seat bone pressure points, knees, any really dry patches, and feet, it is EXCELLENT!</li>
            <li> This is the best for dry skin.</li>
            <li> This is the best cream for extremely dry skin.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s excellent for dry, cracked feet - put in a sock overnight and</li>
            <li> And an awesome bargain compared to the 2-4 oz tube available in local retail stores.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used various cremes from very good, well-known lines but none of them rises to the benefits of Eucerin.</li>
            <li> Very good especially for my burns.</li>
            <li> i cried in joy knowing that my skin felt so young again.</li>
            <li> My skin is smooth and healthy.</li>
            <li> He still itches but not as much as before and his skin looks and feels really good.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the Eucerin for some years, and the nice thing about it is that it doesn&#x27;t change and stays the same over the years, providing excellent moisturizing cream over and over, for a decent price.</li>
            <li> The item came very fast, excellent quality, better than the local grocery shop from where we used to get it.</li>
            <li> but now that I have discovered the Eucerin original, I use it most of the time just before bed.</li>
            <li> I believe Eucerin Original is still the most hydrating and healing creme on the market.</li>
            <li> This is the same great product for a much better price.</li>
            <li> It tends to be greasy, but that is easily taken care of with blotting my hands after rubbing the cream in with a paper towel.  </li>
            <li> We used this cream on his skin for couple of days and the eczema and rashes are clearing up very quickly.</li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t need to apply a lot for it to work well, and the lid is easy to undo.</li>
            <li> I have had fairly severe eczema on my hands, and particularly fingers, for about 40 years now.  </li>
            <li> It actually feels like you have a layer of something on your skin all day (in kind of a good way) not saying greasy</li>
            <li> For solving the problem of dry winter skin, Eucerin is ideal.</li>
            <li> Previous good experience and good results.</li>
            <li> Works best to use a little in excess of what you think you will need, an tissue off the excess.</li>
            <li> This one is clearly the best for us and completely cleared up our skin problems.  </li>
            <li> B001FB5IP0 Aquaphor Healing Ointment  Advanced Therapy, 14-Ounce Jars (Pack of 2)]]is</li>
            <li> My skin becomes much smooth after a couples of months.&lt;br /&gt;It</li>
            <li> Once I learned how to apply it sparingly to my skin just after drying off from a shower I found it indispensable.  </li>
            <li> I use oil free moisture</li>
            <li> Fantastic for eczema prone skin.</li>
            <li> The only thing I can say about this product is that it is indeed great.  </li>
            <li> B001FB5IP0 Aquaphor Healing Ointment  Advanced Therapy, 14-Ounce Jars (Pack of 2)]],</li>
            <li> But, on Amazon everything can be found and its pack-of-2 deal is fantastic.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It is a bit greasy, and it&#x27;s definitely not light - but the staying factor of this moisturizer is the best.</li>
            <li> I apply this daily during the fall and winter months and her skin looks and feels great.  </li>
            <li> bathe everyday (as it&#x27;s best to use after your skin is damp to retain moisture)</li>
            <li> This product is fantastic.</li>
            <li> I love this, love it love love it - can&#x27;t say it enough.  </li>
            <li> Be ware, you must smooth this out on your face or body so it will not show screaks.</li>
            <li> I thought this would be smooth and creamy.</li>
            <li> The skin will absorb what is on it, and if you put more on there, it will keep absorbing more product until you take it off.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a frequent user and this has been consistently good.</li>
            <li> Apply just after shower to get the best effect-soft, smooth and silky skin-because the skin absorbs the moisture more readily than any other time.</li>
            <li> This works the best of anything we have tried for my hubby&#x27;s carpenter hands, which get really raw in winter weather.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s rich.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried numerous skin creams and hand lotions, including all of the most popular fragrance free and hypoallergenic ones.  </li>
            <li> I know it&#x27;s not the original purpose for the creme</li>
            <li> so I was totally excited when I saw the price for TWO jars.  </li>
            <li> This is the original skin repair cream formula.  </li>
            <li> too rich, but my mother like it.</li>
            <li> This cream does a great job at keeping my skin moist in the dry winter air.</li>
            <li> but it does not get absorbed into the skin very quickly.</li>
            <li> There are some days when I am drywalling, and I spend hours using joint compound, washing it off my hands, sanding it off walls, and scrubbing clean my tools.</li>
            <li> Great cream for dry cuticles and feet.</li>
            <li> This is great for dry hands.</li>
            <li> A good moisturizer, but only in the fall and winter when it comfortable to use</li>
            <li> and this is a great nighttime lip balm for the dry</li>
            <li> Amazon is now offering a nice value on two pack, better price than my local store.</li>
            <li> Great product for dry and irritated skin with Eczema.</li>
            <li> I have psoriasis and cremes (not lotions as they dry out) are a great non-RX addition to help moisturize your skin.  </li>
            <li> This Eucerin cream is great for dry skin and eczema.</li>
            <li> This a a great product for severely dry skin.</li>
            <li> I wash a lot of dishes (you can&#x27;t always wear rubber gloves), do a lot of handwashing, from changing diapers and just trying to be a clean person.  </li>
            <li> This is great stuff for my eczema and dry winter months.</li>
            <li> your feet will be super smooth.</li>
            <li> Great for very dry skin.</li>
            <li> So I suppose it would be better to say that if you are hypersensitive to allergens in general, or more specifically allergic to lanolin alcohol, methylisothiazolinone (MI) or methychloroisothiazolinone (MCI), than you might want to avoid using this product.</li>
            <li> This is an amazing cr eam for babies with sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li> True story.)</li>
            <li> This is a really good deal &amp; is the same sold in stores.</li>
            <li> I love this creme,it works very well on my baby skin since he was born</li>
            <li> Nothing I&#x27;ve tried is anywhere near as effective.</li>
            <li> It is by far the best over-the-counter for dry, cracked skin.  </li>
            <li> I bought it due to its richness, which will work great for my feet.</li>
            <li> This has petroleum and mineral oil and other not so great ingredients.  </li>
            <li> And on top of that, we&#x27;ve come a LONG way finding the right kind of diet.</li>
            <li> I have a mild case of Eczema.</li>
            <li> This really isn&#x27;t a quick lotion to put on before you go out the door.</li>
            <li> Otherwise, her hair gets super greasy.</li>
            <li> I love this particular Eucerin lotion</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve also found it much better at keeping my heals soft and smooth than any of the foot creams I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried numerous heel balms, including ones with lanolin (which irritates me), tea tree and/or eucalyptus oil (good anti-fungal properties, but too strongly scented for me), peppermint oil (horrifically overwhelming scent), bees wax (which can clog pores of not emulsified properly),</li>
            <li> I have tried many, many, many other lotions and creams to address this issue, and none of them have ever given consistent results like this one.</li>
            <li> i recently purchased eucerin creme from amazon and im very pleased</li>
            <li> Also, no unpleasant odor.</li>
            <li> this stuff works on dry hands and these are a great price and size and the original is the best, very thick!</li>
            <li> Perfect for those stubborn dry spots that need more than the average moisturizing lotion.</li>
            <li> I usually use the medicine underneath and then put some Eucerin on top for good measure like my dermatologist recommended.</li>
            <li> If you have very sensitive skin as I have you will really love this cream  </li>
            <li> But this IS thanks to Eucerin!!</li>
            <li> It is, however, AWESOME for extra dry, cracking skin on my feet and hands this winter.</li>
            <li> Love Eucerin products, this is nice and thick, but easy to Rub between your hands to apply.</li>
            <li> and this seems to work very well for me.i ordered it and received a 2 pack with free shipping and 2 day delivery since i upgraded to prime membership.</li>
            <li> It is fragrance free and very soothing.</li>
            <li> Since he had surgery on his back and couldn&#x27;t apply the cream to his own legs, I had to do it.</li>
            <li> if not longer&lt;br /&gt;Unscented, no crazy smelly oils</li>
            <li> But the time it takes to rub it in is well worth it.</li>
            <li> This product works better than any lotion I have tried, and better than any other creme I have tried.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve also tried other lotions, including another eucerin cream, but this one was definitely the best.</li>
            <li> This is pure and clean feeling, no irritation.</li>
            <li> It is thick but it is good!</li>
            <li> So I decided to try Eucerin Original Healing Creme and really be diligent about using it every day.  </li>
            <li> &quot; right when you put it on</li>
            <li> (I put my socks on right after applying it with no problems or slippage)</li>
            <li> and this clears it right up.</li>
            <li> Price is right.</li>
            <li> I was going to order this from AMZN, but decided I needed it right away, and went to Walgreens.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve found it to be a huge help in protecting damaged skin (rash, chafed, etc) from becoming further inflamed and damaged.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I use it primarily on ny hands and elbows, it also works great on dry lips (will make them temporarily white until it absorbs).</li>
            <li> Love it - there is no other cream or lotion I want.</li>
            <li> We got this for our baby&#x27;s dry skin and it did a great job making him baby soft.</li>
            <li> For sure, this cream is more like a paste, thick and rich.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s why I buy it in the large tubs!  </li>
            <li> Eucerin does an amazing job on severely dry hands.</li>
            <li> It really does a nice job of keeping my skin moist and younger looking.  </li>
            <li> I experimented with a number of different types, and settled on this as the best for me because it provides a heavy layer without feeling slimy or causing staining of clothes.</li>
            <li> This product is great for someone needing extra moisture like on the bottom of feet or someone with psoriasis or any skin condition that requires extra moisture.</li>
            <li> It spreads no so easy at first, feels soft and moisture after fully applying.</li>
            <li> After undergoing  wound care treatments at a special medical facility, the medical staff recommended this product to my husband  as being superior to most others in the same category.   </li>
            <li> Exactly as described.  </li>
            <li> It is about the same price in the local drug store, but Amazon is so much more convenient, and we get to open a package , sort of like a Christmas present (:D).</li>
            <li> Much more affordable, especially as a lightning deal.</li>
            <li> but they retreved it and if you see a young looking TSA employee with smooth skin...</li>
            <li> It can really work wonders!</li>
            <li> Being allergic to many chemicals in hand cremes, Eucerin is the only product that doesn&#x27;t make my hands break out.  </li>
            <li> Finally a lotion that means rich when they say rich.</li>
            <li> It does exactly what it is suppose to do</li>
            <li> I highly recommend Eucerin to anyone with eczema!!</li>
            <li> Her skin was &amp;#34;normal&amp;#34; within 24 hours of the first dose of antibiotics, and has been for 3 years now.</li>
            <li> Her skin was &amp;#34;normal&amp;#34; within 24 hours of the first dose of antibiotics, and has been for 3 years now.</li>
            <li> It helped with the dryness of her skin for about the first 3 weeks</li>
            <li> Has been around for years and does exactly as advertised.  </li>
            <li> We have used this by the recommendation from our first son&#x27;s allergist.</li>
            <li> 8 more words bs either it works in ten words</li>
            <li> It moisturizes really well!</li>
            <li> It is thick and works great for the winter.</li>
            <li> and I find it&#x27;s easier to put on after massaging in the palms of your hand first.</li>
            <li> Product exactly as described.</li>
            <li> There is nothing out there that works better, brand name or generic.  </li>
            <li> Yes, It makes skin soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> Instead my bride rubs this stuff in, and it stops itching and a few days of use puts me in a good way for a month.</li>
            <li> So, yeah Eucerin is amazing for just about any dry skin issue for our whole family.</li>
            <li> Great lotion, especially in the dry winter.</li>
            <li> When I put the product on in the night the next day my skin feels very soft and nice.</li>
            <li> Other preparations are not as effective.</li>
            <li> I have very dry skin and am very sensitive to many products that are available today.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very thick, not like a lotion, and works better and more quickly than any lotion I&#x27;ve ever tried.</li>
            <li> It does not irritate my sensitive skin like so many lotions do, and it keeps my skin soft and scale-free IF I use it every day.  </li>
            <li> He really swears by this product and was glad to get a larger supply of it.</li>
            <li> This is why it is marked as rich instead of light-weight.&lt;br /&gt;Second, if you want real results, use a LOT.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s pretty much all they use at the hospital.</li>
            <li> Although it is thick and can be a pain to put on, I found it is the best OTC remedy for my eczema; especially in sensitive areas, such as around the eyes.</li>
            <li> Eucerin is the best moisturizing its lays on a bit thick initially but then it really lasts.  </li>
            <li> Cetaphil and most of the other creams marketed as eczema creams, especially if they have colloidal oatmeal in them, make our daughter&#x27;s eczema flare up even more.</li>
            <li> love Eucerin for dry skin</li>
            <li> His skin is super soft and its almost glowing.</li>
            <li> Make sure you use it as soon as you dry off from the shower, otherwise it doesn&#x27;t spread well</li>
            <li> Of course, for extremely dry skin applying more is beneficial.</li>
            <li> This works better for my wife&#x27;s dry and cracking finger tips than the prescription medication prescribed by her dermatologist.  </li>
            <li> My skin is super sensitive to begin with.</li>
            <li> mostly, andI prefer the calming cream for everyday full body use.</li>
            <li> I have 2 large jars that I cannot use.</li>
            <li> Shop smart.</li>
            <li> LEAVES YOUR SKIN SOOO SOFT AMAZING FOR EZMA AND OR DRY SKIN</li>
            <li> When I&#x27;m in bed, at least I know I won&#x27;t be touching anything that can&#x27;t be easily washed.</li>
            <li> The medication worked fine, but after I ran out of medication the irritation and redness was back.</li>
            <li> I choose the first, older title.  </li>
            <li> This is my favorite moisturizing creme when my skin gets very dry.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great for very dry skin and sensitive skin, a terrific moisturizer.  </li>
            <li> The large containers In a two pack are very economical compared to purchasing the local drug store size.</li>
            <li> This great for your skin, especially if you have trouble with it pealing.</li>
            <li> It seems to absorb fairly fast too.</li>
            <li> I like the fact that it has no scent, is hypoallergenic and really works.</li>
            <li> It is really soothing, but be prepared to spend some time getting it off your hands.</li>
            <li> my skin used to be very ashy.</li>
            <li> I tried it and it works very well.</li>
            <li> you don&#x27;t need much</li>
            <li> this product really works.</li>
            <li> If you want something fast, this isn&#x27;t it.</li>
            <li> It will work, but don&#x27;t expect fast results.</li>
            <li> Thanks</li>
            <li> it doesn&#x27;t take much to do the job.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very soothing and calming to my skin.  </li>
            <li> We have to lather her often and it really helps to keep the dryness and rashes in control.  </li>
            <li> Thanks</li>
            <li> every two, three weeks because she would very often break out in hives and rash up and ooze and bleed from head to toe.</li>
            <li> Really appreciate .  </li>
            <li> I really like this product.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s really really greasy.</li>
            <li> but if you want really greasy cream then this is for you</li>
            <li> I set it up for standard 5 to 7 days shipping since it was free for my order</li>
            <li> With his hands in papers/inks all day this has brought so much relief/healing to his hands.</li>
            <li> excellent for protection during cold winter months.</li>
            <li> much as I like this</li>
            <li> Very dense but will use for elbows and heels ths winter</li>
            <li> and then you have to really manually move it around to get an area covered.  </li>
            <li> After trying eight or nine lotions and creams, the Cetaphil Restoraderm really was the winner.</li>
            <li> It is very greasy but helped with eczema problem.</li>
            <li> This product works really well on the hands and feet.  </li>
            <li> I have tried many however this always keeps my skin feeling soft and not greasy throughout the entire day!</li>
            <li> The only reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is because for as much as my kids use (about one tub every two to three weeks!!!)</li>
            <li> This is what we have always used to get deep in the dry skin and help it to heal.&lt;br /&gt;It does not disappear quickly but we keep gently rubbing it until it gets in good enough.</li>
            <li> It is thicker and requires a little more \\&quot;rubbing in\\&quot; and perhaps that moves it down the popular list in this \\&quot;everything must happen</li>
            <li> Aquaphor was super gross, like applying Vaseline straight from the tub, and didn&#x27;t really do much either.</li>
            <li> This is definitely a good product to use on your feet if they are rough and dry out always put socks on after applying foot doctor recommended</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried just about all kinds of common and uncommon remedies, weak to extremely strong topical steroids and none of them worked on my daughter who I had the most difficulties with in terms of her skin.</li>
            <li> It is good because it is simple and free of unnecessary chemicals.  </li>
            <li> After trying many products, this is the only one that&#x27;s really made a big difference.&lt;br</li>
            <li> No more breakouts and my neck stays nicely moisturized.  </li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t take many applications before the scales were whittled down to nothing.</li>
            <li> It even works on the little bumps on the back of my arm (k. pilaris) to a good degree.  </li>
            <li> It s very creamy and kind of hard to blend</li>
            <li> Less a moisturizer, more a waterproofer.</li>
            <li> Decent value.</li>
            <li> But if you want something that will work, and you are okay with having a big glob of white paste on your face/body for hours at a time, this is it.</li>
            <li> For my kids, less chicken/poultry, washing all the fruit and veggies with fruit and vegetable wash, buying organic produce or at least all the root vegetables, and good quality beef and really avoid any food dyes and colorings are all important factors in their skin health.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> My doctor recommended this for my eczema and this is just high quality.</li>
            <li> It isn&#x27;t as gross and greasy to apply as Aquaphor, and it really makes our daughter&#x27;s skin super soft.</li>
            <li> my skin is very dry and my doctor advised me to use Eucerin to smooth my skin.</li>
            <li> I love to use a little bit of this on my hands.</li>
            <li> My dermatologist recommended it to me for sensitive, easily irritated, and sometimes dry skin.</li>
            <li> Very thick and takes a while to rub in to the skin but is good moisture.</li>
            <li> I originally bought it for my son&#x27;s extremely dry skin.</li>
            <li> It is hard to rub in and sticky afterwards, but a very good moisturizer none the less.</li>
            <li> It goes on thick and creamy and feels soothing and amazing.</li>
            <li> Heavy, soothing and most of all,  protective.  </li>
            <li> I have tried so many creams over the years, from Nivea to Lubriderm to JJ baby lotion to Vaseline lotion to plain vaseline and Aquaphore.  </li>
            <li> In addition, I still find it helpful by lotioning them up RIGHT after shower because this way, it gives my kids&#x27; skins extra moisture for a longer period of time.  </li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t live without it.</li>
            <li> I cannot live without Eucerin.  </li>
            <li> So overall, we wish we didn&#x27;t have to have this cream in our daily care routine, but since it really helps our daughter&#x27;s skin, we are super grateful Eucerin USA makes this cream</li>
            <li> For my kids&#x27; super dry skins, lotions including Eucerin lotions are too runny and would evaporate within minutes.</li>
            <li> but when you have super dry skin or scaly patches, you need something that will stay with you.  </li>
            <li> I also use this cream on my feet and they keep them very soft.</li>
            <li> So, so far this product has been a daily routine application on my kids right after a bath/shower and even before they enter a swimming pool as a barrier from the chlorine.</li>
            <li> guess it might be a good cream if you are using it on a small dry spot</li>
            <li> (im a 47 year old man!)</li>
            <li> That said, when I DO happen to use it, it seems to repair my skin better than any other topical lotion I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> It only comes out if you wash them hot, but even then, it leaves a residue that will give fabrics a greasy feeling over time.</li>
            <li> This original crème is the one suggested from the time I started treating my feet for dryness due to Type 2 diabetes.  </li>
            <li> And no reaction from my sensitive skin!</li>
            <li> wow!</li>
            <li> The creme is VERY heavy and there are better alternatives that have since come out which make application easier.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s very expensive in most stores, so we were glad to find it on amazon where we could get the subscribe and save discount.  </li>
            <li> I have also being able to cut down on the topical steroids since I started this product.</li>
            <li> Best stuff on the planet - I literally sigh with pleasure when I put this on my poor old dried out hands!</li>
            <li> The huge 16-ounce tubs will last a very long time.</li>
            <li> And on spots that start getting crusty from all the scratching, we apply this cream throughout the day, plus Hydrocortisone Valerate twice a day, and usually that helps heal her skin pretty quickly.</li>
            <li> And on spots that start getting crusty from all the scratching, we apply this cream throughout the day, plus Hydrocortisone Valerate twice a day, and usually that helps heal her skin pretty quickly.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a very heavy thick cream, it doesn&#x27;t seem to absorb very quickly, but so long as you have nothing to do, and have the time to sit and wait, it works GREAT on really severely dry, chapped, or cracking skin.</li>
            <li> It keeps my skin moisturized for ~12 hours, unlike other lotions (even more-viscous Eucerin lotions) that wear off quickly.  </li>
            <li> The cream is extremely hard to spread more than a couple inches at a time.</li>
            <li> Product: Eucerin Dry Skin Therapy Original Moisturizing Creme (White Jar)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think most people would use this on a regular basis since it&#x27;s very thick, but I&#x27;ve had a very positive experience with it.</li>
            <li> great for cold weather</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great for the cold winters</li>
            <li> and it is do much longer lasting than any lotion I used to use.</li>
            <li> people now mistake me for a 13 year old girl.</li>
            <li> As far as a fountain of youth...</li>
            <li> It stays on well, but not heavy, throughout the night.</li>
            <li> We&#x27;ve been using this on our baby boy since he was a month or two months old.  </li>
            <li> So far my experience with this product has made me a believer.</li>
            <li> This is the only lotion that really helps my husband&#x27;s psoriasis.  </li>
            <li> really does its job based on my personal treatment.</li>
            <li> After washing my face, I slather it on, I also use it every day on my hands after washing dishes.and on my feet to keep them soft.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this stuff every day for nearly 40 years.  </li>
            <li> No bubble baths, only Cetaphil Gentle Skin Cleanser.  </li>
            <li> No bubble baths, only Cetaphil Gentle Skin Cleanser.  </li>
            <li> Keeps my skin extremely soft.  </li>
            <li> By morning my feet are so soft.</li>
            <li> My hands and feet feel soft and hydrated after one use.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin</li>
            <li> My feet are always soft.</li>
            <li> This is the first treatment I&#x27;ve found that stops dry-skin itch all day long without needing reapplication.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin</li>
            <li> but then my hands are sensitive to even water.</li>
            <li> Leaves my hands soft for hours after use.</li>
            <li> and that formula was so soft to apply...</li>
            <li> This is the first cream to give luxurious, comforting moisture all day long .</li>
            <li> This creme makes our daughter&#x27;s skin so soft and does help heal scratches and scrapes.  </li>
            <li> This product keep the skin soft and moist.</li>
            <li> Accutane can be a godsend if you&#x27;ve suffered from adult</li>
            <li> product is fantastic for moisturizing any skin on my hands or body that has dried out as a side effect of Accutane usage.  </li>
            <li> I keep it soft using Eucerin  Healing cream.  </li>
            <li> old age</li>
            <li> and my hands are soft again.  </li>
            <li> Keeps my hands soft.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s more like a thick paste.</li>
            <li> My sister thinks this is as good as La Mer (something ridiculously expensive)</li>
            <li> Everyone knows that for eczema and problematically dry skin, Eucerin is the only things that works at all, and it&#x27;s true</li>
            <li> Although it is a pain to take the time everyday to apply lotion, it would be a greater pain to live with extremely dry skin.  </li>
            <li> Usually you slather it on and can rub in easily, but this cream will go on your skin in a &amp;#34;clump&amp;#34; (wherever you put it)</li>
            <li> Very creamy and a thick, rich, unscented creme.  </li>
            <li> And because Aquaphor doesn&#x27;t necessarily moisturize the skin but mainly seals in moisture; so if my daughter&#x27;s skin doesn&#x27;t have any moisture on it, like right after a shower and before drying her up with a towel, then applying Aquaphor wouldn&#x27;t do much on a very dry skin person.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s definitely not a good cream for full body or large area!</li>
            <li> I apply it whenever my skin feels dry and itchy and it&#x27;s a solid blast of moisturization and brings healing to the skin quickly.</li>
            <li> I use it to calm psoriasis patches along with other meds.</li>
            <li> Other reviews suggesting this is a an extra-rich cream are right on.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it for anyone with the same problem</li>
            <li> Eucerin Original Healing Soothing Repair Creme is the only cream or lotion I&#x27;ve found that manages to actually get rid of dry skin and prevent chafing in problem areas.</li>
            <li> It has really helped out with some long time dryness problems.</li>
            <li> Namely, that if a moisturizer comes out of a bottle or tube, it&#x27;s not thick enough!  </li>
            <li> But it has certainly helped with dry skin/eczema I&#x27;ve been having on my face.  </li>
            <li> I wash my hands very often all day and I  get cracked dry hands.  </li>
            <li> However, I did find that it&#x27;s really worked wonders for my dry heels.</li>
            <li> Works very well on dry skin.</li>
            <li> It worked very well on my dry chapped hands.  </li>
            <li> I love Eucerin but this lotion is too thick and sticky for daily use.</li>
            <li> The cream is thick but keeps skin moisturized and pores open to better absorb ointments.</li>
            <li> Second, you need to apply a THICK layer if you want this to work, preferably a couple times a day or more.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very thick and greasy but the greasiness goes away pretty quickly.</li>
            <li> It works great, but is so thick he sometimes acts like he&#x27;s uncomfortable during application - even after we first rub it thoroughly in our palms.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not a traditional lotiony feeling and it does not have a floral scent which sensitive skin users will appreciate!  </li>
            <li> one day I used one small tube of Eucerin (original) sample which I got from skin specialist..</li>
            <li> Our first son dealt with minor skin issues from being slightly allergic to certain foods and having eczema.</li>
            <li> Eucerin fixed them right up just after a few days of use.  </li>
            <li> But overall, her skin is not as dry, cracked and red as it used to be, unless we forget to put it on (we rarely forget).</li>
            <li> But overall, her skin is not as dry, cracked and red as it used to be, unless we forget to put it on (we rarely forget).</li>
            <li> Is does really work well for very dry skin but</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also very economical, because a little goes a long way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Otherwise, after a few days of this kind of work, the skin on my hands is so badly chapped and cracked that I don&#x27;t like them touching anything at all.</li>
            <li> (Boy, will they be soft when you finally do.)</li>
            <li> And doesn&#x27;t cause itchiness that some others products do, so apparently doesn&#x27;t have some things in it that I might be allergic to.</li>
            <li> My dermatologist says that only the Eucerin and the Cetaphil are pure enough to use on my dry, sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> We have 3 boys who have eczema, one very badly, and this is the best product we&#x27;ve found.  </li>
            <li> We usually put it on in the morning and have her sit on a towel and read a book till the cream is soaked in (it soaks in rather quickly, as compared to Aquaphor).</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s so thick and hard packed in the jar that I couldn&#x27;t even get a good whip on my fingers not to mention to leather over her body....</li>
            <li> We bought this to use on our new baby&#x27;s dry patches on his cheeks, thighs and elbows.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re not allergic to the aforementioned ingredients, than I&#x27;d highly recommend giving this a try if you have dry, chafed or otherwise irritated skin.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t put this on &amp; feel comfortable using the computer, it is a little greasy, but I expect that with something so extremely moisturizing.</li>
            <li> My mom has dry sensitive skin and also she has eczema and this helps it from drying and getting her breakouts.</li>
            <li> An old standby product that works on dry skin.</li>
            <li> Bashfulness son&#x27;s skin is very dry, with a lot of skin care products are useless until you find the Eucerin Original Healing Soothing Repair Creme, very moisturizing, cold weather began, this is a wise choice.</li>
            <li> I keep a large jar of this in my bedroom, so I use a little before leaving home.</li>
            <li> I know it&#x27;s difficult (if not impossible) to get rid of eczema without corticosteroids and this product didn&#x27;t do much by itself in this regard.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Very hard to smooth into skin.</li>
            <li> Wanted to use it on my 1 year old daughter since she has eczema and very dry skin!</li>
            <li> It kind of is weird to put on, or maybe I should say different than other creams.  </li>
            <li> The Eucerin Original Healing Soothing Repair Creme is VERY thick-</li>
            <li> I am simply amazed at how well my hands are doing - particularly since it&#x27;s the dead of winter.  </li>
            <li> Adding ¼ cup of unscented Chlorox to the bath water when her skin flares up badly, to bring the staph bacteria load on her skin back to somewhat normal levels (chlorine dries her skin out more, so we have to add an additional &amp;#34;grease session&amp;#34; for a day after chlorine baths).</li>

            <li> After sleeping in a THIN layer of it overnight, concealer and liquid makeup goes on and stays on while looking more natural than usual.</li>
            <li> I have a very little known of disease (caused by trauma, not transferrable) called RSD, Reflex Sympathetic Dystrophy, or CRPS, Complex Regional Pain Syndrome.</li>
            <li> First, it is really thick, especially at cooler temperatures.</li>
            <li> The moisturizer is super thick but does the trick!</li>
            <li> Regular lotion doesn&#x27;t work because the moisture doesn&#x27;t last for very long.</li>
            <li> I went to the dermatologist to see what was causing a small area of skin irritation and redness -- much to my surprise</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the ONLY product i have tried that keeps my skin moisturized as long as it does.</li>
            <li> One 16oz jar will last a really long time (6-12 months depending on how often you use it).</li>
            <li> Initially, Cetaphil helped but not for too long.  </li>
            <li> My chin is not as itchy and not near as red.</li>
            <li> When I first used this, i thought it was too thick</li>
            <li> I didnt think this product was going to be so thick, it can be a little tough to spread over your body, however, it is great for dry skin.</li>
            <li> With thin layers of lotion, however, I do need to reapply multiple times in a day, but it only takes a couple hours for initial effects to be evident.</li>
            <li> This is the only nonprescription moisturizing cream I have discovered that works for dry heels.  </li>
            <li> With the cold, dry weather approaching I will most likely deal with the Eczema until spring/summer.</li>
            <li> I have suffered chronic dry flaky skin on my face, especially in winter.</li>
            <li> Even putting it on daily does not make the dry skin stop</li>
            <li> I have extremely dry skins, especially on the legs, hips, and waist.  </li>
            <li> I suffer from psoriasis so this is essential in my dry climate.</li>
            <li> This has been the only thing that helps my itchy dry skin during winter.</li>
            <li> Terrific product for wintertime dry weather, keeps the skin from getting chapped.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend for anyone, from dry skinners, to those with skin conditions (doctor permitting), and even just your everyday personage with no skin issues.  </li>
            <li> thick lotion, hard to apply, but seems to work as it does give moisture to the skin, but i found an oil worked better on my child&#x27;s dry and itchy skin.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s texture is more like a mud paste (but white in color), thick and sticky, so hard to spread!</li>
            <li> very thick paste hard to apply..not at all spreading on the skin.... may be this jar contained some other low effective formula than that sample tube.</li>
            <li> (ours is every other day; more or less caused the eczema to get worse), and when you get your child out of the tub, seal that moisture in ASAP (within 3 minutes).  </li>
            <li> This creme goes a long ways and lasts for a long time.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been a Eucerin fan for a long time.  </li>
            <li> Before bed, we put it on and put long sleeved PJs and socks on her immediately after, so this stuff doesn&#x27;t get all over her hair and the bed.</li>
            <li> In the last couple years, I haven&#x27;t seen in on as many store shelves in various states in the country as in the past and that&#x27;s unfortunate.</li>
            <li> I suffered for as long as I can remember.</li>
            <li> A physician recommended Eucerin a long time ago</li>
            <li> Works very well on dry, chapped, irritated skin, but it is so thick that it requires time and effort to rub it in.</li>
            <li> It takes a long time to dry and you have greezy hands for a while.</li>
            <li> I have psoriasis and long ago discovered that daily moisturizing of plaques with a heavy moisturizer really reduces itching and scaling, and even seems to make some small plaques go away.  </li>
            <li> the only other way I&#x27;ve had issues with drying is on the tops of my hands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Eucerin has been around a long while and we will always keep a jar in our medicine cabinet!</li>
            <li> The only product that cures extremely dryness skin.</li>
            <li> Always works on dry skin.</li>
            <li> My daughter has extremely dry skin</li>
            <li> My hands stay dry and chapped from washing dishes.</li>
            <li> When we were in WY and the dry wind sucked all the moisture out of my skin, this is what I used for relief.</li>
            <li> it is not but for dry winter skin on face and hand....</li>
            <li> It adds moisture to soothe dry and itchy skin.</li>
            <li> My skin was really dry and itchy and this did the trick.</li>
            <li> If you are in any sort of occupation that has resulted in dry, weary hands, you should give this stuff a try.</li>
            <li> Wouldn&#x27;t use anything else for dry, itchy skin.</li>
            <li> It was recommended to me by my dermatologist, I&#x27;ve been using it ever since as I have psoriasis and extremely dry skin.</li>
            <li> It works wonders on dry skin and eczema, I don&#x27;t know what I would so without it.</li>
            <li> My dermatologist recommended this to me for my dry skin.  </li>
            <li> I use it every day, and even on my hands in the winter to combat dry skin.  </li>
            <li> Works well on dry skin.</li>
            <li> Seems to do all it says it does no problem with dry skin when I use it as directed</li>
            <li> It also has done nothing on my dry eczema spots because it truly seems like its not even penetrating the skin.</li>
            <li> I use it for my dry skin and then the dry skin disappears.</li>
            <li> It helps my extremely dry skin a lot.</li>
            <li> extremely dry tl</li>
            <li> This is for the folks who have seriously dry skin.</li>
            <li> On your dry feet and cracked heels, you can put socks on to keep it in.</li>
            <li> My wife has been using Eucerin for over 10 years for dry skin.</li>
            <li> which - no matter what I use - hurts by 3pm every day, it&#x27;s so dry.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a must have for dry skin, eczema or psoriasis.</li>
            <li> Bough bulk because of my dry skin condition.</li>
            <li> Will continue to use and it does assist my dry skin - hope this helps;.</li>
            <li> I have exceptionally dry skin on my hands all winter.</li>
            <li> but I use this on my hands and dry areas throughout the day.</li>
            <li> Living in the Mohave, it&#x27;s a dry heat, so along my backbone gets itchy</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s really thick and kind of difficult to spread on your skin.</li>
            <li> I could not live without this in the MN Winters.</li>
            <li> Can not live without this product</li>
            <li> A single jar lasts a very long time.  </li>
            <li> Our daughter usually wears a braid now that her hair is long enough to pull it back.</li>
            <li> For my kids at least, they&#x27;re taking Chinese herbal medicine and using Chinese herbal ointment locally to help with the itchiness.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve mixed this with hydrocortisone for my husband&#x27;s elbows and he has said it smooths his skin and keeps itching down.</li>
            <li> Not my favorite because is difficult to apply it, it is a very heavy product, but it has helped me a lot with my dry skin.</li>
            <li> If dry skin is a problem, this is your one stop shop!    </li>
            <li> The embarrassing scaly red look of my hands became less virulent.</li>
            <li> I have had both knee joints replaced and have very dry skik.</li>
            <li> I have very dry skin</li>
            <li> Both my kids have severe eczema and their skins are very dry.</li>
            <li> My skin is very dry.</li>
            <li> ith it.i get some very dry skin</li>
            <li> I gave one jar to my other granddaughter because it goes a long way.</li>
            <li> Amazon doesn&#x27;t ship a single jar, so now am stuck with two of them to smooth-en out my hands!</li>
            <li> It takes a little extra effort to rub in but after a while there is no residue on my skin.</li>
            <li> and then I started noticing little skin-tag like bumps around the back of her neck and then eventually her chest.</li>
            <li> Also, two of my four children, have a little bit of eczema on their upper arms.  </li>
            <li> I have extremely dry skin due to medications and now add diabetes into the mix</li>
            <li> I recommend this if you are trying to solve a dry skin problem and other lotions haven&#x27;t worked.</li>
            <li> My little one was diagnosed with eczema when she was just a few months old.  </li>
            <li> My doc recommended it as because my skin was getting itchy due to dry condition weather about 5 yrs ago.</li>
            <li> It helps moisturize, heal, and protect my kids skin which is excessively dry due to eczema.</li>
            <li> This lotion is thick and hard to apply at times, but well worth it.</li>
            <li> purchased and tried a wide assortment of creams and lotions in order to treat my feet, which often suffer from calluses, cracking, and athletes foot fungus.  </li>
            <li> If you have any rough skin you need this, this stuff has some staying power, not like those pump bottles of liquid.</li>
            <li> However, I only use it when I am going to be putting socks on because it is really heavy.</li>
            <li> but it does in fact soften rough skin</li>
            <li> It works wonders on the feet, elbows and any rough areas you may have.</li>
            <li> The only thing that works is to wear cotton gloves, even when sleeping.&lt;br /&gt;After a few weeks, I noticed that my hands are softer, but the &amp;#34;miracle&amp;#34; that I was expecting didn&#x27;t happen.</li>
            <li> I tried all kinds of lotions and a few creams, but the red, kinda burning skin would not go away.</li>
            <li> I have had a very hard time keeping my skin dry in the arid  to winter climate that I live in.  </li>
            <li> The Eucerin creme is a bit too heavy for me at other times of the year, but I definitely recommend it for winter use.</li>
            <li> This particular cream is very thick.  </li>
            <li> I have eczema and very sensitive, dry skin and Eucerin doesn&#x27;t trigger any poor reactions for me.  </li>
            <li> (I have a highly attuned sense of smell), and although very thick it&#x27;s not too oily</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s extremely heavy and dense relative to your typical lotions.</li>
            <li> It helps in allergy season, in the winter when the heater is running and every other time of the year.</li>
            <li> ,  Dad had extreme dryness and nothing worked&lt;br /&gt;Even</li>
            <li> Any other time, and I just can&#x27;t stand the feeling of leaving grease marks on anything I touch.</li>
            <li> The problem I have with using hand and skin creams is that too often they&#x27;re either, at one end of the spectrum, too oily/greasy, or at the other end of the spectrum, too moist (which exacerbates athlete&#x27;s foot).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Eucerin, on the other hand, moisturizes and seals in moisture on the skin.</li>
            <li> The other bottle was given to a person who is a lithographer.</li>
            <li> I usually apply a thin layer (I don&#x27;t like the greasiness of lotion) and it is usually sufficient to transform and repair my sandpaper-skin into smooth skin.</li>
            <li> and I would never trust anything other</li>
            <li> Retains moisture EXTREMELY well.  </li>
            <li> though, due to it&#x27;s efficacy.  </li>
            <li> Never a breakout, and I always get compliments after I put it on, for the next few days after!</li>
            <li> Other products I&#x27;ve found extremely helpful to use while on Accutane are Aquaphor</li>
            <li> My little one having extremely dry skin</li>
            <li> While it will never be my everyday moisturizer, and I still find it unpleasant to use, it will be my primary product for a couple of dry, itchy problem areas.</li>
            <li> I visited my dermatologist a few months ago, I was struck by something I read on one of her tip sheets for dealing with dry skin.  </li>
            <li> Nurses have to wash their hands so much, their poor hands get so dried out.  </li>
            <li> I used it on my face (which was incredibly dry) when I was away skiing in the states and now I use it every few days on my face at night</li>
            <li> Unfortunately I have 2 large tubs of this and no clue what to do with it-</li>
            <li> Department Store brands are shallow, expensive and filled with perfumes.  </li>
            <li> No more problem skin as long as we apply nightly.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s an average product according to the Skin Doctor Score....</li>
            <li> tub will last at least a year,</li>
            <li> so I would say on average</li>
            <li> this is really really thick, so i only wear it at night before i go to bed.</li>
            <li> Slather it on, thick as can be and it soaks in by the next diaper change.  </li>
            <li> While my skin is worse than the average 20 year old, I do use to moist my skin.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s actually too thick and clumpy.</li>
            <li> I purchased it because the hospitals use it for my sister who, because of her chronic illness, her skin breaks down quite often.</li>
            <li> Having been told I need to use a moisturizer, I narrowed the choice down to two for daytime use:</li>
            <li> Ended up being too strong for my sons skin :(</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little too thick for me to use every day, but I will definitely continue to use it as a hand and foot cream and a cold-weather moisturizer.</li>
            <li> My kids and I all have dry skin in slightly different forms--eczema, red rash, dry ashy patches...and it gets so bad that it bleeds.  </li>
            <li> I was diagnosed with Guttate Psoriasis about a year and a half ago.  </li>
            <li> (Note: Eucerin is too shiny, heavy, and thick to use easily as a facial moisturizer.)</li>
            <li> and if you put on too much, it gets heavy and uncomfortable.</li>
            <li> I like to use it on my rough heels and feet before bed, but it&#x27;s too thick for my liking to use on hands or other body parts.</li>
            <li> My answer for dry feet, dry winter complexion, and whenever I&#x27;m looking tired and want to wake up looking dewy.</li>
            <li> It is thick and creamy, and a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> This is an inexpensive remedy that I can live with -- no doctor trips and expensive medications.</li>
            <li> The creme is thick and penetrates the dry skin without being overly greasy.</li>
            <li> I did a little research and found this product --</li>
            <li> I am stretching the truth a little...</li>
            <li> This is a \\&quot;hard\\&quot; moisturizer unlike the others mentioned and you have to exert a little force to work it into your skin.</li>
            <li> It does feel a little \\&quot;thick\\</li>
            <li> , this is a little pricier than I wish it</li>
            <li> It takes a little while to rub in, but it helps.</li>
            <li> Besides drying out my nose (and causing a little bit of nosebleeding)</li>
            <li> Use it on my little one&#x27;s eczema.</li>
            <li> Very dry and thick.</li>
            <li> No watered down lotion here!    </li>
            <li> My only complaint is that is hard to spread.</li>
            <li> i used this on my skin, and it rejuvenated my dead skin.</li>
            <li> Because I&#x27;m so sold on this product I went to skindoctor.com to see why a product that has been such a help to me was rated so poorly.</li>
            <li> are, however, a few things you should know before you get this product, as it may affect whether you want it or not.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a bit like oil/acrylic paint after it&#x27;s dried.</li>
            <li> Eucerin is the only cream that my dermatologist has recommended and that has worked for me without irritating my skin.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Eucerin everyday for about 15 years.  </li>
            <li> I also use it everyday for my hands since I wash my hands a lot.</li>
            <li> You can lubricate a whale for a few months with all this lotion.</li>
            <li> I usually just buy generic eucerin in the tubs at pharmacies, and I usually spend $9.99 at least on one tub.  </li>
            <li> The worse spots I have are currently on my hands.  </li>
            <li> Within a few minutes the pain is gone.</li>
            <li> My hands get so dried and cracked to the point that they bleed sometimes.  </li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t want it to go to waste.</li>
            <li> All the repeated washing and exposure to dusty compound really sucks the moisture out of my skin and leaves my hands a swollen, dry, rough mess at the end of the day.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so thick that it&#x27;s hard to work into my skin, but thinner lotions I tried did nothing to help my dry skin.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It is a very thick cream, not a lotion so this tub lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> It is very thick and lasts me a long time.</li>
            <li> Used it  this past harsh;  what seem like a never ending winter.</li>
            <li> I usually use my Eucerin lotion when I have an eczema flair up and within a few days it&#x27;s gone.  </li>
            <li> I have bad eczema, especially in the summer months, on my upper arms and my feet and have suffered for years with this.  </li>
            <li> It helps keep his skin moisturized and soft even during our harsh NJ cold winters.</li>
            <li> I put on trouble spots in the morning and nights and had dramatic improvements to my dry, crackling skin.</li>
            <li> Just a little dab will do ya!</li>
            <li> Yes, it&#x27;s a little thick --</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little bit too thick.  </li>
            <li> The area gets very inflamed and painful.  </li>
            <li> No more chapped hands</li>
            <li> so I had to switch from my usual lotions and body butters.</li>
            <li> I usually use this before I go to bed, and take the remnants off in the morning.</li>
            <li> I usually just put it on and put on gloves and socks until it finishes soaking in.</li>
            <li> I could not spread it comfortably on my baby&#x27;&#x27;s body and hated that experience, every time I tried doing it.</li>
            <li> so I usually just slather it all over my legs which of course gets it all over my hands as well.  </li>
            <li> If you still want to buy then buy a small one.</li>
            <li> Once you have it on your hands, it becomes difficult to grab the door knob to get out of the bedroom, especially if the doorknob is shaped like a ball.</li>
            <li> Waste of money!</li>
            <li> just know it is very heavy to use</li>
            <li> Other eczema routine, as recommended by our pediatrician: Daily Zyrtec, and Benadryl when it gets really bad.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s thick and greasy, so I usually will wait until I&#x27;m going to bed to apply it.</li>
            <li> So needless to say my hands and feet get cracked and dry.</li>
            <li> Wasn&#x27;t fond of this because it was to hard.  </li>
            <li> It is hard to rub into the skin.  </li>
            <li> That&#x27;s not to say that it&#x27;s hard to spread, but it isn&#x27;t creamy or mousse like.</li>
            <li> for some reason this is hard to get - well, it will be well used.</li>
            <li> it was hard to rub into the skin.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little bit frustrating.</li>
            <li> Yes it is greasy and very thick, so not for everyday body lotion.</li>
            <li> Be warned that this is extremely thick and hard to put on.</li>
            <li> having said that, it is the only creme i&#x27;ve ever used that has prevented my fingertips from cracking in the cold winter months.</li>
            <li> So, if I go outside in the cold, my body reacts with perspiration, rather than closing pores.</li>
            <li> I buy this in bulk, going through at least one per week.</li>
            <li> Before she turned one, we had to rush her to the ER at least once</li>
            <li> Three years ago during the winter, I also began to have terrible fingertip cracks which are even more painful and slower to heal than the larger cracks I&#x27;d get throughout the year.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> When my son was a month old, he started getting a horrible rash that I later learned was called eczema.</li>
            <li> It goes on thick and it does its job, but it does take a while to work it in.</li>
            <li> Yes, it&#x27;s thick.</li>
            <li> So thick and paste like.</li>
            <li> The stuff is extremely thick and goes on like paste, so it may not be what you want to put on your face; but for elbows, legs, hands, etc</li>
            <li> The cream is soothing and odorless and leaves a thick coating on my hands.</li>
            <li> It is too thick.  </li>
            <li> the cream is WAY TO THICK.</li>
            <li> /&gt;First of all, it is thick.</li>
            <li> It is soo thick it does not spread now</li>
            <li> and then put my feet in thick, cotton socks.  </li>
            <li> Yes this cream is thick because its a cream not a lotion.</li>
            <li> This is some really THICK stuff.  </li>
            <li> I put it on in a thick layer then put socks on.</li>
            <li> This creme is SO THICK.  </li>
            <li> Thick with no allergic issues.</li>
            <li> It is thick and creamy.  </li>
            <li> Thick, thick, thick and goopy.</li>
            <li> This stuff is THICK.  </li>
            <li> IT is thick and it does HOLD IN the moisture.</li>
            <li> It is really thick and covers the area.</li>
            <li> but I wish it was not so thick and a bit easier to apply.</li>
            <li> This is a thick, non greasy cream.  </li>
            <li> This product is extremely thick, greasy, doesn&#x27;t blend into skin well at all.</li>
            <li> It does have a bit of a thick consistency to the product</li>
            <li> so I don&#x27;t mind applying thick layers on my hands (and</li>
            <li> ( It is like a thick paste, so I use it at nite.</li>
            <li> It comes out of the jar on my fingers in thick clumps.</li>
            <li> It is thick, and at the time, I wanted something thick.</li>
            <li> Every other moisturizer just feels wrong to me these days, so I stick with this.</li>
            <li> In other words, my hands become so greasy that it becomes uncomfortable to touch or grab anything around the house.</li>
            <li> This is some serious stuff...very thick and soothing.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t bother with ridiculously  priced  potions: this creme does the  job at a fraction of the price.</li>
            <li> Seriously....</li>
            <li> Wintertime is here, and the cold weather makes my skin extremely dry.</li>
            <li> It was too thick though and very hard to apply.</li>
            <li> It is hard and very thick.</li>
            <li> Tough to spread, though, as it&#x27;s quite thick.</li>
            <li> We go through a big tub every two to three weeks, depending on how bad our daughter&#x27;s skin is.</li>
            <li> Thank you, Eucerin!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other eczema routine, as recommended by our pediatrician: Daily Zyrtec, and Benadryl when it gets really bad.</li>
            <li> As a toddler, our daughter&#x27;s skin once got so bad that nothing of the above helped.</li>
            <li> As a toddler, our daughter&#x27;s skin once got so bad that nothing of the above helped.</li>
            <li> My son has had really bad eczema since he was 1 month ,he is 13 months now and this is the only product that has made a difference</li>
            <li> I get awful, scaly, red dry skin during the winter.  </li>
            <li> After application, depending on how liberally it is applied (and not much is needed), there can be a slight bit of a lubricated feel, but not slippery like suntan oil at all, which I would hate.  </li>
            <li> Also your skin should be completely dry before you apply or it is impossible to apply.</li>
            <li> The only reason I gave it a three is because it does tend to be greasy after you put it on, but if you&#x27;re like me and you get those nasty rough elbows.</li>
            <li> They have horrible winter eczema, and this is the first creme they say does not sting.</li>
            <li> I just use a small amount, apply a thin layer -- itching stops and redness fads away!  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s that thick, and 100% unscented!</li>
            <li> This product is very hard and  I had to mix it with oils to soften it.</li>
            <li> It is very thick but lasts.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s VERY thick</li>
            <li> VERY THICK...</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also very thick and protects my feet all night.  </li>
            <li> However we did not like it because it&#x27;s very thick.</li>
            <li> He recommended using it and warned us that it is a very thick paste and that we would need to rub it into his skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Non-greasy, but is a very thick moisturizing cream.</li>
            <li> The cream is very thick</li>
            <li> It is VERY thick</li>
            <li> /&gt;It is very thick and takes a bit to work into the skin.  </li>
            <li> It is very, very thick</li>
            <li> If I&#x27;m having an eczema flair up though on my feet, I don&#x27;t put my feet in the socks as this could just worse the effect.  </li>
            <li> We had to pin her socks to her pants, put socks over her hands and pin those to her sleeves (even at 100 degrees outside), just to limit her ability to scratch herself bloody.</li>

            <li> It takes a lot of rubbing it in to apply a thin layer on my hands and legs.</li>
            <li> When their eczema gets worse in the winter, we use a prescription creme but supplement it with Eucerin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My beard would get all itchy with grayish stubble irritating my skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used several cortisone-based prescription ointments at night while wearing vinyl gloves to help control the very painful cracks I get on my knuckles, etc.  </li>
            <li> put this on and my skin stops burning and no more bad or curing or splitting cuticles.</li>
            <li> All my money gone waste :(</li>
            <li> I tried dozens of products and spent hundreds of dollars on other products recommended to me when my now-4-year-old was an infant with terrible eczema, and I was always disappointed.</li>
            <li> I had an outbreak of dyshidrotic eczema that turned into difficult and irritated scabby skin.</li>
            <li> Try it and see if I&#x27;m wrong.</li>
            <li> I did that one night (for a reason) and I was soo uncomfortable</li>
            <li> Works well for my son who suffers from eczema.</li>
            <li> Ask your doctor for coupons as it can get expensive!</li>
            <li> I was desperate from a bad case of stress-induced eczema (my wife and I just had twin girls)</li>
            <li> Impossible to put on.</li>
            <li> my grandkids are shocked that they can order a drink without problems</li>
            <li> (Eucerin Europe does not make this cream, we even called the company, we were so desperate to get this product while we lived there)!</li>
            <li> My daughter has very bad eczema</li>
            <li> our son was in the hospital for a horrible virus and the doctor had the hospital pharmacy order this cream for his eczema.</li>
            <li> In the winter her skin looks awful.  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I love Eucerin but this lotion is too thick and sticky for daily use. However, the price in amazon is unbeatable.</li>
            <li> Takes care of itchy skin in winter and isn&#x27;t too greasy, but it is more like a paste than a cream.  It seems to absorb fairly fast too.</li>
            <li> Very creamy and a thick, rich, unscented creme.  I use it to re-moisturize my legs and feet.  Not greasy or watery; just moisturizing and creamy.  This unscented creme never interferes with additional scented body creams or perfumes that you may want to wear at the same time.  This creme goes a long ways and lasts for a long time.  This was recommended by my doctor and I also recommend it.</li>
            <li> Wasn&#x27;t fond of this because it was to hard.  It was like spreading lard on my body.  It needs to be easier to apply</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been a Eucerin fan for a long time.  It is very thick but lasts.  This price for two is incredible.</li>
            <li> Very thick and takes a while to rub in to the skin but is good moisture.</li>
            <li> Always works on dry skin. We have it in our house all the time. It works great. My mom has been using it for years and loves it</li>
            <li> Exactly as described.  Quality product.  Highly recommend. A+++++</li>
            <li> My daughter has extremely dry skin and I&#x27;ve been using this on her for a couple months now. It&#x27;s amazing the changes I&#x27;ve seen to her skin.</li>
            <li> this is really really thick, so i only wear it at night before i go to bed. having said that, it is the only creme i&#x27;ve ever used that has prevented my fingertips from cracking in the cold winter months. i really love it.</li>
            <li> Great health lotion to use at night before I go to sleep</li>
            <li> great for cold weather</li>
            <li> This great for your skin, especially if you have trouble with it pealing. I purchased it because the hospitals use it for my sister who, because of her chronic illness, her skin breaks down quite often. This keeps her skin issues in check.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t bother with ridiculously  priced  potions: this creme does the  job at a fraction of the price. If it didn&#x27;t, the National Enquirer wouldn&#x27;t have so many cover headlines about the \\&quot;cosmetic surgery of the stars\\&quot;.  I rest my case....</li>
            <li> No more chapped hands</li>
            <li> After undergoing  wound care treatments at a special medical facility, the medical staff recommended this product to my husband  as being superior to most others in the same category.   It is thick and creamy, and a little goes a long way. It worked stupendously well on his thickened scaly skin . It didn&#x27;t take many applications before the scales were whittled down to nothing. Continued applications have helped his skin to stay \\&quot;normal\\&quot;.     Since he had surgery on his back and couldn&#x27;t apply the cream to his own legs, I had to do it. This offered the added blessing of making my hands look better than they had in years. I like the fact that it has no scent, is hypoallergenic and really works. No watered down lotion here!    It is about the same price in the local drug store, but Amazon is so much more convenient, and we get to open a package , sort of like a Christmas present (:D).</li>
            <li> For solving the problem of dry winter skin, Eucerin is ideal. It is really soothing, but be prepared to spend some time getting it off your hands. (Boy, will they be soft when you finally do.) It goes on thick and it does its job, but it does take a while to work it in.</li>
            <li> I was very happy to find these in a two pack. Much more affordable, especially as a lightning deal. My hands stay dry and chapped from washing dishes. (yes, we are a home withOUT a dishwasher. True story.) The creme is thick and penetrates the dry skin without being overly greasy. I do mix it with some regular lotion to put on my kids&#x27; legs. It&#x27;s just easier to rub in that way. They have horrible winter eczema, and this is the first creme they say does not sting. Also, no unpleasant odor.</li>
            <li> I love eucerin products but this creme is too think. The calming cream spreads and absorbs better. The eucerin lotions with sun screen are great too.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t decide if I like this or not.  It&#x27;s VERY thick and it&#x27;s a lot like slathering on Spackle.  It does work but it&#x27;s not slippery like the Cetaphil that is sold in a similar container.  I definitely prefer the Cetaphil if I had to choose.</li>
            <li> This is a very rich cream. I use it to calm psoriasis patches along with other meds. I use it twice a day and it is do much longer lasting than any lotion I used to use. The large containers In a two pack are very economical compared to purchasing the local drug store size.</li>
            <li> I have a very little known of disease (caused by trauma, not transferrable) called RSD, Reflex Sympathetic Dystrophy, or CRPS, Complex Regional Pain Syndrome. I choose the first, older title.  It works on your Sympathetic nervous system, which controls everything we don&#x27;t. So, if I go outside in the cold, my body reacts with perspiration, rather than closing pores. So needless to say my hands and feet get cracked and dry. NOTHING, I&#x27;ve tried through 30 years of this, works as well. I feel as if I&#x27;ll starve, if I can&#x27;t apply this twice / day!    It&#x27;s truly miraculous, I&#x27;ve tried the Big Name OTC stuff, that my wife used, it&#x27;s like rubbing water on your skin! No Help!  This, is magical. I&#x27;m truly thankful that it&#x27;s available OTC, and I can get it!  If dry skin is a problem, this is your one stop shop!    Pete</li>
            <li> my skin used to be very ashy. i used this on my skin, and it rejuvenated my dead skin. i cried in joy knowing that my skin felt so young again. people now mistake me for a 13 year old girl. (im a 47 year old man!)</li>
            <li> This is the only nonprescription moisturizing cream I have discovered that works for dry heels.  I use it before putting on my socks and it works like a charm.  I definitely can recommend the product.  Additionally, a 16-ounce jar lasts for months.</li>
            <li> This stuff is great!  It is by far the best over-the-counter for dry, cracked skin.  I buy it for a family member with eczema and it helps alot!</li>
            <li> I have been using this  for 30+ years. My dermatologist recommended it to me for sensitive, easily irritated, and sometimes dry skin. I&#x27;ve used both lotion and cream. The cream is best for body and limbs, the lotion is better for hands only.  My doctor&#x27;s words to me of &#x27;don&#x27;t be stingy with it&#x27; were a good guide. I tried everything else on the market, nothing soothed my skin like this cream. Yes, it&#x27;s thick. It&#x27;s wonderful!!!  It helps in allergy season, in the winter when the heater is running and every other time of the year. When we were in WY and the dry wind sucked all the moisture out of my skin, this is what I used for relief. I can&#x27;t live without it.</li>
            <li> Keeps skin moist as advertised;good product.</li>
            <li> This is the best I have found.  It really does a nice job of keeping my skin moist and younger looking.  It really is a great product.</li>
            <li> very nice, smoother skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the Eucerin for some years, and the nice thing about it is that it doesn&#x27;t change and stays the same over the years, providing excellent moisturizing cream over and over, for a decent price.</li>
            <li> Impossible to put on. So thick and paste like. When you do manage to put some on looks like you&#x27;ve been painted with white paint. Maybe it does magic but I would assume you would have to run around naked for a while because all that &amp;#34;paint&amp;#34; will go into your closes and smear everywhere.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this for years for my psoriasis, but always had bought it from stores. This is the same great product for a much better price. The cream is thick but keeps skin moisturized and pores open to better absorb ointments.</li>
            <li> I went to the dermatologist to see what was causing a small area of skin irritation and redness -- much to my surprise I have a mild case of Eczema. The doctor prescribed some medication cream and off I went. The medication worked fine, but after I ran out of medication the irritation and redness was back. I did a little research and found this product -- thought I would give it a try and it works great. Yes, it&#x27;s a little thick -- I just use a small amount, apply a thin layer -- itching stops and redness fads away!  I apply it 2 times a week. With the cold, dry weather approaching I will most likely deal with the Eczema until spring/summer. This is an inexpensive remedy that I can live with -- no doctor trips and expensive medications.</li>
            <li> Works well for my son who suffers from eczema.</li>
            <li> love Eucerin for dry skin</li>
            <li> I bought it due to its richness, which will work great for my feet. This is the second one I&#x27;ve gotten.</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing. I have suffered chronic dry flaky skin on my face, especially in winter. Two nights of applying this, and not a trace of flakes. I&#x27;ve tried a bunch of different creams, but I&#x27;ll need to look no further. Good stuff!</li>
            <li> Eucerin is the best moisturizing hand cream I know.  It tends to be greasy, but that is easily taken care of with blotting my hands after rubbing the cream in with a paper towel.  Other preparations are not as effective.</li>
            <li> This buy was an excellent opportunity; the product is just what I needed and the price was even better.  The quantity keeps me from running to the store as often and the shipping speed was just that...lol</li>
            <li> What an experience...my grandkids are shocked that they can order a drink without problems but I get carded???&lt;br /&gt;OK&lt;br /&gt;So I am stretching the truth a little...but it sure makes my skin feel softer and looks nicer too. As far as a fountain of youth...it is not but for dry winter skin on face and hand....this stuff does the trick....for me anyway.&lt;br /&gt;Worth the money until the TSA made me throw it away at the airport check point....but they retreved it and if you see a young looking TSA employee with smooth skin...asked where they got their product...lol</li>
            <li> The best product ever for dry skin. Used it  this past harsh;  what seem like a never ending winter. Used it on my newborn and she&#x27;s never gotten diaper rash. Her skin stayed nice and moisturized.</li>
            <li> pack of 2 saves you about $6.00 at Walmart. This is a really good deal &amp; is the same sold in stores.</li>
            <li> This creme is the only creme, aside from the Cetaphil, that I am allowed to use.  My dermatologist says that only the Eucerin and the Cetaphil are pure enough to use on my dry, sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I love this creme,it works very well on my baby skin since he was born</li>
            <li> Having been told I need to use a moisturizer, I narrowed the choice down to two for daytime use: Eucerin [[ASIN:B001FB5IN2 Eucerin Skin Calming Daily Moisturizing Creme, 14 Ounce Tubes (Pack of 2)]] and Cetaphil. [[ASIN:B001ET7A4K Cetaphil Daily Advance Ultra Hydrating Lotion, 8.0-Ounce Tubes(Pack of 2)]]  I use them for nighttime if I am in a hurry but now that I have discovered the Eucerin original, I use it most of the time just before bed. This is a \\&quot;hard\\&quot; moisturizer unlike the others mentioned and you have to exert a little force to work it into your skin. But there is something about that process I like. It stays on well, but not heavy, throughout the night. It also provides a nice variety.</li>
            <li> My wife swears by it and uses it on our son daily. I feel as if she touches Eucerin more than she touches me.</li>
            <li> Eucerin Original Healing Soothing Repair Creme is the only cream or lotion I&#x27;ve found that manages to actually get rid of dry skin and prevent chafing in problem areas. The stuff is extremely thick and goes on like paste, so it may not be what you want to put on your face; but for elbows, legs, hands, etc it great. I&#x27;ve found it to be a huge help in protecting damaged skin (rash, chafed, etc) from becoming further inflamed and damaged.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I saw in another review where the reviewer gave this product three stars and directed readers to skindoctor.com where this product is rated three stars. It appears that the reviewer has never tried the product but is simply reposting what he or she has read elsewhere. Because I&#x27;m so sold on this product I went to skindoctor.com to see why a product that has been such a help to me was rated so poorly. The only information I could find on the referenced website was that Eucerin was assigned three stars because it:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; \\&quot;contains lanolin alcohol. It also contains methylisothiazolinone (MI) and a related ingredient methychloroisothiazolinone (MCI). These are recognized allergens.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is no comment on that website I can find about actual test results for effectiveness. So I suppose it would be better to say that if you are hypersensitive to allergens in general, or more specifically allergic to lanolin alcohol, methylisothiazolinone (MI) or methychloroisothiazolinone (MCI), than you might want to avoid using this product. If you&#x27;re not allergic to the aforementioned ingredients, than I&#x27;d highly recommend giving this a try if you have dry, chafed or otherwise irritated skin.</li>
            <li> Good product.  It&#x27;s a little bit too thick.  My only complaint is that is hard to spread.</li>
            <li> It is the product recommended from my dermatologist. Not my favorite because is difficult to apply it, it is a very heavy product, but it has helped me a lot with my dry skin.</li>
            <li> I had an outbreak of dyshidrotic eczema that turned into difficult and irritated scabby skin. Regular lotion doesn&#x27;t work because the moisture doesn&#x27;t last for very long. I decided to look for something more heavy-duty, specifically for treating my eczema and found Eucerin on here. I tried it and it works very well. I apply it whenever my skin feels dry and itchy and it&#x27;s a solid blast of moisturization and brings healing to the skin quickly.</li>
            <li> The moisturizer is super thick but does the trick! We got this for our baby&#x27;s dry skin and it did a great job making him baby soft. It is hard to rub in and sticky afterwards, but a very good moisturizer none the less.</li>
            <li> This is what the leading doctors and allergists recommend for eczema and keeping the skin moist.  We&#x27;ve been using this on our baby boy since he was a month or two months old.  It works great and helps a bunch.</li>
            <li> My mom has dry sensitive skin and also she has eczema and this helps it from drying and getting her breakouts. Now she has her sisters using it and they love it</li>
            <li> Product as advertised.</li>
            <li> We bought this to use on our new baby&#x27;s dry patches on his cheeks, thighs and elbows. It works great, but is so thick he sometimes acts like he&#x27;s uncomfortable during application - even after we first rub it thoroughly in our palms.  It is, however, AWESOME for extra dry, cracking skin on my feet and hands this winter. And an awesome bargain compared to the 2-4 oz tube available in local retail stores.</li>
            <li> The item came very fast, excellent quality, better than the local grocery shop from where we used to get it.</li>
            <li> This cream is the best in the market that i have tried so far without any reservation.It adds moisture to soothe dry and itchy skin.Apply just after shower to get the best effect-soft, smooth and silky skin-because the skin absorbs the moisture more readily than any other time.Try it and you will love it as well.</li>
            <li> I was desperate from a bad case of stress-induced eczema (my wife and I just had twin girls) so I decided to spend extra money on a hand cream. Within one day the Eucerin worked its wonders. The embarrassing scaly red look of my hands became less virulent. The cream is soothing and odorless and leaves a thick coating on my hands. So far my experience with this product has made me a believer.</li>
            <li> Have been using this every since 1980 when I was diagnosed with eczema and the doctor suggested I use it.  Have tried several &#x27;copies&#x27;, but nothing works like the Eucerin despite claims to the contrary.  Decent value.</li>
            <li> And what a GREAT price. this stuff works on dry hands and these are a great price and size and the original is the best, very thick!</li>
            <li> This is the only lotion that really helps my husband&#x27;s psoriasis.  After trying many products, this is the only one that&#x27;s really made a big difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s very expensive in most stores, so we were glad to find it on amazon where we could get the subscribe and save discount.  The jars are the same size as in the stores and will last him for months.  We&#x27;ll definitely be buying it again.</li>
            <li> This cream does a great job at keeping my skin moist in the dry winter air. I keep a jar on my nightstand and apply it every night before I go to bed. My doctor had advised me to use only products that are unscented so I had to switch from my usual lotions and body butters. The Eucerin creme is a bit too heavy for me at other times of the year, but I definitely recommend it for winter use.</li>
            <li> Lines disappear and best of all you don&#x27;t need much but it&#x27;s rich. But I bought two for one deal.</li>
            <li> Great product for softening hardened skin. Was recommended by doctor and glad he did. Try it and see if I&#x27;m wrong.</li>
            <li> I do not like this product.  It is too thick.  It is hard to rub into the skin.  I have not seen any improvement in my skin.  It arrived  well packaged, on time.  Two of them.  I can not recommend from my experience.</li>
            <li> this is great for the winter. My skin was really dry and itchy and this did the trick. Be warned that this is extremely thick and hard to put on. Also your skin should be completely dry before you apply or it is impossible to apply.</li>
            <li> This stuff works great and you can&#x27;t beat the price for delivery right to your door.</li>
            <li> Keeps baby moisturized</li>
            <li> this product really works. It s very creamy and kind of hard to blend so I mix it with coconut or jojoba oil. My skin is smooth and healthy.</li>
            <li> I have had both knee joints replaced and have very dry skik. The Eucerin does a good job but it does not get absorbed into the skin very quickly.</li>
            <li> This works the best of anything we have tried for my hubby&#x27;s carpenter hands, which get really raw in winter weather.</li>
            <li> SKIN IS AWESOME AFTER I USE THIS CREAM</li>
            <li> Previous good experience and good results.</li>
            <li> i love this cream and love i can buy 2 at a time i use this stuff every day and now i got my daughter using this. its reallly good cream</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t buy this cream on Amazon. I got two jars from Walgreens when they had a Buy one get one 50% off sale. Wanted to use it on my 1 year old daughter since she has eczema and very dry skin! the cream is WAY TO THICK. Seriously....it&#x27;s so thick and hard packed in the jar that I couldn&#x27;t even get a good whip on my fingers not to mention to leather over her body....it just does not spread!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I guess it might be a good cream if you are using it on a small dry spot so you just cover it with the cream. but it&#x27;s definitely not a good cream for full body or large area!</li>
            <li> I have eczema just above my upper lip, and it&#x27;s been there for several years. I have tried many, many, many other lotions and creams to address this issue, and none of them have ever given consistent results like this one. I&#x27;ve been using this for years, and it remains the only cream that has ever made a difference.&lt;br /&gt;There are, however, a few things you should know before you get this product, as it may affect whether you want it or not.&lt;br /&gt;First of all, it is thick. This is not a cream as the product name says. It&#x27;s more like a thick paste. It&#x27;s a bit like oil/acrylic paint after it&#x27;s dried. Or a tar of some sort. That&#x27;s not to say that it&#x27;s hard to spread, but it isn&#x27;t creamy or mousse like. This is why it is marked as rich instead of light-weight.&lt;br /&gt;Second, if you want real results, use a LOT. Just slap a load on there. The skin will absorb what is on it, and if you put more on there, it will keep absorbing more product until you take it off. I usually use this before I go to bed, and take the remnants off in the morning. This really isn&#x27;t a quick lotion to put on before you go out the door. It&#x27;s something that takes time to truly work. If you want something fast, this isn&#x27;t it. But if you want something that will work, and you are okay with having a big glob of white paste on your face/body for hours at a time, this is it. It will work, but don&#x27;t expect fast results. Just expect thorough results.</li>
            <li> Best online price I&#x27;ve found so far. Great deal, good product.</li>
            <li> Excellent product for my parents,  Dad had extreme dryness and nothing worked&lt;br /&gt;Even load of Vaseline didn&#x27;t work.&lt;br /&gt;this is s life saver and Miraculous  item.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;GOD Bless</li>
            <li> Ended up being too strong for my sons skin :(</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for decades, and it continues to keep my skin nice.  I won&#x27;t ever stop using it.</li>
            <li> So, yeah Eucerin is amazing for just about any dry skin issue for our whole family.</li>
            <li> Great price.  My wife has used this stuff for years!!!</li>
            <li> Works very well on dry, chapped, irritated skin, but it is so thick that it requires time and effort to rub it in. The Eucerin healing lotion works better for me.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like using this creme on my skin. I&#x27;ll admit that. It&#x27;s so greasy that I will only submit to applying this lotion when I&#x27;m crawling into bed. Any other time, and I just can&#x27;t stand the feeling of leaving grease marks on anything I touch. When I&#x27;m in bed, at least I know I won&#x27;t be touching anything that can&#x27;t be easily washed. That said, when I DO happen to use it, it seems to repair my skin better than any other topical lotion I&#x27;ve tried. OK, I guess [[ASIN:B001FB5IP0 Aquaphor Healing Ointment  Advanced Therapy, 14-Ounce Jars (Pack of 2)]]is about the same. Still, compared to most moisturizing lotions, this stuff is great. There are some days when I am drywalling, and I spend hours using joint compound, washing it off my hands, sanding it off walls, and scrubbing clean my tools. All the repeated washing and exposure to dusty compound really sucks the moisture out of my skin and leaves my hands a swollen, dry, rough mess at the end of the day. On those days, I need stuff like Eucerin to help heal my hands while I&#x27;m sleeping. Otherwise, after a few days of this kind of work, the skin on my hands is so badly chapped and cracked that I don&#x27;t like them touching anything at all. If you are in any sort of occupation that has resulted in dry, weary hands, you should give this stuff a try. It can really work wonders!</li>
            <li> Excellent product and excellent service. I am very much satisfied with the results. This product was recommended by my doctor for skin care.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for over 15 years. I am a eczema sufferer and have tried every lotion and creme on the market. My wife recommended this from one of her clients and I immediately tried it. The effects were instant! My skin holds the moisture and doesn&#x27;t leave residue on my clothes. It&#x27;s the ONLY product i have tried that keeps my skin moisturized as long as it does. I buy this in bulk, going through at least one per week. Ask your doctor for coupons as it can get expensive!</li>
            <li> Great cream for dry cuticles and feet.</li>
            <li> Worked great! Would buy again!</li>
            <li> my skin is very dry and my doctor advised me to use Eucerin to smooth my skin. My skin becomes much smooth after a couples of months.&lt;br /&gt;It really does its job based on my personal treatment.</li>
            <li> Bashfulness son&#x27;s skin is very dry, with a lot of skin care products are useless until you find the Eucerin Original Healing Soothing Repair Creme, very moisturizing, cold weather began, this is a wise choice.</li>
            <li> I get awful, scaly, red dry skin during the winter.  After a recommendation from an allergist, I tried Eucerin -and it works!  It does not irritate my sensitive skin like so many lotions do, and it keeps my skin soft and scale-free IF I use it every day.  If I miss a day I immediately see a difference.  I have tried the drugstore generics but they do not work as well.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the only thing for diaper rash.  No zinc oxide to have to rub off a sore butt.  Slather it on, thick as can be and it soaks in by the next diaper change.  I&#x27;ve used it for years and as a nurse, recommend it to all my patients.</li>
            <li> Excellent help....I have to have it in house at all time</li>
            <li> This product is the best!!!!! After washing my face, I slather it on, I also use it every day on my hands after washing dishes.and on my feet to keep them soft. It&#x27;s the best moisturizer on the market; in my opinion.</li>
            <li> Love Eucerin products, this is nice and thick, but easy to Rub between your hands to apply. It is not sticky, or greasy. Leaves skin with a nice glow, without looking oily.</li>
            <li> I have been using this creme for over 30 years. Although it is thick and can be a pain to put on, I found it is the best OTC remedy for my eczema; especially in sensitive areas, such as around the eyes.</li>
            <li> Being allergic to many chemicals in hand cremes, Eucerin is the only product that doesn&#x27;t make my hands break out.  Because of the quality of the product it tends to be a bit pricey at pharmacys.  Amazon sells the quality and makes it affordable also.  In this economy Amazon is the way to go.  Thanks</li>
            <li> Helpful for my recovery from a total left hip replacement surgery and a lot of complications afterwards.</li>
            <li> This product works great; however, it has the consistency of lard.  Very hard to smooth into skin.</li>
            <li> I have very dry skin and this works when I put it on at night under my jammies - instant skin that doesn&#x27;t  itch.</li>
            <li> Excellent product but I&#x27;d recommed the 16 ounce jar to all but the 16.9 ounce bottle (with the pump is the best product).</li>
            <li> This is the only creme we have found that will work on my husbands itchy back.  Will not be w/o it!</li>
            <li> Great product altogether.</li>
            <li> I have extremely dry skin due to medications and now add diabetes into the mix and i feel like i have not had a drink of water in years. put this on and my skin stops burning and no more bad or curing or splitting cuticles.</li>
            <li> VERY THICK... I wash my hands on a regular basis... it doesn&#x27;t take much to do the job. Just a little dab will do ya! Also great for your elbows, knees and feet</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this stuff every day for nearly 40 years.  Since it came in a blue glass jar!  Once I learned how to apply it sparingly to my skin just after drying off from a shower I found it indispensable.  Wouldn&#x27;t use anything else for dry, itchy skin.</li>
            <li> I love Eucerin creme.  There are only a handful of products that work-and LAST in keeping my skin moisturized.  This is one of them.  And as a bonus this brand doesn&#x27;t have all sorts of things added to the lotion you don&#x27;t need. You can&#x27;t beat the price, either.</li>
            <li> It was recommended to me by my dermatologist, I&#x27;ve been using it ever since as I have psoriasis and extremely dry skin. Even putting it on daily does not make the dry skin stop but it does work well when used regularly.</li>
            <li> It spreads no so easy at first, feels soft and moisture after fully applying. great buy, and will buy more for folks and friends.</li>
            <li> I love to use a little bit of this on my hands. This is great for dry hands. When I first used this, i thought it was too thick but now I love this. I keep a tiny jar of this in my handbag, for when I go places. I keep a large jar of this in my bedroom, so I use a little before leaving home.</li>
            <li> Finally a lotion that means rich when they say rich. Great for feat, hands, elbows, and knees. I use oil free moisture w/sunscreen by neutrogena on my face so I don&#x27;t break out! Eucerin repair creme is somewhere in between a balm and a creme it&#x27;s that thick, and 100% unscented! Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> Fantastic for eczema prone skin. Been using it for almost 30 years, now use it on my babies&#x27; skin. Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> The only thing I can say about this product is that it is indeed great.  It does exactly what it is suppose to do and then some.  It is a regular in my home for my two sons.  Great product.</li>
            <li> Everyone knows that for eczema and problematically dry skin, Eucerin is the only things that works at all, and it&#x27;s true So we keep buying it over and over. The original is still the best.</li>
            <li> It is soo thick it does not spread now I have 2 large jars that I cannot use.</li>
            <li> I have bad eczema, especially in the summer months, on my upper arms and my feet and have suffered for years with this.  Eucerin is the only cream that my dermatologist has recommended and that has worked for me without irritating my skin.  The Eucerin Original Healing Soothing Repair Creme is VERY thick- almost a cross between an ointment and a mousse.  It&#x27;s not a traditional lotiony feeling and it does not have a floral scent which sensitive skin users will appreciate!  I usually use my Eucerin lotion when I have an eczema flair up and within a few days it&#x27;s gone.  I usually use the medicine underneath and then put some Eucerin on top for good measure like my dermatologist recommended. It&#x27;s very soothing and calming to my skin.  It does feel a little \\&quot;thick\\&quot; right when you put it on but as it absorbs into your skin, that feeling goes away.  I also put it on my feet at night, alternating with [[ASIN:B001FB5IP0 Aquaphor Healing Ointment  Advanced Therapy, 14-Ounce Jars (Pack of 2)]], and then put my feet in thick, cotton socks.  If I&#x27;m having an eczema flair up though on my feet, I don&#x27;t put my feet in the socks as this could just worse the effect.  I highly recommend Eucerin to anyone with eczema!!</li>
            <li> The only cream that works for our daughter&#x27;s eczema (and my husband&#x27;s cracked heels)! We tried coconut oil, Aquaphor, cetaphil, urea, and many, many, many others (including a bunch of Eczema creams from pharmacies in Germany). Nothing helped. Aquaphor was super gross, like applying Vaseline straight from the tub, and didn&#x27;t really do much either. Cetaphil and most of the other creams marketed as eczema creams, especially if they have colloidal oatmeal in them, make our daughter&#x27;s eczema flare up even more. Not so with Eucerin. It isn&#x27;t as gross and greasy to apply as Aquaphor, and it really makes our daughter&#x27;s skin super soft. But yes, it is still a big pain in the b*** to apply.  First, it is really thick, especially at cooler temperatures. You might need to warm it up in your hands before rubbing it on during the colder months. Second, you need to apply a THICK layer if you want this to work, preferably a couple times a day or more. We go through a big tub every two to three weeks, depending on how bad our daughter&#x27;s skin is. She needs to be &amp;#34;greased&amp;#34; face to toes. We usually put it on in the morning and have her sit on a towel and read a book till the cream is soaked in (it soaks in rather quickly, as compared to Aquaphor). Before bed, we put it on and put long sleeved PJs and socks on her immediately after, so this stuff doesn&#x27;t get all over her hair and the bed. It has ruined all of her PJs because they are soaked with this stuff. It only comes out if you wash them hot, but even then, it leaves a residue that will give fabrics a greasy feeling over time. Same with hair. Our daughter usually wears a braid now that her hair is long enough to pull it back. Otherwise, her hair gets super greasy. So overall, we wish we didn&#x27;t have to have this cream in our daily care routine, but since it really helps our daughter&#x27;s skin, we are super grateful Eucerin USA makes this cream (Eucerin Europe does not make this cream, we even called the company, we were so desperate to get this product while we lived there)! Is our daughter still scratching? Yes, and she still has flare-ups. But overall, her skin is not as dry, cracked and red as it used to be, unless we forget to put it on (we rarely forget). And on spots that start getting crusty from all the scratching, we apply this cream throughout the day, plus Hydrocortisone Valerate twice a day, and usually that helps heal her skin pretty quickly. Thank you, Eucerin!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other eczema routine, as recommended by our pediatrician: Daily Zyrtec, and Benadryl when it gets really bad. Keeping an eye on foods, psychological (e.g. stress of moving), and environmental her skin seems to react to. No polyester fabrics for her. No bubble baths, only Cetaphil Gentle Skin Cleanser.  Adding ¼ cup of unscented Chlorox to the bath water when her skin flares up badly, to bring the staph bacteria load on her skin back to somewhat normal levels (chlorine dries her skin out more, so we have to add an additional &amp;#34;grease session&amp;#34; for a day after chlorine baths). As a toddler, our daughter&#x27;s skin once got so bad that nothing of the above helped. We had to pin her socks to her pants, put socks over her hands and pin those to her sleeves (even at 100 degrees outside), just to limit her ability to scratch herself bloody. At that point, our pediatrician gave her antibiotics to lower the bacterial load on her skin. Her skin was &amp;#34;normal&amp;#34; within 24 hours of the first dose of antibiotics, and has been for 3 years now. I hope this helps someone out there...rate to get this product while we lived there)! Is our daughter still scratching? Yes, and she still has flare-ups.

            <li> Bought this as when I worked in dermatologist office we used this as a &amp;#34;base&amp;#34; for many of the prescription cremes we made.  The creme is VERY heavy and there are better alternatives that have since come out which make application easier.  Is does really work well for very dry skin but just know it is very heavy to use and you might want to reserve for night use.</li>
            <li> I have ordered this twice and it has greatly eased my Psoriasis. It takes a little extra effort to rub in but after a while there is no residue on my skin.</li>
            <li> LEAVES YOUR SKIN SOOO SOFT AMAZING FOR EZMA AND OR DRY SKIN</li>
            <li> Bought this for my gramps based on doctor&#x27;s recommendation. Works well since he isn&#x27;t complaining! Make sure you ask your doc if you need it!</li>
            <li> Although it is a pain to take the time everyday to apply lotion, it would be a greater pain to live with extremely dry skin.  I&#x27;ve been using this creme for about two decades now, and hope it never goes out of production until a permanent cure is found.  One great thing about this type of Eucerin is that it isn&#x27;t oily at all.  After application, depending on how liberally it is applied (and not much is needed), there can be a slight bit of a lubricated feel, but not slippery like suntan oil at all, which I would hate.  If you rub it in thoroughly, and use just enough to cover the area, it returns the skin to how it should feel, without being chapped, flaky and parched, which for me is after every wash.  No lotion soap I&#x27;ve tried prevents dryness, so this Eucerin creme is what I count on.</li>
            <li> My 18mo has eczema and this cream has been really great for her skin.  We have to lather her often and it really helps to keep the dryness and rashes in control.  I would recommend for anyone dealing with eczema try this product.</li>
            <li> Product: Eucerin Dry Skin Therapy Original Moisturizing Creme (White Jar)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve purchased and tried a wide assortment of creams and lotions in order to treat my feet, which often suffer from calluses, cracking, and athletes foot fungus.  I include some foot care tips below, but let me first describe how I found this wonderful product, and what makes it work for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* I&#x27;ve tried numerous skin creams and hand lotions, including all of the most popular fragrance free and hypoallergenic ones.  The problem I have with using hand and skin creams is that too often they&#x27;re either, at one end of the spectrum, too oily/greasy, or at the other end of the spectrum, too moist (which exacerbates athlete&#x27;s foot).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* I&#x27;ve tried numerous heel balms, including ones with lanolin (which irritates me), tea tree and/or eucalyptus oil (good anti-fungal properties, but too strongly scented for me), peppermint oil (horrifically overwhelming scent), bees wax (which can clog pores of not emulsified properly), you name it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The eucerin works perfectly for me, because it&#x27;s wonderfully UNSCENTED (I have a highly attuned sense of smell), and although very thick it&#x27;s not too oily (I put my socks on right after applying it with no problems or slippage), it&#x27;s not waxy (no clogged pores), and it&#x27;s non-irritating.  It&#x27;s also very thick and protects my feet all night.  In short, for me, it&#x27;s perfect.  It&#x27;s also very economical, because a little goes a long way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly Recommended.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;TIP: Be sure to shop around for the best price, as the seller linked to this review may not necessarily offer the best bargain ... and always check the shipping and handling.</li>
            <li> Eucerin creme contains Methylisothiazolinone and Methylchloroisothiazolinone, both of which are controversial because they&#x27;ve been linked to nerve damage and neuron destruction in studies, one of which was conducted by the University of Pittsburgh.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You&#x27;re better off looking for an organic skin creme that doesn&#x27;t contain any unnatural chemical compounds.&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t poison yourself! Shop smart.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Eucerin everyday for about 15 years.  I have eczema and very sensitive, dry skin and Eucerin doesn&#x27;t trigger any poor reactions for me.  This particular cream is very thick.  I don&#x27;t think most people would use this on a regular basis since it&#x27;s very thick, but I&#x27;ve had a very positive experience with it.</li>
            <li> This is my go-to cream for face and body! I love it!</li>
            <li> AMAZING...I have lymphodema and I absolutely love this cream for my legs. It does an amazing and better job of keeping my skin smooth and healed than any cream I have ever purchased. I am thrilled I found it and have no intention of ever being without it or the foot cream.</li>
            <li> I believe Eucerin Original is still the most hydrating and healing creme on the market. In the last couple years, I haven&#x27;t seen in on as many store shelves in various states in the country as in the past and that&#x27;s unfortunate. All the products in the Eucerin line are great, but this one is still the best. It is thicker and requires a little more \\&quot;rubbing in\\&quot; and perhaps that moves it down the popular list in this \\&quot;everything must happen fast\\&quot; culture. Do take the time to rub it in on problem areas like cuticles, heels, knees and sun-parched skin, but use it everywhere. It&#x27;s also a must have for babies and growing children. I&#x27;ve used various cremes from very good, well-known lines but none of them rises to the benefits of Eucerin. Honestly, this has been my favorite, most indispensable skin creme for years! When I couldn&#x27;t find it this southern California town, I panicked. But, on Amazon everything can be found and its pack-of-2 deal is fantastic. The huge 16-ounce tubs will last a very long time. Eucerin is for everyone and for all the time.</li>
            <li> I think the best dry skin cream on the market.</li>
            <li> This cream is great, better than the one we normally use (Cetaphil) our son was in the hospital for a horrible virus and the doctor had the hospital pharmacy order this cream for his eczema. We used this cream on his skin for couple of days and the eczema and rashes are clearing up very quickly. His skin is super soft and its almost glowing. Yes this cream is thick because its a cream not a lotion. The price is better than cetaphil too</li>
            <li> I started using Eucerin products 25 years ago when my child&#x27;s pediatrician recommended it. They are all quality products that are consistently good for my skin and my children&#x27;s skin, and don&#x27;t cost a fortune. It is not always easy to get a good selection of Eucerin products where I live, so was thrilled to find them on Amazon.</li>
            <li> Good Stuff. Have used it for years. Thanks</li>
            <li> Have been using this cream over 10 years.  Keeps my skin extremely soft.  Make sure you use it as soon as you dry off from the shower, otherwise it doesn&#x27;t spread well</li>
            <li> This is definitely a good product to use on your feet if they are rough and dry out always put socks on after applying foot doctor recommended</li>
            <li> Always works. Yes it is greasy and very thick, so not for everyday body lotion. Perfect for feet / eczema etc.</li>
            <li> My kids and I all have dry skin in slightly different forms--eczema, red rash, dry ashy patches...and it gets so bad that it bleeds.  I have tried so many creams over the years, from Nivea to Lubriderm to JJ baby lotion to Vaseline lotion to plain vaseline and Aquaphore.  This one is clearly the best for us and completely cleared up our skin problems.  No more problem skin as long as we apply nightly.</li>
            <li> This is some really THICK stuff.  I wash my hands very often all day and I  get cracked dry hands.  Eucerin fixed them right up just after a few days of use.  Now I only have to use it every so often to keep my hands healthy.  The only thing I don&#x27;t like is the thickness but I don&#x27;t know if it would work as well if it were different.  It takes a long time to dry and you have greezy hands for a while.</li>
            <li> this is one of the best creames out there which help keep my feet softer which I use at night</li>
            <li> If you have very sensitive skin as I have you will really love this cream  I use it on my face daily and it makes a big difference in the dryness</li>
            <li> amazing moisturizer!!!</li>
            <li> I originally bought it for my son&#x27;s extremely dry skin. It was too thick though and very hard to apply. However, I did find that it&#x27;s really worked wonders for my dry heels. I put it on in a thick layer then put socks on. By morning my feet are so soft. I know it&#x27;s not the original purpose for the creme but I&#x27;ve found that&#x27;s what works best for us.</li>
            <li> Eucerin does an amazing job on severely dry hands. I know someone that uses it for ichthyosis. I just use it for hands and feet. It goes on thick and creamy and feels soothing and amazing. It doesn&#x27;t feel greasy, but it can take some time or extra rubbing to fully absorb. I usually just put it on and put on gloves and socks until it finishes soaking in. My hands and feet feel soft and hydrated after one use. Unscented (which I love) and one tub has lasted months.</li>
            <li> Both my kids have severe eczema and their skins are very dry. I&#x27;ve tried just about all kinds of common and uncommon remedies, weak to extremely strong topical steroids and none of them worked on my daughter who I had the most difficulties with in terms of her skin. Before she turned one, we had to rush her to the ER at least once every two, three weeks because she would very often break out in hives and rash up and ooze and bleed from head to toe. Most pediatricians would recommend Aquaphor which I&#x27;d tried on my daughter. It helped with the dryness of her skin for about the first 3 weeks and then I started noticing little skin-tag like bumps around the back of her neck and then eventually her chest. I figured it was probably blocking her pores. And because Aquaphor doesn&#x27;t necessarily moisturize the skin but mainly seals in moisture; so if my daughter&#x27;s skin doesn&#x27;t have any moisture on it, like right after a shower and before drying her up with a towel, then applying Aquaphor wouldn&#x27;t do much on a very dry skin person. And more so you&#x27;d feel a bit greasy on your skin. Eucerin, on the other hand, moisturizes and seals in moisture on the skin. For my kids&#x27; super dry skins, lotions including Eucerin lotions are too runny and would evaporate within minutes. So, so far this product has been a daily routine application on my kids right after a bath/shower and even before they enter a swimming pool as a barrier from the chlorine. In addition, I still find it helpful by lotioning them up RIGHT after shower because this way, it gives my kids&#x27; skins extra moisture for a longer period of time.  The only reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is because for as much as my kids use (about one tub every two to three weeks!!!), this is a little pricier than I wish it was.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;P.S. For people with eczema or moms who are looking for ways to reduce the severity of their kids&#x27; eczema, I personally think the Eucerin creme alone won&#x27;t do the trick. For my kids at least, they&#x27;re taking Chinese herbal medicine and using Chinese herbal ointment locally to help with the itchiness. And on top of that, we&#x27;ve come a LONG way finding the right kind of diet. For my kids, less chicken/poultry, washing all the fruit and veggies with fruit and vegetable wash, buying organic produce or at least all the root vegetables, and good quality beef and really avoid any food dyes and colorings are all important factors in their skin health.</li>
            <li> I have switched to Eucerin for everything for my sensitive/dry skin. I didnt think this product was going to be so thick, it can be a little tough to spread over your body, however, it is great for dry skin. I have been using it on my knees, elbows and ankles mostly, andI prefer the calming cream for everyday full body use.</li>
            <li> If you have any rough skin you need this, this stuff has some staying power, not like those pump bottles of liquid.</li>
            <li> A good moisturizer, but only in the fall and winter when it comfortable to use</li>
            <li> Excellent cream. Using it daily for scar therapy.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff! It works wonders on dry skin and eczema, I don&#x27;t know what I would so without it.</li>
            <li> I used one of these jars every day on face and arms and it lasted over a year!  This is THE lotion.  It works.  It even works on the little bumps on the back of my arm (k. pilaris) to a good degree.  [Heads up for those of you with acne:  take a probiotic supplement daily like [[ASIN:B000GWKA2K Garden of Life Primal Defense HSO Probiotics Formula, Caplets, 180-Count Bottle]].]</li>
            <li> This is some serious stuff...very thick and soothing. It has really helped out with some long time dryness problems.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s an average product according to the Skin Doctor Score....read the review at theskindoctor.com</li>
            <li> Told to use this by my doctor it is a very good product</li>
            <li> This was initially bought for my baby&#x27;s eczema on a friend&#x27;s recommendation. However we did not like it because it&#x27;s very thick. I could not spread it comfortably on my baby&#x27;&#x27;s body and hated that experience, every time I tried doing it. I am, however using it to moisturize my hands :-) Amazon doesn&#x27;t ship a single jar, so now am stuck with two of them to smooth-en out my hands!</li>
            <li> used before, very effective</li>
            <li> Its a wonderful product.  And it really works great. I have one at work. Really appreciate .  Use the product during the winter .</li>
            <li> Love it - there is no other cream or lotion I want. Ever again.</li>
            <li> My dermatologist recommended this to me for my dry skin.  I really like this product.  It&#x27;s working for me.  My husband even started to use it and he likes it too.</li>
            <li> i didn&#x27;t know this was going to be so greasy. it&#x27;s really really greasy. stains the sheets if you put it on at night. won&#x27;t be buying this again. but if you want really greasy cream then this is for you</li>
            <li> I love this particular Eucerin lotion so I was totally excited when I saw the price for TWO jars.  I set it up for standard 5 to 7 days shipping since it was free for my order but I actually got it the next day!! Great lotion, great price, and got here very quickly!!!</li>
            <li> This original crème is the one suggested from the time I started treating my feet for dryness due to Type 2 diabetes.  I&#x27;ve tried others but Eucerin is still the best.</li>
            <li> I have extremely dry skins, especially on the legs, hips, and waist.  This product works better than any lotion I have tried, and better than any other creme I have tried.  A single jar lasts a very long time.  Also, there is no order or greasiness.</li>
            <li> I could not live without this in the MN Winters. I use it primarily on ny hands and elbows, it also works great on dry lips (will make them temporarily white until it absorbs). My 3yo has Eczema on his legs and this clears it right up. It&#x27;s easiest to apply on larger areas when skin is still wet/moist after a bath/shower.</li>
            <li> This creme is SO THICK.  Like butter.  It keeps my skin moisturized for ~12 hours, unlike other lotions (even more-viscous Eucerin lotions) that wear off quickly.  I love this creme.</li>
            <li> Favorite lip balm. Thick with no allergic issues. I have sensitive skin and this is a great nighttime lip balm for the dry climate.&lt;br /&gt;This tub will last at least a year, if not longer&lt;br /&gt;Unscented, no crazy smelly oils</li>
            <li> This cream (in the jar) is remarkable.  It is thick and creamy.  I see significant improvement in my skin every time I use it!</li>
            <li> This cream is great for softening and smoothing problem areas like knees, elbow, and feet.  I use it every day, and even on my hands in the winter to combat dry skin.  I&#x27;ve also found it much better at keeping my heals soft and smooth than any of the foot creams I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> Wonderful product. Has been around for years and does exactly as advertised.  This was a two pack buy, I kept one for myself to use on the dryer areas. The other bottle was given to a person who is a lithographer. With his hands in papers/inks all day this has brought so much relief/healing to his hands.</li>
            <li> Works well on dry skin. Good price and value.  Seems to do all it says it does no problem with dry skin when I use it as directed</li>
            <li> My care giver insists on this for my legs</li>
            <li> I have psoriasis and long ago discovered that daily moisturizing of plaques with a heavy moisturizer really reduces itching and scaling, and even seems to make some small plaques go away.  I experimented with a number of different types, and settled on this as the best for me because it provides a heavy layer without feeling slimy or causing staining of clothes. Every other moisturizer just feels wrong to me these days, so I stick with this.</li>
            <li> Wintertime is here, and the cold weather makes my skin extremely dry. No problem. All I have to do is apply some Eucerin. I usually apply a thin layer (I don&#x27;t like the greasiness of lotion) and it is usually sufficient to transform and repair my sandpaper-skin into smooth skin. With thin layers of lotion, however, I do need to reapply multiple times in a day, but it only takes a couple hours for initial effects to be evident. Of course, for extremely dry skin applying more is beneficial.</li>
            <li> for some reason this is hard to get - well, it will be well used. I wish this company would help us soldiers out a bit. We could use this product out here</li>
            <li> My daughter has very bad eczema and I would never trust anything other then Eucerin on her skin.  This cream for me is like a miracle.</li>
            <li> We have used this by the recommendation from our first son&#x27;s allergist. Our first son dealt with minor skin issues from being slightly allergic to certain foods and having eczema. He recommended using it and warned us that it is a very thick paste and that we would need to rub it into his skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m certainly glad we used this and still use this. It helps keep his skin moisturized and soft even during our harsh NJ cold winters.</li>
            <li> It is thick but it is good!</li>
            <li> Arrived promptly. Just as described. Husband is a physician and swears by this for himself and his patients.  Highly recommend. A+++++</li>
            <li> I really love this product. It helped and healed my daughter&#x27;s skin problems. I also use this cream on my feet and they keep them very soft.</li>
            <li> Way cheaper than stores I got one for the gym and one for home. Perfect to control eczema I suffered for as long as I can remember. Finally a dermatologist told me to use eucerin daily from head to toe immediately after taking a shower. Since then I&#x27;ve been able to control my eczema I highly recommend it for anyone with the same problem</li>
            <li> I use it specifically for the bottom of me feet. And it works wonderful. My feet are always soft. However, I only use it when I am going to be putting socks on because it is really heavy.</li>
            <li> Thick, thick, thick and goopy. I like to use it on my rough heels and feet before bed, but it&#x27;s too thick for my liking to use on hands or other body parts. No noticeable smell. This item is a 2 pack of 16 ounce jars, so you&#x27;ll have lots.</li>
            <li> It has done wonders for my g&#x27;dau&#x27;s face. I gave one jar to my other granddaughter because it goes a long way. Very pleased with it.</li>
            <li> This stuff is THICK.  But it has certainly helped with dry skin/eczema I&#x27;ve been having on my face.  It&#x27;s so thick that it&#x27;s hard to work into my skin, but thinner lotions I tried did nothing to help my dry skin.  I recommend this if you are trying to solve a dry skin problem and other lotions haven&#x27;t worked.</li>
            <li> This is the original skin repair cream formula.  It&#x27;s great for very dry skin and sensitive skin, a terrific moisturizer.  Once you use Eucerin you are likely to get hooked on it.  Amazon is now offering a nice value on two pack, better price than my local store.</li>
            <li> I remember this from a million years ago, but was recently reminded about it on a segment on the morning news. I sent one to my daughter and kept one. IT is thick and it does HOLD IN the moisture.</li>
            <li> This works better for my wife&#x27;s dry and cracking finger tips than the prescription medication prescribed by her dermatologist.  The cracked and bleeding skin at the end of her fingers has healed up.</li>
            <li> My daughter&#x27;s doctor recommended this for skin graft aftercare.  It keeps the wound moist and stops it from tightening. It&#x27;s pretty much all they use at the hospital.</li>
            <li> I suffer from psoriasis so this is essential in my dry climate. 8 more words bs either it works in ten words or it doesn&#x27;t</li>
            <li> Works very well on dry skin. Especially if applied on damp skin. have noticed healing to areas once flared by an eczema reaction. Hydrating and non-irritating.</li>
            <li> Best moisturizing cream around.  It is really thick and covers the area.</li>
            <li> My son has had really bad eczema since he was 1 month ,he is 13 months now and this is the only product that has made a difference and I have tried quite a lot ranging from aveeno to aquaphor,triple cream,oatmeal bath,gentle naturals etc.I simply mix it with Vaseline and spread on him several time a day.He still itches but not as much as before and his skin looks and feels really good.I have also being able to cut down on the topical steroids since I started this product.</li>
            <li> Wonderful cream.  I&#x27;ve priced it elsewhere at double the price.</li>
            <li> excellent for protection during cold winter months.</li>
            <li> We have 3 boys who have eczema, one very badly, and this is the best product we&#x27;ve found.  I tried dozens of products and spent hundreds of dollars on other products recommended to me when my now-4-year-old was an infant with terrible eczema, and I was always disappointed. I think different products work for different people, but from research and experience I learned that the best thing for eczema is to find out how often your child needs to be bathed to promote healing (ours is every other day; more or less caused the eczema to get worse), and when you get your child out of the tub, seal that moisture in ASAP (within 3 minutes).  This is a great product for sealing in that moisture.</li>
            <li> This is part of my skin care regime. Saves my skin in the winter. Great for sealing in the moisture. Love that it is unscented.&lt;br /&gt;It is a bit greasy, and it&#x27;s definitely not light - but the staying factor of this moisturizer is the best. And no reaction from my sensitive skin!</li>
            <li> This is great stuff! It is the best for the money, don&#x27;t feel you have to spend the big bucks for a great product, this is it!</li>
            <li> I have eczema &amp; this is the only lotion that doesn&#x27;t hurt when I put it on. It moisturizes really well! I couldn&#x27;t put this on &amp; feel comfortable using the computer, it is a little greasy, but I expect that with something so extremely moisturizing.</li>
            <li> Best eczema cream out there, especially if you&#x27;re not a fragrance person.</li>
            <li> After hand surgery this is what they use in Occupational Therapy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m sure my therapist has thoroughly researched healing creams and decided on this one.  I like the feel when the therapist massages this into my hand.  It isn&#x27;t oily or greasy and allows my skin to breath.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As much as I like this; I&#x27;m also treating the incision with Manuka honey which works great for scars.</li>
            <li> Great moisturizer for my body. It&#x27;s great for the cold winters but I wish it was not so thick and a bit easier to apply. It takes a lot of rubbing it in to apply a thin layer on my hands and legs. Otherwise this is a top quality product.</li>
            <li> This is what we use in the hospital, and it is the best not only for diabetics but for everyone. You don&#x27;t need to apply a lot for it to work well, and the lid is easy to undo.</li>
            <li> My little one was diagnosed with eczema when she was just a few months old.  In the winter her skin looks awful.  I apply this daily during the fall and winter months and her skin looks and feels great.  This is a thick, non greasy cream.  I would highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Item was as advertised. Good item.</li>
            <li> I have had fairly severe eczema on my hands, and particularly fingers, for about 40 years now.  I&#x27;ve used several cortisone-based prescription ointments at night while wearing vinyl gloves to help control the very painful cracks I get on my knuckles, etc.  Three years ago during the winter, I also began to have terrible fingertip cracks which are even more painful and slower to heal than the larger cracks I&#x27;d get throughout the year.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I visited my dermatologist a few months ago, I was struck by something I read on one of her tip sheets for dealing with dry skin.  Namely, that if a moisturizer comes out of a bottle or tube, it&#x27;s not thick enough!  It needs to come out of a jar to do any real good.  So I decided to try Eucerin Original Healing Creme and really be diligent about using it every day.  I use it now after each shower - it does take more time to put on so I usually just slather it all over my legs which of course gets it all over my hands as well.  I am simply amazed at how well my hands are doing - particularly since it&#x27;s the dead of winter.  No cracks whatsoever!!  No sign of eczema....again, I am just blown away by this since I&#x27;ve been suffering from eczema for so long.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I always thought I had been pretty good about moisturizing....but now I&#x27;m committed to using this product throughout the year, not just during winter.  I&#x27;m already into my 2nd jar with a 3rd in waiting in my closet.  I cannot get over how under-control my eczema is now and I never would have believed it was possible simply from using a cream like this to moisturize. But this IS thanks to Eucerin!!</li>
            <li> Bought this for my brother who uses it constantly.  He really swears by this product and was glad to get a larger supply of it.</li>
            <li> This product is extremely thick, greasy, doesn&#x27;t blend into skin well at all. It also has done nothing on my dry eczema spots because it truly seems like its not even penetrating the skin. Unfortunately I have 2 large tubs of this and no clue what to do with it- maybe I will use it as a foot cream with socks over it for deep moisturizing- I guess thats all I can recommend this for.</li>
            <li> Great product! I use it for my dry skin and then the dry skin disappears.</li>
            <li> Eucerin is the best cream for my psoriasis that I have been able to find.</li>
            <li> THIS CREME IS GREAT TO USE IF YOU NEED TO REPAIR YOUR SKIN</li>
            <li> Great product for dry and irritated skin with Eczema. Non-greasy, but is a very thick moisturizing cream. Price is right. Prime eligible.</li>
            <li> Very dense but will use for elbows and heels ths winter</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a very heavy thick cream, it doesn&#x27;t seem to absorb very quickly, but so long as you have nothing to do, and have the time to sit and wait, it works GREAT on really severely dry, chapped, or cracking skin. It does leave the area feeling a bit gummy/tacky for a while after application. I wouldn&#x27;t use this all over my body, but for hands, elbows, seat bone pressure points, knees, any really dry patches, and feet, it is EXCELLENT!</li>
            <li> Love this product.  It helps my extremely dry skin a lot.</li>
            <li> Retains moisture EXTREMELY well.  I have psoriasis and cremes (not lotions as they dry out) are a great non-RX addition to help moisturize your skin.  It kind of is weird to put on, or maybe I should say different than other creams.  Usually you slather it on and can rub in easily, but this cream will go on your skin in a &amp;#34;clump&amp;#34; (wherever you put it) and then you have to really manually move it around to get an area covered.  I am okay to deal with that though, due to it&#x27;s efficacy.  It&#x27;s great to use if you don&#x27;t shower/bathe everyday (as it&#x27;s best to use after your skin is damp to retain moisture); it still moisturizes and does the job EXCELLENTLY, just as good as when out of the shower.  Highly recommend for anyone, from dry skinners, to those with skin conditions (doctor permitting), and even just your everyday personage with no skin issues.  It is a treat for your skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure this lotion helps some people but we do not like it. The cream is extremely hard to spread more than a couple inches at a time. It takes FOREVER to try to lotion an entire limb. Additionally, it did nothing to help my son&#x27;s eczema. After trying eight or nine lotions and creams, the Cetaphil Restoraderm really was the winner. It kept us from having to use steroid cream all the time.</li>
            <li> My answer for dry feet, dry winter complexion, and whenever I&#x27;m looking tired and want to wake up looking dewy. Never a breakout, and I always get compliments after I put it on, for the next few days after! After sleeping in a THIN layer of it overnight, concealer and liquid makeup goes on and stays on while looking more natural than usual. I never let it run out! And the Amazon price beats the store, by about 50%.</li>
            <li> Solid brand. Excellent moisturizer after spending an hour or so in a chlorinated swimming pool--even during winter my skin stays hydrated.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite moisturizing creme when my skin gets very dry.  Others sting, this one doesn&#x27;t.  This works amazingly well for me overnight.  It&#x27;s very thick, not like a lotion, and works better and more quickly than any lotion I&#x27;ve ever tried.</li>
            <li> This is the best for dry skin. I have tried many however this always keeps my skin feeling soft and not greasy throughout the entire day!</li>
            <li> The doctors will tell you that if you are going to use lotion, buy the tubs of creme.  Pump lotions have mostly water in them, and that is what you are paying for.  This lotion is thick and hard to apply at times, but well worth it.</li>
            <li> My doc recommended it as because my skin was getting itchy due to dry condition weather about 5 yrs ago. I have been using it and never had any skin problems since then. I found it about 20-30% cheaper from save &amp; subscribe here comparison to regular grocery shelf price.</li>
            <li> This stuff is great for heels</li>
            <li> This is an amazing cr eam for babies with sensitive skin.  It is thick and works great for the winter.</li>
            <li> love it -- it work better than others</li>
            <li> I can understand why they renamed it from \\&quot;moisturizing cream\\&quot;. This is closer to Desitin, definitely more of an ointment than a cream. Might be superb if that is what you need. Less a moisturizer, more a waterproofer. Actually increases friction.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll be going back to Cetaphil Moisturizing Cream.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: I&#x27;ve increased my star rating to reflect my ongoing experience. I&#x27;ve tried a couple dozen different lotions, crèmes, and ointments, including some with hydrocortisone and antihistamines. This is the first treatment I&#x27;ve found that stops dry-skin itch all day long without needing reapplication. While it will never be my everyday moisturizer, and I still find it unpleasant to use, it will be my primary product for a couple of dry, itchy problem areas.</li>
            <li> My skin is super sensitive to begin with. So I have all sorts of facial problems with acne, blackheads and whatnots. I recently found a face wash that works but was leaving my skin around my nose and chin area extremely dry tl the point where it&#x27;d flake. I used so many lotions and oils to treat the flaky dryness but nothing worked. This stuff worked instantly! I love it! I use it as soon as I finish washing my face or shower. It works best after showering :) I&#x27;m very happy with this. Best lotion out there!!</li>
            <li> My skin is very dry. A physician recommended Eucerin a long time ago and I&#x27;ve been using it ever since. It takes a little while to rub in, but it helps.</li>
            <li> Eucerin is the best moisturizing its lays on a bit thick initially but then it really lasts.  I used Vaseline -petroleum jelly  before this and I still do sometimes but this one trumps them all.</li>
            <li> My 93yr Mom loves it and so do I. :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We use several jars each year... it&#x27;s a good price for a good product.</li>
            <li> This is for the folks who have seriously dry skin. The cream is very thick and I find it&#x27;s easier to put on after massaging in the palms of your hand first. It&#x27;s a little too thick for me to use every day, but I will definitely continue to use it as a hand and foot cream and a cold-weather moisturizer.</li>
            <li> I dun know how you can use this crème. It&#x27;s texture is more like a mud paste (but white in color), thick and sticky, so hard to spread! I do not recommend this at all.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve recently ordered jars of this product after reading reviews. I have sensitive skin and this is a great product without breaking the bank. When I put the product on in the night the next day my skin feels very soft and nice. It does have a bit of a thick consistency to the product but I think its an excellent cream.</li>
            <li> My kids have suffered from eczema for years. This is what we have always used to get deep in the dry skin and help it to heal.&lt;br /&gt;It does not disappear quickly but we keep gently rubbing it until it gets in good enough. On your dry feet and cracked heels, you can put socks on to keep it in. When their eczema gets worse in the winter, we use a prescription creme but supplement it with Eucerin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is a very thick cream, not a lotion so this tub lasts a long time. Perfect for those stubborn dry spots that need more than the average moisturizing lotion.</li>
            <li> It is what I needed and have had it before, so found it very great, especially to get 2 of them rather than just one.  Not so sure of the hand wash but then my hands are sensitive to even water.</li>
            <li> This Eucerin cream is great for dry skin and eczema. When my son was a month old, he started getting a horrible rash that I later learned was called eczema. I tried aquaphor, but didn&#x27;t like the ointment feel to it. Eucerin is also classified as an ointment, but can be rubbed in well enough that it doesn&#x27;t feel like one. My son&#x27;s pediatrician recommended using it twice daily and within a week, my son&#x27;s skin cleared up! I also use it everyday for my hands since I wash my hands a lot. One 16oz jar will last a really long time (6-12 months depending on how often you use it). I&#x27;ve also tried other lotions, including another eucerin cream, but this one was definitely the best.</li>
            <li> This product is fantastic. My wife has been using Eucerin for over 10 years for dry skin. She uses about 4 jars a month. By far this is the best price we have ever found. We&#x27;re saving between $12-$16 a month.&lt;br /&gt;Can&#x27;t say enough about this product.</li>
            <li> A dependable product that I&#x27;ve used for years. Works best to use a little in excess of what you think you will need, an tissue off the excess. Leaves my hands soft for hours after use.</li>
            <li> This is by far the best moisturizing creme I have ever used.  It is good because it is simple and free of unnecessary chemicals.  I have used it for years.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for many years off and on. But I always come back to it because it&#x27;s the best for my eczema prone skin.</li>
            <li> As described.  An old standby product that works on dry skin.</li>
            <li> Great for very dry skin. Tough to spread, though, as it&#x27;s quite thick.</li>
            <li> My little one having extremely dry skin and I was using Vaseline and Aveeno baby moisturizer for quite a while but still no use. one day I used one small tube of Eucerin (original) sample which I got from skin specialist..that worked like a charm on babies skin....and that formula was so soft to apply... I was very happy and believed that Eucerin (original) will work on my babies skin..Bought 2 pack of 16 ounces jar....very thick paste hard to apply..not at all spreading on the skin.... may be this jar contained some other low effective formula than that sample tube.Would not recommend this to any one.I would say don&#x27;t trust sample which contains better formula to impress people.If you still want to buy then buy a small one.All my money gone waste :(</li>
            <li> I have very dry skin and am very sensitive to many products that are available today.  This is a great product for those of us who have sensitive/dry skin.</li>
            <li> My favorite moisturizer for feet</li>
            <li> This a a great product for severely dry skin. It helps moisturize, heal, and protect my kids skin which is excessively dry due to eczema.</li>
            <li> exellent product, good price</li>
            <li> Other reviews suggesting this is a an extra-rich cream are right on. But the time it takes to rub it in is well worth it. I&#x27;ve been dealing with seborreic dermatitis and exczema since I turned 50 four years ago. I use steroid creams for flare ups but still need something for all over moisture, especially on my face, which - no matter what I use - hurts by 3pm every day, it&#x27;s so dry. This is the first cream to give luxurious, comforting moisture all day long . I&#x27;m thrilled. In one week my face looks and feels 100% better.  This, in my opinion, is the best over the counter cream on the market for exzema sufferers. Wish I had tried it sooner.</li>
            <li> Product exactly as described.</li>
            <li> I love this, love it love love it - can&#x27;t say it enough.  That&#x27;s why I buy it in the large tubs!  My best friend&#x27;s son is graduating from nursing school next month and I&#x27;m giving him some of this.  Nurses have to wash their hands so much, their poor hands get so dried out.  My sister is a Nurse Practitioner and she is the one who turned me on to this.  It&#x27;s so good, I&#x27;m just glad I don&#x27;t need a prescription for it!!</li>
            <li> This is the best cream for extremely dry skin.  It was recommended by my son&#x27;s pediatrician for severe diaper rash 26 years ago and I use it from everything from chapped lips to foot care.</li>
            <li> Best stuff on the planet - I literally sigh with pleasure when I put this on my poor old dried out hands!</li>
            <li> This has petroleum and mineral oil and other not so great ingredients.  i though this had urea, which I was looking for, but was mistaken.  It is VERY thick but it does in fact soften rough skin so I can&#x27;t say that it doesn&#x27;t work.  I just like better ingredients.  This is a LOT of lotion.  You can lubricate a whale for a few months with all this lotion.</li>
            <li> I usually just buy generic eucerin in the tubs at pharmacies, and I usually spend $9.99 at least on one tub.  That is probably a sale price so I would say on average I spend about $10.79 or more.  Here on Amazon, you the brand name and 2 jars.  It&#x27;s a really good price here.  I was diagnosed with Guttate Psoriasis about a year and a half ago.  Initially, Cetaphil helped but not for too long.  Even after using Cetaphil, my skin would become itchy throughout the day.  I was blown away with the results of using Eucerin.  This stuff is absolutely amazing!  The worse spots I have are currently on my hands.  I wash a lot of dishes (you can&#x27;t always wear rubber gloves), do a lot of handwashing, from changing diapers and just trying to be a clean person.  I cannot live without Eucerin.  Also, two of my four children, have a little bit of eczema on their upper arms.  Use this stuff on the areas that have the eczema and it will go away within a day or two.  There is nothing out there that works better, brand name or generic.  It&#x27;s a must have for dry skin, eczema or psoriasis.</li>
            <li> Heavy, soothing and most of all,  protective.  I use it for my hands and face twice a day.  Department Store brands are shallow, expensive and filled with perfumes.  This is pure and clean feeling, no irritation.</li>
            <li> This product was recommended to us by our daughter&#x27;s pediatrician.  This creme makes our daughter&#x27;s skin so soft and does help heal scratches and scrapes.  Our friend was impressed with the softness of our daughter&#x27;s skin!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is very thick and takes a bit to work into the skin.  We&#x27;ve been using this product for about a year and are very happy with it.</li>
            <li> Bough bulk because of my dry skin condition. Be ware, you must smooth this out on your face or body so it will not show screaks. While my skin is worse than the average 20 year old, I do use to moist my skin. My age group is 60+. Will continue to use and it does assist my dry skin - hope this helps;.</li>
            <li> This is great stuff for my eczema and dry winter months. It is a great product for women after shaving their legs, arm pits and bikini line. It is very thick and lasts me a long time. I only went through two of these last year. I put on trouble spots in the morning and nights and had dramatic improvements to my dry, crackling skin.</li>
            <li> This product is very hard and  I had to mix it with oils to soften it.</li>
            <li> I have always loved this brand.  It works wonders on the feet, elbows and any rough areas you may have.</li>
            <li> Good price, great delivery, for the Original Eucerin I have been using for years.</li>
            <li> This product keep the skin soft and moist. Great product!</li>
            <li> BEST TOPICAL CREME ON MARKET</li>
            <li> Accutane can be a godsend if you&#x27;ve suffered from adult acne-- but it can also cause some severe drying as a side effect. Besides drying out my nose (and causing a little bit of nosebleeding) the only other way I&#x27;ve had issues with drying is on the tops of my hands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product is fantastic for moisturizing any skin on my hands or body that has dried out as a side effect of Accutane usage.  It&#x27;s thick and greasy, so I usually will wait until I&#x27;m going to bed to apply it. I&#x27;ve also purchased some moisturizing gloves to help as well[[ASIN:B001G7PWAE Earth Therapeutics Hand Gloves, Moisturizing, 1 pair (Pack of 2)]]. Other products I&#x27;ve found extremely helpful to use while on Accutane are Aquaphor [[ASIN:B002UUT428 Aquaphor Baby To-Go Pack, two .35-Ounce Tubes (Pack of 3)]] for my lips, and Cerave[[ASIN:B000YJ2SLG CeraVe Moisturizing Lotion (12 oz)]] to apply as a facial moisturizer. (Note: Eucerin is too shiny, heavy, and thick to use easily as a facial moisturizer.)</li>
            <li> I order this cream based on my dermatologist&#x27;s recommendations. For sure, this cream is more like a paste, thick and rich. Once you have it on your hands, it becomes difficult to grab the door knob to get out of the bedroom, especially if the doorknob is shaped like a ball. In other words, my hands become so greasy that it becomes uncomfortable to touch or grab anything around the house. It&#x27;s a little bit frustrating. The only thing that works is to wear cotton gloves, even when sleeping.&lt;br /&gt;After a few weeks, I noticed that my hands are softer, but the &amp;#34;miracle&amp;#34; that I was expecting didn&#x27;t happen. I know it&#x27;s difficult (if not impossible) to get rid of eczema without corticosteroids and this product didn&#x27;t do much by itself in this regard.&lt;br /&gt;I like that product overall, and I keep using it anyways. It doesn&#x27;t have any toxic ingredients so I don&#x27;t mind applying thick layers on my hands (and feet).&lt;br /&gt;And yes, I would recommend this product anyways!</li>
            <li> llego en perfecto estado y rapido, quisiera saber si puedo resibir ofertas del vendedor directamente para comprar mas rapido, en estos dias seguire conprando sus productos.</li>
            <li> I love this body cream  I have psoriasis on my upper legs (in the back)  The area gets very inflamed and painful.  I keep it soft using Eucerin  Healing cream.  Within a few minutes the pain is gone.</li>
            <li> I was going to order this from AMZN, but decided I needed it right away, and went to Walgreens. I have been having a rough, sensitive, red chin every since I hit 55, and just thought it was old age My beard would get all itchy with grayish stubble irritating my skin. I tried all kinds of lotions and a few creams, but the red, kinda burning skin would not go away. I had to keep my beard shaved at all times and the redness would continue. So i did try this and have seen good results in just a week/ My chin is not as itchy and not near as red. I will order this 2 pack next time. ( It is like a thick paste, so I use it at nite. GLTA</li>
            <li> Works well but it&#x27;s really thick and kind of difficult to spread on your skin.</li>
            <li> Who can knock Eucerin? If winter is unkind to your skin then you need this. If your heels crack then you need this. Nothing I&#x27;ve tried is anywhere near as effective.</li>
            <li> Fantasic product with fast delivery and excellent communication.  A life saver product for my kids skin and the lotion is also awesome too.</li>
            <li> I have had a very hard time keeping my skin dry in the arid  to winter climate that I live in.  This healed my skin amazingly well! It was a recommendation From a very wise friend. I hope that my recommendation counts also.</li>
            <li> The only reason I gave it a three is because it does tend to be greasy after you put it on, but if you&#x27;re like me and you get those nasty rough elbows. It helps a lot</li>
            <li> I thought this would be smooth and creamy. It is hard and very thick. It comes out of the jar on my fingers in thick clumps. Very dry and thick. Will go back to my regular lotion.</li>
            <li> I used it on my face (which was incredibly dry) when I was away skiing in the states and now I use it every few days on my face at night</li>
            <li> Eucerin is an excellent cream to use if you are trying to repair your skin. I was battling with several skin issues when I used this product and thought that it started me on the road to healing. It is thick, and at the time, I wanted something thick. I also like the convenience of the jar. You don&#x27;t have to worry about a pump failing.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s almost like a solid. You would scratch your skin while applying. There is no way you could apply it to your body, unless you wanna hurt yourself.</li>
            <li> This is the best for babies and toddlers! Great for me as well, I use it on my hands and feet.</li>
            <li> I do a lot of washing daily.  My hands get so dried and cracked to the point that they bleed sometimes.  I love this repair creme by Eucerin.  I apply it overnight and my hands are soft again.  Sometimes I wash my hands after I have this on but the lotion still stays on my hands.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this creme off and on for years. It is very, very thick but when you have super dry skin or scaly patches, you need something that will stay with you.  I&#x27;ve mixed this with hydrocortisone for my husband&#x27;s elbows and he has said it smooths his skin and keeps itching down. It&#x27;s excellent for dry, cracked feet - put in a sock overnight and your feet will be super smooth. Eucerin has been around a long while and we will always keep a jar in our medicine cabinet!</li>
            <li> too rich, but my mother like it. no smell</li>
            <li> Waste of money! It does not penetrate and I have to use another lotion with it. It&#x27;s actually too thick and clumpy. There is nothing soothing about it. Stick with the regular lotion.</li>
            <li> Eucerin is a great product.</li>
            <li> i recently purchased eucerin creme from amazon and im very pleased ith it.i get some very dry skin and this seems to work very well for me.i ordered it and received a 2 pack with free shipping and 2 day delivery since i upgraded to prime membership. i went to my podiatrist and told her what iam using she said it is one she recommends.</li>
            <li> thick lotion, hard to apply, but seems to work as it does give moisture to the skin, but i found an oil worked better on my child&#x27;s dry and itchy skin.</li>
            <li> My doctor recommended this for my eczema and this is just high quality. It&#x27;s extremely heavy and dense relative to your typical lotions. My sister thinks this is as good as La Mer (something ridiculously expensive)</li>
            <li> Works for me, i have a skin allergy</li>
            <li> This has been the only thing that helps my itchy dry skin during winter.</li>
            <li> I have exceptionally dry skin on my hands all winter. This stuff does the trick.</li>
            <li> Terrific product for wintertime dry weather, keeps the skin from getting chapped. And doesn&#x27;t cause itchiness that some others products do, so apparently doesn&#x27;t have some things in it that I might be allergic to.</li>
            <li> love this its the best</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a frequent user and this has been consistently good.</li>
            <li> This stuff liver up to the label.</li>
            <li> The only product that cures extremely dryness skin. It is very greasy but helped with eczema problem. I use it every night on my dried/cracked skin heels and cover with socks. Can not live without this product</li>
            <li> Yes, It makes skin soft and smooth. It actually feels like you have a layer of something on your skin all day (in kind of a good way) not saying greasy cuz it&#x27;s not. It&#x27;s just the texture that I don&#x27;t like cuz it makes it a pain to slather it on and if you put on too much, it gets heavy and uncomfortable. I did that one night (for a reason) and I was soo uncomfortable I didn&#x27;t get a good night sleep. Still using it nonetheless cuz I bought and paid for a pack of 2 and I don&#x27;t want it to go to waste. But I don&#x27;t think I would be buying more.</li>
            <li> This product is great for someone needing extra moisture like on the bottom of feet or someone with psoriasis or any skin condition that requires extra moisture. It is fragrance free and very soothing. Best to use any moisturizer after bathing but I use this on my hands and dry areas throughout the day.</li>
            <li> Ordered for my wife who says this is the BEST stuff.  Living in the Mohave, it&#x27;s a dry heat, so along my backbone gets itchy and I need to take a grinder to it.  Instead my bride rubs this stuff in, and it stops itching and a few days of use puts me in a good way for a month.</li>
            <li> wow! ordered yesterday!!</li>
            <li> Keeps my hands soft. My favorite hand cream!</li>
            <li> This product works really well on the hands and feet.  It worked very well on my dry chapped hands.  But, when I tried to use it on my arms and legs it was hard to rub into the skin.</li>
            <li> The skin on neck used to breakout in reaction to chemicals in facial lotions and creams.  I couldn&#x27;t moisturize my neck without risking a severe chemical reaction.  The last time that happened, I had to go see my doctor because the breakout was so severe.  My doctor recommended Eucerin and it worked like a magic.  No more breakouts and my neck stays nicely moisturized.  I&#x27;ve recommended it to my daughter and my sister for their skin problems.</li>
            <li> Great lotion, especially in the dry winter. Use it on my little one&#x27;s eczema. It&#x27;s very thick and greasy but the greasiness goes away pretty quickly. Is definitely a healing cream.</li>
            <li> Very good especially for my burns.</li>
