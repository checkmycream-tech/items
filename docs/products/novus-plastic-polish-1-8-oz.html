            <li> I&#x27;ve used Novus polish before. It is the best polish out there for just about anything.</li>

It&#x27;s perfect for removing bug splatter off the windshield or your helmet/visor. It also works to clean the plastic windows on my GEO Tracker.</li>
            <li> The best polish ever for this category. The worst for bottle spray nozzels that just break during use just about when bottle is about half empty, or should we say half full. Experience 2x in a row.</li>
            <li> The best plastic cleaner I have ever used.  So effective, so easy to apply and remove.  I use it for my helmet shield, fairing windscreen and auto and motorcycle headlight lens&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> A friend of mine told me about this for my windshield to remove all the bugs &amp; bug juice that pelts the windshield in the spring. It is by far the best I have used to date. Will recommend it to all my motorcycle friends for sure.</li>
            <li> I love this polish! Works on so many things and no streaking.</li>

            <li> Was using Windex and paper towels to clean helmet face shield. Then I found out that combo is like using sandpaper. Switched to Novus #1 and a microfiber towel. Did a 2500 mi. motorcycle trip this summer and had almost no shield scratches.     Will buy again, but I think it is a bit too expensive which is why I gave it 4 stars.</li>
            <li> Have been using this product for years and motorcycle windshield - never scratches and cleans wonderfully.  Easy to apply and polish.</li>
            <li> I use this plastic cleaner on my (plastic) boat windows and hatches.  It is great for cleaning off the salt spray and grime that seems to collect on my windows.  With this product, I don&#x27;t have to worry about forming scratches while cleaning or anything else.  Great product!</li>
            <li> this is such a good item, hides all the scratches on the golf cart window shield  this is a must buy</li>
            <li> I probably should have bought Novus 2.  There is very little abrasive action with the 1.</li>
            <li> Very good product. I use this to clean my pinball machines playfield.</li>
            <li> I use it to clean my plexi podiums/lecterns.  It does the job better than anything else out there that i have found.</li>
            <li> Bought the polish for my golf cart plastic windshield. After applying as instructed, the windshield still tend to fog up during early morning rounds. Maybe I am expecting too much.</li>
            <li> Excellent product and seller.</li>
            <li> when i bought this product i had bought a new windshield for my motorcyclr and wanted something that would keep it looking new.novus is the ticket.a little goes a long way and with a microfiber towel it cleans and polishes great. it will even get the \\&quot;heavy&lt;br /&gt;&#x27;stuff off with just a little soaking.got the 8oz bottle and the next i get will b e the bigger container so i don&#x27;t come up short. NOVUS Plastic Polish Clean &amp; Shine</li>
            <li> product said works on plastic to bring shine never did thing on my plastic counter tops like said buy small bottle first to try befor you wast you money</li>
            <li> Novus #1 is what I take on the road trips to clean the plastic windshield on my Harley! Bugs galore after a day of riding has no chance against Novus #1. I ONLY use Novus products on my windshield. #2 &amp; #3 do a superior job with scratches. Some guys use furniture polish. Good luck with that!</li>
            <li> Works great, does not leave any streaks. Use it mainly on my motorcycle windshield and helmet shields, but also use it on my cars for cleaning the instrument gauges plastic cover.  I have used competing products, but prefer this brand.</li>
            <li> If the windshield is new use this every time it needs cleaning to keep it clear.  If it already has scratches use Novus #2 first, then #1 to polish it.  Works great!</li>
