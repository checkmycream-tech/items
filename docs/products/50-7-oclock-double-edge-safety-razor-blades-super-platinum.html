            <li>Try the ones you like best again.  </li>
            <li>These could be the best blades at their price point.</li>
            <li>They are so good perhaps you should buy some &amp;#34;wound seal power&amp;#34; to have on hand just in case.</li>
            <li>Quick shipping on a quality product!!!</li>
            <li>These blades work great for me, but you need to find the right blade for your own skin.  </li>
            <li>I have not at all nicked myself with them, but they deliver a very smooth shave.  </li>
            <li>Awesome smooth blade and pretty cheap.</li>
            <li>I did not think anything could be better than feather razors, but these are by a hair.  </li>
            <li>Just for reference I am using them with a Murker 23C and am quite satisfied.</li>
            <li>I am not joking it is surely a pre-Christmas miracle.</li>
            <li>Winning.</li>
            <li>I think these are a bit better</li>
            <li>I love these blades</li>
            <li>I nicked myself the first time I used them but then got quite used to the nice smooth shave they provide.</li>
            <li>I had been using Astra SP (considered a medium sharpness blade) in my 34C. Astras were smooth but didn&#x27;t give a close shave.</li>
            <li>Just a smooth, clean shave.  </li>
            <li>Get back to basics and enjoy healthy skin again!</li>
            <li>Gillette 7 o&#x27;clock super platinums as is pictured</li>
            <li>You&#x27;ll know which is right for you after that.</li>
            <li>But even with the extra sharpness (compared to Astra), they still felt fairly smooth, though not as smooth or forgiving as the Astra.</li>
            <li>In the end, these blades are an improvement compared to Astra SP, but requires good technique as these are less forgiving blades.</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>These are some of the better double edge blades I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li>Next to the Blue Gillette 7 O&#x27;Clock which are no longer made, these are simply the best.  </li>
            <li>Certainly they are not sharper,&lt;br /&gt;but</li>
            <li>Thanks.</li>
            <li>The extra sharpness will lead to a bit more irritation/nicks/cuts, but with proper technique, you will also be doing fewer passes to achieve a closer shave.</li>
            <li>This is not a complaint against the seller nor the blade.  </li>
            <li>These 7 O&#x27;clocks (from India) gave a much closer shave, most likely due to their sharpness.</li>
            <li>next as the price is much more reasonable and likely to have similar sharpness/smoothness performance.</li>
            <li>The black blades are fine, but they do have different characteristics.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended for a Double Edge shaving enthusiast.</li>

            <li> There are other 7 O&#x27; Clock blades that are worth trying, specifically the green box ones.</li>
            <li> and they last me 10-14 days each, shaving ~every other day with coarse hair.</li>
            <li> , you will receive the black box blades which are different.  </li>
            <li> I think I will try the Perma Sharp (Greens)</li>
            <li> They are sharp as heck!</li>
            <li> Where they are made matters, they are not the same, not necessarily better or worse but not the same.</li>
            <li> Took forever to get here and the blades and not as sharp as some other Gillette Platinum&#x27;s I have tried in the past.</li>
            <li> at least 5 shaves out of each blade with no problem.</li>
            <li> a bit on the expensive side</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think anyone can do wrong by trying them.</li>
            <li> There are subtle differences between them all, but none of them are bad.</li>

            <li> My father wanted these! He loves them! Thanks!</li>
            <li> I did not think anything could be better than feather razors, but these are by a hair.  Certainly they are not sharper,&lt;br /&gt;but they are a tad smoother.  I have not at all nicked myself with them, but they deliver a very smooth shave.  They&lt;br /&gt;are a bit on the expensive side but so are the Iridiums.  I don&#x27;t think anyone can do wrong by trying them. A 50 count&lt;br /&gt;order is about 23.99, so just go ahead and splurge on these one day.  You won&#x27;t regret it.</li>
            <li> Awesome smooth blade and pretty cheap. This will easily last me a year as I&#x27;ve been stretching at least 5 shaves out of each blade with no problem. They are sharp as heck! I nicked myself the first time I used them but then got quite used to the nice smooth shave they provide. Highly recommended for a Double Edge shaving enthusiast. Just for reference I am using them with a Murker 23C and am quite satisfied.</li>
            <li> No snags, no nicks.  Just a smooth, clean shave.  These blades work great for me, but you need to find the right blade for your own skin.  Get a sampler pack (you can find on Amazon).  Try out a dozen or so different blades.  Try the ones you like best again.  You&#x27;ll know which is right for you after that.</li>
            <li> ... Because I got the cigar. I would like to write a review for these but for the price of these I got 100 FEATHER HI-STAINLESS. I am not joking it is surely a pre-Christmas miracle. Hahahahahahahahahaha. Winning.</li>
            <li> I returned it when I found out it was NOT made in Russia. It was made in India. DID NOT like the misrepresentation.</li>
            <li> Quick shipping on a quality product!!!</li>
            <li> These are some of the better double edge blades I&#x27;ve tried. These could be the best blades at their price point. There are other 7 O&#x27; Clock blades that are worth trying, specifically the green box ones. There are subtle differences between them all, but none of them are bad.</li>
            <li> I had been using Astra SP (considered a medium sharpness blade) in my 34C. Astras were smooth but didn&#x27;t give a close shave. These 7 O&#x27;clocks (from India) gave a much closer shave, most likely due to their sharpness.

I think I will try the Perma Sharp (Greens) next as the price is much more reasonable and likely to have similar sharpness/smoothness performance.</li>
            <li> These are not the Russian blades as shown, these are the blades from India.  There are multiple complaints on here about this but Amazon doesn&#x27;t correct it.  Where they are made matters, they are not the same, not necessarily better or worse but not the same.</li>
            <li> These are Gillette Blacks, not Gillette Blues.  There is a difference.</li>
            <li> This is not a complaint against the seller nor the blade.  But it should be noted for those who are specifically looking for the blue box Gillette 7 o&#x27;clock super platinums as is pictured, you will receive the black box blades which are different.  The black blades are fine, but they do have different characteristics.</li>
            <li> I ordered a sampler pack of blades, and I was between these and the Treet Platinums. I think these are a bit better and they last me 10-14 days each, shaving ~every other day with coarse hair.</li>
            <li> Took forever to get here and the blades and not as sharp as some other Gillette Platinum&#x27;s I have tried in the past.</li>
            <li> Next to the Blue Gillette 7 O&#x27;Clock which are no longer made, these are simply the best.  I love these blades</li>
            <li> get rid of skin problems and stop paying $30-$50 for mega razor blades. Get back to basics and enjoy healthy skin again!</li>
            <li> They are so good perhaps you should buy some &amp;#34;wound seal power&amp;#34; to have on hand just in case. Thanks.</li>
