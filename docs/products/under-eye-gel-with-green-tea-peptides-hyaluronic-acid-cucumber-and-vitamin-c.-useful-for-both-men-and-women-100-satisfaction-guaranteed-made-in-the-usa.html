            <li>I receive this product on a discount/ free to review, I love this product it works wonders its amazing</li>
            <li>/&gt;.I received this product in exchange for a truthful and unbiased review.</li>
            <li>Though packed full with all these ingredients, the anti-aging serum feels lightweight and very refreshing when used during my skin care routine.</li>
            <li>I love this line of products.</li>
            <li>Love the label on this too -</li>
            <li>It doesnt leave a greasy residue and really feels great on.  </li>
            <li>The anti-aging serum wasn&#x27;t greasy, and it was easy to apply and smooth in around the eye area!</li>
            <li>It is important to me to stay very fit and take care of the body I have.</li>
            <li>Regarding fine lines, I have yet not seen any results, but the skin feels a lot more rested and the puffiness of the day gone.</li>
            <li>It absorbs very quickly, within 15-30 seconds, depending on the amount you use.</li>
            <li>It has a warm effect when I first apply it.</li>
            <li>It camouflaged my dark undereye circles perfectly!</li>
            <li>I was pleased to get notice that I would be receiving True Skin Care Anti-Aging Eye Gel with Vitamin C to review.  </li>
            <li>Made with some great ingredients that spas use like Aloe, Green Tea, Cucumber and Licorice Root as well as a boost from Hyaluronic Acid you are getting the best eye care possible without the cost :)  </li>
            <li>By using it twice a day; in the morning and at night, it will reduce the look of fine lines and wrinkles while reducing inflammation and brightening your complexion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>but it did soften fine lines almost immediately.  </li>
            <li>I have started to notice some reduction in fine lines and wrinkles around my eyes and mouth as well as improvement in the tightening of my skin.</li>
            <li>This bottle also comes with a 100% risk free guarantee, so your purchase is always protected - but I am sure that you will love this as much as I do!  </li>
            <li>It is probably a good product, but was too strong for my sensitive eye area.</li>
            <li>The cost per oz. is a fantastic value.</li>
            <li>It is perfect for men and women to get rid of those bags under their eyes and firm up the skin.</li>
            <li>I haven’t notice any difference with under eye circles, but to be honest I don’t have very visible ones</li>
            <li>This was given to me free to try and review.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a welcome addition to my daily routine.</li>
            <li>I got this free with promotion #trueskincareeyes</li>
            <li>So far so good.</li>
            <li>If you aren&#x27;t completely satisfied, you can contact True Skin Care and they will make things right for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>significantly reduce.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li>this one I use overnight before bed on a clean face</li>
            <li>The Soothing Eye Gel is made in the USA in True Skin Care&#x27;s  FDA Registered Facility</li>
            <li>I’ve used the True Skin Care Anti-Aging Eye Gel for a couple of weeks now</li>
            <li>I think the price on Amazon is reasonable for this cream, and I&#x27;ll be buying more.  </li>
            <li>True Skin Care</li>
            <li>so I can put it on cool</li>
            <li>I am a true believer in anti-wrinkle formulas.</li>
            <li>But the best surprise is that the cream has really de-puffed my eyelids, so that my eyes look much more open and younger.  </li>
            <li>It absorbs quickly with no sticky residue or buildup.</li>
            <li>, I can already notice there is less lines under my eye, it feels great</li>
            <li>I wish I would have known about this product sooner because I love my new fresh and awake look.</li>
            <li>Another great aspect of this product is that a little bit goes a loooong way.</li>
            <li>but after that I started to noticed the smaller lines kind of smoothing out.</li>
            <li>I am sure this product works for some people, but it has been completely ineffective for me.</li>
            <li>so it feels more soothing and cooling to the sensitive eye area.</li>
            <li>I got this product with a big discount to give my honest opinion</li>
            <li>I received a complimentary product to test.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this for a couple days now and so far, I&#x27;m in love with it.</li>
            <li>Receive the package right on time.</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t wait to continue to see positive results!</li>
            <li>The gel contains vitamin c which is believed to fight free radicals, aloe &amp; cucumber to soothe puffy eyes, hyaluronic acid for hydration, and most importantly peptides and green tea to reverse signs of aging.</li>
            <li>I wear contacts and my eyes are sensitive to any strong scent applied around it.  </li>
            <li>can actually say I really like this product, I have been using it in conjunction with their scrub treatment, and I&#x27;m loving the results.</li>
            <li>I like that very much.</li>
            <li>It hydrates the sensitive skin around your eyes to help reduce the fine lines and wrinkles.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The Soothing Eye Gel is risk free because True Skin Care prides themselves on being truly different from their competition.</li>
            <li>This has really helped!  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m still on my first tube</li>
            <li>Bought this product for my fiancé and she absolutely loves it!</li>
            <li>Really tightens up the eye area!  </li>
            <li>The first the catch my eye was the ingredients.</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>I use almost 2 month or may be more only waist my money</li>
            <li>I was skeotic at first</li>
            <li>I have tried many different eye products, but none really seemed to work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>As a result, I look more refreshed than I had been for a long time.  </li>
            <li>you get a clear bottle that shows off the sweet serum inside.  </li>
            <li>I would definitely recommend this brand if you&#x27;re looking for something more natural!</li>
            <li>I was told I had huge bags under my eyes and now people comment that they look much smaller.  </li>
            <li>It’s very cooling.</li>
            <li>so I didn’t expect much of a change.</li>
            <li>It’s very hydrating without leaving any residue.</li>
            <li>With the screen and it making some of my lines disappear my make up goes on much nicer and smoother looking because the wrinkles are disappearing.</li>
            <li>I really like this product.</li>
            <li>Nothing really happened after 30 days.</li>
            <li>I’ve actually tried a few different eye creams and gels and I haven’t really been impressed with any of them.</li>
            <li>I really like this eye serum and</li>
            <li>I would recommend this to anyone who wants to get that of those unwanted bags under their eyes.</li>
            <li>but after couple of minutes the feeling goes away, thank you so much for the opportunity to try this product</li>
            <li>The scrub is great but only for twice a weeks, leaves my skin powerless and super clean,</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this!</li>
            <li>It is safe for all skin types, even for those with extra sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I received the product at a heavily discounted/free from Amazon to give my honest opinion on it in a review.</li>
            <li>I normally don&#x27;t like to spend much, and this is definitely a higher end product</li>
            <li>Refreshing and clean feeling after a hard day at work.</li>
            <li>I was recently given the opportunity to try True Skin Care&#x27;s Soothing Eye Gel</li>
            <li>I have noticed that after using it my eyes look a little less puffy and it most definitely feels good.</li>
            <li>It is gentle on your skin while still being powerful enough to produce visible results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>but I was lucky enough to get it at a reduced price for a review and now I&#x27;m hooked.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>I love the little pump applicator, too, as well as the lack of a perfumy smell.</li>
            <li>And once you open it up from the box it is in a beautiful bottle that is a pump so it only applies a small amount</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had no negative reactions to this product.</li>
            <li>what i like most about it is the ingredients cucumber and aloe and green tea.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend giving this eye gel a try if you need improvement with dark circles, puffiness and fine lines and wrinkles.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m hoping for more noticeable results on the long run, but so far I can say i definitely recommend their products.</li>
            <li>True Skin Care is a family owned and operated company and their Soothing Eye Gel is made to hydrate and soothe the dry, sensitive skin around your eyes.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not saying WOW!</li>
            <li>Soothing Eye gel is a eye treatment that is natural!</li>
            <li>This cooling gel has made a significant difference on the dark circles</li>
            <li>I work so hard to keep my body healthy</li>
            <li>I also like that the ingredients are mostly natural.</li>
            <li>lots of this natural serum to be applied.</li>
            <li>I have noticed a marked improvement in my skin and under my eyes.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a 35 year old mom</li>
            <li>I have both sensitive skin and eyes</li>
            <li>It has no smell and is not messy.</li>
            <li>have never been much into skin creams and care, but I guess that as years are passing I now have a bigger need to do so and pay attention to the signs of aging in my skin, hahaha.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I consider myself an old school type of guy.</li>
            <li>My skin was dry to egin with so it worked very fast.</li>
            <li>I cleaned my face extremely well so that I could get a fresh start using the product.</li>
            <li>Now that I have tried it, and see that it will last a long time I will buy this again, it&#x27;s worth it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I am approaching those &amp;#34;middle-age&amp;#34; years and there are times that I look in the mirror and see a person that looks considerably older than I feel.</li>
            <li>This anti-aging eye gel, from True Skin Care, is truly a little miracle in a bottle.</li>
            <li>I look pretty rough a lot of days.</li>
            <li>did drop this one star because I haven&#x27;t seen any change to my fine lines around my eyes, but I&#x27;ve only used it for a few weeks</li>
            <li>However something new I have been experiencing recently is double bags.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t think I needed an eye gel since I consider myself to be young with healthy skin, however, people always used to tell me how tired I always looked while pointing at my eyes.  </li>
            <li>Up until this point, this particular eye gel has actually given me visible results within the first few weeks of using it.</li>
            <li>In general I find that cooling under eye gels tend to burn my eyes but this did not.</li>
            <li>so far, after using this product for the last 6 months, i see result, my eyebags has improved.</li>
            <li>and I also love how long this bottle will last me because a little dab goes a long way.  </li>
            <li>I have sensitive eyes, so I was concerned that this product might irritate my eye area, but it actually did just the opposite!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m leery about applying weird ingredients to my eye area, so I thought I&#x27;d try a more natural product.</li>
            <li>The gel is light and takes very little time to dry.  </li>
            <li>Who wants bags under their eyes or those wrinkles and dark spots?  </li>
            <li>you have dark circles under your eyes, True Skin Care&#x27;s Soothing Eye Gel can reduce them and make them less noticeable.</li>

            <li> /&gt;.I received this product in exchange for a truthful and unbiased review.</li>

            <li> I love this line of products.</li>
            <li> Love the label on this too -</li>
            <li> It doesnt leave a greasy residue and really feels great on.  </li>
            <li> The anti-aging serum wasn&#x27;t greasy, and it was easy to apply and smooth in around the eye area!</li>
            <li> It is important to me to stay very fit and take care of the body I have.</li>
            <li> Regarding fine lines, I have yet not seen any results, but the skin feels a lot more rested and the puffiness of the day gone.</li>
            <li> It absorbs very quickly, within 15-30 seconds, depending on the amount you use.</li>
            <li> It has a warm effect when I first apply it.</li>
            <li> It camouflaged my dark undereye circles perfectly!</li>
            <li> I was pleased to get notice that I would be receiving True Skin Care Anti-Aging Eye Gel with Vitamin C to review.  </li>
            <li> Made with some great ingredients that spas use like Aloe, Green Tea, Cucumber and Licorice Root as well as a boost from Hyaluronic Acid you are getting the best eye care possible without the cost :)  </li>
            <li> By using it twice a day; in the morning and at night, it will reduce the look of fine lines and wrinkles while reducing inflammation and brightening your complexion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> but it did soften fine lines almost immediately.  </li>
            <li> I have started to notice some reduction in fine lines and wrinkles around my eyes and mouth as well as improvement in the tightening of my skin.</li>
            <li> This bottle also comes with a 100% risk free guarantee, so your purchase is always protected - but I am sure that you will love this as much as I do!  </li>
            <li> It is probably a good product, but was too strong for my sensitive eye area.</li>
            <li> The cost per oz. is a fantastic value.</li>
            <li> It is perfect for men and women to get rid of those bags under their eyes and firm up the skin.</li>
            <li> I haven’t notice any difference with under eye circles, but to be honest I don’t have very visible ones</li>
            <li> This was given to me free to try and review.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a welcome addition to my daily routine.</li>
            <li> I got this free with promotion #trueskincareeyes</li>
            <li> So far so good.</li>
            <li> If you aren&#x27;t completely satisfied, you can contact True Skin Care and they will make things right for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> significantly reduce.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li> this one I use overnight before bed on a clean face</li>
            <li> The Soothing Eye Gel is made in the USA in True Skin Care&#x27;s  FDA Registered Facility</li>
            <li> I’ve used the True Skin Care Anti-Aging Eye Gel for a couple of weeks now</li>
            <li> I think the price on Amazon is reasonable for this cream, and I&#x27;ll be buying more.  </li>
            <li> True Skin Care</li>
            <li> so I can put it on cool</li>
            <li> I am a true believer in anti-wrinkle formulas.</li>
            <li> But the best surprise is that the cream has really de-puffed my eyelids, so that my eyes look much more open and younger.  </li>
            <li> It absorbs quickly with no sticky residue or buildup.</li>
            <li> , I can already notice there is less lines under my eye, it feels great</li>
            <li> I wish I would have known about this product sooner because I love my new fresh and awake look.</li>
            <li> Another great aspect of this product is that a little bit goes a loooong way.</li>
            <li> but after that I started to noticed the smaller lines kind of smoothing out.</li>
            <li> I am sure this product works for some people, but it has been completely ineffective for me.</li>
            <li> so it feels more soothing and cooling to the sensitive eye area.</li>
            <li> I got this product with a big discount to give my honest opinion</li>
            <li> I received a complimentary product to test.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for a couple days now and so far, I&#x27;m in love with it.</li>
            <li> Receive the package right on time.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t wait to continue to see positive results!</li>
            <li> The gel contains vitamin c which is believed to fight free radicals, aloe &amp; cucumber to soothe puffy eyes, hyaluronic acid for hydration, and most importantly peptides and green tea to reverse signs of aging.</li>
            <li> I wear contacts and my eyes are sensitive to any strong scent applied around it.  </li>
            <li> can actually say I really like this product, I have been using it in conjunction with their scrub treatment, and I&#x27;m loving the results.</li>
            <li> I like that very much.</li>
            <li> It hydrates the sensitive skin around your eyes to help reduce the fine lines and wrinkles.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The Soothing Eye Gel is risk free because True Skin Care prides themselves on being truly different from their competition.</li>
            <li> This has really helped!  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m still on my first tube</li>
            <li> Bought this product for my fiancé and she absolutely loves it!</li>
            <li> Really tightens up the eye area!  </li>
            <li> The first the catch my eye was the ingredients.</li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> I use almost 2 month or may be more only waist my money</li>
            <li> I was skeotic at first</li>
            <li> I have tried many different eye products, but none really seemed to work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> As a result, I look more refreshed than I had been for a long time.  </li>
            <li> you get a clear bottle that shows off the sweet serum inside.  </li>
            <li> I would definitely recommend this brand if you&#x27;re looking for something more natural!</li>
            <li> I was told I had huge bags under my eyes and now people comment that they look much smaller.  </li>
            <li> It’s very cooling.</li>
            <li> so I didn’t expect much of a change.</li>
            <li> It’s very hydrating without leaving any residue.</li>
            <li> With the screen and it making some of my lines disappear my make up goes on much nicer and smoother looking because the wrinkles are disappearing.</li>
            <li> I really like this product.</li>
            <li> Nothing really happened after 30 days.</li>
            <li> I’ve actually tried a few different eye creams and gels and I haven’t really been impressed with any of them.</li>
            <li> I really like this eye serum and</li>
            <li> I would recommend this to anyone who wants to get that of those unwanted bags under their eyes.</li>
            <li> but after couple of minutes the feeling goes away, thank you so much for the opportunity to try this product</li>
            <li> The scrub is great but only for twice a weeks, leaves my skin powerless and super clean,</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this!</li>
            <li> It is safe for all skin types, even for those with extra sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I received the product at a heavily discounted/free from Amazon to give my honest opinion on it in a review.</li>
            <li> I normally don&#x27;t like to spend much, and this is definitely a higher end product</li>
            <li> Refreshing and clean feeling after a hard day at work.</li>
            <li> I was recently given the opportunity to try True Skin Care&#x27;s Soothing Eye Gel</li>
            <li> I have noticed that after using it my eyes look a little less puffy and it most definitely feels good.</li>
            <li> It is gentle on your skin while still being powerful enough to produce visible results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> but I was lucky enough to get it at a reduced price for a review and now I&#x27;m hooked.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I love the little pump applicator, too, as well as the lack of a perfumy smell.</li>
            <li> And once you open it up from the box it is in a beautiful bottle that is a pump so it only applies a small amount</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had no negative reactions to this product.</li>
            <li> what i like most about it is the ingredients cucumber and aloe and green tea.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend giving this eye gel a try if you need improvement with dark circles, puffiness and fine lines and wrinkles.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m hoping for more noticeable results on the long run, but so far I can say i definitely recommend their products.</li>
            <li> True Skin Care is a family owned and operated company and their Soothing Eye Gel is made to hydrate and soothe the dry, sensitive skin around your eyes.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not saying WOW!</li>
            <li> Soothing Eye gel is a eye treatment that is natural!</li>
            <li> This cooling gel has made a significant difference on the dark circles</li>
            <li> I work so hard to keep my body healthy</li>
            <li> I also like that the ingredients are mostly natural.</li>
            <li> lots of this natural serum to be applied.</li>
            <li> I have noticed a marked improvement in my skin and under my eyes.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a 35 year old mom</li>
            <li> I have both sensitive skin and eyes</li>
            <li> It has no smell and is not messy.</li>
            <li> have never been much into skin creams and care, but I guess that as years are passing I now have a bigger need to do so and pay attention to the signs of aging in my skin, hahaha.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I consider myself an old school type of guy.</li>
            <li> My skin was dry to egin with so it worked very fast.</li>
            <li> I cleaned my face extremely well so that I could get a fresh start using the product.</li>
            <li> Now that I have tried it, and see that it will last a long time I will buy this again, it&#x27;s worth it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I am approaching those &amp;#34;middle-age&amp;#34; years and there are times that I look in the mirror and see a person that looks considerably older than I feel.</li>
            <li> This anti-aging eye gel, from True Skin Care, is truly a little miracle in a bottle.</li>
            <li> I look pretty rough a lot of days.</li>
            <li> did drop this one star because I haven&#x27;t seen any change to my fine lines around my eyes, but I&#x27;ve only used it for a few weeks</li>
            <li> However something new I have been experiencing recently is double bags.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t think I needed an eye gel since I consider myself to be young with healthy skin, however, people always used to tell me how tired I always looked while pointing at my eyes.  </li>
            <li> Up until this point, this particular eye gel has actually given me visible results within the first few weeks of using it.</li>
            <li> In general I find that cooling under eye gels tend to burn my eyes but this did not.</li>
            <li> so far, after using this product for the last 6 months, i see result, my eyebags has improved.</li>
            <li> and I also love how long this bottle will last me because a little dab goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> I have sensitive eyes, so I was concerned that this product might irritate my eye area, but it actually did just the opposite!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m leery about applying weird ingredients to my eye area, so I thought I&#x27;d try a more natural product.</li>
            <li> The gel is light and takes very little time to dry.  </li>
            <li> Who wants bags under their eyes or those wrinkles and dark spots?  </li>
            <li> you have dark circles under your eyes, True Skin Care&#x27;s Soothing Eye Gel can reduce them and make them less noticeable.</li>
            <li> I have had dark circles and puffiness under my eyes since I was very young.</li>
            <li> I noticed  that the tiny wrinkles near my outer eyes lessened with use of this product and that my dark circles lessened, too.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve bought many of the high department store products they were quite expensive and this product works as well if not better.</li>
            <li> Even though I&#x27;m in my twenties, I&#x27;m always looking for an under eye serum to combat my early signs of wrinkles and dark circles.</li>
            <li> The bottle will last a long time.</li>
            <li> The first couple days it was slow going</li>
            <li> My main goal was to get rid of darkness under my eyes and also reduce puffiness -- things that make you look old and tired.  </li>
            <li> It hasn&#x27;t been long since I started using it</li>
            <li> The larger lines were actually getting less noticeable.</li>
            <li> The gel quickly absorbs into my skin and does not leave a sticky feeling like creams can, or a weird dry second skin feeling like some gels can.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I received this for testing purposes, and it definitely helps my dark under-eye circles.</li>
            <li> I would definitely recommend this product to anyone with dark circles under their eyes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve been using it every single morning for over 7 months!</li>
            <li> You only need a very small amount of this gel, so the bottle will last you for a long time.</li>
            <li> It gives a little tingle after I deep cleanse my face, which makes me know that it&#x27;s working.</li>
            <li> They are not completely gone, but they are lighter and less noticeable now.  </li>
            <li> I have only been using it a few weeks and can&#x27;t wait to see if it will help those dark circles I have.</li>
            <li> I bought it mainly to moisturize my eye area and prevent premature aging, so I wasn&#x27;t expecting to see a lot of improvement; however, I slept very poorly one night &amp; applied the gel the next day before work-</li>
            <li> Whether it comes in the shape of creams, gels, or paste is of little importance to me as long as it does what it promises to do.</li>
            <li> I concluded that it was largely due to the dark rings under my eyes.</li>
            <li> The skin under my eyes feels tighter, and the dark circles even look like they are improving.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for an eye serum/gel that addresses the dark circles around my eyes.</li>
            <li> After using this for about a month, I can see that the dark hues under my eyes have diminished.</li>
            <li> and I always have dark bags under my eyes in the morning.</li>
            <li> However, it has done nothing for my dark circles.</li>
            <li> I have not had any negative reactions to this gel, actually the gel cools and soothes my eyes.</li>
            <li> Not worth the $.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this eye gel for about a week, &amp;#34;it works&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;Puffy Eyes and Dark circles:</li>
            <li> This cream has helped a lot with the dark circles.  </li>
            <li> It combats the aging of skin and puts an end to the dark circles and puffiness under your eyes.</li>
            <li> I always have issues with dark circles under my eyes.  </li>
            <li> I knew years of dark circles under my eyes</li>
            <li> Also since you need to use very little this bottle though small will last you awhile if you just use it around your eyes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> but It looks like I have two black eyes,</li>
            <li> dark area a little lighter.  </li>
            <li> This product took a little bit to work on my dark circles-about 4 days</li>
            <li> Skin Care&#x27;s Soothing Eye Gel is made with ingredients like Cucumber, Green Tea, Aloe and Vitamin C to reduce puffiness, dark circles and wrinkles.</li>
            <li> it feels tight when you put it on</li>
            <li> I was tired of looking in the mirror and only noticing dark circles.</li>
            <li> It took me a little while before deciding to use it.  </li>
            <li> I have used Mary Kay&#x27;s before but wasn&#x27;t a fan of the little pot and its messiness.</li>
            <li> Now I don&#x27;t have to worry about triggering my migraines while trying to prevent wrinkles, dark circles, and puffiness!</li>
            <li> just put a little dot of gel on my finger tip and massage around my eye area.  </li>
            <li> It burned a little and caused some temporary redness in a few areas.</li>
            <li> so you don&#x27;t waste any of the product.</li>
            <li> I take a few minutes to eat breakfast</li>
            <li> so I have to be especially careful with what products I use on and around the eyes.</li>
            <li> I would never find an overnight solution but just in a few days I could see the difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not really huge</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the beginning of the school year, and as a teacher, these are long exhausting days with little sleep.  </li>
            <li> I would recommend this serum to anyone who needs a little eye-lift!</li>
            <li> Almost forgot- the container looks small, but a little dab will do ya!  </li>
            <li> I usually get when I put serum under my eyes since the skin on that part is thinner.</li>
            <li> A small dab on ring finger and massage into the targeted spots snd</li>
            <li> Made of up cucumber, aloe and green tea!</li>
            <li> ThIs skin cares helps with my dark, puffy, tired eyes and helps me feel refreshed.</li>
            <li> a single person say I looked tired!  </li>
            <li> I have little girl that likes to keep me up at night, so I always look exhausted.</li>
            <li> I have finally decided that I will just forever have my horrible bags under my eyes due to lack of sleep and allergies combined.</li>
            <li> Weird, didn’t even know it was possible and it looks horrible!</li>
            <li> sorry just does not work for me.  </li>
            <li> I have to use it above and below the eye because my eyes are so horrible.</li>
            <li> it is crazy how the darkness has started to fade away.  </li>
            <li> Allergies are part of the reason why my under eye bags are so bad, and now with anxiety and insomnia</li>
            <li> I am really disappointed.</li>
            <li> Also, you know how some under-eye serums, or even face ones have an awful perfumey smell?</li>
            <li> My undereye bags are terrible, and they have been since I was about 12, I am 32 now</li>

            <li> I love this serum. I have been using it constantly for a month. It is lightweight and moisturizing. I can put my makeup over it without worrying that it will shift throughout the day. The cost per oz. is a fantastic value. I highly recommend it.</li>

            <li> This anti-aging eye gel, from True Skin Care, is truly a little miracle in a bottle. I have had dark circles and puffiness under my eyes since I was very young. I have tried many different eye products, but none really seemed to work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  This wonderful soothing gel goes on very smooth and light. It absorbs very quickly, within 15-30 seconds, depending on the amount you use. You only need a very small amount of this gel, so the bottle will last you for a long time. I have sensitive eyes, so I was concerned that this product might irritate my eye area, but it actually did just the opposite! It feels nice going on and after using it. The skin under my eyes feels tighter, and the dark circles even look like they are improving. It also helps with puffiness. It hydrates the sensitive skin around your eyes to help reduce the fine lines and wrinkles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  I highly recommend giving this eye gel a try if you need improvement with dark circles, puffiness and fine lines and wrinkles. So happy I got to try this in exchange for a review.</li>
            <li> I have been using this for over 3 months now, have not seen any difference at all.</li>
            <li> Works well at helping you look awake even when you don&#x27;t feel awake - absorbs well and feels nice on your skin.  A good product for your eyes.</li>
            <li> I’ve used the True Skin Care Anti-Aging Eye Gel for a couple of weeks now and I like it. It’s a soothing and cooling eye gel that is supposed to also help with under eye circles and help with anti-aging. I have noticed that after using it my eyes look a little less puffy and it most definitely feels good. It’s very cooling. I haven’t notice any difference with under eye circles, but to be honest I don’t have very visible ones so I didn’t expect much of a change. It’s very hydrating without leaving any residue. I like this under eye gel. In general I find that cooling under eye gels tend to burn my eyes but this did not. I like that very much.</li>
            <li> It is probably a good product, but was too strong for my sensitive eye area. It burned a little and caused some temporary redness in a few areas. Won&#x27;t be buying it again.</li>
            <li> The serum is like a gel. It has a warm effect when I first apply it. It wasn&#x27;t sticky at all. It doesn&#x27;t leave your eyes shiny so you can wear it when during the day. It hasn&#x27;t been long since I started using it but I can tell there&#x27;s a difference. It&#x27;s not really huge but I can tell that something is going on. I love this serum it doesn&#x27;t have a stingy feel I usually get when I put serum under my eyes since the skin on that part is thinner. I also like that the ingredients are mostly natural. I use this every morning and before I go to bed. So far so good. I received this for a discounted price in exchange of my unbiased and honest review.</li>
            <li> gave this as a gift to my mother-in-law and she loves it.</li>
            <li> Receive the package right on time. The product itself comes in a nice box. And once you open it up from the box it is in a beautiful bottle that is a pump so it only applies a small amount so you don&#x27;t waste any of the product. I took five days to use the cream and I used it three. Morning, afternoon and evening.  The first couple days it was slow going but after that I started to noticed the smaller lines kind of smoothing out. The larger lines were actually getting less noticeable. I will use this product continuously. As it seems to be working well.  With the screen and it making some of my lines disappear my make up goes on much nicer and smoother looking because the wrinkles are disappearing. I&#x27;ve bought many of the high department store products they were quite expensive and this product works as well if not better. Before actually using I  I cleaned my face extremely well so that I could get a fresh start using the product. I myself like the product and believe in the product. And I will continue using it.  I received the product at a heavily discounted/free from Amazon to give my honest opinion on it in a review.</li>
            <li> This was given to me free to try and review. I&#x27;ve been looking for an eye serum/gel that addresses the dark circles around my eyes. This seems to be the one sofar to show some iimprovement.&lt;br /&gt;There&#x27;s no need for lots of this natural serum to be applied. A small dab on ring finger and massage into the targeted spots snd you&#x27;re done.&lt;br /&gt; It absorbs quickly with no sticky residue or buildup. Give it a try and see the difference.</li>
            <li> I have been using this along with the moisturizer and I love them both. I have noticed a marked improvement in my skin and under my eyes. I have little girl that likes to keep me up at night, so I always look exhausted. This has really helped!  I never thought to try it but I was lucky enough to get it at a reduced price for a review and now I&#x27;m hooked.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the beginning of the school year, and as a teacher, these are long exhausting days with little sleep.  ThIs skin cares helps with my dark, puffy, tired eyes and helps me feel refreshed.</li>
            <li> This cooling gel has made a significant difference on the dark circles I was always use to seeing throughout the day. After using this for about a month, I can see that the dark hues under my eyes have diminished. I put this on every morning and every night and have been using it for more than a month.  I was tired of looking in the mirror and only noticing dark circles. The serum has definitely helped. I don’t need to chalk on concealer to try to hide anything because there isn’t anything to hide anymore. I wish I would have known about this product sooner because I love my new fresh and awake look.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for several months now and I am hooked! I&#x27;m a 35 year old mom and I always have dark bags under my eyes in the morning. But this product has been great at lightening up the darkness under my eyes and tightening those bags. It has a great cooling effect too that is very soothing and helps to rejuvenate me. Another great aspect of this product is that a little bit goes a loooong way. I&#x27;m still on my first tube and I&#x27;ve been using it every single morning for over 7 months! I would recommend this serum to anyone who needs a little eye-lift!</li>
            <li> I really like this product. I used in the mornings after I take a shower and it really perks up my skin and feels great!</li>
            <li> Great, inexpensive eye serum</li>
            <li> Bought this product for my fiancé and she absolutely loves it!</li>
            <li> I could tell the difference when I used it versus when I didn&#x27;t use it! I know that Vitamin C is an antioxidant, and that it can help with the skin. I noticed  that the tiny wrinkles near my outer eyes lessened with use of this product and that my dark circles lessened, too. The anti-aging serum wasn&#x27;t greasy, and it was easy to apply and smooth in around the eye area!</li>
            <li> I received this product as a gift having never heard of it or used it before. It took me a little while before deciding to use it.  Oh, but when I did... it was awesome!  I love the container (as cheesy as that sounds).  It is great for traveling, because it&#x27;s under 3 oz and it&#x27;s a pump applicator but has a solid cap so it won&#x27;t leak all over the rest of my luggage.  The product itself has a great texture, very smooth and feels great going on your skin.  I didn&#x27;t think I needed an eye gel since I consider myself to be young with healthy skin, however, people always used to tell me how tired I always looked while pointing at my eyes.  Since I have been using the product (I figured what the heck, I already had it and it felt nice) I have not had a single person say I looked tired!  Coincidence, maybe, but I&#x27;m going to keep using it and tell my good friends to try it too! - Written by James&#x27; wife    Almost forgot- the container looks small, but a little dab will do ya!  This product will last-great investment.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m leery about applying weird ingredients to my eye area, so I thought I&#x27;d try a more natural product. It feels great! I love the little pump applicator, too, as well as the lack of a perfumy smell. I bought it mainly to moisturize my eye area and prevent premature aging, so I wasn&#x27;t expecting to see a lot of improvement; however, I slept very poorly one night &amp; applied the gel the next day before work- It camouflaged my dark undereye circles perfectly! I have used Mary Kay&#x27;s before but wasn&#x27;t a fan of the little pot and its messiness. I would definitely recommend this brand if you&#x27;re looking for something more natural!</li>
            <li> Really tightens up the eye area!  A great soother for when you have a not-so-good night.</li>
            <li> given as a gift to a loved one and they love it and look forward to getting more.</li>
            <li> I have used this item for 2+ weeks with no change in the circles under my eyes at all.  I am hoping the seller&#x27;s guarantee for customer satisfaction comes through as I try to get a refund.  I am sure this product works for some people, but it has been completely ineffective for me.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not saying WOW! Nothing really happened after 30 days. Will keep searching for the product that works.</li>
            <li> This eye cream has a nice texture. However, it has done nothing for my dark circles. I will move on to another product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had no negative reactions to this product. It&#x27;s a welcome addition to my daily routine.</li>
            <li> I’ve actually tried a few different eye creams and gels and I haven’t really been impressed with any of them. Up until this point, this particular eye gel has actually given me visible results within the first few weeks of using it. I got this eye gel for free to try and review; regardless this is my 100% honest opinion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The results that I have seen have been with the bags under my eyes. I have finally decided that I will just forever have my horrible bags under my eyes due to lack of sleep and allergies combined. I know that they are definitely a visible symptom of allergies; per several different Drs. However something new I have been experiencing recently is double bags. I get these slightly smaller but definitely noticeable bags on the permanent ones. Weird, didn’t even know it was possible and it looks horrible! I shower and when I get out I put this eye gel around my eyes including below on my “double bags”. I take a few minutes to eat breakfast and when I come back to do my hair the second bags are gone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also like how this is a gel and not cream so it feels more soothing and cooling to the sensitive eye area. I have both sensitive skin and eyes so I have to be especially careful with what products I use on and around the eyes. I have not had any negative reactions to this gel, actually the gel cools and soothes my eyes. The gel quickly absorbs into my skin and does not leave a sticky feeling like creams can, or a weird dry second skin feeling like some gels can.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did drop this one star because I haven&#x27;t seen any change to my fine lines around my eyes, but I&#x27;ve only used it for a few weeks so it may need more time to see a more visible improvement. Because I do see it helping with puffy eyes and bags I will continue to use it for even just that alone. Also since you need to use very little this bottle though small will last you awhile if you just use it around your eyes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;#trueskincareeyes</li>
            <li> I believed all the great reviews....sorry just does not work for me.  Not worth the $.</li>
            <li> I really like this eye serum and what i like most about it is the ingredients cucumber and aloe and green tea. The first the catch my eye was the ingredients. ..i saw the difference in my eye it give them a younger look. I got this product with a big discount to give my honest opinion</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this eye gel for about a week, &amp;#34;it works&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;Puffy Eyes and Dark circles: significantly reduce.&lt;br /&gt;The bottom line: &amp;#34;I will be buying again!&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> Refreshing and clean feeling after a hard day at work. Can&#x27;t wait to continue to see positive results!</li>
            <li> I Love the way this feels.  Definitely is a must to have!</li>
            <li> I am really disappointed. ... I read the reviews before my purchase... it&#x27;s been almost 3 weeks now.... not a noticeable difference at all...circles still there..puffiness still there... dark area a little lighter.  I&#x27;m going to give it a couple more weeks...hoping for the best.</li>
            <li> so far, after using this product for the last 6 months, i see result, my eyebags has improved.</li>
            <li> I decided to try this product after reading all the good reviews, and I am very happy after about one month of use.  My main goal was to get rid of darkness under my eyes and also reduce puffiness -- things that make you look old and tired.  This cream has helped a lot with the dark circles.  They are not completely gone, but they are lighter and less noticeable now.  But the best surprise is that the cream has really de-puffed my eyelids, so that my eyes look much more open and younger.  As a result, I look more refreshed than I had been for a long time.  I think the price on Amazon is reasonable for this cream, and I&#x27;ll be buying more.  Great product!</li>
            <li> This product feels great on your skin! For a guy, best of all, it&#x27;s fragrance free.</li>
            <li> I feel this product does help with making the skin under your eyes smoother. It also helps with puffiness. I have only been using it a few weeks and can&#x27;t wait to see if it will help those dark circles I have. I did receive this item to review, but I give my 100% honest opinion. Thanks!</li>
            <li> True Skin Care Soothing Eye gel is a eye treatment that is natural! Made of up cucumber, aloe and green tea! I really liked it. It has no smell and is not messy. Even my husband could use it! Lol! It combats the aging of skin and puts an end to the dark circles and puffiness under your eyes. Very cool product! Loved reviewing it! :)</li>
            <li> I received this for testing purposes, and it definitely helps my dark under-eye circles. It brightens my eyes, and makes them look so much better! Also, you know how some under-eye serums, or even face ones have an awful perfumey smell? This one doesn&#x27;t.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The fact it has no smell makes me VERY happy! Now I don&#x27;t have to worry about triggering my migraines while trying to prevent wrinkles, dark circles, and puffiness!</li>
            <li> Really great product, lots of powerful anti aging ingredients, my new favorite eye serum!!</li>
            <li> I keep this in the fridge so I can put it on cool, it is so refreshing. My undereye bags are terrible, and they have been since I was about 12, I am 32 now but It looks like I have two black eyes, or it did before using this. Allergies are part of the reason why my under eye bags are so bad, and now with anxiety and insomnia I look pretty rough a lot of days. This makes me look so much better, which makes me feel better. The bottle will last a long time. I normally don&#x27;t like to spend much, and this is definitely a higher end product, I got to try it at a discount to give an unbiased review on my blog and I wanted to review it here as well. Now that I have tried it, and see that it will last a long time I will buy this again, it&#x27;s worth it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would say this bottle will probably last me 6 months with me using it twice a day. I have to use it above and below the eye because my eyes are so horrible.</li>
            <li> No difference at all nothing waist my money I use almost 2 month or may be more only waist my money</li>
            <li> This is a great product that works well. I would recommend this to anyone who wants to get that of those unwanted bags under their eyes. I also had an issue dealing with shipping and the seller was very pleasant and easy to deal with to get things straightened out.</li>
            <li> This is a great product.  I was told I had huge bags under my eyes and now people comment that they look much smaller.  Getting better all the time&lt;br /&gt;Thanks</li>
            <li> I receive this product on a discount/ free to review, I love this product it works wonders its amazing, I can already notice there is less lines under my eye, it feels great it feels tight when you put it on but after couple of minutes the feeling goes away, thank you so much for the opportunity to try this product</li>
            <li> I was pleased to get notice that I would be receiving True Skin Care Anti-Aging Eye Gel with Vitamin C to review.  I always have issues with dark circles under my eyes.  I thought using this Eye Gel would take some time to show improvement around my eyes but I was truly amazed by the quickness of its results.  I have been using for about 2 weeks and it is crazy how the darkness has started to fade away.  I knew years of dark circles under my eyes I would never find an overnight solution but just in a few days I could see the difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I just put a little dot of gel on my finger tip and massage around my eye area.  It doesn’t have a scent which is great for me.  I wear contacts and my eyes are sensitive to any strong scent applied around it.  The gel is light and takes very little time to dry.  I would definitely recommend this product to anyone with dark circles under their eyes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;.I received this product in exchange for a truthful and unbiased review. My opinions and all thoughts reflected in this evaluation are solely my own.</li>
            <li> This product took a little bit to work on my dark circles-about 4 days but it did soften fine lines almost immediately.  My skin was dry to egin with so it worked very fast. I got this free with promotion #trueskincareeyes</li>
            <li> I am a true believer in anti-wrinkle formulas. Whether it comes in the shape of creams, gels, or paste is of little importance to me as long as it does what it promises to do. The gel contains vitamin c which is believed to fight free radicals, aloe &amp; cucumber to soothe puffy eyes, hyaluronic acid for hydration, and most importantly peptides and green tea to reverse signs of aging. Though packed full with all these ingredients, the anti-aging serum feels lightweight and very refreshing when used during my skin care routine. I have started to notice some reduction in fine lines and wrinkles around my eyes and mouth as well as improvement in the tightening of my skin. #trueskincareeyes</li>
            <li> I love this line of products. I was given this product to try in exchange of a non biased review.&lt;br /&gt;I have never been much into skin creams and care, but I guess that as years are passing I now have a bigger need to do so and pay attention to the signs of aging in my skin, hahaha.&lt;br /&gt;I can actually say I really like this product, I have been using it in conjunction with their scrub treatment, and I&#x27;m loving the results. The scrub is great but only for twice a weeks, leaves my skin powerless and super clean, this one I use overnight before bed on a clean face and I wake up so refreshed. Regarding fine lines, I have yet not seen any results, but the skin feels a lot more rested and the puffiness of the day gone. I&#x27;m hoping for more noticeable results on the long run, but so far I can say i definitely recommend their products.</li>
            <li> I was hesitant to try this product because of the type of guy I am. I consider myself an old school type of guy. A hunter, fisherman, survivalist...It is important to me to stay very fit and take care of the body I have. I am approaching those &amp;#34;middle-age&amp;#34; years and there are times that I look in the mirror and see a person that looks considerably older than I feel. I concluded that it was largely due to the dark rings under my eyes. I work so hard to keep my body healthy, I thought why not try something that could help me look the age that I feel. I asked my wife if I could just try hers before I purchased my own. I am sold on it.  I still feel weird about using it, but I sure like the results.</li>
            <li> Great product and I would highly recommend this!</li>
            <li> I has been a month and I could not see the effect.</li>
            <li> Who wants bags under their eyes or those wrinkles and dark spots?  No hands?  Me neither.  True Skin Care has come up with a great solution for abolishing all of those nasties!  Made with some great ingredients that spas use like Aloe, Green Tea, Cucumber and Licorice Root as well as a boost from Hyaluronic Acid you are getting the best eye care possible without the cost :)  This is a wonderful serum that is nice and smooth and leaves your skin feeling silky smooth and refreshed.  Love the label on this too - you get a clear bottle that shows off the sweet serum inside.  This bottle also comes with a 100% risk free guarantee, so your purchase is always protected - but I am sure that you will love this as much as I do!  I received a complimentary product to test.</li>
            <li> This stuff is great.  I a male and came across this oroduct on Amazon.  I was skeotic at first but it only took a week to see some results under my eyes.  It doesnt leave a greasy residue and really feels great on.  I will be buying this again and I also love how long this bottle will last me because a little dab goes a long way.  Great customer service too.</li>
            <li> Even though I&#x27;m in my twenties, I&#x27;m always looking for an under eye serum to combat my early signs of wrinkles and dark circles. I&#x27;ve been using this for a couple days now and so far, I&#x27;m in love with it. It gives a little tingle after I deep cleanse my face, which makes me know that it&#x27;s working.</li>
