    <ol>
            <li>Wonderful product.</li>
            <li>Best shampoo I&#x27;ve ever used.  </li>
            <li>This shampoo is a wonderful gem from the drugstore!</li>
            <li>and I must admit her hair looks great.  </li>
            <li>Great product, tried it on vacation and loved it.</li>
            <li>Loved the product&#x27;s scent and how it worked in my curly hair with the matching conditioner...</li>
            <li>I was very pleased with the results.  </li>
            <li>I love this product originally found it in a health food store and then was very happy to find it on Amazon</li>
            <li>I sure hope Giovanni continues making this one and does not change the ingredients!</li>
            <li>it is so very nice to be able to sit on my couch and have my favorite things delivered to my home.</li>
            <li>so I searched for months to find a cheaper, suitable replacement.</li>
            <li>Very good for curly hair, which is more brittle than straight.  </li>
            <li>The smell is fine, nothing offensive but nothing spectacular either.</li>
            <li>I really love this shampoo.  </li>
            <li>And the ingredients are safe.  </li>
            <li>Both me and my girlfriend love this shampoo.  </li>
            <li>Most shampoos strip my hair but this doesn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li>It felt very clean and looked shiny.  </li>
            <li>wonderful shampoo for really dry hair.  </li>
            <li>i have fine wavy long hair and this stuff is the best without making my hair greasy but keeping it moisturized, shiny and smooth!</li>
            <li>She had been spending quite a bit more for other products and we were both very happy to find this one.</li>
            <li>Very good for gray hair, same problem.  </li>
            <li>It makes my hair super smooth and it feel really healthy after I use it.  </li>
            <li>Did I mention it smells fantastic?  </li>
            <li>Saw it available on Amazon.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s important to me that my shampoo cleans my scalp and moisturizes my hair.</li>
            <li>This stuff is fabulous for anyone with hyper sensitive skin and needs a good shampoo for itchy scalp too.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t even feel like it gets my hair clean.</li>
            <li>I have always had a hard time with finding hair care products for my hair but this is PERFECT!!!!</li>
            <li>(to my surprise and dismay!)&lt;br /&gt;I was looking for a good alternative to Pantene because my hairdresser had informed me pantene contains the same ingredients as floor wax (yuk)</li>
            <li>its not a bad product for your hair if you can deal with the smell.</li>
            <li>Other than that, I&#x27;ve used the shampoo before, and it&#x27;s a great product.</li>
            <li>It lathers well and doesn&#x27;t take much to get the hair clean!</li>
            <li>I have thick wavy brown scottish heritage hair, it&#x27;s not course... - this product (shampoo and conditioner) sounded great like it was going to make my hair super sleek</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t produce a whole lot of lather and it rinses out quickly.</li>
            <li>It also comes in a larger pump bottle (more cost affordable per ounce).</li>
            <li>Straight argan oil to damp hair after a shower is useful for me.</li>
            <li>First I thought it may have been stress, but then I tried giving my hair a break from the 2chic shampoo and conditioner and trying something else</li>
            <li>Giovanni is clearly doing a great job at green washing their products.</li>
            <li>I specifically love this shampoo because it is one of the few shampoos I can use that doesn&#x27;t cause any breakout and keeps my scalp itch free for 24 hours.</li>
            <li>I was reluctant at first as I was becoming discouraged, but decided that one more (after buying four other shampoos in last 6 months) wouldn&#x27;t hurt.  </li>
            <li>I have shoulder length, bleached straight hair.</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t really that fond of it for that reason.</li>
            <li>There are a few others I can use that could do the job as well, but they don&#x27;t leave my hair as nice as this one does.</li>
            <li>Fluffy, kind of rough.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I do still color my hair with a dye containing ammonia, but as far as I can tell, my hair is still healthy and is definitely still shiny after a month of using this.</li>
            <li>This shampoo smelled very nice but was very drying and felt as if it made the hair too thin</li>
            <li>This shampoo left my scalp clean, but really tangled and stripped my hair.</li>
            <li>Another bonus is the beautiful, subtle fragrance is head and shoulders above BdF or any other shampoo&#x27;s overwhelming chemical</li>
            <li>At first I was pleasantly surprised and amazed at the results.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been searching for a good moisturizing shampoo that is sulfate free, with no parabens, silicones, artificial fragrances or PEG&#x27;s....</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve stopped using them and have been using regular Pantene and my scalp is back to healthy.</li>
            <li>I found my hair to actually be quite UNsleek, rather kind of rough and frizzy!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had better results with other natural shampoos/conditioners.  </li>
            <li>Make the switch - spend a little more money on a high-quality product like this and know that you aren&#x27;t putting anything toxic on your scalp and skin.  </li>
            <li>When I found this Giovanni 2Chic shampoo I couldn&#x27;t believe it; Not only does this shampoo feel and work exactly like Bain de Force in my hair, but it does so for a quarter of the price!</li>
            <li>My hair is normally normal to oily.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried far more expensive shampoos in an effort to calm down my oddly textured hair, but this one is the best so far.</li>
            <li>the plus side, my hair is easy to brush after washing and isn&#x27;t all dried out after blow-drying.</li>
            <li>My hair is shiny, soft, and</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m surprised at the reviews that say it causes breakouts or itchy scalp.</li>
            <li>Certainly far from sleek.  </li>
            <li>I was looking for a shampoo that would leave some natural moisture in my hair but still allow me to go a couple of days between shampoos, so I thought I would try this.</li>
            <li>After having frizzy hair my entire post-pubescent life, I finally found a product that left me hair smooth.</li>
            <li>Even after sweating the hair near my forehead didn&#x27;t frizz or curl up.</li>
            <li>After a week of use, my entire back and face is breaking out and scalp is very itchy.</li>
            <li>I picked this up one day because my regular natural shampoo and conditioner were not in stock.</li>
            <li>This product should be clearly labeled as a shampoo for severely dry, parched, or damaged hair -- definitely NOT for all hair types.</li>
            <li>My hair is fine, meaning each strand of hair is thin and fragile, but has varying degrees of curl/frizz throughout and some coarse areas.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> I color my hair and it tends to get dry unless I condition heavily, which can weigh it down because it&#x27;s fine.</li>
            <li> The experience I&#x27;ve had with vegan and vegetarian shampoos/conditioners is that they caused dry rot just like a typical shampoo bought at the store; the only reason I even tried another quasi-ethical hair product was because my hair was short and therefore not in as much danger of being damaged.  </li>
            <li> your hair is picky, dry or sensitive and your wallet needing a little R&amp;R, do yourself a favor and give this impressive shampoo a try, I have a feeling you won&#x27;t be disappointed!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve made haircuts last three times as long without split ends using this and the matching conditioner.</li>
            <li> As my hair is quite long, dry and even a little damaged I have had to spend more money than I would like to admit on hair care over the past few years.</li>
            <li> I did not enjoy that route and wanted to use my old favorites.</li>
            <li> --I might still have the same problem as I had with other vegan/vegetarian products and see dry rot.</li>
            <li> It made my hair feel dry and like straw.  </li>
            <li> After I had to cut my hair off, I went back to trying to find the most ethical shampoo and conditioner I could (had tried it with long hair with horrible results).</li>
            <li> Got a few wet hair water drops on a piece of wooden furniture after showering and the water dropled had discolored the stain of the wood!</li>
            <li> My hair is really wild and it has helped tame it a little.  </li>
            <li> so I was stoked about a natural \\&quot;skeekening\\&quot; product... that said after even several usages, even rinsing out the conditioner with cold water, my hair seemed surprisingly less soft/smooth than normal.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Enough so that I&#x27;m actually making an effort to post a review, which I usually don&#x27;t.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I looked into this shampoo due to the argan oil.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used other organic shampoos that did not tangle or strip my hair.</li>
            <li> It was a soft, weird type of dandruff that would fall in big chunks on my shoulders.</li>
            <li> However, after using it a few weeks I&#x27;ve noticed my scalp is dry</li>
            <li> My hair looked fine, but towards the end of the day I would get really bad dandruff.</li>
            <li> My hair felt moisterized but not weighed down.  </li>
            <li> When I received this shampoo it had been tightly wrapped up in a shipping bag with packing tape to keep it from leaking everywhere.</li>
            <li> I wll find something that spells a little nicer to use.</li>
            <li> A few years ago I was a Giovanni customer through and through.</li>
            <li> And that&#x27;s when I started having trouble.</li>
            <li> Plus it was very hard to comb through while wet.  </li>
            <li> There are words on the ingredient list that are not safe.</li>
            <li> To top it off, my face is breaking out horribly.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Giovanni conditioners in the past but never the shampoos.  </li>
            <li> Not sure which applies here, but something must.</li>
            <li> and that&#x27;s when I noticed that when I would use other shampoos for a couple of days, I wouldn&#x27;t get the weird dandruff.</li>
            <li> I am not some oily teenager, so it&#x27;s frustrating to have this happen.</li>
            <li> It was expensive.</li>
            <li> My hero product, Bain de Force by Kerastase is incredibly expensive</li>
            <li> But it still looks dirty.</li>
            <li> But this didn&#x27;t do it for me :(</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never been so disappointed in shampoo and conditioner.</li>
            <li> I am disappointed that I bought this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> &quot; I highlight my hair and hate using conditioners because they make my hair greasy.</li>
            <li> It was a bit nasty.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> This shampoo smelled very nice but was very drying and felt as if it made the hair too thin</li>
            <li> I really love this shampoo.  It makes my hair super smooth and it feel really healthy after I use it.  The smell is fine, nothing offensive but nothing spectacular either.</li>
            <li> wonderful shampoo for really dry hair.  The Argan oil is just what I needed, and I can already see and feel the difference.  Wonderful product.</li>
            <li> When I received this shampoo it had been tightly wrapped up in a shipping bag with packing tape to keep it from leaking everywhere. When I cut the wrapping off, the cap was open and there was shampoo everywhere. It was quite obvious to me to the person who packed this knew this was going to be an issue. Other than that, I&#x27;ve used the shampoo before, and it&#x27;s a great product. Really moisturizes your hair, but I wouldn&#x27;t recommend using it every day because it&#x27;s heavy.</li>
            <li> A few years ago I was a Giovanni customer through and through. For a few years I tried the whole DIY organic products. I did not enjoy that route and wanted to use my old favorites. So I ordered this without reading the ingredients. It is TOXIC in my mind. I used it and my scalp was on fire, red, and itchy. There are words on the ingredient list that are not safe. Giovanni is clearly doing a great job at green washing their products. Please read it and do your research before purchasing.</li>
            <li> Loved the product&#x27;s scent and how it worked in my curly hair with the matching conditioner... After a week of use, my entire back and face is breaking out and scalp is very itchy. Got a few wet hair water drops on a piece of wooden furniture after showering and the water dropled had discolored the stain of the wood! Yikes!!!! Would not buy again.</li>
            <li> I tried this shampoo because I wanted something without sulphates.  It made my hair feel dry and like straw.  Plus it was very hard to comb through while wet.  I used this with the matching conditioner.  My hair is normally normal to oily.  I won&#x27;t purchase this again.</li>
            <li> Best shampoo I&#x27;ve ever used.  And the ingredients are safe.  My hair is shiny, soft, and oh - it stopped falling out too.  Make the switch - spend a little more money on a high-quality product like this and know that you aren&#x27;t putting anything toxic on your scalp and skin.  Did I mention it smells fantastic?  Both me and my girlfriend love this shampoo.  It also comes in a larger pump bottle (more cost affordable per ounce).</li>
            <li> Most shampoos strip my hair but this doesn&#x27;t. I have always had a hard time with finding hair care products for my hair but this is PERFECT!!!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m surprised at the reviews that say it causes breakouts or itchy scalp. I specifically love this shampoo because it is one of the few shampoos I can use that doesn&#x27;t cause any breakout and keeps my scalp itch free for 24 hours.

I&#x27;ve made haircuts last three times as long without split ends using this and the matching conditioner. This stuff is fabulous for anyone with hyper sensitive skin and needs a good shampoo for itchy scalp too.</li>
            <li> I have thick wavy brown scottish heritage hair, it&#x27;s not course... - this product (shampoo and conditioner) sounded great like it was going to make my hair super sleek (um, like the bottle says)  I found my hair to actually be quite UNsleek, rather kind of rough and frizzy! (to my surprise and dismay!)&lt;br /&gt;I was looking for a good alternative to Pantene because my hairdresser had informed me pantene contains the same ingredients as floor wax (yuk) so I was stoked about a natural \\&quot;skeekening\\&quot; product... that said after even several usages, even rinsing out the conditioner with cold water, my hair seemed surprisingly less soft/smooth than normal.  Certainly far from sleek.  Fluffy, kind of rough.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Enough so that I&#x27;m actually making an effort to post a review, which I usually don&#x27;t.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sounds like it works for some people, but definitely not across the board. I&#x27;ve had better results with other natural shampoos/conditioners.  Straight argan oil to damp hair after a shower is useful for me. But this didn&#x27;t do it for me :(</li>
            <li> i have fine wavy long hair and this stuff is the best without making my hair greasy but keeping it moisturized, shiny and smooth!</li>
            <li> I have shoulder length, bleached straight hair. I looked into this shampoo due to the argan oil. This shampoo left my scalp clean, but really tangled and stripped my hair. I had to use a lot of leave in conditioner as a result. I&#x27;ve used other organic shampoos that did not tangle or strip my hair.</li>
            <li> I bought 2 shampoos and 2 conditioners (the big ones) back in April at the owners appreciation weekend at my local co-op. It was expensive. Almost $55 in total. I began using them after I finished what I had, which was around the end of April. And that&#x27;s when I started having trouble. My hair looked fine, but towards the end of the day I would get really bad dandruff. It was a soft, weird type of dandruff that would fall in big chunks on my shoulders. It was a bit nasty. First I thought it may have been stress, but then I tried giving my hair a break from the 2chic shampoo and conditioner and trying something else and that&#x27;s when I noticed that when I would use other shampoos for a couple of days, I wouldn&#x27;t get the weird dandruff. And when I would go back to 2chic, the dandruff came back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve stopped using them and have been using regular Pantene and my scalp is back to healthy. I&#x27;ve never been so disappointed in shampoo and conditioner. Don&#x27;t buy these.</li>
            <li> its not a bad product for your hair if you can deal with the smell. I wasn&#x27;t really that fond of it for that reason.I wll find something that spells a little nicer to use.</li>
            <li> The front of this bottle says \\&quot;for all hair types.\\&quot; I highlight my hair and hate using conditioners because they make my hair greasy. I was looking for a shampoo that would leave some natural moisture in my hair but still allow me to go a couple of days between shampoos, so I thought I would try this. Well, after a day of not shampooing with this stuff, my hair looks like a total grease mop, with the separation at the scalp and everything. Forget about going two days. I don&#x27;t even feel like it gets my hair clean. To top it off, my face is breaking out horribly. I am not some oily teenager, so it&#x27;s frustrating to have this happen. I am disappointed that I bought this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the plus side, my hair is easy to brush after washing and isn&#x27;t all dried out after blow-drying. But it still looks dirty. This product should be clearly labeled as a shampoo for severely dry, parched, or damaged hair -- definitely NOT for all hair types.</li>
            <li> I love this product originally found it in a health food store and then was very happy to find it on Amazon it is so very nice to be able to sit on my couch and have my favorite things delivered to my home.</li>
            <li> This shampoo is a wonderful gem from the drugstore! As my hair is quite long, dry and even a little damaged I have had to spend more money than I would like to admit on hair care over the past few years. My hero product, Bain de Force by Kerastase is incredibly expensive so I searched for months to find a cheaper, suitable replacement. When I found this Giovanni 2Chic shampoo I couldn&#x27;t believe it; Not only does this shampoo feel and work exactly like Bain de Force in my hair, but it does so for a quarter of the price! Another bonus is the beautiful, subtle fragrance is head and shoulders above BdF or any other shampoo&#x27;s overwhelming chemical scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If your hair is picky, dry or sensitive and your wallet needing a little R&amp;R, do yourself a favor and give this impressive shampoo a try, I have a feeling you won&#x27;t be disappointed!</li>
            <li> Very good for curly hair, which is more brittle than straight.  Very good for gray hair, same problem.  I use their matching conditioner and it leaves a shiny but not greasy coating.</li>
            <li> My wife loves this and I must admit her hair looks great.  She had been spending quite a bit more for other products and we were both very happy to find this one.</li>
            <li> Great product, tried it on vacation and loved it. Saw it available on Amazon. And it&#x27;s easier to get it here than scouring stores and wasting time trying to find it when you can have it delivered to your door.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m an african american woman with locs.  I&#x27;ve been searching for a good moisturizing shampoo that is sulfate free, with no parabens, silicones, artificial fragrances or PEG&#x27;s....well this is it!  I purchased this shampoo over the weekend and used it immediately.  I was very pleased with the results.  I&#x27;ve used Giovanni conditioners in the past but never the shampoos.  I was reluctant at first as I was becoming discouraged, but decided that one more (after buying four other shampoos in last 6 months) wouldn&#x27;t hurt.  This shampoo won&#x27;t dissapoint!  My hair felt moisterized but not weighed down.  It felt very clean and looked shiny.  It lathers well and doesn&#x27;t take much to get the hair clean! I sure hope Giovanni continues making this one and does not change the ingredients!</li>
            <li> I have used this with the partner conditioner.  My hair is really wild and it has helped tame it a little.  It doesn&#x27;t produce a whole lot of lather and it rinses out quickly.</li>
            <li> After I had to cut my hair off, I went back to trying to find the most ethical shampoo and conditioner I could (had tried it with long hair with horrible results). This shampoo is NOT vegan--it is vegetarian. As I understand it, that means that while it does not contain animal ingredients and was not tested on animals, some of the ingredients it does contain are either tested on animals or processed using animal ingredients. Not sure which applies here, but something must. The experience I&#x27;ve had with vegan and vegetarian shampoos/conditioners is that they caused dry rot just like a typical shampoo bought at the store; the only reason I even tried another quasi-ethical hair product was because my hair was short and therefore not in as much danger of being damaged.  I do still color my hair with a dye containing ammonia, but as far as I can tell, my hair is still healthy and is definitely still shiny after a month of using this. I don&#x27;t know how my hair my hair would react if I were to try to grow it out, though--I might still have the same problem as I had with other vegan/vegetarian products and see dry rot.</li>
            <li> I picked this up one day because my regular natural shampoo and conditioner were not in stock. At first I was pleasantly surprised and amazed at the results. After having frizzy hair my entire post-pubescent life, I finally found a product that left me hair smooth. Even after sweating the hair near my forehead didn&#x27;t frizz or curl up. However, after using it a few weeks I&#x27;ve noticed my scalp is dry and I have dandruff.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried far more expensive shampoos in an effort to calm down my oddly textured hair, but this one is the best so far. My hair is fine, meaning each strand of hair is thin and fragile, but has varying degrees of curl/frizz throughout and some coarse areas. I color my hair and it tends to get dry unless I condition heavily, which can weigh it down because it&#x27;s fine. It&#x27;s important to me that my shampoo cleans my scalp and moisturizes my hair. This does both and you can&#x27;t beat the price.</li>
