            <li>I have no complaints for this conditioner, but I was looking for a slightly more of a deep conditioning treatment than it provides.</li>

            <li>This products not only smells great but leaves hair soft and shiny all day long!</li>
            <li>Fast shipping.</li>
            <li>Conditions hair very well.</li>
            <li>Does not do much to moisturize your hair.</li>
            <li>I used the JOICO K-PAK Intense Hydrator on my hair.</li>
            <li>This does absolutely nothing to my hair.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not the real product.</li>
            <li>Normally, I LOVE THIS CONDITIONER, so when I saw the price, I had to order because it was much lower than other sellers&#x27; prices....</li>
            <li>I also use other Joico shampoos and conditioners and love them as well.</li>
            <li>this does a better job  than some other brands I&#x27;ve tried like Biolage, Pantene, or Garnier.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommend ....</li>

            <li>The hydrater leaves your hair silky soft and shiny.  </li>
            <li>My hair became so soft and hydrated.</li>
            <li>The K-Pak products are the only product that really moisturize my hair.</li>
            <li>Maybe the price is low because this conditioner is OLD and has been sitting around on the shelf!</li>
            <li>Unfortunately, they were always out of the product - not only did I love it, it appeared everyone else did too!  </li>
            <li>I use the hydrator before I blow dry my wet hair and then keep it in my hair before I use hot rollers.</li>

            <li> I have no complaints for this conditioner, but I was looking for a slightly more of a deep conditioning treatment than it provides.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping. Great price. I color my hair and this conditoner works well.It doesn&#x27;t harm the color. I have more moisture and my hair has been more manageable. Love this stuff.</li>
            <li> Great product. It made my bleached damaged hair shiny and soft! I already started seeing results within the first use, and more permanent results after 3 uses. I leave it in my hair for a long time.</li>
            <li> Ordered for Wife. Hair&#x27;s really happy so that says it all.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product, originally, at a salon shop.  Unfortunately, they were always out of the product - not only did I love it, it appeared everyone else did too!  The hydrater leaves your hair silky soft and shiny.  I dye my hair and this product is wonderful for dye, dry hair.  I highly recommend this product.  Thank you Joico!</li>
            <li> Conditions hair very well. Makes it shiny. Helps if you use it after using the deep reconstructed. Leave it in under a plastic cap for 10 min.</li>
            <li> Not for dry, colored hair. Does not do much to moisturize your hair. Probably good for normal hair.</li>
            <li> I love this product!!!  I have bleached and highlighted blonde hair.  I use this once a week and my hair is like silk.  I put a generous amount on and then put a plastic shower cap on it and leave for 15-20 min before rinsing.  It is wonderful hydration for colored, dry hair.  I also use other Joico shampoos and conditioners and love them as well.</li>
            <li> Great. Just what I was looking for</li>
            <li> already used this product to much time and my hair forever stay good&lt;br /&gt;i love this product&lt;br /&gt;the results are good</li>
            <li> Gf says this stuff is &amp;#34;boss&amp;#34; It&#x27;s the best for damaged hair and there is nothing better out there and unfortunately, worth the price tag.</li>
            <li> I had just bleached my hair at home. I over bleached my hair to the point it was like gummie and breaking. I was afraid to comb it with a conditioner in it. when it dried, it was hard, dry, brittle stiff. When I comb it it was raining blonde hair. I used the JOICO K-PAK Intense Hydrator on my hair. I first used the shampoo and then the Hydrator. My hair became so soft and hydrated. My hair became a new texture. Silky, soft, easy to comb without my hair breaking off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Finally, I found a product that actually does what it says. My hair now is strong,soft, silky, manageable and is now growing faster because the breakage has stop. I heard Joico is the best for over-bleached hair. Now I know its true. I&#x27;m stocking up on the entire line. its fantastic</li>
            <li> Arrived quickly and is awesome intense hydrator for dry hair.  I&#x27;ve used it for many years and love it.  I would recommend the purchase of this conditioner.</li>
            <li> This products not only smells great but leaves hair soft and shiny all day long! I would definitely buy it again.</li>
            <li> I have used Joico products in the past and Omg it was amazing stuff!!! And smelled delish! But when I ordered this one I couldn&#x27;t belive the smell. This does absolutely nothing to my hair. I&#x27;m beginning to think that this is a scam. It&#x27;s not the real product. Total waist of my money. !!!! Your better off buying this at Marshalls dept store!!!!!</li>
            <li> This works wonderfully on my hair.  I use the hydrator before I blow dry my wet hair and then keep it in my hair before I use hot rollers.</li>
            <li> The best conditioner I have found to really leave my hair soft and easy to comb thru.  I don&#x27;t wash my thick long hair everyday which helps with dryness but I use this product every time I shampoo.  Highly recommend ....can&#x27;t buy this at my salon for this size and price!!!</li>
            <li> Love it! Best conditioner that ACTUALLY MOISTURIZES AND MAKES A DIFFERENCE IN YOUR HAIR!</li>
            <li> Love this conditioner! its one of the only ones I have found that leave my hair untangled and smooth! I have highly processed hair, and have regularly received comments about how great the condition of my hair is.</li>
