            <li>warms quickly, nice steam stream, adjustable height</li>
            <li>The steam is very fine and nice.</li>
            <li>Very strong mist.</li>
            <li>it so far it has been flawless.</li>
            <li>Nice strong stream of steam.</li>
            <li>but now it will not stay on for more than two or three minutes without shutting off.</li>
            <li>So glad about that.</li>
            <li>They do not make it any more</li>
            <li>we weren&#x27;t keeping it filled w/water!</li>
            <li>This unit is possibly ok if you are an engineer.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I found this on Amazon.</li>
            <li>I love this, and as a mobile esthetician, this is easily disassembled and reassembled.</li>
            <li>Easy assembly.</li>
            <li>It worked fine</li>
            <li>Easy to remove basin to clean.  </li>
            <li>This steamer puts out a Full Force of steam.</li>
            <li>So it has been a long road trying to find a good one again.  </li>
            <li>They  also purchased one each and love their new steamers also.  </li>
            <li>Client says there is a clean scent when blue light switch is on.</li>
            <li>This is not the problem, and any esthetician is pretty aware to keep water in a steamer.  </li>
            <li>so I figured it was just a malfunction in the first machine.  </li>
            <li>The steamer itself is pretty solid, you just have to work with it and make sure the water is exactly at the water line or it will leak.</li>
            <li>I just couldn&#x27;t get the legs on correctly, and I had put them on backwards at first.</li>
            <li>Needs to be higher up off the floor for my liking.  </li>
            <li>I liked this one so much I told the other  4 facialists I work with.  </li>
            <li>They gave us two options-send it back to them or and we could receive the parts and easily fix it f</li>
            <li>so much is that there is no ding when it turns off</li>
            <li>It really blows out the steam very well.</li>
            <li>The supplier sent me a new reservoir as the first one cracked, and they didn&#x27;t charge me for it.</li>
            <li>I contacted the seller and he offered to send me a new water container free of charge the next day.</li>
            <li>So easy to use and light enough to move to other treatment rooms.</li>
            <li>Everything seems fine, it heats up, starts to steam, and then it just shuts off and will not go back until it is completely cooled.  </li>
            <li>As my husband is a former electrician and we are near a small appliance shop we said great we would fix it.  </li>
            <li>I will be ordering a new one but not this one.</li>
            <li>At this point we contact the business to have a new steamer sent, as we have been told by professionals not to work on it.  </li>
            <li>Customer service 101- a new machine would be sent.    </li>
            <li>I reached out to the seller and they sent a new one.  </li>
            <li>Lots of plastic parts and just not heavy duty.</li>
            <li>This lasted about 4 months of daily use in our business, other brands typically last us about two or more years.</li>
            <li>If you will subject this to much moving around or daily use, you may want to consider something a bit more expensive and made with more steel parts.</li>
            <li>Now the second one is doing the exact same thing!  </li>
            <li>That may be true, however  Sundaes Novelties gave us incorrect information which caused a bunch of wasted time and money for their client.</li>
            <li>I was unsure of the ability to work well because of the low price - I was pleasantly surprised!</li>
            <li>As the business stated \\&quot;anyone with basic knowledge\\&quot; could fix it, we figured the guys that maintain our other steamers would not have a problem getting it right.   </li>
            <li>Already extended as far as I could but not tall enough.</li>

            <li> This steamer puts out a Full Force of steam. I was unsure of the ability to work well because of the low price - I was pleasantly surprised! I use it daily in my skin care business and it so far it has been flawless. Easy assembly. I would recommend to anyone.</li>
            <li> Only used this steamer a total of 5 times since I bought it several months ago. Today after only running for less than 10 minutes it kept shutting off.</li>
            <li> It worked well for a little while but now it will not stay on for more than two or three minutes without shutting off. I will be ordering a new one but not this one.</li>
            <li> Lots of plastic parts and just not heavy duty. If you will subject this to much moving around or daily use, you may want to consider something a bit more expensive and made with more steel parts. This lasted about 4 months of daily use in our business, other brands typically last us about two or more years.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had a few different steamers. The reason I like this one so much is that there is no ding when it turns off, you get to control the length of time it is on, and it turns off automatically when the water level gets too low. The steam is very fine and nice. The supplier sent me a new reservoir as the first one cracked, and they didn&#x27;t charge me for it. So glad about that. The only thing is that the base could be more stable. But it&#x27;s not a huge deal.</li>
            <li> I have purchased a lot of different facial steamers in my 20 years in this profession, priced from $125 to $800.  This streamer works like my $800 streamer which I had over 6 years and loved.  They do not make it any more was the reason I had not purchase another one.  So it has been a long road trying to find a good one again.  This facial steamer is it.  There was a small issue at first with the water holder but Silver Fox immediately corrected it.  I liked this one so much I told the other  4 facialists I work with.  They  also purchased one each and love their new steamers also.  Thank you Silver Fox...</li>
            <li> Works exceedingly well! Very strong mist. Client says there is a clean scent when blue light switch is on. I would purchase again.</li>
            <li> The steamer is excellent. However; the stand is terrible. If you are replacing a steamer head unit, this is the steamer you want. However this is only if you have a solid base to put it on. The stand supplied is weak, poor construction and cannot hold a mag lamp.</li>
            <li> warms quickly, nice steam stream, adjustable height</li>
            <li> After 9.5 months using this steamer we were experiencing the same challenges others were on here and-steamer shutting off. After contacting the company they said it was under warrantee. They gave us two options-send it back to them or and we could receive the parts and easily fix it f we had a bit if knowledge about small appliance/electrical . As my husband is a former electrician and we are near a small appliance shop we said great we would fix it.  So...we received the parts along with the instructions and a link to a YouTube video.    - the pamphlet is in black and white, but refers to the \\&quot;red\\&quot; areas. No help  - the video is terrible-with the technicians&#x27; hands blocking out the area we need to see.   We decided to take it to the small appliance shop. As the business stated \\&quot;anyone with basic knowledge\\&quot; could fix it, we figured the guys that maintain our other steamers would not have a problem getting it right.   We take it over, fill it up with water turn it in. This time as it turns off the machine blows a fuse. Machine shop says there is more wrong than the thermostat .     At this point we contact the business to have a new steamer sent, as we have been told by professionals not to work on it.  Total resistance.   They   1.refuse, say our only option is to send it back. At this point we have spent several hours attempting to do what they claimed was a simple fix, haven&#x27;t had a machine for two weeks. They are now suggesting we pack it up send it away and go w/o for another 7-10 days?   2.Claim the machine shop doesn&#x27;t know  anything about the machine- weird because we were told we could fix it with a video?  3.Told us we watched the wrong video  4.Suggest we weren&#x27;t keeping it filled w/water! This is not the problem, and any esthetician is pretty aware to keep water in a steamer.  5.Told us we should have had an extra steamer so we wouldn&#x27;t have to be in a bind.  6.Say that&#x27;s not how a warrantee works. That may be true, however  Sundaes Novelties gave us incorrect information which caused a bunch of wasted time and money for their client. Customer service 101- a new machine would be sent.    So hopefully some of this info may help someone else save some time and money. I unfortunately am outta luck.</li>
            <li> It stopped working in less than a week</li>
            <li> Great for the price. I have not had any problems with the item in the 6 months I&#x27;ve owned it and I use it all day.</li>
            <li> I love this, and as a mobile esthetician, this is easily disassembled and reassembled. I also love that it comes with an o-zone choice!</li>
            <li> This unit is possibly ok if you are an engineer. It comes with only written directions, no diagrams or parts list. The directions are in English written by a non English speaking person. Don&#x27;t buy this unit unless you are very good at putting devices together.</li>
            <li> This steamer works amazingly good. It really blows out the steam very well. So easy to use and light enough to move to other treatment rooms.</li>
            <li> I purchased this steamer 2 years ago. I used it a few times and it started shutting off after only 10-20 seconds of steam.  I reached out to the seller and they sent a new one.  It worked fine so I figured it was just a malfunction in the first machine.  Now the second one is doing the exact same thing!  (I have only used it about 20 times) It is so frustrating!  Everything seems fine, it heats up, starts to steam, and then it just shuts off and will not go back until it is completely cooled.  I will be purchasing another steamer from elsewhere.  I guess it&#x27;s my loose.  Don&#x27;t waste your money here!</li>
            <li> This steamer is an amazing price and fits perfectly in my treatment room. Easy assembly of the unit and great customer service if you have any questions regarding the machine. I&#x27;m glad I found this on Amazon.</li>
            <li> The steamer itself is pretty solid, you just have to work with it and make sure the water is exactly at the water line or it will leak. My biggest frustration came in assembly. I just couldn&#x27;t get the legs on correctly, and I had put them on backwards at first. Just couldn&#x27;t figure it out, and if the base is unstable, you don&#x27;t have a unit. Eventually, after about a month, I did figure it out, but I have to baby the stand so the legs don&#x27;t come out.</li>
            <li> Steamer works great.  Easy to remove basin to clean.  Needs to be higher up off the floor for my liking.  Already extended as far as I could but not tall enough.</li>
            <li> This is a nice steamer! Nice strong stream of steam. I use the steamer for a  couple of weeks when I noticed the water container cracked in about 4 places and was leaking water. I contacted the seller and he offered to send me a new water container free of charge the next day.</li>
