            <li> Not highly pigmented.</li>
            <li> The color is dark enough that you actually can notice that you are wearing makeup but subtle enough to not be overly indulging or the &amp;#34;clay pot&amp;#34; look as my mother likes to call it!!</li>
            <li> color was not what I expected.. to shiny for me.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m always a little worried about trying different brands of any makeup due to the risk of breaking out</li>
            <li> A little bit goes a long way.</li>
            <li> In addition to that, in the past, I have been known to purchase bronzers almost triple the price for the same quality.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not to dark or orange</li>
            <li> The top cap of it fell off when I got it which is annoying</li>
            <li> or it may end up a little orange.</li>
            <li> didnot receive my bronzer got a green eye crayon instead no pacakaging.</li>
            <li> After reading some of the reviews and seeing that no one really had anything bad to say about this product, I took the plunge and bought it.</li>
            <li> Use this item everyday!</li>
            <li> not many bronzers show up on me.</li>
            <li> but no sparkles (which I hate).</li>
            <li> Terrible.</li>
            <li> It was still orange, sparkly, and terrible.</li>

            <li> It doesn&#x27;t look like much but this powder will seriously last forever and is the perfect color to give a natural glow for fair to medium skin.</li>
            <li> Terrible. I have a medium complexion and the color made me look like a demented clown. I tried to salvage the purchase by applying it on my eyelids to see if it would work as an eye-shadow...no. It was still orange, sparkly, and terrible.</li>
            <li> i&#x27;m happy with my purchase i used it and happy with the outcome....</li>

            <li> The sparkles make it very shiny.</li>
            <li> Not highly pigmented. Shimmery.</li>
            <li> Love it great price great color stays on all day with no worries of reapplying it glad I found it</li>
            <li> This is a pretty good bronzer for the price. It&#x27;s not very dark and wouldn&#x27;t be a good bronzer for contouring because it does have some shimmer to it. But it doesn&#x27;t give skin a nice healthy glow.</li>
            <li> I had been searching for a good bronzer for months and purchased many different brands that ended up in the trash. I finally gave up the self-searching and took to Google to see suggestions on bronzer products. Milani was one of the top 10 brands of bronzing products. The site I used also gave me places to purchase and of course, Amazon, carried it and was the cheapest. After reading some of the reviews and seeing that no one really had anything bad to say about this product, I took the plunge and bought it. Needless to say, Google wins again at being correct!!! This is the BEST bronzer I have come across as of yet, and trust me, my checking account can vouch for being pinged time and time again for the purchase of another store bought bronzer. I am extremely satisfied with this product. It is a beautiful color and goes well with all my other makeup. It&#x27;s not to dark or orange so anyone with normal to tan skin tones should do great with this product. I&#x27;m always a little worried about trying different brands of any makeup due to the risk of breaking out but this product did not break me out any. It was like I had been using it forever!! The color is dark enough that you actually can notice that you are wearing makeup but subtle enough to not be overly indulging or the &amp;#34;clay pot&amp;#34; look as my mother likes to call it!! Love Milani products; even purchased the blush in Luminoso and it goes absolutely PERFECT with this bronzer. Makes for a beach girl/Cali girl look!!!</li>
            <li> This product was shipped quickly. In addition to that, in the past, I have been known to purchase bronzers almost triple the price for the same quality. Actually, I favor this Milani brand better. It provides just the perfect amount of shimmer without being excessively glittery. I am happy with my purchase, and definitely will be purchasing again in the near future.</li>
            <li> Use this item everyday! Love it. 😉</li>
            <li> I got this bronzer after many stores got rid of the Neutrogena Glow bronzers. This bronzer stays on all day and isn&#x27;t oily at all. I love this stuff. Got here super fast and was packaged really well.</li>
            <li> Well packaged and i love this bronzer&lt;br /&gt;great for light to medium skintones:)&lt;br /&gt;better than mac in my opinion amazing!</li>
            <li> This is a great bronzer.  I have fair skin, and this powder added a glow without being orangey or cakey. The little brush that comes with it is perfect, too! Would definitely purchase again.</li>
            <li> Makes my skin brake out easily, although my checks do get a good color.</li>
            <li> Quality product.&lt;br /&gt;This is a good bronzer color for anyone w. light skin.</li>
            <li> Love love love this brozer I&#x27;ve aleeady purchased this item twice and absolutely love it!, use it all over my face to even out my makeup!! It does the job for me!!!</li>
            <li> Adds just enough bronze</li>
            <li> Way TOO GLOWY for my middle-aged skin!!  Much more &#x27;glow&#x27; than color.</li>
            <li> I am extremely pleased by this bronzer. I have a tannish skin tone (1/4 peruvian) and not many bronzers show up on me. This one is so faint and beautiful with a light shimmer but no sparkles (which I hate). Comes with a compact case and brush. I am very pleased with this product! will buy again.</li>
            <li> So far I&#x27;m really liking this. Works well for my fair skin.</li>
            <li> color was not what I expected.. to shiny for me.</li>
            <li> Bigger than expected and beautiful.👌</li>
            <li> This bronzer lasts forever! A little bit goes a long way. Gives a fresh and natural look. This bronzer is a Great value!</li>
            <li> Love the bronzer, goes on nicely just don&#x27;t want to do too much or it may end up a little orange. good overall</li>
            <li> love this product. I only need to apply once because I use a face-setting spray (Urban Decay &#x27;All Nighter&#x27; spray). Looks great, goes on easy and does not have that thick clumpy look and is not super orange.</li>
            <li> didnot receive my bronzer got a green eye crayon instead no pacakaging. would not recommend or buy again</li>
