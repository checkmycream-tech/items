            <li>Perfect for during pregnancy The colors really match my garments and they fit perfect.</li>
            <li>and they stay nicely.</li>
            <li>Nice assortment of colors.</li>
            <li>Worked perfect, fit every bra I owned, wish a little longer, nice package with good color variety.</li>
            <li>perfect, just what i needed, i couldnt believe that the pinkesh on totally matched the bra i was wearing...</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t have too many colors</li>
            <li>Could even use more colors.</li>
            <li>;  Need I say more?</li>
            <li>Will buy more for sure.</li>
            <li>They fit all of my bras and are very comfortable.</li>
            <li>These are perfect for those bras that need just a little more wiggle room in the band.</li>
            <li>They stay attached well and the variety of colors makes it easy to match one to just about any bra.</li>
            <li>The two hooks snap easily into the eyes on the bra and no sewing is involved.  </li>
            <li>Adding a full size, lime 34 to 36 would have been better.</li>
            <li>They seem to stay attached just fine through the washing cycles and dryer.</li>

            <li>They are OK great colors, material is a little itchy.</li>
            <li>And it&#x27;s nice to have so many different colors.</li>
            <li>Perfect for Vicki&#x27;s Secret bras.</li>
            <li>But it was worth the wait since these are very good quality and should last a long time.  </li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>I was thrilled that the light pink colour was almost exactly the same shade as my light pink bra.</li>
            <li>I purchased these for my adult daughter, who used them and exclaimed, &amp;#34;No more back fat!&amp;#34</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s saved me a ton of money but not having to buy new bras.  </li>
            <li>Pretty colors and properly spaced hooks for me</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re soft, and I was concerned about that since I am very sensitive to anything scratching my skin.  </li>
            <li>The colors are very pretty and though I only have white bras, having colors doesn&#x27;t bother me since no one will see them through my shirts anyway.  </li>
            <li>only problem was it took a long time for them to arrive, nearly 2 weeks.  </li>

            <li> Pretty colors and properly spaced hooks for me but they are quite short. Adding a full size, lime 34 to 36 would have been better.</li>
            <li> These are perfect for those bras that need just a little more wiggle room in the band. They stay attached well and the variety of colors makes it easy to match one to just about any bra.</li>

            <li> Nice assortment of colors. The quality seems very nice also.</li>
            <li> Very good quality and great price.  Perfect for Vicki&#x27;s Secret bras. I purchased these for my adult daughter, who used them and exclaimed, &amp;#34;No more back fat!&amp;#34;  Need I say more?</li>
            <li> Worked perfect, fit every bra I owned, wish a little longer, nice package with good color variety. Found that two together was awesome for some. Will buy more for sure.</li>
            <li> They work as they should. But took forever to receive. Guess that&#x27;s what I get looking for pink.  I wouldn&#x27;t order again, but just because it takes so long to receive.</li>
            <li> I love the huge variety of colours you get in the pack, and they fit my Victoria&#x27;s Secret bras perfectly. I was thrilled that the light pink colour was almost exactly the same shade as my light pink bra. Perfect!</li>
            <li> They are OK great colors, material is a little itchy.</li>
            <li> These are least expensive bra extenders I could find and they work so well.  They&#x27;re soft, and I was concerned about that since I am very sensitive to anything scratching my skin.  The colors are very pretty and though I only have white bras, having colors doesn&#x27;t bother me since no one will see them through my shirts anyway.  The two hooks snap easily into the eyes on the bra and no sewing is involved.  These are great!!!  I take them off before washing my bras though I may wash the extenders eventually, but in a separate mesh bag.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only problem was it took a long time for them to arrive, nearly 2 weeks.  But it was worth the wait since these are very good quality and should last a long time.  And the price can&#x27;t be beat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE 3.6.14&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve just been leaving them attached to my bras when washing.  They seem to stay attached just fine through the washing cycles and dryer.</li>
            <li> These Boolavard bra extenders work as advertised. They fit all of my bras and are very comfortable. And it&#x27;s nice to have so many different colors. No complaints.</li>
            <li> Perfect for during pregnancy The colors really match my garments and they fit perfect. No problems with the item at all</li>
