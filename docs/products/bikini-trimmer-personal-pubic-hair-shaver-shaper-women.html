            <li>None of the batteries fit properly in either of them and the cover pops open.</li>

            <li> 1st it came b4 the expected date!!</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your time or money.  </li>
            <li> :/</li>
            <li> I have to wonder if the people writing the bad reviews for this product didn&#x27;t know how to adjust it properly.</li>
            <li> No good - returned this item</li>
            <li> their claim that it doesn&#x27;t pull hair is completely false.  </li>
            <li> hate them...</li>
            <li> Crap bundykay76@yahoo.com</li>
            <li> Terrible product.  </li>
            <li> Horrible from the moment i opened the box !</li>

            <li> Terrible product.  It took forever to get it to even trim any hair, let alone the fact their claim that it doesn&#x27;t pull hair is completely false.  Don&#x27;t waste your time or money.  Now I see why it was a \\&quot;buy one get one free\\&quot; offer.    I would like to add that this review is only based on the product, not the seller.  I would not hesitate to buy any products from Executive Home Supply in the future.</li>
            <li> I have to wonder if the people writing the bad reviews for this product didn&#x27;t know how to adjust it properly. It worked great for me, quick and easy! Would highly recommend this to a friend.</li>
            <li> No razor burn and trims neatly -- not especially close shave</li>
            <li> Nice.  At first I thought it wasn&#x27;t working well, but it was my mistake.  It is a great little tool!  I&#x27;m giving the extra one away as a Christmas present :-)  It works especially well when I removed the length adjuster and used it without it.  May be buying more for presents...</li>
            <li> Trims nicely and works great in the shower but the batteries do not last long in the trimmer.</li>
            <li> The perfect trimmer for women. This is the second one I have purchased. LOL.... I lost my last trimmer... I can&#x27;t imagine where it ran off too. But it is nowhere to be found. It&#x27;s always nice to have something new anyway.&lt;br /&gt;A+</li>
            <li> No!!! It was a waste of good money.</li>
            <li> Works great but the dock/charger is a horrible design. This is my second one of these and they both eventually wore out the electric outlet and wouldn&#x27;t stay plugged in. Since the unit has to sit on top, it won&#x27;t charge any other way.</li>
            <li> Love this trimmer!!!! I bought two !!</li>
            <li> I guess you get what you paid for. This item is garbage do not even buy it. It doesn&#x27;t even shave right.</li>
            <li> Exactly as described except didn&#x27;t come with the scissors as pictured.</li>
            <li> This is a great little product; works great.  Having 2 will work out perfectly...I can keep one at home and one at the lake.  I would recommend this to a friend.  Great purchase experience too.</li>
            <li> does not work at all, It comes on but does not cut the hair and i am fine haired...</li>
            <li> my daughter love it thank you</li>
            <li> hate them...batteries will not stay in</li>
            <li> No good - returned this item</li>
            <li> Thank goodness it came with two.  The first one died after about 3 weeks.</li>
            <li> It isn&#x27;t worth the money</li>
            <li> Great trimmer for the price BOGO !!!!  Worked fantastic and very light weight.  Small size is great and will easily pack for trips.&lt;br /&gt;Arrived on time.  Great service</li>
            <li> Great product would recommend it to others shipping was prompt thank you</li>
            <li> I brought one and received one free. The problem is that there is a defect with the the machines. None of the batteries fit properly in either of them and the cover pops open. They do not operate because the batteries will not sit properly. I tried them all different ways to try and get them to sit properly but they won&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> Horrible from the moment i opened the box ! Didnt trim any hair at all anywhere no matter how many times i adjusted it. But it did manage to cut my on the leg and make alot of noise. The one star im forced to give is one too many</li>
            <li> Worked well when it worked...stopped working and I don&#x27;t know why. I didn&#x27;t get very many uses out of it.</li>
            <li> These don&#x27;t work well.  You get what you pay for.  I dropped them in the thrift store collection</li>
            <li> Very please with this product.  Product was as described and operates like a charm.</li>
            <li> This product is horrible! All it does is make noise. It did not cut any hair at all. I tried it on several areas and it did not work. I would like to give it no stars but that is not an option.</li>
            <li> I like this trimmer. No pulling or nicks. Works very well for my needs.</li>
            <li> Love this trimmer. 1st it came b4 the expected date!! And love the guard but even w/o it it doesnt cut me and cleans the area nice and smooth! Plus it was buy one get one u cant beat it for the price!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s good. No bells and whistles, but it does what it says.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You have to absolutely shove the batteries in until they snap into place.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Buy one get one will probably be necessary when it breaks in six months. Hahah. But all around, I&#x27;m satisfied with it.&lt;br /&gt;If you want the best, don&#x27;t buy something that is under $20 and buy one, get one free.</li>
            <li> it just stopped working. the second free one never worked at all. :/</li>
            <li> Crap bundykay76@yahoo.com</li>
            <li> as advertised - on time</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t cut close enough.  Had to make too many passes, just to get trimmed down to where I wanted it.</li>
            <li> Nothing needed.. works and it is easy to use.</li>
    </ol>
