            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m all for people making a profit, but NOT taking advantage of people by their own GREED!!!!!</li>
            <li>This was is the best razor, I have used it for forty years, when it still was under the Wilkinson brand name.</li>
            <li>These are the best blades ever made.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m happy.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a great product and don&#x27;t know why Schick would discontinue it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m happy that I found replacement blades now that they are not being manufactured.</li>
            <li>or it&#x27;s a really good product.</li>
            <li>These are my favorite razors of all time!</li>
            <li>You would have thought they would have provided me with an alternative and some kind of deal to switch over</li>
            <li>you think people have  this kind of money.  </li>
            <li>The aloe strip is very soothing and the best razor a girl could ask for.</li>
            <li>some of us love this product</li>
            <li>I can still find them here when I need more.</li>
            <li>I love these refills, however, they have become cost prohibitive.  </li>
            <li>I LOVE IT..</li>
            <li>I love this razor and the refills  </li>
            <li>they are better than any others I have tried.</li>
            <li>I have used this razor since I was a teenager (now 54) and love it.</li>
            <li>I have used the Personal Touch like most of the ladies who have written reviews, for many years !!</li>
            <li>The item was fine,</li>
            <li>Since no average person has a plethora of dollars, this is a really good product.  </li>
            <li>You cannot buy them here any more for a reasonable price.</li>
            <li>I, too, like most women here, love the Personal Touch razor and have been using it for years.</li>
            <li>It is an old favorite, and I wish they had never stopped making such a good product.</li>
            <li>The problem is they stopped making these and finding them is a rare occurrence.  </li>
            <li>I DID love Personal Touch.</li>
            <li>The price for 2 refill blades was 300% higher than if you bought it in stores.</li>
            <li>When I first read it I thought it HAD to be a typo.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve owned a Schick Personal Touch Razor for many years.</li>
            <li>We should all right to the Schick company and tell them how much they could make if they started selling these again.  </li>
            <li>And now your gonna ask  us to pay that much money.  </li>
            <li>What a real shame.</li>
            <li>you either have too much money</li>
            <li>I like the fact that the blades have aloe and lanolin mixed in because it creates a really smooth shave.  </li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>I love it, just not the price in the stores I paid less online</li>
            <li>but the high cost gets a 1 .</li>
            <li>started a new one..</li>
            <li>If I could afford these, I would try that new NO NO product.</li>
            <li>I like many other reviewers were upset about the discontinuation of the Schick Personal Touch Razor and refills.  </li>
            <li>wow!</li>
            <li>My wife refuses to use any other blade except the Personal Touch Blades; however, I do not like the fact that they aren&#x27;t in the stores any more.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 52 yrs old...</li>
            <li>The blades when I get a new one out feel rough like they are used.</li>
            <li>I have loved my Perosnal Touch razor for years, but the refills have become nearly impossible to find.  </li>

            <li> I needed them because they keep me from cutting myself and since I am fighting breast cancer it was extra important for me because you have to be very careful taking radiation and not breaking the skin under the arms.</li>
            <li> I cannot believe that Personal Touch is no more, and Schick is no longer producing the cartridges.</li>
            <li> I hate you for discontinuing this perfectly fine product.</li>
            <li> So it makes me very angry that I can no longer afford such a simple product.</li>
            <li> $90 or so for eight individule blades is a bit excessive.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll be searching for a new razor after all these years! :(</li>
            <li> I have  used the shaver for at least 30 yrs</li>
            <li> Guess I&#x27;ll have to find a new brand. :(</li>
            <li> Other razors are clumsy and uncomfortable to use.</li>
            <li> I mean come on....</li>
            <li> This is ridiculous ...</li>
            <li> Seriously?</li>
            <li> That price is ridiculous</li>
            <li> I like the blades since I&#x27;ve been using them for years but didn&#x27;t like the price which was ridiculous.  </li>
            <li> I am so disappointed that Schick has discontinued the Personal Touch razor refill blades.</li>
            <li> These prices are unbelievable!!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not the rip-off price that bothers me.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, off to VENUS.</li>
            <li> Too expensive however</li>
            <li> Sad.</li>
            <li> Ive been using it for over 10 years and would be so sad</li>
            <li> They were very expensive for 8 refills.  </li>
            <li> is this how it going to be with your products, you&#x27;re going to have some people go to another brand :(</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I love it, just not the price in the stores I paid less online I had to pay out the @$$. is this how it going to be with your products, you&#x27;re going to have some people go to another brand :( some of us love this product</li>
            <li> The item was fine, just WAY OVERPRICED!!&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m all for people making a profit, but NOT taking advantage of people by their own GREED!!!!!</li>
            <li> The blades when I get a new one out feel rough like they are used. Yes it looks like the package has never been opened.&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t think it is the seller as it is the product. Maybe after twenty something years I need to find another razor. Service was&lt;br /&gt;great though.</li>
            <li> I have loved my Perosnal Touch razor for years, but the refills have become nearly impossible to find.  Found them here and ordered a bunch, so I am set for a while.  Hope I can still find them here when I need more.</li>
            <li> I love these refills, however, they have become cost prohibitive.  I&#x27;ll be searching for a new razor after all these years! :(</li>
            <li> I have used the Personal Touch like most of the ladies who have written reviews, for many years !! It is obvious that there is a demand for this product so why it&#x27;s been discontinued is a mystery to us all!!  These prices are unbelievable!! I would rate the razor refills a 5 but the high cost gets a 1 .</li>
            <li> I like many other reviewers were upset about the discontinuation of the Schick Personal Touch Razor and refills.  I contacted the company and they said they did not have enough consumer demand to keep it going.  You would have thought they would have provided me with an alternative and some kind of deal to switch over but that wasn&#x27;t the cast.  Unfortunately, off to VENUS.</li>
            <li> I mean come on....100 bucks for a shaver refill??!! This is ridiculous ...I have  used the shaver for at least 30 yrs and so does my daughter.  Then the stores quit selling them.  And now your gonna ask  us to pay that much money.  I&#x27;m 52 yrs old...lost a job started a new one..you think people have  this kind of money.  We should all right to the Schick company and tell them how much they could make if they started selling these again.  I cant afford this.  I LOVE IT..BUT NOT FOR THE PRICE</li>
            <li> These are my favorite razors of all time! Though I will NEVER even consider paying what they are asking here on Amazon. Guess I&#x27;ll have to find a new brand. :(</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not the rip-off price that bothers me. That is a sign that these blades are almost gone. You cannot buy them in a store. You cannot buy them here any more for a reasonable price. SCHICK--I hate you for discontinuing this perfectly fine product. I have 6 blades left. Then what? Spend $300 on a NO-NO? Use goopy razor/blade sets covered with creamy stuff? What a real shame. I DID love Personal Touch.</li>
            <li> I cannot believe that Personal Touch is no more, and Schick is no longer producing the cartridges. Was relieved to find these on amazon.</li>
            <li> Too expensive however</li>
            <li> The price for 2 refill blades was 300% higher than if you bought it in stores. w&lt;br /&gt; What a rip off!</li>
            <li> It is an old favorite, and I wish they had never stopped making such a good product. The aloe strip is very soothing and the best razor a girl could ask for.</li>
            <li> I love this razor and the refills  they are better than any others I have tried. I have been looking every where for them.</li>
            <li> You know that when you&#x27;re paying over $4 per blade that you either have too much money or it&#x27;s a really good product. Since no average person has a plethora of dollars, this is a really good product.  I like the fact that the blades have aloe and lanolin mixed in because it creates a really smooth shave.  The problem is they stopped making these and finding them is a rare occurrence.  But find them I did and I&#x27;m happy.</li>
            <li> My wife has to have these...they are going out of circulation &amp; cost is thru the roof....I believe she must change her shaving&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;habits.</li>
            <li> I, too, like most women here, love the Personal Touch razor and have been using it for years. Can&#x27;t find refill blades in any stores, so I came to Amazon hoping to find them. I did, but wow! There is no way I can afford them, so I guess I&#x27;ll have to find a different razor. Sad. It&#x27;s a great product and don&#x27;t know why Schick would discontinue it.</li>
            <li> This was is the best razor, I have used it for forty years, when it still was under the Wilkinson brand name. Other razors are clumsy and uncomfortable to use. So it makes me very angry that I can no longer afford such a simple product. If I could afford these, I would try that new NO NO product. Maybe do away with the need to shave at all, but that is out of my reach too. The people selling these refills are simply scalpers. But I did find this link at OverStock $28.49. http://www.overstock.com/Health-Beauty/Schick-Personal-Touch-Razors-Pack-of-4/4600561/product.html</li>
            <li> The Personal Touch Refill Blades, based on price, must be going extinct!&lt;br /&gt;Prices vary but $90 or so for eight individule blades is a bit excessive.</li>
            <li> I used to pay $3.94 at walmart for a 4 cartridge refill pack. I am in utter shock and dismay that the price for 2 refill sets is over $100. When I first read it I thought it HAD to be a typo. Seriously? $100 for what I could have bought at walmart for $8 a year ago.</li>
            <li> My wife refuses to use any other blade except the Personal Touch Blades; however, I do not like the fact that they aren&#x27;t in the stores any more.</li>
            <li> That price is ridiculous</li>
            <li> I like the blades since I&#x27;ve been using them for years but didn&#x27;t like the price which was ridiculous.  I&#x27;ll be buying a permanent hair removal system when these blades are used up!</li>
            <li> You cannot find this product in any store Because Schick stop making them.  Thank goodness for this dealer on line. These are the best blades ever made. Thanks</li>
            <li> I am so disappointed that Schick has discontinued the Personal Touch razor refill blades. I have used this razor since I was a teenager (now 54) and love it. I am depressed about the prospect of having to find another razor when the refills I bought on Amazon run out!</li>
            <li> I wish Schick did not discontinue this line!  Ive been using it for over 10 years and would be so sad come the day that I cant get these refill blades.</li>
            <li> They were very expensive for 8 refills.  I feel I was held up.  I needed them because they keep me from cutting myself and since I am fighting breast cancer it was extra important for me because you have to be very careful taking radiation and not breaking the skin under the arms.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve owned a Schick Personal Touch Razor for many years. I&#x27;m happy that I found replacement blades now that they are not being manufactured.</li>
