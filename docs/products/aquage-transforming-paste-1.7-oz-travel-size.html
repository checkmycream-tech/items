    <ol>
            <li> I&#x27;m MALE and this paste is without a doubt the BEST hair product I&#x27;ve EVER used! Keeps my hair damp looking and in place all day. Works best on short hair. Absolutely recomend this product to guys!</li>
            <li> Good stuff.  I use this the day after I shampoo to help with any styling needed.</li>
            <li> Great product, speedy delivery and I will purchase again</li>
            <li> I love this product, the travel size being impossible to find in town, I decided to try the internet.  I ordered on March 6th hoping for delivery by March 18th.  Had to email company to ask where product was, never did arrive in time for trip.  Company blamed the mail.</li>
            <li> A litle goes a long way. My hair sucks up product but a pea sized amount does the trick. Piece-y, styled hair without looking glued up or being sticky. I have thick, coarse blonde hair so it has its work cut out for it.</li>
            <li> I wish I could find this locally.  I love this product!  It provides good hold but my hair doesn&#x27;t get stiff or sticky.  The travel size fits in my 1 qt. bag for TSA purposes.</li>
            <li> The transforming paste gave my hair more body but also dulled the shine a bit.  I do like the product however and am trying to find a larger size.</li>
            <li> I LOVE, LOVE, LOVE aquage and can&#x27;t get it anywhere here in Alaska. I&#x27;m thrilled that Amazon carries it and got it to me in double quick time. It&#x27;s an amazing hair product, I use it daily, and this size is perfect for traveling, which we do.</li>
            <li> After recently getting a layered bob, I was at a loss on what to do with it, not having used product for years. I bought this based on the reviews and have been very happy with it. It does feel just like glue on your hands, but is not stiff or sticky in the hair and washes out with no problem. Gives me a choppy look without feeling icky</li>
            <li> I have used Aquage products for at least eight years.  This paste is great for creating volume after your blow-dry.  Quick shipment.</li>
            <li> Great product. Can be used on wet or dry hair. Holds well but not sticky or greasy. Have used it for more than 5 years and still very happy</li>
            <li> It was great, like it alot&lt;br /&gt;I use it everyday and glad I found it, no salons carry this product</li>
            <li> For years I have been looking for a replacement for Pureology&#x27;s discontinued Texture Twist and tried probably 8-10 different waxes but I never found anything that came close until trying a travel size of Aquage&#x27;s Transforming Paste. It&#x27;s perfect for my hair (and a humid environment in Houston) which is somewhat thick, slightly coarse and cut in a short layered style. The paste has a great texture and holding and shaping power but doesn&#x27;t feel sticky in your hair. Love it!</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful product that never leaves my hairy greasy.  It enhances the texture and adds shine, without any oil.</li>
            <li> Love this product!  Have been using it for years.  I have thick and medium-course stright hair.  It is hard to shape because it is so thick and heavy.  This is the only product I&#x27;ve tried that works.  I&#x27;ve tried many.  I think if you have thin hair fine hair this would not be a good product for you, but it worked excellent for me.  I Use about 1/4 to 1/2 teaspoon in my hands and rub together and work through my hair.  Do not need more to shap in place.</li>
            <li> great product.  Have been using it for years.  Perfect hair day or night.  Nothing more needs be said about aquage.</li>
            <li> Excellent hair paste; I don’t use anything else.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Aquage to control my thin hair for many years. I love the stuff. My hair was always a mess before Aquage. New great travel size fits in one quart plastic bag for TSA.</li>
