            <li>I love these claw clips!</li>
            <li>Great clip if you have fine hair.  </li>
            <li>They hold nicely and do not hurt at all.</li>
            <li>The curve of these clips and the curve of the teeth sits nicely against the scalp.  </li>
            <li>Handy to order online.</li>
            <li>I was so thrilled to find these clips.  </li>
            <li>They grip perfectly for the amount of hair that I have, and because they&#x27;re curved, they hang on to it and look much nicer, too.  </li>
            <li>but they&#x27;re sturdy and look nice.</li>
            <li>Nice grip.</li>
            <li>The curve on these clips is wonderful so that I can use them at work, kind of cover them with my hair and still look professional instead of looking like I am going to do laundry.  </li>
            <li>Not that good of quality, break easy.</li>
            <li>So glad they are available on Amazon!!</li>
            <li>Right size &amp; work great.</li>
            <li>If you have very fine hair</li>
            <li>They keep an excellent grip on my hair, no slipping or loosening over time.</li>
            <li>They aren&#x27;t super strong, but for the price, I am happy.</li>
            <li>They do have a curve, so they sit very comfortably against your head.</li>
            <li>They are also very comfortable.  </li>
            <li>I have been looking for these for a while, and haven&#x27;t been able to find them in stores.</li>
            <li>I decided to go on Amazon and hunt for these because I haven&#x27;t been able to find them anywhere.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not taking any chances of not being able to find them again.  </li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried many others over the years, but either they hold my hair snuggly and hurt my head</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t been able to find them in stores.</li>
            <li>These are some of the better clips that I have bought.</li>
            <li>I love this style of hair clip</li>
            <li>Were ok, They kept my hair up in a sweep from falling in my face and on my shoulders, I sometimes do not like to feel hair on me</li>
            <li>love these.</li>
            <li>These are even better than the H&amp;M clips.</li>
            <li>Love these clips.</li>
            <li>Will update upon use :)</li>
            <li>When Goody discontinued them, I was glad Amazon had them.  </li>
            <li>It works better with medium length hair, where you can twist the hair and let it poke out the top.</li>
            <li>Not anti-slip but stayed in ok.</li>
            <li>Again octopus cips are better for comfort because they give a lot more flex than these.</li>
            <li>They were much better quality than the Dollar Store variety.</li>
            <li>Now I find the clear is ideal.  </li>
            <li>So glad that Amazon can always fill that gap.  </li>
            <li>What more can I say about a hair clip.  </li>
            <li>It was well worth the time, price and product to see if they were as good.</li>
            <li>Love the convenience of ordering thru Amazon to get what I want.</li>
            <li>This is my favorite hair clip, but I can no longer find it in any stores.  </li>
            <li>So excited that I found them I ordered 5!</li>
            <li>Brittle and break easily.</li>
            <li>They hurt &amp; fall out too easily.</li>
            <li>Great grip , no sharp edges.</li>
            <li>nice and sturdy and holds my fine hair pretty well</li>
            <li>It is fine, but I have a lot.</li>
            <li>this works just fine.</li>
            <li>These are the best hair clips, hands down!</li>
            <li>The size listed in an answer to a question is 3 1/2 inches and the image is accurate.</li>
            <li>I have a huge bag of clips of all sizes.  </li>
            <li>or they are comfortable and let my hair slide out.  </li>
            <li>They secure the hair without pinching or hurting after wearing them for hours.</li>
            <li>Having three different colors is great too.</li>
            <li>these are well made and the tips of the claws are smooth and rounded.</li>
            <li>the hair clips were great and for their price i thought they would last maybe two months</li>
            <li>These clips do the job perfectly; I use them everyday.</li>
            <li>My mom borrowed it once and has since avoided getting it back to me, lol.</li>
            <li>Use them daily, there great.</li>
            <li>The curved design fits the contours of my head well, making it comfortable to wear, even at night while sleeping.  </li>
            <li>Love these, the metal seems pretty strong hopefully they hold up.</li>
            <li>Most clips just slide right out of my hair.</li>
            <li>Holds my fine hair well and is significantly more comfortable than the straight clips.</li>
            <li>I have a lot of long hair and this works great.</li>
            <li>These hold all of my hair with a great, tight fit!  </li>
            <li>My 10 year old daughter has longish fine hair and these are nice for putting her hair up.  </li>
            <li>Also it&#x27;s pretty strong unlike others which break easily.  </li>
            <li>For anyone looking for a good clip that doesn&#x27;t break easy and that will hold your hair all day long without falling out, this review is meant for you.  </li>
            <li>Durable, strong, holds even my fine and straight hair without any issues.  </li>
            <li>The natural colors are nice too.</li>
            <li>Perfect for not too thick my hair.</li>
            <li>I was a red head &amp; loved the tortise shell color clips.  </li>
            <li>They work and don&#x27;t dig as much, but there is another set out there that the claw curves just a bit more and is shorter, that does NO digging whatsoever.</li>
            <li>Smaller, light-weight, curved shape is the most comfortable clip I have ever had!</li>
            <li>the size is adequate.  </li>
            <li>I feel more pulling with these than the other ones I own.</li>
            <li>She is very pleased with these because they are the only clips she has found that stay in place.</li>
            <li>Also, they don&#x27;t hurt my very sensitive scalp like many clips do.  </li>
            <li>I have straight fine hair and cannot find a clip that will hold it in place for any length of time.</li>
            <li>Beware of clips that are straight across instead of curved to fit the head.  </li>
            <li>worth it.</li>
            <li>These are what I always look for in stores but can rarely find these days.  </li>
            <li>These are nice and rounded and well worth the extra like 2 dollars.</li>
            <li>theses are just right.</li>
            <li>these clips sometimes will grab and hold the hair and then at times they just slide right through.</li>
            <li>These are great quality, hold tight but are very comfortable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>As long as you get a good price, they&#x27;re a decent buy.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t write reviews very often but these are definitely worthy of one.  </li>
            <li>I used to be able to find at my local stores</li>
            <li>Exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li>;)  </li>
            <li>read the reviews and everyone mentioned that they had been in search of these exact clips.</li>
            <li>and i was looking for clips that would hold it up during hot summer days.</li>
            <li>Exactly what you expect to get, 3 medium sized claw grip hair clips.</li>
            <li>I used to be able to get them at any local walmart but can&#x27;t find them there anymore.  </li>
            <li>Exactly as advertised.  </li>
            <li>I wear hair claws everyday and am always looking for a more comfortable, yet durable design.  </li>
            <li>Well it seems like those shorter clips, which are my favorite, have been out of production for a long time.  </li>
            <li>Better quality than the numerous &amp; similar hair clips available.</li>
            <li>The clips arrived very quickly and they were as shown above.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re easy to grip, easy to open and close, are very comfortable, and are slim and not bulky, but open wide.</li>
            <li>These are nice and strong, I only wish that they were a little deeper so that they could hold a thicker amount of hair.</li>
            <li>Holds hair very well.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend these clips!</li>
            <li>they also seem very sturdy and i will buy them again when the need arises.</li>
            <li>They feel very flimsy.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t hold as much hair as it could.</li>
            <li>didn&#x27;t like, doesn&#x27;t hold very well.</li>
            <li>They work great and haven&#x27;t broken or cracked for me in over a year of use.</li>
            <li>I can twist my hair up and these are big enough and strong enough to hold it securely while I cool off, cook, do housework or whatever.  </li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t imagine why they are so hard to find in stores near me, they are far more comfortable than straight clips of a similar style, will be ordering more.</li>
            <li>I stepped on and broke two out of the three I originally had over the years and have had only one for quite some time.  </li>
            <li>These clips hold my hair super tight and feel comfortable on my head all day.  </li>
            <li>my hair is very long and fine, and these clips hold without any difficulties.  </li>
            <li>My oldest daughter has thick, fine, VERY long hair (to the top of her rear) and these clips work for her mane too!  </li>
            <li>I live very close to all of these stores: Wal-Mart, Walgreens, Target, SuperTarget, Kroger, CVS, Sally Beauty, K-Mart and Ulta.  </li>
            <li>Still not as high quality as the old ones I have, much thinner plastic and rougher teeth, but do the job far better than the new style of clips with the flat teeth that rest against your scalp.</li>
            <li>rather they ran larger, but can&#x27;t find the ones I used 2 decades ago that were curved &amp; opened larger for more hair.  </li>
            <li>I have several of these already and knew I would be satisfied but cannot always find this particular size locally.</li>
            <li>These are my favorite because they actually are sturdy enough to hold all my hair in place without spending a fortune.</li>
            <li>These are smaller than I expected, so they did not do a great job holding up long hair, but sufficed in a pinch.</li>
            <li>These are ok, they don&#x27;t hold your hair too tight</li>
            <li>The price is too high, but sometimes you just have to overpay.</li>
            <li>These are great for holding thick, long hair.</li>
            <li>I enjoyed the clear one the most for my blonde/gray thin hair; which has now been cut short, so I don&#x27;t/can&#x27;t use the clips.</li>
            <li>They are strong and large enough to keep my hair up off my neck without slipping.</li>
            <li>When it broke I began the search for a new clip.</li>
            <li>I had gotten her some really ceapo ones from another store, but the ends where super sharp and pointy from the plastic molding process.</li>
            <li>hair is long and straight and, in Texas, that means Hot.  </li>
            <li>My daughter and I both have think long hair and break our hair accessories easily, but these always last.  </li>
            <li>I like that these are curved like the natural shape of our heads.</li>
            <li>I bought a 3 pack of these clips years ago (guessing at least 5 years ago) and haven&#x27;t been able to find them until now.  </li>
            <li>My aunt gave me some of her old hair clips that she&#x27;d bought in the 90&#x27;s</li>
            <li>I really like the Goody products, but this isn&#x27;t the same as the ones that I have been lookiing for.</li>
            <li>old</li>
            <li>I have bought many others way more expensive and just wasted my money.  </li>
            <li>These are exactly what I expected.  </li>
            <li>Exactly as described and expected.</li>
            <li>I have long thick hair &amp; these are the only kind of clip that seems to work well for me.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a huge hair clip person, it&#x27;s so much easier to keep my hair half decent without actually trying hard.</li>
            <li>It is the only clip my wife will use for her hair, it is thinner than when she was young and grips it well.</li>
            <li>I have been looking for the old goody claw clip, the really big one...</li>
            <li>But if you have hair that is thin or in between you&#x27;ll love them.</li>
            <li>That might be a problem if you have fine hair, but would especially benefit someone with thick hair.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re strong and hold well with my thick long hair.</li>
            <li>I have really thin, fine hair, and this style clip is the only one I&#x27;ve found that holds my hair without me having to re-adjust it.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t imagine they would hold; if you have very thick hair, I think they are too light.</li>

            <li> What more can I say about a hair clip.  </li>
            <li> It was well worth the time, price and product to see if they were as good.</li>
            <li> Love the convenience of ordering thru Amazon to get what I want.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite hair clip, but I can no longer find it in any stores.  </li>
            <li> So excited that I found them I ordered 5!</li>
            <li> Brittle and break easily.</li>
            <li> They hurt &amp; fall out too easily.</li>
            <li> Great grip , no sharp edges.</li>
            <li> nice and sturdy and holds my fine hair pretty well</li>
            <li> It is fine, but I have a lot.</li>
            <li> this works just fine.</li>
            <li> These are the best hair clips, hands down!</li>
            <li> The size listed in an answer to a question is 3 1/2 inches and the image is accurate.</li>
            <li> I have a huge bag of clips of all sizes.  </li>
            <li> or they are comfortable and let my hair slide out.  </li>
            <li> They secure the hair without pinching or hurting after wearing them for hours.</li>
            <li> Having three different colors is great too.</li>
            <li> these are well made and the tips of the claws are smooth and rounded.</li>
            <li> the hair clips were great and for their price i thought they would last maybe two months</li>
            <li> These clips do the job perfectly; I use them everyday.</li>
            <li> My mom borrowed it once and has since avoided getting it back to me, lol.</li>
            <li> Use them daily, there great.</li>
            <li> The curved design fits the contours of my head well, making it comfortable to wear, even at night while sleeping.  </li>
            <li> Love these, the metal seems pretty strong hopefully they hold up.</li>
            <li> Most clips just slide right out of my hair.</li>
            <li> Holds my fine hair well and is significantly more comfortable than the straight clips.</li>
            <li> I have a lot of long hair and this works great.</li>
            <li> These hold all of my hair with a great, tight fit!  </li>
            <li> My 10 year old daughter has longish fine hair and these are nice for putting her hair up.  </li>
            <li> Also it&#x27;s pretty strong unlike others which break easily.  </li>
            <li> For anyone looking for a good clip that doesn&#x27;t break easy and that will hold your hair all day long without falling out, this review is meant for you.  </li>
            <li> Durable, strong, holds even my fine and straight hair without any issues.  </li>
            <li> The natural colors are nice too.</li>
            <li> Perfect for not too thick my hair.</li>
            <li> I was a red head &amp; loved the tortise shell color clips.  </li>
            <li> They work and don&#x27;t dig as much, but there is another set out there that the claw curves just a bit more and is shorter, that does NO digging whatsoever.</li>
            <li> Smaller, light-weight, curved shape is the most comfortable clip I have ever had!</li>
            <li> the size is adequate.  </li>
            <li> I feel more pulling with these than the other ones I own.</li>
            <li> She is very pleased with these because they are the only clips she has found that stay in place.</li>
            <li> Also, they don&#x27;t hurt my very sensitive scalp like many clips do.  </li>
            <li> I have straight fine hair and cannot find a clip that will hold it in place for any length of time.</li>
            <li> Beware of clips that are straight across instead of curved to fit the head.  </li>
            <li> worth it.</li>
            <li> These are what I always look for in stores but can rarely find these days.  </li>
            <li> These are nice and rounded and well worth the extra like 2 dollars.</li>
            <li> theses are just right.</li>
            <li> these clips sometimes will grab and hold the hair and then at times they just slide right through.</li>
            <li> These are great quality, hold tight but are very comfortable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> As long as you get a good price, they&#x27;re a decent buy.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t write reviews very often but these are definitely worthy of one.  </li>
            <li> I used to be able to find at my local stores</li>
            <li> Exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li> ;)  </li>
            <li> read the reviews and everyone mentioned that they had been in search of these exact clips.</li>
            <li> and i was looking for clips that would hold it up during hot summer days.</li>
            <li> Exactly what you expect to get, 3 medium sized claw grip hair clips.</li>
            <li> I used to be able to get them at any local walmart but can&#x27;t find them there anymore.  </li>
            <li> Exactly as advertised.  </li>
            <li> I wear hair claws everyday and am always looking for a more comfortable, yet durable design.  </li>
            <li> Well it seems like those shorter clips, which are my favorite, have been out of production for a long time.  </li>
            <li> Better quality than the numerous &amp; similar hair clips available.</li>
            <li> The clips arrived very quickly and they were as shown above.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re easy to grip, easy to open and close, are very comfortable, and are slim and not bulky, but open wide.</li>
            <li> These are nice and strong, I only wish that they were a little deeper so that they could hold a thicker amount of hair.</li>
            <li> Holds hair very well.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend these clips!</li>
            <li> they also seem very sturdy and i will buy them again when the need arises.</li>
            <li> They feel very flimsy.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t hold as much hair as it could.</li>
            <li> didn&#x27;t like, doesn&#x27;t hold very well.</li>
            <li> They work great and haven&#x27;t broken or cracked for me in over a year of use.</li>
            <li> I can twist my hair up and these are big enough and strong enough to hold it securely while I cool off, cook, do housework or whatever.  </li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t imagine why they are so hard to find in stores near me, they are far more comfortable than straight clips of a similar style, will be ordering more.</li>
            <li> I stepped on and broke two out of the three I originally had over the years and have had only one for quite some time.  </li>
            <li> These clips hold my hair super tight and feel comfortable on my head all day.  </li>
            <li> my hair is very long and fine, and these clips hold without any difficulties.  </li>
            <li> My oldest daughter has thick, fine, VERY long hair (to the top of her rear) and these clips work for her mane too!  </li>
            <li> I live very close to all of these stores: Wal-Mart, Walgreens, Target, SuperTarget, Kroger, CVS, Sally Beauty, K-Mart and Ulta.  </li>
            <li> Still not as high quality as the old ones I have, much thinner plastic and rougher teeth, but do the job far better than the new style of clips with the flat teeth that rest against your scalp.</li>
            <li> rather they ran larger, but can&#x27;t find the ones I used 2 decades ago that were curved &amp; opened larger for more hair.  </li>
            <li> I have several of these already and knew I would be satisfied but cannot always find this particular size locally.</li>
            <li> These are my favorite because they actually are sturdy enough to hold all my hair in place without spending a fortune.</li>
            <li> These are smaller than I expected, so they did not do a great job holding up long hair, but sufficed in a pinch.</li>
            <li> These are ok, they don&#x27;t hold your hair too tight</li>
            <li> The price is too high, but sometimes you just have to overpay.</li>
            <li> These are great for holding thick, long hair.</li>
            <li> I enjoyed the clear one the most for my blonde/gray thin hair; which has now been cut short, so I don&#x27;t/can&#x27;t use the clips.</li>
            <li> They are strong and large enough to keep my hair up off my neck without slipping.</li>
            <li> When it broke I began the search for a new clip.</li>
            <li> I had gotten her some really ceapo ones from another store, but the ends where super sharp and pointy from the plastic molding process.</li>
            <li> hair is long and straight and, in Texas, that means Hot.  </li>
            <li> My daughter and I both have think long hair and break our hair accessories easily, but these always last.  </li>
            <li> I like that these are curved like the natural shape of our heads.</li>
            <li> I bought a 3 pack of these clips years ago (guessing at least 5 years ago) and haven&#x27;t been able to find them until now.  </li>
            <li> My aunt gave me some of her old hair clips that she&#x27;d bought in the 90&#x27;s</li>
            <li> I really like the Goody products, but this isn&#x27;t the same as the ones that I have been lookiing for.</li>
            <li> old</li>
            <li> I have bought many others way more expensive and just wasted my money.  </li>
            <li> These are exactly what I expected.  </li>
            <li> Exactly as described and expected.</li>
            <li> I have long thick hair &amp; these are the only kind of clip that seems to work well for me.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a huge hair clip person, it&#x27;s so much easier to keep my hair half decent without actually trying hard.</li>
            <li> It is the only clip my wife will use for her hair, it is thinner than when she was young and grips it well.</li>
            <li> I have been looking for the old goody claw clip, the really big one...</li>
            <li> But if you have hair that is thin or in between you&#x27;ll love them.</li>
            <li> That might be a problem if you have fine hair, but would especially benefit someone with thick hair.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re strong and hold well with my thick long hair.</li>
            <li> I have really thin, fine hair, and this style clip is the only one I&#x27;ve found that holds my hair without me having to re-adjust it.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t imagine they would hold; if you have very thick hair, I think they are too light.</li>
            <li> They grip your hair, and are big enough to accommodate those of us with long hair.</li>
            <li> My 7 year old granddaughter will enjoy using these for her long thick little girl hair!</li>
            <li> One of the biggest points for me buying them was that the ends went flat.</li>
            <li> My hair is so long that it actually should be cut to lighten the load from my head.</li>
            <li> Black, tortoise and clear . . .</li>
            <li> Brown, black and clear.</li>
            <li> It is SO difficult finding clips strong enough and wide enough to hold my hair up.</li>
            <li> My hair is just past my shoulders, very fine and quite thin.  </li>
            <li> These are pretty standard claw clips, approximately the size of a standard computer mouse.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t rip at hair or break hair even thin hair on sick people its GREAT!</li>
            <li> This is a sturdy clip that is tight enough for even thin, fine hair.</li>
            <li> I wish they were slightly larger, but I am afraid that if they were much larger then they would slip out too easily.</li>
            <li> my hair is too thick but it does a decent enough job.</li>
            <li> They hold my hair all day long and they don&#x27;t slip.  </li>
            <li> No issues; just bigger than expected</li>
            <li> I have long hair &amp; living in Florida</li>
            <li> They Hold everything in place just like they are supposed to, even after a long day inside a hat.</li>
            <li> Not must of a problem for me because my hair is blonde and pretty thin.</li>
            <li> These work really well with my thick hair.  </li>
            <li> They feel pretty weak.</li>
            <li> I especially like these clips due to the curve.  </li>
            <li> I have very very long hair.</li>
            <li> I have very long hair &amp;</li>
            <li> They do dry out and the teeth break off</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m down to my last clip!  </li>
            <li> I bought one pack 3 years ago and I am down to my last clip which cracked from stepping on it.</li>
            <li> These run a bit bigger than the ones I had previously.</li>
            <li> I have very long and insanely thick hair, and this clip is the only one that seems to hold my hair up properly.  </li>
            <li> I have thin, fine hair and have a hard time finding clips that will stay in.</li>
            <li> The only little thing i didn&#x27;t like is their grip.</li>
            <li> I can sometimes find it in Walmart, not very often.</li>
            <li> not strong enough to hold hair at all</li>
            <li> These clips are my favorite and are next to impossible to find!  </li>
            <li> that&#x27;s missing two teeth, cracked down the middle and is still hanging on like a champ.</li>
            <li> These do dig a little into my scalp, not nearly as much as some others that I have tossed, but they do hold my hair.</li>
            <li> They were larger than I thought, but still worked on my long, thin hair.  </li>
            <li> I hate the flimsy plastic so many are made of.  </li>
            <li> So far none of the teeth have broken off, which sometimes happens with less durable claws.</li>
            <li> I keep these at home &amp; work &amp; in the car when the heat makes it unbearable to keep my hair down.</li>
            <li> I misplaced the other two.</li>
            <li> Too bad, Goody used to make things to last, but guess there isn&#x27;t much profit in well made merchandise.  </li>
            <li> Whenever I purchase hair clips they are usually too small or too big...</li>
            <li> Wish I could get all three black.</li>
            <li> Not super comfy.</li>
            <li> I wear black alot so will use that black clip too.  </li>
            <li> i have long thick hair (down to my lower waist)</li>
            <li> The other two clips were fine and worked well, but the product loses points because of the broken one and the fact that there was no corresponding fragment inside the package - meaning it was broken during manufacture, packaged, and then got past inspection to be shipped out to the consumer in that condition.</li>
            <li> These clips kept my hair up for a few hours before it started coming down.</li>
            <li> They grip tightly and do not slide.</li>
            <li> I have very long, thick, curly hair.</li>
            <li> the only problem is that there is a limit on how thick your hair can be to put all your hair up with a clip this small.</li>
            <li> The plastic is a little on the flimsy side, so they will break after awhile.  </li>
            <li> and i wish they were just a little wider.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m still struggling to find a clip that can hold up my heavy hair</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m adding this to my wish list and reordering a few times a year.  </li>
            <li> For me it&#x27;s just a tad too heavy.</li>
            <li> She has one that&#x27;s a few years</li>
            <li> I bought these for my daughter who has long thin hair.  </li>
            <li> It is hard to find hair clips like these that are slightly curved to be ergonomic to your skull.</li>
            <li> Half of the plastic grip was snapped off making it impossible to open the clip, and when I took it out of the packaged I stabbed my finger on the very sharp exposed spring in the hinge.</li>
            <li> My hair is a couple inches past my shoulders.</li>
            <li> I usually have to tie a ponytail and then use a clip to keep things on my head -</li>
            <li> Not sure how I would use this with longer</li>
            <li> I have medium-thickness hair, a bit past shoulder length, and these clips don&#x27;t slip out of my hair.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately I have to buy this set every year as they don&#x27;t last for c--</li>
            <li> but lately I&#x27;ve been struggling.  </li>
            <li> Just received it for my wife, unfortunately the last one came broken.</li>
            <li> works well in thick hair</li>
            <li> Still, if you have thick hair, something to think about.</li>
            <li> Seriously.</li>
            <li> Will hold thick hair (which is what I have) or thin (which is what my daughter has).</li>
            <li> I have very thick hair</li>
            <li> My set came with one of the clips broken.</li>
            <li> Desperate, I searched and searched for these clips at the store but realized that they are now discontinued.</li>
            <li> I hate clips that go outward at the ends, which dig into your head after awhile causing pain &amp; discomfort.</li>

    <ol>
            <li> Holds hair very well.</li>
            <li> These are nice and strong, I only wish that they were a little deeper so that they could hold a thicker amount of hair.</li>
            <li> I have been looking for these for a while, and haven&#x27;t been able to find them in stores. These are great for holding thick, long hair.</li>
            <li> It is hard to find hair clips like these that are slightly curved to be ergonomic to your skull. I can&#x27;t imagine why they are so hard to find in stores near me, they are far more comfortable than straight clips of a similar style, will be ordering more.</li>
            <li> I like that these are curved like the natural shape of our heads.</li>
            <li> I have long thick hair &amp; these are the only kind of clip that seems to work well for me.  This is my second time buying these here on amazon.  Cannot find them in stores.</li>
            <li> works well in thick hair</li>
            <li> I have really thin, fine hair, and this style clip is the only one I&#x27;ve found that holds my hair without me having to re-adjust it.  I guard them with my life.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t write reviews very often but these are definitely worthy of one.  For anyone looking for a good clip that doesn&#x27;t break easy and that will hold your hair all day long without falling out, this review is meant for you.  I bought a 3 pack of these clips years ago (guessing at least 5 years ago) and haven&#x27;t been able to find them until now.  They hold my hair all day long and they don&#x27;t slip.  It must be the way they curve and the way the claws curve.  I stepped on and broke two out of the three I originally had over the years and have had only one for quite some time.  I have bought many others way more expensive and just wasted my money.  I decided to go on Amazon and hunt for these because I haven&#x27;t been able to find them anywhere.  I am so happy that I was able to find them!  I bought three more of the 3 packs!  I&#x27;m not taking any chances of not being able to find them again.  I highly recommend these clips!</li>
            <li> Had bought several types of clips similar in nature that did not hold the hair - these do the job.</li>
            <li> These work great &amp; I can&#x27;t seem to find them anywhere except online. So happy to have found these.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m still struggling to find a clip that can hold up my heavy hair</li>
            <li> Holds my fine hair well and is significantly more comfortable than the straight clips.</li>
            <li> These work really well with my thick hair.  The plastic is a little on the flimsy side, so they will break after awhile.  As long as you get a good price, they&#x27;re a decent buy.</li>
            <li> These clips are doing a good job of holding my hair in place.  I wish they were slightly larger, but I am afraid that if they were much larger then they would slip out too easily.</li>
            <li> The only hair clips that actually hold my hair in place. WalMart has discontinued them, so I was happy to find them online.</li>
            <li> Great clip if you have fine hair.  Smaller, light-weight, curved shape is the most comfortable clip I have ever had!</li>
            <li> These are exactly what I expected.  My daughter and I both have think long hair and break our hair accessories easily, but these always last.  The natural colors are nice too.</li>
            <li> I used to be able to find at my local stores but lately I&#x27;ve been struggling.  These are THE ONLY hair clips that are shaped in the form of your anatomy off your head therefore it holds your hair in place ALL day without having to check and resecure your hair throughout the day.  I&#x27;m adding this to my wish list and reordering a few times a year.  They do dry out and the teeth break off but after a year or so.  The ONLY hair clip I look for.  Will hold thick hair (which is what I have) or thin (which is what my daughter has).</li>
            <li> Love it. Great grip , no sharp edges. Perfect for not too thick my hair.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I wanted. They hold nicely and do not hurt at all.</li>
            <li> excellent quality for the price!  my hair is very long and fine, and these clips hold without any difficulties.  they also seem very sturdy and i will buy them again when the need arises.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re strong and hold well with my thick long hair. I couldn&#x27;t find anything like them in stores. worth it.</li>
            <li> David&#x27;s wife is posting this not him. ;)  I bought a 3 pack of these clips over 5 years ago.  I&#x27;m down to my last clip!  I&#x27;ve tried many others over the years, but either they hold my hair snuggly and hurt my head or they are comfortable and let my hair slide out.  The curve of these clips and the curve of the teeth sits nicely against the scalp.  My hair is just past my shoulders, very fine and quite thin.  These are the ONLY clips that work for me.  My oldest daughter has thick, fine, VERY long hair (to the top of her rear) and these clips work for her mane too!  I&#x27;m so glad I&#x27;ve found these again!!!! I haven&#x27;t been able to find them in stores.</li>
            <li> I have thin, fine hair and have a hard time finding clips that will stay in. These clips kept my hair up for a few hours before it started coming down. These are some of the better clips that I have bought.</li>
            <li> I love this style of hair clip but I can&#x27;t find them in stores ANYWHERE!  I live very close to all of these stores: Wal-Mart, Walgreens, Target, SuperTarget, Kroger, CVS, Sally Beauty, K-Mart and Ulta.  Yet none of them have clips like these.  My aunt gave me some of her old hair clips that she&#x27;d bought in the 90&#x27;s - she&#x27;s had a pixie cut since 1998! - and they are similar to these but they are the shorter version.  Well it seems like those shorter clips, which are my favorite, have been out of production for a long time.  These are a good alternative.  They stay put without budging throughout the day.  Also, they don&#x27;t hurt my very sensitive scalp like many clips do.  Still not as high quality as the old ones I have, much thinner plastic and rougher teeth, but do the job far better than the new style of clips with the flat teeth that rest against your scalp.</li>
            <li> Were ok, They kept my hair up in a sweep from falling in my face and on my shoulders, I sometimes do not like to feel hair on me</li>
            <li> love these. read the reviews and everyone mentioned that they had been in search of these exact clips. now I know why. the only problem is that there is a limit on how thick your hair can be to put all your hair up with a clip this small. my hair is too thick but it does a decent enough job.</li>
            <li> Great clips been using these for years.</li>
            <li> My 10 year old daughter has longish fine hair and these are nice for putting her hair up.  Handy to order online.</li>
            <li> Whenever I purchase hair clips they are usually too small or too big...theses are just right. I have medium length hair &amp; thickness. They secure the hair without pinching or hurting after wearing them for hours. One of the biggest points for me buying them was that the ends went flat. I hate clips that go outward at the ends, which dig into your head after awhile causing pain &amp; discomfort. Having three different colors is great too.</li>
            <li> Made to hold, but not last forever.  Too bad, Goody used to make things to last, but guess there isn&#x27;t much profit in well made merchandise.  Brittle and break easily.</li>
            <li> My hair is a couple inches past my shoulders. It is fine, but I have a lot. I had one clip I bought years ago that worked perfectly! When it broke I began the search for a new clip. The search did not end here. These clips did not hold my hair at all. They feel very flimsy. I do not recommend these.</li>
            <li> Exactly as described and expected. It doesn&#x27;t rip at hair or break hair even thin hair on sick people its GREAT!</li>
            <li> I have a lot of long hair and this works great. Great hold.</li>
            <li> Durable, strong, holds even my fine and straight hair without any issues.  I usually have to tie a ponytail and then use a clip to keep things on my head - this works just fine.</li>
            <li> not strong enough to hold hair at all</li>
            <li> The size listed in an answer to a question is 3 1/2 inches and the image is accurate. The one I wanted to order is 2 1/2 inches and lighter weight. This is a sturdy clip that is tight enough for even thin, fine hair. For me it&#x27;s just a tad too heavy. Black, tortoise and clear . . . these are well made and the tips of the claws are smooth and rounded. My 7 year old granddaughter will enjoy using these for her long thick little girl hair!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for a claw clips to replace some ones I have bought from H&amp;M. Those broke and they no longer carried the same ones.  These are even better than the H&amp;M clips. They grip tightly and do not slide.</li>
            <li> i have long thick hair (down to my lower waist) and i was looking for clips that would hold it up during hot summer days. these clips sometimes will grab and hold the hair and then at times they just slide right through. so i am constantly readjusting the clip.</li>
            <li> Love these clips. They are strong and large enough to keep my hair up off my neck without slipping. Brown, black and clear. Perfect for any outfit.</li>
            <li> Excellent quality for the price, and pretty too. These are great for women with thicker hair- and I have tried a lot of claw clips.</li>
            <li> Just received it for my wife, unfortunately the last one came broken. Will update upon use :)</li>
            <li> Wished these kept a stronger hold on my hair. They feel pretty weak.</li>
            <li> No issues; just bigger than expected</li>
            <li> It is what it is I guess. It&#x27;s not the best claw clip out there.  I feel more pulling with these than the other ones I own.</li>
            <li> I was so thrilled to find these clips.  They are the only ones I can wear without pressure pain.  When Goody discontinued them, I was glad Amazon had them.  Wish I could get all three black.</li>
            <li> These clips are my favorite and are next to impossible to find!  They grip perfectly for the amount of hair that I have, and because they&#x27;re curved, they hang on to it and look much nicer, too.  Love them!</li>
            <li> Exactly what you expect to get, 3 medium sized claw grip hair clips.</li>
            <li> I have straight fine hair and cannot find a clip that will hold it in place for any length of time. Most clips just slide right out of my hair. These clips stay put! They&#x27;ll stay in my hair all day if I want. No problems at all. I wish I could find these in my local stores. These are the best hair clips, hands down! Love them!</li>
            <li> nice and sturdy and holds my fine hair pretty well</li>
            <li> I have very very long hair. I use a pony tail holder to hold my hair then I twist my hair and use this to hold my hair up off of my neck. I thought I needed longer ones but no these are perfect. My hair is so long that it actually should be cut to lighten the load from my head. Seriously.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t hold as much hair as it could. Not must of a problem for me because my hair is blonde and pretty thin. Still, if you have thick hair, something to think about. It works better with medium length hair, where you can twist the hair and let it poke out the top. Not sure how I would use this with longer hair-- try an octopus clip for that. Not anti-slip but stayed in ok. Not super comfy. Again octopus cips are better for comfort because they give a lot more flex than these.</li>
            <li> The clips arrived very quickly and they were as shown above. I would recommend this. The only little thing i didn&#x27;t like is their grip. I have very thick hair and i wish they were just a little wider. But if you have hair that is thin or in between you&#x27;ll love them.</li>
            <li> good clips , will use these a lot</li>
            <li> Yay!!  Just got these and they&#x27;re the ones I was hoping they were.  These are what I always look for in stores but can rarely find these days.  I hate the flimsy plastic so many are made of.  These are great quality, hold tight but are very comfortable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair is long and straight and, in Texas, that means Hot.  I can twist my hair up and these are big enough and strong enough to hold it securely while I cool off, cook, do housework or whatever.  So glad they are available on Amazon!!</li>
            <li> It is the only clip my wife will use for her hair, it is thinner than when she was young and grips it well. I can sometimes find it in Walmart, not very often.</li>
            <li> I have a huge bag of clips of all sizes.  The curve on these clips is wonderful so that I can use them at work, kind of cover them with my hair and still look professional instead of looking like I am going to do laundry.  I will order again.</li>
            <li> didn&#x27;t like, doesn&#x27;t hold very well.</li>
            <li> These are ok, they don&#x27;t hold your hair too tight</li>
            <li> They were larger than I thought, but still worked on my long, thin hair.  They aren&#x27;t super strong, but for the price, I am happy.</li>
            <li> These are pretty standard claw clips, approximately the size of a standard computer mouse. They work great and haven&#x27;t broken or cracked for me in over a year of use.</li>
            <li> the hair clips were great and for their price i thought they would last maybe two months but they&#x27;re sturdy and look nice.</li>
            <li> Good claw clip for hair for the price.</li>
            <li> These clips are the BEST! I bought one pack 3 years ago and I am down to my last clip which cracked from stepping on it. I misplaced the other two. Desperate, I searched and searched for these clips at the store but realized that they are now discontinued. I searched online as well but had to type in &amp;#34;discontinued claw clips&amp;#34; and these came up and I just about passed out! So excited that I found them I ordered 5! These clips hold my hair super tight and feel comfortable on my head all day.  I don&#x27;t understand why Goody discontinued these clips. Hoping they reconsider.</li>
            <li> I enjoyed the clear one the most for my blonde/gray thin hair; which has now been cut short, so I don&#x27;t/can&#x27;t use the clips. They were much better quality than the Dollar Store variety.</li>
            <li> These clips seem sturdy.... not flimsy like some I&#x27;ve come across. They do have a curve, so they sit very comfortably against your head. These run a bit bigger than the ones I had previously. That might be a problem if you have fine hair, but would especially benefit someone with thick hair. I have medium-thickness hair, a bit past shoulder length, and these clips don&#x27;t slip out of my hair. I would recommend these to anyone in the market for a good, well-designed hair clip.</li>
            <li> My set came with one of the clips broken. Half of the plastic grip was snapped off making it impossible to open the clip, and when I took it out of the packaged I stabbed my finger on the very sharp exposed spring in the hinge. The other two clips were fine and worked well, but the product loses points because of the broken one and the fact that there was no corresponding fragment inside the package - meaning it was broken during manufacture, packaged, and then got past inspection to be shipped out to the consumer in that condition.</li>
            <li> I have very long, thick, curly hair. It is SO difficult finding clips strong enough and wide enough to hold my hair up. These clips do the job perfectly; I use them everyday. They keep an excellent grip on my hair, no slipping or loosening over time. They&#x27;re easy to grip, easy to open and close, are very comfortable, and are slim and not bulky, but open wide. My mom borrowed it once and has since avoided getting it back to me, lol.</li>
            <li> These hold all of my hair with a great, tight fit!  They are also very comfortable.  Great buy!!! Would buy this product again.</li>
            <li> I especially like these clips due to the curve.  I have very long hair &amp; the size is adequate.  I would rather they ran larger, but can&#x27;t find the ones I used 2 decades ago that were curved &amp; opened larger for more hair.  I am an elder, white haired lady now.  I was a red head &amp; loved the tortise shell color clips.  Now I find the clear is ideal.  I wear black alot so will use that black clip too.  I give my red haired daughter the &#x27;brown&#x27; (tortise color) clip.  Unfortunately I have to buy this set every year as they don&#x27;t last for c--p like they did decades ago.  But these are still the only clips I find that work for me.  Beware of clips that are straight across instead of curved to fit the head.  They hurt &amp; fall out too easily.</li>
            <li> I have very long and insanely thick hair, and this clip is the only one that seems to hold my hair up properly.  It curves to your head which is necessary to hold everything.  Also it&#x27;s pretty strong unlike others which break easily.  I used to be able to get them at any local walmart but can&#x27;t find them there anymore.  So glad that Amazon can always fill that gap.  Great product, wish I didn&#x27;t have to order it online though...I hope they don&#x27;t take it off the market.</li>
            <li> Not that good of quality, break easy.</li>
            <li> They stay put. What more can I say about a hair clip.  Its to hold hair up off neck.</li>
            <li> These do dig a little into my scalp, not nearly as much as some others that I have tossed, but they do hold my hair. I really like the Goody products, but this isn&#x27;t the same as the ones that I have been lookiing for. They work and don&#x27;t dig as much, but there is another set out there that the claw curves just a bit more and is shorter, that does NO digging whatsoever. I hope to find them. It was well worth the time, price and product to see if they were as good.</li>
            <li> My girlfriend loves this brand. I had gotten her some really ceapo ones from another store, but the ends where super sharp and pointy from the plastic molding process. These are nice and rounded and well worth the extra like 2 dollars. They also seem to last forever. She has one that&#x27;s a few years (maybe like 5?) old that&#x27;s missing two teeth, cracked down the middle and is still hanging on like a champ.</li>
            <li> Exactly as advertised.  And they don&#x27;t hurt.</li>
            <li> I have several of these already and knew I would be satisfied but cannot always find this particular size locally. Love the convenience of ordering thru Amazon to get what I want. I have long hair &amp; living in Florida I keep these at home &amp; work &amp; in the car when the heat makes it unbearable to keep my hair down. These are my favorite because they actually are sturdy enough to hold all my hair in place without spending a fortune.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a huge hair clip person, it&#x27;s so much easier to keep my hair half decent without actually trying hard. Love these, the metal seems pretty strong hopefully they hold up.</li>
            <li> I have been looking for the old goody claw clip, the really big one...but these are remarkably strong and hold my hair up great!</li>
            <li> This is my favorite hair clip, but I can no longer find it in any stores.  The price is too high, but sometimes you just have to overpay.</li>
            <li> These are light-weight clips, almost bordering on flimsy.  If you have very fine hair I don&#x27;t imagine they would hold; if you have very thick hair, I think they are too light.</li>
            <li> I love these claw clips! They grip your hair, and are big enough to accommodate those of us with long hair.</li>
            <li> I bought these for my daughter who has long thin hair.  She is very pleased with these because they are the only clips she has found that stay in place.</li>
            <li> Nice grip. They Hold everything in place just like they are supposed to, even after a long day inside a hat.</li>
            <li> Use them daily, there great.</li>
            <li> Right size &amp; work great. Better quality than the numerous &amp; similar hair clips available.</li>
            <li> These are smaller than I expected, so they did not do a great job holding up long hair, but sufficed in a pinch.</li>
            <li> I wear hair claws everyday and am always looking for a more comfortable, yet durable design.  These Goody claws work well in my past-the-shoulders length hair.  The curved design fits the contours of my head well, making it comfortable to wear, even at night while sleeping.  So far none of the teeth have broken off, which sometimes happens with less durable claws.</li>
