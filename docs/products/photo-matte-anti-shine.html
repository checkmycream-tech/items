            <li>Great for stage and camera close-ups, too.</li>
            <li>but this stuff does the job of smoothing out my skin very nicely</li>
            <li>Was thrilled to find my fave Smashbox Anti-shine here on amazon!</li>
            <li>This is good for that.</li>
            <li>It feels really good too though like pearly.</li>
            <li>Smashbox is a really good quality brand, I also have their primer and undereye brightner.</li>
            <li>but not as good.</li>
            <li>I tried this on a friend who has more oily skin and while she did have to blot once during the day, the difference was incredible.</li>
            <li>I still have shine fairly soon after applying</li>
            <li>This is a good product and does what it says it will do.  </li>
            <li>She absolutely loved it.</li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t be able to get ready without this wonderful wonderful product!</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t sure how great this product would work with it&#x27;s claim to reduce shine</li>
            <li>This product works wonders, I love it!</li>
            <li>I love this stuff!</li>
            <li>This stuff is amazing.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s so popular</li>
            <li>saw a lot of reviews about Smashbox&#x27;s anti-shine and it seemed like people really liked it</li>
            <li>This picture is of the &amp;#34;old&amp;#34; Smashbox Anti-Shine product which is the best product in the whole world as a primer for oily skin.  </li>
            <li>This is the best I&#x27;ve found so far.  </li>
            <li>This product is fantastic!  </li>
            <li>I love this stuff.  </li>
            <li>get the things I want from amazon, and even more sweeter for letting me write reviews on his account.</li>
            <li>Still better than nothing....</li>
            <li>I love, love, love this stuff.</li>
            <li>with this underneath, i have winning combination.</li>
            <li>i love this product.</li>
            <li>I put this on and I am virtually oil free all day!</li>
            <li>and I love it.</li>
            <li>I found this product at Sephora about two years ago and immediately fell in love.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s phenomenal.  </li>
            <li>I have severly oily skin and wear a lot of foundation so for the most part it keeps everything in place.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m quite pleased with this purchase.</li>
            <li>The original product does not appear to have any oily ingredients in it at all!  </li>
            <li>I get easily 3 months of every day use from one tube.  </li>
            <li>have combination skin that is incredibly dry around my jawbone and hairline, but also an incredibly greasy T-zone and cheeks.</li>
            <li>The best part about this product is how little you have you use.</li>
            <li>Also there is a huge difference from wearing it and not wearing it...</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s light</li>
            <li>With this, my skin stays shine free all day.</li>
            <li>/&gt;- really gives my T-zone a nice matte feeling after applying it&lt;br</li>
            <li>It has been discontinued, but is available online still on some sites.  </li>
            <li>Item was exactly what was describe and it works ok.</li>
            <li>Also, the original tube was 1 oz.</li>
            <li>So wish they would not have discontinued the original Smashbox Anti-Shine.</li>
            <li>This is the first foundation that is clean and smooth and lasts all day for me!  </li>
            <li>This product is really great, the only thing about this gel is that you have to make sure you rub it in the oily areas evenly and quickly since it dries fast.  </li>
            <li>Paired with blotting sheets, this does give me a full day coverage.</li>
            <li>All I needed was a dab on my finger and to rub it on my nose, it sets really quick.</li>
            <li>works better than it said it would will be purchasing more of the Smashbox AntShine in the future.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;ve even been to Gulfport in the summer you know, it&#x27;s ridiculously hot and humid!  </li>
            <li>After having tried so so many mattifier creams, lotions, powders, plus constantly touching up ALL day long, I was thrilled that this actually worked!!</li>
            <li>My skin looks very smooth without the Smashbox and then when I use it, it gives my skin this rough look and my pores seem to be more pronounced.  </li>
            <li>Well worth the money.</li>
            <li>So it seems like its only compatible with Smashbox&#x27;s own products, which is a given.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>After finally tracking some down in the USA I ended up paying £60 for a £20 with my sister very happy indeed - her claim being that it is some sort of miracle</li>
            <li>Even tried Sephora&#x27;s version which is less than good.  </li>
            <li>Why and the world would you discontinue a new product that works?!!!  </li>
            <li>It works all day and you don&#x27;t have to use very much.  </li>
            <li>Love it and would totally recommend it.</li>
            <li>this is the first time in my life (i&#x27;m 28 and started wearing make up at 13)</li>
            <li>thanks smashbox!</li>
            <li>I tried Murad&#x27;s mattifier which works pretty well</li>
            <li>I run, do hot yoga and lift and this stuff does not fail.  </li>
            <li>I also experience hot flashes, once the hot flash has subsided this product continues to do what it describes</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried many different products, but nothing has worked.</li>
            <li>I live in Nashville and it&#x27;s been super hot and very humid though.</li>
            <li>My boyfriend has very oily skin and loves this for how well it keeps his skin from getting shiny.</li>
            <li>All day my skin look matte but still fresh and soft.  </li>
            <li>My mom recommended I buy this because I have very oily skin.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li>I am a dark-skinned woman and have a very oily t-zone.</li>
            <li>I have very oily skin</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t see really any difference in my &amp;#34;shine factor&amp;#34; at all using this product.</li>
            <li>I can really tell the difference in the days that I forget to put this on.</li>
            <li>I have pretty normal skin</li>
            <li>so I&#x27;m usually really picky about products that goes on my face.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>It took longer than expected to arrive (more than 10days) and it was like at ester in size.&lt;br /&gt;Best</li>
            <li>i have very oily skin and live in a hot, HUMID area.</li>
            <li>It is always pretty clear and but the shine never goes away.  </li>
            <li>When you first apply it, it makes your face feel completely oil-free.</li>
            <li>This is my husbands account, he&#x27;s sweet enough to me</li>
            <li>I decided to order this product because I have combination to normal skin, and my nose gets really oily throughout the day.</li>
            <li>Price is high for such a small amount, but worth every dime! :)</li>
            <li>For reference: I have very oily and sensitive skin that is prone to break outs</li>
            <li>Product does keep my oily face under control for most of the day instead of just a few hours without it.  </li>
            <li>It gives just enough to even things out and light enough to not feel like I had to put a mask on.  </li>
            <li>I am a male with pretty oily skin.</li>
            <li>I say this because I didn&#x27;t put it on evenly enough on my nose the first time I used it</li>
            <li>but I was pleasantly surprised with how well it works!</li>
            <li>that i have not had a huge, shiny mess on my face by mid-morning.</li>
            <li>This product certainly helps reduce the &amp;#34;lightbulb&amp;#34; look in photographs and the shiny look overall.</li>
            <li>so one side of my nose was oily and the other half was nice and matte.   </li>
            <li>I am 44 years old still with oily skin.  </li>
            <li>I have very oily skin especially in the T zone.  </li>
            <li>Tried Victoria&#x27;s Secret Anti-shine which is good but feels sticky for several minutes</li>
            <li>Since high school I have been looking for a product that could help me because I have always felt self concision about my face looking like an oil slick even when it is clean.  </li>
            <li>I was very hopeful after reading all the positive reviews because I wanted to see if this could cut down on the shine</li>
            <li>I mainly put it all around my nose, but found myself still using the same amount of powder and blotting linens throughout the day.</li>
            <li>I will probably buy this again after I&#x27;m finished because it&#x27;s pretty decent at keeping my face less oily.</li>
            <li>Sometimes can be a little chalky and ashy if not blended in quickly.  </li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re thinking about this product and have an important day/event coming up in a few days, I suggest pay for the fast shipping and handling and get other cosmetics to go with this anti-shine gel.  </li>
            <li>and the new tube is .5 oz., yet the cost is about the same.  </li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t try this on a non-oily part of your face because it&#x27;d probably dry it out way too much.</li>
            <li>I like it generally</li>
            <li>She finally realized that my skin is just naturally shiny.  </li>
            <li>i wear bare escentuals make up-</li>
            <li>The packaging is super small.</li>
            <li>So I was very bummed to find that Ulta, Sephora, and every other place I looked stopped carrying this product.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s worth the money even though it&#x27;s a small tube.  </li>
            <li>wow, i can&#x27;t believe i waited so long to buy this product!</li>
            <li>The bottle almost looks full and I&#x27;ve been using it daily for a month at least.</li>
            <li>The new one feels alot like other anti-shine products I have used that just glide over your skin.  </li>

            <li> I am 44 years old still with oily skin.  </li>
            <li> I have very oily skin especially in the T zone.  </li>
            <li> Tried Victoria&#x27;s Secret Anti-shine which is good but feels sticky for several minutes</li>
            <li> Since high school I have been looking for a product that could help me because I have always felt self concision about my face looking like an oil slick even when it is clean.  </li>
            <li> I was very hopeful after reading all the positive reviews because I wanted to see if this could cut down on the shine</li>
            <li> I mainly put it all around my nose, but found myself still using the same amount of powder and blotting linens throughout the day.</li>
            <li> I will probably buy this again after I&#x27;m finished because it&#x27;s pretty decent at keeping my face less oily.</li>
            <li> Sometimes can be a little chalky and ashy if not blended in quickly.  </li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re thinking about this product and have an important day/event coming up in a few days, I suggest pay for the fast shipping and handling and get other cosmetics to go with this anti-shine gel.  </li>
            <li> and the new tube is .5 oz., yet the cost is about the same.  </li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t try this on a non-oily part of your face because it&#x27;d probably dry it out way too much.</li>
            <li> I like it generally</li>
            <li> She finally realized that my skin is just naturally shiny.  </li>
            <li> i wear bare escentuals make up-</li>
            <li> The packaging is super small.</li>
            <li> So I was very bummed to find that Ulta, Sephora, and every other place I looked stopped carrying this product.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s worth the money even though it&#x27;s a small tube.  </li>
            <li> wow, i can&#x27;t believe i waited so long to buy this product!</li>
            <li> The bottle almost looks full and I&#x27;ve been using it daily for a month at least.</li>
            <li> The new one feels alot like other anti-shine products I have used that just glide over your skin.  </li>
            <li> But, I do notice that my face is LESS oily than normal, so I guess it is helping keep the oil under control</li>
            <li> However, you only need a teeny tiny bit so it will last a long time.  </li>
            <li> Normally I go through a couple of oil blotting papers per day, and now I only have to do a little dab once throughout the day.</li>
            <li> /&gt;- does what it&#x27;s supposed to do for a few hours (usually only 4hrs for me on a humid day in San Diego and about 6hrs on normal days).</li>
            <li> as other reviewers have said,    - use just a tiny amount  - use under makeup  - if it gets \\&quot;cloudy\\&quot; on your skin, simply dab with water  - may need to reapply later during the day</li>
            <li> Sephora has since stopped carrying this, so I tried several other oil control anti-shine products that they carried including Urban Decay&#x27;s, but none compare to Smashbox.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m usually a fan of smashbox products but this particular one didn&#x27;t work for me.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t understand why she needs, but at least she uses it sparingly and says it really helps her.</li>
            <li> I was on the fence about buying this product for a long time.</li>
            <li> Here are a few pros and cons that I&#x27;ve found so far</li>
            <li> It seems to be applying something dry and arid.</li>
            <li> For the first few hours I am usually oil-free but</li>
            <li> I brought this product for my sister as a birthday present, she had previously brought it on a concession stand &amp; raved about it.</li>
            <li> I use it every day and have over half left after 9 months.</li>
            <li> Your face does need to be prepped properly or you&#x27;ll get a blotchy, chaulky mess.  </li>
            <li> in the summer especially my t zone is a shiney mess and this stuff keeps the oily shine at bay for photo shoots or a nite out on the town..</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> a little of the product goes a long ways, and can be put on over moisturizer.</li>
            <li> I have bi-polar skin that is dry in the morning and is shiny within a few hours.</li>
            <li> It reduces shine just a little, but not much.</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that the tube came in a plastic bag.  </li>
            <li> while it makes your face matte, it will also make your face feel stiff and uncomfortable at first since its literally blocking pores</li>
            <li> It cuts down on the reflection.</li>
            <li> (because half way through the day it looks blotchy and odd)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve previously tried Medi-Matte, which didn&#x27;t do a thing for me, and Smashbox Photo Finish, which seems to work for a few hours but not at all like the anti-shine powder gel.</li>
            <li> In using this product a little DOES go a LONG...way.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t feel like I have a heavy foundation on.  </li>
            <li> However, this might actually make the oil worse throughout the day because your face feels the need to overcompensate.</li>
            <li> When putting it on it does feel weird as it can become hard to spread and if you are as oily as my boyfriend then you may need to reapply half way through the day, but every time you apply you feel a massive amount of relief from shiny skin.</li>
            <li> I have a super-oily forehead and this keeps it from looking like a oil slick.</li>
            <li> No more embarrassing pictures.</li>
            <li> If you are blessed with an excessively shiny face, like me, you need to buy this stuff.</li>
            <li> and you have to wait at least 5 min for that to stop before applying any foundation or mineral powder.  </li>
            <li> As headline says, this product is too thick and sticky for my taste and changes the consistency of powder foundation even when I wait about 10 minutes to apply it</li>
            <li> I mean washed and moisturized before putting this stuff on, no flaky areas.  </li>
            <li> You need a very small amount, so it lasts forever.</li>
            <li> When I use it, no matter how little or how much, by an hour or 2 in the day, I&#x27;m already patting my face to reduce the shine, and it makes my foundation look horrible.  </li>
            <li> but alas...</li>
            <li> I was skeptical</li>
            <li> So uncomfortable unless you like being sweaty, oily and smelling bad, which I don&#x27;t.  </li>
            <li> You sweat buckets within seconds of coming out of a cold shower.  </li>
            <li> My face shines like crazy by noon and my makeup is melting off my face by then.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s sooo expensive!</li>
            <li> This product helps against the brightness, but the feeling is very unpleasant to apply.</li>
            <li> I was shocked that this worked!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d recommend this to anyone who has problems with terribly oily areas.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> My boyfriend has very oily skin and loves this for how well it keeps his skin from getting shiny. When putting it on it does feel weird as it can become hard to spread and if you are as oily as my boyfriend then you may need to reapply half way through the day, but every time you apply you feel a massive amount of relief from shiny skin.</li>
            <li> This product helps against the brightness, but the feeling is very unpleasant to apply. It seems to be applying something dry and arid. The seller complied with the delivery time. The packaging is super small.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a product to help reduce oil and shine on my face.  This one isn&#x27;t it.</li>
            <li> I always get shiny in the T zone. This is good for that. However for all day use, you probably will have to reapply. It feels really good too though like pearly. I like it generally</li>
            <li> This product is fantastic!  The only reason I didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars is the cost.  However, you only need a teeny tiny bit so it will last a long time.  I have very oily skin in the summer especially and this product works to control shine without feeling heavy at all.  You don&#x27;t even know its there!  Definitely will purchase again</li>
            <li> I am a male with pretty oily skin. I was very hopeful after reading all the positive reviews because I wanted to see if this could cut down on the shine but alas... no such luck. I tried applying it varying ways and varying amounts but it all yielded the same results. I would be shiny in about a hour or two.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff.  I have the shiniest face on the planet.  My mother used to yell at me growing up that I had not washed my face well enough because she thought it looked oily.  She finally realized that my skin is just naturally shiny.  It is always pretty clear and but the shine never goes away.  Since high school I have been looking for a product that could help me because I have always felt self concision about my face looking like an oil slick even when it is clean.  This stuff finally did it!  All day my skin look matte but still fresh and soft.  I do not wear makeup (because half way through the day it looks blotchy and odd) but this stuff does the job of smoothing out my skin very nicely and there is no need for makeup. Love it and would totally recommend it.</li>
            <li> I am 44 years old still with oily skin.  This is the first foundation that is clean and smooth and lasts all day for me!  I don&#x27;t feel like I have a heavy foundation on.  It gives just enough to even things out and light enough to not feel like I had to put a mask on.  I Love This Product!!!!  Why and the world would you discontinue a new product that works?!!!  BRING IT BACK!!!!</li>
            <li> My mom recommended I buy this because I have very oily skin. When you first apply it, it makes your face feel completely oil-free. However, this might actually make the oil worse throughout the day because your face feels the need to overcompensate. Definitely does not reduce oil production and might even increase it. I&#x27;m usually a fan of smashbox products but this particular one didn&#x27;t work for me.</li>
            <li> This stuff works!  I apply it over my moisturizer and under my make-up and it lasts for hours.  It&#x27;s the best oil-control product that I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> &gt;This is my husbands account, he&#x27;s sweet enough to me get the things I want from amazon, and even more sweeter for letting me write reviews on his account. Anyways  &gt;This product works wonders, I love it! I decided to order this product because I have combination to normal skin, and my nose gets really oily throughout the day. Not flattering at all, I would get so self-concious about it. Since using this product my nose has been matte, not oily like it used to be.  In using this product a little DOES go a LONG...way. All I needed was a dab on my finger and to rub it on my nose, it sets really quick. It&#x27;s light so it feels like there&#x27;s nothing on my face. You can use it on moisterizer and under primer and makeup or without anything.  This product is really great, the only thing about this gel is that you have to make sure you rub it in the oily areas evenly and quickly since it dries fast.  I say this because I didn&#x27;t put it on evenly enough on my nose the first time I used it so one side of my nose was oily and the other half was nice and matte.   &gt;It&#x27;s worth the money even though it&#x27;s a small tube.  Smashbox is a really good quality brand, I also have their primer and undereye brightner. I had standard shipping with this product, so it took about 5 day for me to get it.  If you&#x27;re thinking about this product and have an important day/event coming up in a few days, I suggest pay for the fast shipping and handling and get other cosmetics to go with this anti-shine gel.  This product is great for weddings, partys, taking photograhps, etc.</li>
            <li> Product does keep my oily face under control for most of the day instead of just a few hours without it.  Your face does need to be prepped properly or you&#x27;ll get a blotchy, chaulky mess.  By prep I mean washed and moisturized before putting this stuff on, no flaky areas.  My only complaint is that the tube came in a plastic bag.  No outer packaging so there&#x27;s no information on how to use it.</li>
            <li> Bought mine from Ebay for $18. (my best offer). It reduces shine just a little, but not much. Still better than nothing....but I will have to try something else to get the matte effect I desire. No one product works for everyone. I live in Nashville and it&#x27;s been super hot and very humid though.</li>
            <li> I have a super-oily forehead and this keeps it from looking like a oil slick. Normally I go through a couple of oil blotting papers per day, and now I only have to do a little dab once throughout the day. I love, love, love this stuff. I&#x27;ve previously tried Medi-Matte, which didn&#x27;t do a thing for me, and Smashbox Photo Finish, which seems to work for a few hours but not at all like the anti-shine powder gel. I&#x27;d recommend this to anyone who has problems with terribly oily areas. I wouldn&#x27;t try this on a non-oily part of your face because it&#x27;d probably dry it out way too much. Just use where you need it. Perfect for summer!</li>
            <li> wow, i can&#x27;t believe i waited so long to buy this product! i have very oily skin and live in a hot, HUMID area. this is the first time in my life (i&#x27;m 28 and started wearing make up at 13) that i have not had a huge, shiny mess on my face by mid-morning. i wear bare escentuals make up- with this underneath, i have winning combination. thanks smashbox!</li>
            <li> as other reviewers have said,    - use just a tiny amount  - use under makeup  - if it gets \\&quot;cloudy\\&quot; on your skin, simply dab with water  - may need to reapply later during the day</li>
            <li> PHOTO MATTE ANTI-SHINE this is a product that will not show OIL on face.  It is one of the best out there by smashbox.  I got it and will buy again.</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing.  My forehead is not oily but was shiny from retina use I think.  A tiny bit of this and gone.  No more embarrassing pictures.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know where I would be without this products.. in the summer especially my t zone is a shiney mess and this stuff keeps the oily shine at bay for photo shoots or a nite out on the town.. great stuff!!</li>
            <li> I brought this product for my sister as a birthday present, she had previously brought it on a concession stand &amp; raved about it. I looked for it in shops &amp; online in the uk &amp; nobody had it in stock.....it&#x27;s so popular it was sold out on the day it went on sale!!!. After finally tracking some down in the USA I ended up paying £60 for a £20 with my sister very happy indeed - her claim being that it is some sort of miracle anti-shine face cream which she rates as 10/10 &amp; a definate place in her make up cabinet</li>
            <li> I started using Smashbox&#x27;s Anti-Shine while going to Navy \\&quot;A\\&quot;-school in Gulfport, MS... in June!  If you&#x27;ve even been to Gulfport in the summer you know, it&#x27;s ridiculously hot and humid!  You sweat buckets within seconds of coming out of a cold shower.  So uncomfortable unless you like being sweaty, oily and smelling bad, which I don&#x27;t.  This stuff worked wonders!!  So I was very bummed to find that Ulta, Sephora, and every other place I looked stopped carrying this product.  I tried Murad&#x27;s mattifier which works pretty well but not as good. Even tried Sephora&#x27;s version which is less than good.  Tried Victoria&#x27;s Secret Anti-shine which is good but feels sticky for several minutes and you have to wait at least 5 min for that to stop before applying any foundation or mineral powder.  Was thrilled to find my fave Smashbox Anti-shine here on amazon! It works all day and you don&#x27;t have to use very much.  I get easily 3 months of every day use from one tube.  I run, do hot yoga and lift and this stuff does not fail.  I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> i love this product. it works just like it says it will.  I was skeptical bc I am a dark-skinned woman and have a very oily t-zone. I put this on and I am virtually oil free all day!</li>
            <li> This product works great.  I have very oily skin especially in the T zone.  This product wipes away and keeps the shine away.  I also experience hot flashes, once the hot flash has subsided this product continues to do what it describes and I love it.</li>
            <li> Item was exactly what was describe and it works ok. I have very oily skin so it helps me out alot.</li>
            <li> If you get olily and shiny anywhere on your face this is the soultion! I wouldn&#x27;t be able to get ready without this wonderful wonderful product!</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t see really any difference in my &amp;#34;shine factor&amp;#34; at all using this product. I mainly put it all around my nose, but found myself still using the same amount of powder and blotting linens throughout the day. I have bi-polar skin that is dry in the morning and is shiny within a few hours.</li>
            <li> I found this product at Sephora about two years ago and immediately fell in love. Sephora has since stopped carrying this, so I tried several other oil control anti-shine products that they carried including Urban Decay&#x27;s, but none compare to Smashbox.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have combination skin that is incredibly dry around my jawbone and hairline, but also an incredibly greasy T-zone and cheeks. My face shines like crazy by noon and my makeup is melting off my face by then. This product truly keeps the oil at bay and I have used it almost daily for about two years. I can really tell the difference in the days that I forget to put this on. Definitely a must-have.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff! It controls shine and creates a great base without drying out my skin. Such a shame my local stores don&#x27;t carry it.</li>
            <li> I have always had oily, shiny skin. I&#x27;ve tried many different products, but nothing has worked. With this, my skin stays shine free all day. Well worth the money. You need a very small amount, so it lasts forever. I use it every day and have over half left after 9 months.</li>
            <li> I was on the fence about buying this product for a long time. It looked like a perfect solution but it&#x27;s sooo expensive! I gave in an bought it and will never be without it again. I have pretty normal skin but my eye makeup ALWAYS moves around- my shadow creases and my liner travels. Additionally, I powder mid-afternoon (like the rest of the world). I put the tiniest bit of this product across my nose and on my eyelids and my makeup stays where I put it- AND I don&#x27;t need to powder all day. I tried this on a friend who has more oily skin and while she did have to blot once during the day, the difference was incredible. The best part about this product is how little you have you use. The bottle almost looks full and I&#x27;ve been using it daily for a month at least. At that rate, I can justify the cost. This is a great product- give it a try!</li>
            <li> I never write reviews, but I had to say something about this product.  It&#x27;s phenomenal.  If you are blessed with an excessively shiny face, like me, you need to buy this stuff.</li>
            <li> Sometimes can be a little chalky and ashy if not blended in quickly.  I still have shine fairly soon after applying</li>
            <li> Another must-have for the teenager. I don&#x27;t understand why she needs, but at least she uses it sparingly and says it really helps her.</li>
            <li> For reference: I have very oily and sensitive skin that is prone to break outs so I&#x27;m usually really picky about products that goes on my face.&lt;br /&gt;I saw a lot of reviews about Smashbox&#x27;s anti-shine and it seemed like people really liked it so I gave it a try. Here are a few pros and cons that I&#x27;ve found so far (I&#x27;ve had it for a month).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;pros:&lt;br /&gt;- really gives my T-zone a nice matte feeling after applying it&lt;br /&gt;- does what it&#x27;s supposed to do for a few hours (usually only 4hrs for me on a humid day in San Diego and about 6hrs on normal days). For the first few hours I am usually oil-free but around 4-5 hrs I&#x27;ll start to see the shine coming. But, I do notice that my face is LESS oily than normal, so I guess it is helping keep the oil under control even if its not 100%.&lt;br /&gt;- doesn&#x27;t cause any breakouts for my face&lt;br /&gt;- A little goes a long way. 1 oz is a lot given how much I actually use each day. I use about....1/4 of a pea size amount to put on my forehead, nose, and chin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;cons:&lt;br /&gt;- if you use too much,you&#x27;ll have to blend it out a lot, and that will cause white streak marks&lt;br /&gt;- while it makes your face matte, it will also make your face feel stiff and uncomfortable at first since its literally blocking pores&lt;br /&gt;- depending on what primer I use under this, it could start flaking (ex. Urban decay pore perfecting primer WILL flake with this anti-shine but Smashbox&#x27;s Photo Finisher WON&#x27;T). Also, if I put this anti-shine BEFORE a primer but AFTER a moisturizer it can also flake with the moisturizer. So it seems like its only compatible with Smashbox&#x27;s own products, which is a given.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, i&#x27;ll use it if I&#x27;m going out for a few hours, but I don&#x27;t think it works for a whole day oil-free look that a lot of people claim it does. I would recommend it for people who don&#x27;t have as oily skin as I do. I will probably buy this again after I&#x27;m finished because it&#x27;s pretty decent at keeping my face less oily. Paired with blotting sheets, this does give me a full day coverage.</li>
            <li> As headline says, this product is too thick and sticky for my taste and changes the consistency of powder foundation even when I wait about 10 minutes to apply it</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure how great this product would work with it&#x27;s claim to reduce shine but I was pleasantly surprised with how well it works!</li>
            <li> This is a good product and does what it says it will do.  This is the best I&#x27;ve found so far.  I must just have extrmely oily skin on my forehead region because I still get the shine and oily feel by dinner time.</li>
            <li> Ordered this as a gift for a friend. She absolutely loved it.</li>
            <li> I was shocked that this worked! After having tried so so many mattifier creams, lotions, powders, plus constantly touching up ALL day long, I was thrilled that this actually worked!! I also use It Cosmetics Bye Bye Pores HD Powder (which btw is a miracle in itself) and I was absolutely, positively, delighted when I looked in the mirror a couple hours after applying my makeup to find a matte face!!!  It can be drying, so only use it in your oily prone areas. Price is high for such a small amount, but worth every dime! :)</li>
            <li> When I use it, no matter how little or how much, by an hour or 2 in the day, I&#x27;m already patting my face to reduce the shine, and it makes my foundation look horrible.  My skin looks very smooth without the Smashbox and then when I use it, it gives my skin this rough look and my pores seem to be more pronounced.  I used it on my sister for Prom and took pictures...with the flash, you could see where the Smashbox was under the foundation in her T-zone, but we didn&#x27;t have enough time to re-do her make up.  I will NOT be purchasing this again.</li>
            <li> works better than it said it would will be purchasing more of the Smashbox AntShine in the future. And I like that a little of the product goes a long ways, and can be put on over moisturizer.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for 2 years now, and it helps with shine a lot. I have severly oily skin and wear a lot of foundation so for the most part it keeps everything in place.  It&#x27;s not a miricle, but I havn&#x27;t found a product that matches it. Also there is a huge difference from wearing it and not wearing it...now I feel naked not wearing it.</li>
            <li> It took longer than expected to arrive (more than 10days) and it was like at ester in size.&lt;br /&gt;Best regards</li>
            <li> I have one of those faces that always needs powder (oily skin, what can I say). This product certainly helps reduce the &amp;#34;lightbulb&amp;#34; look in photographs and the shiny look overall. Great for stage and camera close-ups, too. It cuts down on the reflection. I&#x27;m quite pleased with this purchase.</li>
            <li> This picture is of the &amp;#34;old&amp;#34; Smashbox Anti-Shine product which is the best product in the whole world as a primer for oily skin.  It has been discontinued, but is available online still on some sites.  That is what I thought I was ordering.  When the product arrived the tube is different, and  has a different name on it.  Also, the original tube was 1 oz. and the new tube is .5 oz., yet the cost is about the same.  The original product does not appear to have any oily ingredients in it at all!  The new one feels alot like other anti-shine products I have used that just glide over your skin.  So wish they would not have discontinued the original Smashbox Anti-Shine.</li>
