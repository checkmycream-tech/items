            <li>Very pretty color, great consistency</li>
            <li>First off, this color is beautiful.</li>
            <li>i love pastel colors.  </li>
            <li>though a bit more to the pastel purple side) that can be used in work (maybe not for ultra-conservative atmospheres, though).  </li>
            <li>and I always use a top coat.</li>
            <li>I love this color.  </li>

            <li>China glaze is my favorite nail polish i love it because it dries fast providing for layering more polish without looking clunky!</li>
            <li>This is such a beautiful color</li>
            <li>I got a pedi with it 2 weeks ago and it still looks fine, though it will be replaced this weekend.  </li>
            <li>This color is super cute.</li>
            <li>Light</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also easy to apply and dries quickly.</li>
            <li>So worth it!</li>
            <li>Very pretty, light lavender.</li>
            <li>Needed two coats for full coverage, but it lasted almost a week without chipping.</li>
            <li>Would be good for a French manicure.</li>
            <li>Applies like a dream and dries quickly.  </li>
            <li>The color is so pretty and light.  </li>
            <li>A very pretty lilac color.</li>
            <li>Great base color but also good on its own for a neutral no attention grabbing every day wear.</li>
            <li>great product, as expected, high quality, will do business again!</li>
            <li>It applies well, especially for being a pastel creme, and has a nice finish after it dries.</li>
            <li>The texture was great and it wasn&#x27;t too hard to keep it from being streaky.</li>
            <li>Really pretty blue-lavender color.  </li>
            <li>you pretty much need 1.5 coats to get this right.  </li>
            <li>All their colors are fun and vibrant.</li>
            <li>this nail polish dries really fast and the color is exactly the one shown in the picture...</li>
            <li>I have it on my toes currently and enjoy it.  </li>
            <li>ABSOLUTELY IN LOVE!&lt;3</li>
            <li>really pretty and soft lavender color.</li>
            <li>but I prefer vibrant colors, this was my attempt to lighten up.</li>
            <li>As Air is very high quality and dries almost exactly the same color as it shows up in photos on the bottle.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended for those who want a classy shade of purple.</li>
            <li>Make sure you use a quality top and base coat.  </li>

            <li> doesnt last any longer than any other cheaper nail polish!</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, it chips quickly.  </li>

            <li> it was a waste of my money....</li>
            <li> Not exactly my favorite color</li>
            <li> One thick coat is all you need.  </li>
            <li> And it doesn&#x27;t mind a very thick, one coat application.  </li>
            <li> In my opinion, you can never go wrong with a nail polish by China Glaze.  </li>
            <li> OBSESSED!!!</li>

            <li> i love pastel colors.  No wonder this China Glaze collection got me....but i only bought one color and it was this one.  Applies like a dream and dries quickly.  you pretty much need 1.5 coats to get this right.  Anyway, on tanned NC 30-35 me this color looks classy and beautiful:  a cream demure pastel purple-grey color (though a bit more to the pastel purple side) that can be used in work (maybe not for ultra-conservative atmospheres, though).  i think all ages can wear this....yes, even seniors.  China glaze, continue the good work if you are reading this!</li>
            <li> Great long-lasting nail varnish!  Needed two coats for full coverage, but it lasted almost a week without chipping.</li>
            <li> doesnt last any longer than any other cheaper nail polish! it was a waste of my money....</li>
            <li> Light As Air is very high quality and dries almost exactly the same color as it shows up in photos on the bottle. It applies well, especially for being a pastel creme, and has a nice finish after it dries. I don&#x27;t know if chipping is a problem because I&#x27;ve only worn it for one day and I always use a top coat. The texture was great and it wasn&#x27;t too hard to keep it from being streaky.</li>
            <li> Very pretty color, great consistency, I&#x27;ve been wearing this all summer and I&#x27;m still loving it! I&#x27;d recommend it to anyone!</li>
            <li> This is such a beautiful color it&#x27;s a pale lilac mixed with gray.It took two coats for it to be opaque and its a really nice formula.I definitely recommend it.Also,the shipping was extremely fast.&amp;#60;3</li>
            <li> china glaze products go on some amazingly smooth, neat, and thick!! PERFECTT! you honestly could use just one layer and it would look great. really pretty and soft lavender color. i love this product!</li>
            <li> Very pretty, light lavender. Perfect for springtime! Glitter polishes go great on top of this! Not exactly my favorite color but I prefer vibrant colors, this was my attempt to lighten up. I still love the color!</li>
            <li> In my opinion, you can never go wrong with a nail polish by China Glaze.  Since I discovered them, I have not used another brand.  One thick coat is all you need.  Unlike other polishes, the nail polishy odor goes away within an hour or so.  And it doesn&#x27;t mind a very thick, one coat application.  All their colors are fun and vibrant.</li>
            <li> The color is so pretty and light.  It goes on easy with streaks and looks flawless.  Highly recommended for those who want a classy shade of purple.</li>
            <li> Really pretty blue-lavender color.  Unfortunately, it chips quickly.  Make sure you use a quality top and base coat.  It does look nice for Spring.</li>
            <li> I love this color.  It is has a matte finish and it is perfect for spring and summer.  I have it on my toes currently and enjoy it.  I got a pedi with it 2 weeks ago and it still looks fine, though it will be replaced this weekend.  A very pretty lilac color.</li>
            <li> great product, as expected, high quality, will do business again!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a tomboy so by chance that makes me a polish applying rookie. First off, this color is beautiful. It&#x27;s soft and feminine without being too bland. It&#x27;s also easy to apply and dries quickly. So worth it!</li>
            <li> The color is just like you see in the picture. It goes on with a frosty purple color coat. Will purchase again.</li>
            <li> Great base color but also good on its own for a neutral no attention grabbing every day wear. Would be good for a French manicure.</li>
            <li> China glaze is my favorite nail polish i love it because it dries fast providing for layering more polish without looking clunky!</li>
            <li> The color is fantastic...!! I love it!! this nail polish dries really fast and the color is exactly the one shown in the picture...</li>
            <li> i absolutely love this color. one coat is just enough but if you want it to appear darker two coats would be perfect! my friends love the color as well!</li>
            <li> JUST GOT MY PRODUCT COUPLE DAYS AGO AND I MUST SAY...OBSESSED!!!(: LOVE THE COLOR AND GREAT PRODUCT AS WELL! IM ALREADY HOOKED. I WILL DEFINITELY BE BUYING THIS AGAIN. ABSOLUTELY IN LOVE!&lt;3</li>
            <li> This color is super cute. Perfect for spring!!! Easter lilies are what this color reminds me of. Would definitely buy again!</li>
