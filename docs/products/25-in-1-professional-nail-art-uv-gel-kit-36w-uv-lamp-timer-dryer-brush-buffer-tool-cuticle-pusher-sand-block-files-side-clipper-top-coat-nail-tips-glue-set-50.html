            <li>I liked the lamp and the tools buy</li>
            <li>Super happy</li>
            <li>but the rest of the items are good worth the money.</li>
            <li>l got the kit and everything was working fine until a month after I got it</li>
            <li>I enjoy this product</li>
            <li>It was cheaply made.</li>
            <li>the UV light stop working</li>
            <li>everything came right on time :)</li>

            <li>On the bright side, the shipping on this product was faster than expected, and everything listed was included!</li>
            <li>The UV lamp works great and is big enough to do a mani or pedi.</li>
            <li>Package arrived in Time but the lamp out of order before  first use.</li>
            <li>so I&#x27;m fairly certain it&#x27;s not my technique.</li>

            <li> Product was as promised and arrived on time.</li>
            <li> Package arrived in Time but the lamp out of order before  first use. Bad quality.</li>
            <li> The Lighting came broken, they mailed a new light bulb but the machine has been acting up since day 1.</li>
            <li> This kit has everything you need to create gel nails at home or just for practice.</li>
            <li> Awesome starter kit! It has everything you will need, highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> The foil measurement stickers were damaged. The kit does come with a lot of stuff.</li>
            <li> I also ordered the kit and only received the lamp. The lamp I received was extremely low in quality.</li>
            <li> This was a great surprise. Everything was in its on bag. The gel stuff split but stayed in the bag. The UV light is WAY bigger than I thought. Super happy</li>
            <li> Nail quality is mediocre,  but all &amp; all great deal. Having fun! &amp; much cheaper than the salon if u have skills to do them yourself</li>
            <li> Received package in 2 days! Great but it did not come with the uv lamp like it said in the description</li>
            <li> Only the lamp came, wheres the rest of the stuff????? I paid for what the picture shows but only the lamp came</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t get everything it said I was going to get. I was really disappointed. ðŸ‘Ž</li>
            <li> I order this kit. And only received tha lamp..</li>
            <li> I need a how to booklet or something did anyone think about that</li>
            <li> I ordered this Friday and received it on a Monday. The shipping time was excellent. Unfortunately, I was a little disappointed to get only one out of three of my gels were factory sealed. My pink gel leaked during transit, not a whole lot but it would not have happened at all if they were sealed as they should have been. Both of my glues were completely dried out and unusable. Other than that, I am pleased with my purchase. The UV lamp works great and is big enough to do a mani or pedi.</li>
            <li> i give it a 4 star because one of the uv lights its loose and i have to wiggle it to stay on but the rest of the items are good worth the money.</li>
            <li> I enjoy this product everything came right on time :)</li>
            <li> My niece loved it - great gift and lots of stuff!!</li>
            <li> The uv light is broken already?? It was cheaply made.</li>
            <li> Try, try, try as I might, I CAN NOT get these nails to stay on. I even bought a different brand of glue thinking that was it. I&#x27;ve spent a good hour or more, on three different occasions applying these meticulously, only to have them peel off 5 hours later. I used a friends pricier kit and had no issues so I&#x27;m fairly certain it&#x27;s not my technique. On the bright side, the shipping on this product was faster than expected, and everything listed was included!</li>
            <li> l got the kit and everything was working fine until a month after I got it the UV light stop working it smokes bad when I turn it on I really wish you guys can mail me out another one or something</li>
            <li> I liked the lamp and the tools buy it&#x27;s very low quality the gel I&#x27;ve used the withe one and it&#x27;s messy and peals off a day after</li>
