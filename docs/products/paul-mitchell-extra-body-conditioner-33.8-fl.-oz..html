            <li>excellent daily conditioner/rinse&lt;br /&gt;great</li>

            <li>What a great price for this enormous bottle of conditioner!</li>
            <li>Works well, leaves my hair shiny and full of body.</li>
            <li>My hair is fine and tends to tangle, so I need a good conditioner, but not one that weighs my hair down.  </li>
            <li>It is not as thick as most conditioners so while it conditions my hair perfectly it does not weigh it down!</li>
            <li>Sometimes a product can seem to have the desired effect at first, but after you use it for awhile, it stops working.  </li>
            <li>This has been my conditioner of choice for the last year, it leaves my hear noticeably thicker and more voluminous.</li>
            <li>kind of weights my hair down.</li>
            <li>This product leaves a very waxy residue on my hair.  </li>
            <li>It does not leave any residue and truly helps keep the style in my very &amp;#34;fine&amp;#34; hair.  </li>
            <li>It is a great every day shampoo for thin hair.</li>
            <li>Thanks.</li>
            <li>This is my favorite conditioner and I have trouble finding it in the retail stores here.</li>
            <li>I care much for the fragrance though, kind of a chemical smell not pleasant.</li>
            <li>It makes my hair soft, shiny and tangle-free, but also provides the \\&quot;body\\</li>
            <li>her hair comes out so soft</li>
            <li>I have extremely fine and thin hair and this product makes me feel like I have thicker, fuller hair.  </li>

            <li> This product leaves a very waxy residue on my hair.  This may be how the product is intended to help with volume, but it leaves my hair with an unpleasant texture that makes it difficult to manage.  When I try to run my fingers through it, my fingers get stuck as my hair has a waxy feel and brushing is more difficult as well.  It&#x27;s difficult to keep my hair brushed out as the strands tend to stick together and start to look messy after a short period of time.  The waxy residue also makes it more difficult to curl and style.  I have stopped using it 2 or 3 times and every time I try it again (hoping for a different result), I have the same experience.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for some time now and it is &amp;#34;good stuff.&amp;#34;  It does not leave any residue and truly helps keep the style in my very &amp;#34;fine&amp;#34; hair.  fmp</li>
            <li> This product is great! i have baby thin hair and this product seems to multiply my hair making it look a lot fuller! I&#x27;m super happy with it... and it makes my hair so shiny!!! love it! and recommend it!!</li>
            <li> I have used this conditioner for years and absolutely love it!! It is not as thick as most conditioners so while it conditions my hair perfectly it does not weigh it down!</li>
            <li> Wonderful... would buy again and again!  Love the large size and great value for money. I decanter it into smaller bottles to use in the gym.</li>
            <li> Great stuff. I used to use The Conditioner, but since my hair has thinned out, this stuff works even better.</li>
            <li> I love it for my daughter hair, when I wash her hair with the shampoo her hair comes out so soft</li>
            <li> I have extremely fine and thin hair and this product makes me feel like I have thicker, fuller hair.  Love this product!!!</li>
            <li> This product left an extremely greasy residue in my hair. I would never buy it again.</li>
            <li> Works well, leaves my hair shiny and full of body. I care much for the fragrance though, kind of a chemical smell not pleasant.</li>
            <li> excellent daily conditioner/rinse&lt;br /&gt;great paul mitchell quality</li>
            <li> this is a good price for this size bottle. i love the shampoo and rinse in the volumizing line. use it every day!</li>
            <li> This is a very good rinse that leaves my very fine hair feeling fuller without feeling greasy or wet. Great purchase.</li>
            <li> Works fine BUT -- note that this is a CONDITIONER.  It is NOT a shampoo;  Amazon incorrectly has this sorted into Hair Care/Shampoos.</li>
            <li> What a great price for this enormous bottle of conditioner! I would pay $16 for a half-size bottle at the local drug store. This has been my conditioner of choice for the last year, it leaves my hear noticeably thicker and more voluminous. I don&#x27;t use it every day as I find my hair needs some deep moisture treatment in between volume treatments but I have a great routine going with this conditioner. Would definitely recommend to any friend!</li>
            <li> kind of weights my hair down.</li>
            <li> I like all Paul Mitchell products. I have been using them for 20 years.</li>
            <li> I really love this produce but I wish it lathered more during use.  It is a great every day shampoo for thin hair.</li>
            <li> I order shampoo but unfortunately I got body rinse. I wish someone send me shampoo instead of EXTRA BODY RINSE. Thanks. katherine</li>
