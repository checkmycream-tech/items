            <li>I didn&#x27;t notice any change or improvement in color, but it is good otherwise.</li>

            <li>, makes my hair shine, it does smell nice and we all know the Pantene brand makes good</li>
            <li>I am not using the shampoo of its kind and still have good results.  </li>
            <li>Likewise, I love the upside-down bottle!</li>
            <li>But, I can tell you that my color continued to look outstanding!  </li>
            <li>with all Pantene conditioners, the smell is amazing.</li>

            <li>I am thrilled</li>

            <li>Another nice Pantene conditioner, safe for color treated hair.  </li>
            <li>This is a good-quality conditioner with a pleasant sweet fragrance.  </li>
            <li>The scent is great, but not as good as the old Pantene fragrance.</li>
            <li>Nice generous sized container -- easy to dispense without the contents squooshing out non stop.</li>
            <li>All Hair Types - Men, Women and Teens - Safe for Color Treated Hair - By Maple Holistics]]</li>
            <li>that is more than twice the cost of Pantene, yet I&#x27;ll gladly spend it given what it does for my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>, this is an inexpensive (~$6/bottle) conditioner that is an ok value</li>
            <li>After using up the tube of conditioner that is included with the hair dye, this Pantene Pro-V conditioner is perfect for regular use.</li>
            <li>While the conditioner isnâ€™t as important as the shampoo with regard to color retention, it is still nice to use a coordinating shampoo and conditioner.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m just glad it&#x27;s still there.</li>
            <li>Pantene Pro-V Color Conditioner worked ok.</li>
            <li>This keeps your hair nice and smooth.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s excellent on low lights too.</li>
            <li>she&#x27;s still able to style it in anyway</li>
            <li>I am in love with this conditioner.</li>
            <li>I love the appealing fragrance, the creamy thickness, and the rinse-ability of this product.</li>
            <li>First off this smells amazing!  </li>
            <li>Always a problem protecting my hair color and also keeping that healthy shine.  </li>
            <li>LOVE THIS CONDITIONER AND</li>
            <li>THAT WAS ABLE TO BUY IT IN BULK</li>
            <li>too!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I may be biased because I do like and use most Pantene products, but now this conditioner is one of my favorite ones.</li>
            <li>why spend more on a &amp;#34;prestige&amp;#34; brand when Pantene works so well?</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d recommend this if you&#x27;re looking for more moisture, radiance or shine.</li>
            <li>If you look on my shelves at home in my bathroom, most products are Pantene.</li>
            <li>Currently I&#x27;m in love with &amp;</li>
            <li>Love this hair conditioner.</li>
            <li>Love this shampoo.</li>
            <li>It was very easy to work through hair and fairly easy to rinse.</li>
            <li>Seems like a pretty good conditioner.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It has a great smell and conditions her hair where it is so very soft.</li>
            <li>It has a nice light clean fragrance that I like.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used several Pantene shampoos and conditioners and they all seem to be very good</li>
            <li>You don&#x27;t need a lot of it and it rinses easily.</li>
            <li>It leaves the hair shiny and easy to brush.</li>
            <li>Has a very mild fragrance.</li>
            <li>This returned it to its soft, silky, and shiny state, which is good :-)&lt;br</li>
            <li>Awesome product that doesn&#x27;t weigh my hair down.  </li>
            <li>you can get this on sale, then it&#x27;s a fine product.</li>
            <li>I am a huge fan of Pantene products.</li>
            <li>*  Micro-polishers smooth the outer layer of hair to help Protect color and leave hair shiny</li>
            <li>I bought this pack of conditioner by Pantene because I got such a great deal on Amazon.</li>
            <li>I love Pantene and love thhis conditioner, I was able to stock up at a very very low price.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a good daily conditioner but nothing special.</li>
            <li>Let me start off by saying that my wife is a big fan of Panten products, because them seem to make good quality products.</li>
            <li>However check prices to make sure it is reasonable.</li>
            <li>I can style my hair with soft waves and still have a nice bounce to it.</li>
            <li>I have tried loads of products, most do a reasonable job</li>
            <li>Good for color treated hair and contains antioxidants that work from the hairs surface to the ends and infuses your hair with deep moisture to the core.</li>
            <li>Not bad.</li>
            <li>If you enjoy the Pantene line and have colored hair, this should be right up your alley.</li>
            <li>This product conditions nicely and has a pleasant subtle fragrance.</li>
            <li>As far as color preserve I would assume that would be more important in your shampoo than your conditioner because the shampoo is the one that can strip the color from your hair.  </li>
            <li>While my wife and I do not color our hair, we&#x27;ve found the color protection conditioners just seem to bind to the hair better and offer more shine/protection even for non colored hair (obviously for colored here</li>
            <li>In fact I couldn&#x27;t see what was different between this and most of the other pantene products, they are all nice smelling, excellent for dry hair but leave a bit of a film on the hair that can build up over time</li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s great for everyday use</li>
            <li>It does leave my hair soft, shiny and manageable, but honestly, I can&#x27;t tell that much difference between this, Suave and Paul Mitchell.  </li>
            <li>and if you&#x27;re looking to try something to extend the life of your hair color, it&#x27;s worth trying.</li>
            <li>I will continue to use it as it performs well as an overall conditioner, but I&#x27;m not convinced it will revive your hair color or preserve it on its own.</li>
            <li>For what it&#x27;s worth, I&#x27;m keeping my Tresemme.  </li>
            <li>For whatever reason my hair just seems more manageable and soft.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve noticed that it was a good shampoo to detangle hair using fingers while wet</li>
            <li>It left a really nice scent in my hair all day and gave it a nice shine that was more than ordinary.  </li>
            <li>Leaves my hair smelling nice all day long.  </li>
            <li>It smooth my hair much better than the other brand.</li>
            <li>Fresh certainly, touch of floral?</li>
            <li>/&gt;Beauty products are so very personal and what some might love, others might dislike.  </li>
            <li>IIt&#x27;s her second favorite conditioner.</li>
            <li>exactly what I wanted</li>
            <li>first thing I noticed when I opened the bottle was the fragrance.  </li>
            <li>I currently use Fekkai Color Care products but  Pantene seems to work just as will with a much better price point.</li>
            <li>Pantene has lines of products it seems (Protection, Smoothness, Natural Oil Smoothness, Volume, etc) and this seems to fit into the Protection/Smoothness categories quite well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>For color renewal/retention, I get better results using L&#x27;Oreal Colorist Collection Blondes White Violet Conditioner once a week.</li>
            <li>I really wanted to love this, especially since it gets such outstanding reviews.</li>
            <li>However, my hair is also dry and very fine.</li>
            <li>It makes her highlights last a great deal longer than when she uses any other product.</li>
            <li>and I like the texture it leaves my short, fine hair.</li>
            <li>, it is certainly decent, yet wouldn&#x27;t be my first choice.</li>
            <li>The scent is what I would expect from a Pantene condition, except that it smells slightly sweeter and more pleasant than the usual one I have used.  </li>
            <li>I actually have to alternate between brands of shampoo &amp; conditioner, but overall the conditioner works great.  </li>
            <li>and it really does help to preserve unnatural colors in hair.</li>
            <li>It leaves my hair feeling so smooth and definitely shiny.  </li>
            <li>but this one really works for me.  </li>
            <li>so I don&#x27;t really need conditioner for tangles.</li>
            <li>It also really brings out the shine.</li>
            <li>I always enjoy the smell of their products - and this conditioner is no different.  </li>
            <li>this is the whole point here).  </li>
            <li>I really like Pantene products, and I like this conditioner.</li>
            <li>In fact, it really perked my waves up.</li>
            <li>It conditions my hair,and it IS shiny, but my hair feels much softer when I use the Pantene Moisture Renewal conditioner.</li>
            <li>It smells good, the same scent as all other Pantene  products that I have ever tried.</li>
            <li>Pantene shampoos and conditioners usually have a nice fragrance and work well, but this one has a fantastic fragrance and works to not only protect my coloring, but also add shine and hydration to my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Pantene Pro-V Color Preserve Shine Conditioner is better than average and by average, I&#x27;m talking the many inexpensive options that you can find almost anywhere.</li>
            <li>and I really like this new product.  </li>
            <li>when the price is spot on and more than 20% LESS from either the food market or CVS/Walgreens</li>
            <li>She comes back to this over and over, she has tried a lot of different conditioners and this is her favorite.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s good for long hair, leaving it moisturized and smoothed, and it does not weigh hair down at all.</li>
            <li>This particular conditioner has taken over as first choice for the color treated hair users here especially because it has such a light scent.  </li>
            <li>If you were starting with fresh color, maybe.</li>
            <li>B00L1KFQKC Natural Conditioner By Maple Holistics - Sulfate Free Treatment for Dry and Damaged Hair - 18 Silk Amino Acids, Argan, Jojoba, and Botanical Keratin -</li>
            <li>Very smooth formula, stands up to it&#x27;s name, the usual you&#x27;d expect from this brand.</li>
            <li>In any case, I wouldn&#x27;t be surprised if all those shampoos weren&#x27;t the same underneath the colorful labels.  </li>
            <li>Leaves hair very soft, manageable, and with lots of body-</li>
            <li>It has a strong scent and didn&#x27;t really make my hair feel conditioned with a slick feeling.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not noticing a big difference in the color preservation of my highlights, but as it doesn&#x27;t cost any more than any of the other Pantene conditioners I&#x27;ll take the  chance that it might be helping.</li>
            <li>Leaves hair soft and shiny!</li>
            <li>It has the usual clean smell from most of the Pantene line, but also a slight additional smell of freshness that is difficult to describe, other than being very pleasant.  </li>
            <li>She enhances the color of her hair with L&#x27;oreal and then uses Pro-V shampoo and Conditioner.&lt;br /&gt;I have even tried the conditioner; and clearly understand why she uses nothing else.&lt;br /&gt;Now</li>
            <li>My hair tends to get greasy at the roots if I don&#x27;t wash it every day and sometimes I get buildup, but so far I haven&#x27;t with this</li>
            <li>It leaves gets the tangles out and leaves hair feeling soft.</li>
            <li>gentle enough for permed hair&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>She waits for it to go one sale because she&#x27;s price conscious</li>
            <li>As far as keeping my color from fading, well time will tell.</li>
            <li>As far as preserving color, that&#x27;s another issue.</li>
            <li>My hair is on the finer side and this conditioner is not heavy or gives me a lot of build up.  </li>
            <li>It delivers glossy, soft, manageable hair--</li>
            <li>/&gt;It took about the same amount as Pantene always takes, which for my long hair is about a palm full - shorter hair can probably get by with about a quarter sized amount.</li>
            <li>so I really don&#x27;t have long soft tresses but the shine and the body that the Pantene Pro-V Color Preserve gives my hair</li>
            <li>Overall, I thought it was ok, but nothing out of the ordinary for a hair conditioner.</li>
            <li>They smell good but only cleans the hair, never felt the conditioning part, left My hair thick and dry and stiff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Few seem to do anything extraordinary.</li>
            <li>I bleach and color my hair in vivid hues (currently lavender)</li>
            <li>I honestly usually use a cheap shampoo and splurge on my conditioner, luckily Pantene is affordable at $3-$4 a bottle usually.</li>
            <li>It is a thick, rich, creamy conditioner that leaves my hair feeling soft and manageable.</li>
            <li>Now, since I have my hair colored monthly, my color usually remains pretty vibrant ...</li>
            <li>It leaves hair nice and fragrant, just clean smelling and not at all annoying or cloying.</li>
            <li>Once I did, and styled as usual, I didn&#x27;t notice any special effects.</li>
            <li>But mine is three weeks old and I will not know if it actually preserves my color until I try it longer</li>
            <li>I color a portion of my hair regularly and need a pretty heavy conditioner.</li>
            <li>The consistency is thick, a little goes a long way and the scent is quite nice, yet not overpowering.</li>
            <li>I would definitely recommend this version to anyone who wants a little extra shine and bounce in their hair.</li>

            <li> with all Pantene conditioners, the smell is amazing.</li>
            <li> It always leaves my hair nice and shiny.</li>
            <li> I am thrilled</li>
            <li> It is designed for color treated hair but you can use it with natural too so excellent for everyone.  </li>
            <li> Another nice Pantene conditioner, safe for color treated hair.  </li>
            <li> This is a good-quality conditioner with a pleasant sweet fragrance.  </li>
            <li> The scent is great, but not as good as the old Pantene fragrance.</li>
            <li> Nice generous sized container -- easy to dispense without the contents squooshing out non stop.</li>
            <li> All Hair Types - Men, Women and Teens - Safe for Color Treated Hair - By Maple Holistics]]</li>
            <li> that is more than twice the cost of Pantene, yet I&#x27;ll gladly spend it given what it does for my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> , this is an inexpensive (~$6/bottle) conditioner that is an ok value</li>
            <li> After using up the tube of conditioner that is included with the hair dye, this Pantene Pro-V conditioner is perfect for regular use.</li>
            <li> While the conditioner isnâ€™t as important as the shampoo with regard to color retention, it is still nice to use a coordinating shampoo and conditioner.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m just glad it&#x27;s still there.</li>
            <li> Pantene Pro-V Color Conditioner worked ok.</li>
            <li> This keeps your hair nice and smooth.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s excellent on low lights too.</li>
            <li> she&#x27;s still able to style it in anyway</li>
            <li> I am in love with this conditioner.</li>
            <li> I love the appealing fragrance, the creamy thickness, and the rinse-ability of this product.</li>
            <li> First off this smells amazing!  </li>
            <li> Always a problem protecting my hair color and also keeping that healthy shine.  </li>
            <li> LOVE THIS CONDITIONER AND</li>
            <li> THAT WAS ABLE TO BUY IT IN BULK</li>
            <li> too!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I may be biased because I do like and use most Pantene products, but now this conditioner is one of my favorite ones.</li>
            <li> why spend more on a &amp;#34;prestige&amp;#34; brand when Pantene works so well?</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d recommend this if you&#x27;re looking for more moisture, radiance or shine.</li>
            <li> If you look on my shelves at home in my bathroom, most products are Pantene.</li>
            <li> Currently I&#x27;m in love with &amp;</li>
            <li> Love this hair conditioner.</li>
            <li> Love this shampoo.</li>
            <li> It was very easy to work through hair and fairly easy to rinse.</li>
            <li> Seems like a pretty good conditioner.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It has a great smell and conditions her hair where it is so very soft.</li>
            <li> It has a nice light clean fragrance that I like.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used several Pantene shampoos and conditioners and they all seem to be very good</li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t need a lot of it and it rinses easily.</li>
            <li> It leaves the hair shiny and easy to brush.</li>
            <li> Has a very mild fragrance.</li>
            <li> This returned it to its soft, silky, and shiny state, which is good :-)&lt;br</li>
            <li> Awesome product that doesn&#x27;t weigh my hair down.  </li>
            <li> you can get this on sale, then it&#x27;s a fine product.</li>
            <li> I am a huge fan of Pantene products.</li>
            <li> *  Micro-polishers smooth the outer layer of hair to help Protect color and leave hair shiny</li>
            <li> I bought this pack of conditioner by Pantene because I got such a great deal on Amazon.</li>
            <li> I love Pantene and love thhis conditioner, I was able to stock up at a very very low price.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good daily conditioner but nothing special.</li>
            <li> Let me start off by saying that my wife is a big fan of Panten products, because them seem to make good quality products.</li>
            <li> However check prices to make sure it is reasonable.</li>
            <li> I can style my hair with soft waves and still have a nice bounce to it.</li>
            <li> I have tried loads of products, most do a reasonable job</li>
            <li> Good for color treated hair and contains antioxidants that work from the hairs surface to the ends and infuses your hair with deep moisture to the core.</li>
            <li> Not bad.</li>
            <li> If you enjoy the Pantene line and have colored hair, this should be right up your alley.</li>
            <li> This product conditions nicely and has a pleasant subtle fragrance.</li>
            <li> As far as color preserve I would assume that would be more important in your shampoo than your conditioner because the shampoo is the one that can strip the color from your hair.  </li>
            <li> While my wife and I do not color our hair, we&#x27;ve found the color protection conditioners just seem to bind to the hair better and offer more shine/protection even for non colored hair (obviously for colored here</li>
            <li> In fact I couldn&#x27;t see what was different between this and most of the other pantene products, they are all nice smelling, excellent for dry hair but leave a bit of a film on the hair that can build up over time</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s great for everyday use</li>
            <li> It does leave my hair soft, shiny and manageable, but honestly, I can&#x27;t tell that much difference between this, Suave and Paul Mitchell.  </li>
            <li> and if you&#x27;re looking to try something to extend the life of your hair color, it&#x27;s worth trying.</li>
            <li> I will continue to use it as it performs well as an overall conditioner, but I&#x27;m not convinced it will revive your hair color or preserve it on its own.</li>
            <li> For what it&#x27;s worth, I&#x27;m keeping my Tresemme.  </li>
            <li> For whatever reason my hair just seems more manageable and soft.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve noticed that it was a good shampoo to detangle hair using fingers while wet</li>
            <li> It left a really nice scent in my hair all day and gave it a nice shine that was more than ordinary.  </li>
            <li> Leaves my hair smelling nice all day long.  </li>
            <li> It smooth my hair much better than the other brand.</li>
            <li> Fresh certainly, touch of floral?</li>
            <li> /&gt;Beauty products are so very personal and what some might love, others might dislike.  </li>
            <li> IIt&#x27;s her second favorite conditioner.</li>
            <li> exactly what I wanted</li>
            <li> first thing I noticed when I opened the bottle was the fragrance.  </li>
            <li> I currently use Fekkai Color Care products but  Pantene seems to work just as will with a much better price point.</li>
            <li> Pantene has lines of products it seems (Protection, Smoothness, Natural Oil Smoothness, Volume, etc) and this seems to fit into the Protection/Smoothness categories quite well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> For color renewal/retention, I get better results using L&#x27;Oreal Colorist Collection Blondes White Violet Conditioner once a week.</li>
            <li> I really wanted to love this, especially since it gets such outstanding reviews.</li>
            <li> However, my hair is also dry and very fine.</li>
            <li> It makes her highlights last a great deal longer than when she uses any other product.</li>
            <li> and I like the texture it leaves my short, fine hair.</li>
            <li> , it is certainly decent, yet wouldn&#x27;t be my first choice.</li>
            <li> The scent is what I would expect from a Pantene condition, except that it smells slightly sweeter and more pleasant than the usual one I have used.  </li>
            <li> I actually have to alternate between brands of shampoo &amp; conditioner, but overall the conditioner works great.  </li>
            <li> and it really does help to preserve unnatural colors in hair.</li>
            <li> It leaves my hair feeling so smooth and definitely shiny.  </li>
            <li> but this one really works for me.  </li>
            <li> so I don&#x27;t really need conditioner for tangles.</li>
            <li> It also really brings out the shine.</li>
            <li> I always enjoy the smell of their products - and this conditioner is no different.  </li>
            <li> this is the whole point here).  </li>
            <li> I really like Pantene products, and I like this conditioner.</li>
            <li> In fact, it really perked my waves up.</li>
            <li> It conditions my hair,and it IS shiny, but my hair feels much softer when I use the Pantene Moisture Renewal conditioner.</li>
            <li> It smells good, the same scent as all other Pantene  products that I have ever tried.</li>
            <li> Pantene shampoos and conditioners usually have a nice fragrance and work well, but this one has a fantastic fragrance and works to not only protect my coloring, but also add shine and hydration to my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Pantene Pro-V Color Preserve Shine Conditioner is better than average and by average, I&#x27;m talking the many inexpensive options that you can find almost anywhere.</li>
            <li> and I really like this new product.  </li>
            <li> when the price is spot on and more than 20% LESS from either the food market or CVS/Walgreens</li>
            <li> She comes back to this over and over, she has tried a lot of different conditioners and this is her favorite.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s good for long hair, leaving it moisturized and smoothed, and it does not weigh hair down at all.</li>
            <li> This particular conditioner has taken over as first choice for the color treated hair users here especially because it has such a light scent.  </li>
            <li> If you were starting with fresh color, maybe.</li>
            <li> B00L1KFQKC Natural Conditioner By Maple Holistics - Sulfate Free Treatment for Dry and Damaged Hair - 18 Silk Amino Acids, Argan, Jojoba, and Botanical Keratin -</li>
            <li> Very smooth formula, stands up to it&#x27;s name, the usual you&#x27;d expect from this brand.</li>
            <li> In any case, I wouldn&#x27;t be surprised if all those shampoos weren&#x27;t the same underneath the colorful labels.  </li>
            <li> Leaves hair very soft, manageable, and with lots of body-</li>
            <li> It has a strong scent and didn&#x27;t really make my hair feel conditioned with a slick feeling.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not noticing a big difference in the color preservation of my highlights, but as it doesn&#x27;t cost any more than any of the other Pantene conditioners I&#x27;ll take the  chance that it might be helping.</li>
            <li> Leaves hair soft and shiny!</li>
            <li> It has the usual clean smell from most of the Pantene line, but also a slight additional smell of freshness that is difficult to describe, other than being very pleasant.  </li>
            <li> She enhances the color of her hair with L&#x27;oreal and then uses Pro-V shampoo and Conditioner.&lt;br /&gt;I have even tried the conditioner; and clearly understand why she uses nothing else.&lt;br /&gt;Now</li>
            <li> My hair tends to get greasy at the roots if I don&#x27;t wash it every day and sometimes I get buildup, but so far I haven&#x27;t with this</li>
            <li> It leaves gets the tangles out and leaves hair feeling soft.</li>
            <li> gentle enough for permed hair&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> She waits for it to go one sale because she&#x27;s price conscious</li>
            <li> As far as keeping my color from fading, well time will tell.</li>
            <li> As far as preserving color, that&#x27;s another issue.</li>
            <li> My hair is on the finer side and this conditioner is not heavy or gives me a lot of build up.  </li>
            <li> It delivers glossy, soft, manageable hair--</li>
            <li> /&gt;It took about the same amount as Pantene always takes, which for my long hair is about a palm full - shorter hair can probably get by with about a quarter sized amount.</li>
            <li> so I really don&#x27;t have long soft tresses but the shine and the body that the Pantene Pro-V Color Preserve gives my hair</li>
            <li> Overall, I thought it was ok, but nothing out of the ordinary for a hair conditioner.</li>
            <li> They smell good but only cleans the hair, never felt the conditioning part, left My hair thick and dry and stiff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Few seem to do anything extraordinary.</li>
            <li> I bleach and color my hair in vivid hues (currently lavender)</li>
            <li> I honestly usually use a cheap shampoo and splurge on my conditioner, luckily Pantene is affordable at $3-$4 a bottle usually.</li>
            <li> It is a thick, rich, creamy conditioner that leaves my hair feeling soft and manageable.</li>
            <li> Now, since I have my hair colored monthly, my color usually remains pretty vibrant ...</li>
            <li> It leaves hair nice and fragrant, just clean smelling and not at all annoying or cloying.</li>
            <li> Once I did, and styled as usual, I didn&#x27;t notice any special effects.</li>
            <li> But mine is three weeks old and I will not know if it actually preserves my color until I try it longer</li>
            <li> I color a portion of my hair regularly and need a pretty heavy conditioner.</li>
            <li> The consistency is thick, a little goes a long way and the scent is quite nice, yet not overpowering.</li>
            <li> I would definitely recommend this version to anyone who wants a little extra shine and bounce in their hair.</li>
            <li> This conditioner makes my hair feel silky soft and actually adds some body to it rather than weighing it down.</li>
            <li> I color my hair and try to use either shampoo or conditioner to protect the color and get a long lasting shine.  </li>
            <li> It always leaves my hair smooth, shiny, and bouncy (which is not easy with my long, thick, wavy hair).</li>
            <li> I have been coloring my hair with semi-permanent coloring lately because I have found one that I really like the color</li>
            <li> I have long hair</li>
            <li> (I can say that because you don&#x27;t know her, otherwise I&#x27;d be a dead man) and in fact I&#x27;ve never seen her in her natural color.</li>
            <li> I have grey hair</li>
            <li> As a conditioner, this Pantene product is very similar to other types of Pantene conditioners for uncolored hair --</li>
            <li> do find that Pantene is usually quite affordable on Amazon, often being less than at local grocery and drug stores, but here&#x27;s a tip - check Amazon&#x27;s coupon page, they frequently offer Pantene coupons and if they do, it could save you a bit.</li>
            <li> As always it could be a great deal or horrible deal.</li>
            <li> but you have to really be careful about how often you wash and careful with the shampoos and conditioners that you use because semi-permanent hair color washes away with each hair wash.</li>
            <li> She says she has minimal build up on her hair as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> this, I had a harder time combing out tangles.</li>
            <li> I would start off by purchasing one regular sized bottle and trying it for a few days before committing yourself to buying a case of it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a thick white lotion and while it promises radiance, I didn&#x27;t notice anything different.</li>
            <li> I have baby fine, thin hair and even though the product is thick it doesn&#x27;t weigh my hair down at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Then using it, I noticed that as with other Pantene products Iâ€™ve used, a little goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> I am a big user of Pantene shampoo and conditioner and find that they work well for the type of hair in our household: thick, wavy/curly and dry.</li>
            <li> I find my color doesn&#x27;t last ordinarily beyond 2-3 weeks using a over the counter root color product.</li>
            <li> Blindfolded, I don&#x27;t think I could tell this conditioner from any other in that price range:</li>
            <li> I usually use Tresemme as the answer to my tangle problems (which are really a big problem for me).  </li>
            <li> and she says even some of the other pantene conditioners don&#x27;t work as well, her hair is manageable without being greasy.</li>
            <li> She loves that her hair doesn&#x27;t turn copper after she dyes it like the other ones.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t weigh down the hair and styling</li>
            <li> and it does not weigh down my hair.  </li>
            <li> I did not find that it weighed down my hair at all.&lt;br /&gt;My</li>
            <li> the typical Tresemme, L&#x27;Oreal, Garnier, Finesse row at the drugstore.  </li>
            <li> It is thick so a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> (as least that&#x27;s what she tells me because I notice very little about such things).  </li>
            <li> Keeps your color a little longer as well.</li>
            <li> less stiff.</li>
            <li> This is one of a few Pantene conditioners I rotate through.  </li>
            <li> I usually wash my hair everyday</li>
            <li> I found very little to make the Color Revival stand out as a product for colored hair.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s thick, feels slick in your hand as you apply it and what I would consider a heavy conditioner.</li>
            <li> I usually use this at nite --</li>
            <li> she chooses, because it doesn&#x27;t leave a slick feel to her hair.</li>
            <li> It did nothing out of the ordinary.  </li>
            <li> It is convenient buying in the 6 pack as it lasts e for a few months without having to go to the store to buy another one!</li>
            <li> After using it, my hair seemed easier to control than usual, perhaps because of the hydration.  </li>
            <li> I have been testing a lot of Pantene conditioners lately.</li>
            <li> It left my hair looking dirty and oily by the end of the day.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately I found it to be just average.</li>
            <li> (sorry I don&#x27;t do Wal-Mart)it is not too hard to understand why we now subscribe to it.</li>
            <li> Her hair color doesn&#x27;t bleach out or fade as badly now that she&#x27;s using this</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Pantene Pro-V Color Preserve Shine Conditioner is better than average and by average, I&#x27;m talking the many inexpensive options that you can find almost anywhere. The consistency is thick, a little goes a long way and the scent is quite nice, yet not overpowering. Fresh certainly, touch of floral? It does leave my hair soft, shiny and manageable, but honestly, I can&#x27;t tell that much difference between this, Suave and Paul Mitchell.  As to the color preserving effects, I can only guess that the ingredients will work to keep the color in the hair. Time will tell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Beauty products are so very personal and what some might love, others might dislike.  I won&#x27;t say that Pantene Pro-V Color Preserve Shine Conditioner isn&#x27;t good, it is certainly decent, yet wouldn&#x27;t be my first choice. What would be is [[ASIN:B00L1KFQKC Natural Conditioner By Maple Holistics - Sulfate Free Treatment for Dry and Damaged Hair - 18 Silk Amino Acids, Argan, Jojoba, and Botanical Keratin - All Hair Types - Men, Women and Teens - Safe for Color Treated Hair - By Maple Holistics]] that is more than twice the cost of Pantene, yet I&#x27;ll gladly spend it given what it does for my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the end, this is an inexpensive (~$6/bottle) conditioner that is an ok value and if you&#x27;re looking to try something to extend the life of your hair color, it&#x27;s worth trying. It does condition well, makes my hair shine, it does smell nice and we all know the Pantene brand makes good products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Edit:  I received Pantene Color Revival, not Color Preserve! So this review is about Pantene Color Preserve.</li>
            <li> took a while to get here but for cheap i cant complain these were excellent!</li>
            <li> I have been converted to Pantene Pro-V hair products for their usefulness and price points.  This particular conditioner has taken over as first choice for the color treated hair users here especially because it has such a light scent.  After using up the tube of conditioner that is included with the hair dye, this Pantene Pro-V conditioner is perfect for regular use. It doesn&#x27;t weigh down the hair and styling tends to last longer with healthier hair.</li>
            <li> I actually have to alternate between brands of shampoo &amp; conditioner, but overall the conditioner works great.  My hair tends to get greasy at the roots if I don&#x27;t wash it every day and sometimes I get buildup, but so far I haven&#x27;t with this and it does not weigh down my hair.  I&#x27;ve only just switched to this conditioner for about a week, so of course my opinion could change after I&#x27;ve been using it longer, so if it does I will update my review at that time.</li>
            <li> This review is for Pantene Pro-V Color Revival conditioner which I received. I am a big user of Pantene shampoo and conditioner and find that they work well for the type of hair in our household: thick, wavy/curly and dry. I color a portion of my hair regularly and need a pretty heavy conditioner. I find my color doesn&#x27;t last ordinarily beyond 2-3 weeks using a over the counter root color product. As a conditioner, this Pantene product is very similar to other types of Pantene conditioners for uncolored hair -- it&#x27;s thick, feels slick in your hand as you apply it and what I would consider a heavy conditioner. I have long hair so I use alot (about 2 tbsp) but that&#x27;s overkill. Without using this product alongside the shampoo (which can strip color) I found very little to make the Color Revival stand out as a product for colored hair. I will continue to use it as it performs well as an overall conditioner, but I&#x27;m not convinced it will revive your hair color or preserve it on its own.</li>
            <li> Great Product for a great price</li>
            <li> My number 1 to go product to buy and use.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a big fan of Pantene shampoos and conditioners, in fact they are all I use now. This product conditions nicely and has a pleasant subtle fragrance. I&#x27;m not noticing a big difference in the color preservation of my highlights, but as it doesn&#x27;t cost any more than any of the other Pantene conditioners I&#x27;ll take the  chance that it might be helping.</li>
            <li> Good deal. It leaves gets the tangles out and leaves hair feeling soft. Ive used pantene for years and will continue to.</li>
            <li> I have used Pantene for years and I really like this new product.  The scent is what I would expect from a Pantene condition, except that it smells slightly sweeter and more pleasant than the usual one I have used.  It left a really nice scent in my hair all day and gave it a nice shine that was more than ordinary.  I would definitely recommend this version to anyone who wants a little extra shine and bounce in their hair.</li>
            <li> Nice generous sized container -- easy to dispense without the contents squooshing out non stop. I usually use this at nite -- I sleep on it (I wear a cap over it) and wash it out the next morning, My hair is very short and I also use hair gel so I really don&#x27;t have long soft tresses but the shine and the body that the Pantene Pro-V Color Preserve gives my hair is GREAT.</li>
            <li> I have been coloring my hair with semi-permanent coloring lately because I have found one that I really like the color but you have to really be careful about how often you wash and careful with the shampoos and conditioners that you use because semi-permanent hair color washes away with each hair wash. While the conditioner isnâ€™t as important as the shampoo with regard to color retention, it is still nice to use a coordinating shampoo and conditioner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Features:&lt;br /&gt;*  Micro-polishers smooth the outer layer of hair to help Protect color and leave hair shiny&lt;br /&gt;*  Lightweight moisturizers Provide Protection against damage&lt;br /&gt;*  Designed for color-treated hair; gentle enough for permed hair&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As with all Pantene conditioners, the smell is amazing. It is a thick, rich, creamy conditioner that leaves my hair feeling soft and manageable.</li>
            <li> You get what you pay for</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t find this in the stores anymore.  Works great.  Gets the frzzies.</li>
            <li> I have always used head and shoulder 2 in 1 shampoo &amp; conditioner. They smell good but only cleans the hair, never felt the conditioning part, left My hair thick and dry and stiff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Noticeable difference just a couple times after using this conditioner along with pantenes shampoo. hair feels softer.  less stiff. perhaps because  i didnt have dandruff but used h&amp;s&#x27;s dandruff 2 in 1. but never going back to head and shoulder again.</li>
            <li> Awesome product that doesn&#x27;t weigh my hair down.  I love it.</li>
            <li> My wife colors her hair (I can say that because you don&#x27;t know her, otherwise I&#x27;d be a dead man) and in fact I&#x27;ve never seen her in her natural color. I have grey hair and I&#x27;m just glad it&#x27;s still there. My wife has used Patene Pro-V Conditioner for years and she loves it. IIt&#x27;s her second favorite conditioner. It smells very pleasant but most of all helps to hold in her color (as least that&#x27;s what she tells me because I notice very little about such things).  She waits for it to go one sale because she&#x27;s price conscious but I say what a couple extra bucks over Suave if it&#x27;s something you like or need. One day she may actually take my advice. I haven&#x27;t given up yet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended</li>
            <li> Excellent conditioner and it really does help to preserve unnatural colors in hair. Great smell to boot. Excellent product.</li>
            <li> Pantene Pro-V Color Conditioner worked ok. It has a strong scent and didn&#x27;t really make my hair feel conditioned with a slick feeling. I didn&#x27;t think  my hair was any shinier either. As far as keeping my color from fading, well time will tell. Overall, I thought it was ok, but nothing out of the ordinary for a hair conditioner.</li>
            <li> Let me start off by saying that my wife is a big fan of Panten products, because them seem to make good quality products. This is another one of good quality. It does the job, but is not &amp;#34;heavy&amp;#34; nor is it greasy feeling when used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In short...another good product by this manufacturer.</li>
            <li> This keeps your hair nice and smooth. Keeps your color a little longer as well.</li>
            <li> This product works well, but it is being shipped only as 1 bottle, not the 6 shown in the item description.</li>
            <li> Great conditioner.Gives my hair lots of extra body and shine.</li>
            <li> I bought this pack of conditioner by Pantene because I got such a great deal on Amazon. It&#x27;s a good daily conditioner but nothing special. The scent is great, but not as good as the old Pantene fragrance. Wish they would bring it back!</li>
            <li> My wife loves this conditioner. It helps maintain the bright and shininess of her hair color. It makes her highlights last a great deal longer than when she uses any other product. It&#x27;s excellent on low lights too. Her hair color doesn&#x27;t bleach out or fade as badly now that she&#x27;s using this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has a great smell and conditions her hair where it is so very soft. Even though it softens her hair she&#x27;s still able to style it in anyway she chooses, because it doesn&#x27;t leave a slick feel to her hair. She says she has minimal build up on her hair as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s great for everyday use even if you haven&#x27;t colored your hair. It&#x27;s a wonderful product for the money.</li>
            <li> Blindfolded, I don&#x27;t think I could tell this conditioner from any other in that price range: the typical Tresemme, L&#x27;Oreal, Garnier, Finesse row at the drugstore.  It&#x27;s a thick white lotion and while it promises radiance, I didn&#x27;t notice anything different. I usually use Tresemme as the answer to my tangle problems (which are really a big problem for me).  It allows me to comb out in the shower and have no tangles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With this, I had a harder time combing out tangles. Once I did, and styled as usual, I didn&#x27;t notice any special effects. I asked my husband if it looked shinier, but I don&#x27;t think he&#x27;d notice any way.  To me, it did not increase shine.  It did nothing out of the ordinary.  As far as preserving color, that&#x27;s another issue. If you were starting with fresh color, maybe. But mine is three weeks old and I will not know if it actually preserves my color until I try it longer (I will update review if somehow my color dramatically remains).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you can get this on sale, then it&#x27;s a fine product. Just don&#x27;t expect miracles. For what it&#x27;s worth, I&#x27;m keeping my Tresemme.  In any case, I wouldn&#x27;t be surprised if all those shampoos weren&#x27;t the same underneath the colorful labels.  Few seem to do anything extraordinary.</li>
            <li> This is a great product! It always leaves my hair nice and shiny. It is convenient buying in the 6 pack as it lasts e for a few months without having to go to the store to buy another one! However check prices to make sure it is reasonable. As always it could be a great deal or horrible deal.</li>
            <li> I am in love with this conditioner. It smells good, feels like butter in my hair and it detangles so well!!</li>
            <li> I color my hair and try to use either shampoo or conditioner to protect the color and get a long lasting shine.  After two weeks of using this conditioner, I can say that it works good.  I am not using the shampoo of its kind and still have good results.  It has a pleasant scent, not overpowering.  My hair is on the finer side and this conditioner is not heavy or gives me a lot of build up.  I can style my hair with soft waves and still have a nice bounce to it. I don&#x27;t see a very big change in shine but it is not dulling either.</li>
            <li> This is the best deal I ever got!</li>
            <li> She comes back to this over and over, she has tried a lot of different conditioners and this is her favorite.  She has color treated hair and she says even some of the other pantene conditioners don&#x27;t work as well, her hair is manageable without being greasy.</li>
            <li> This conditioner is great for detangling and softening your hair. I didn&#x27;t notice any change or improvement in color, but it is good otherwise. You don&#x27;t need a lot of it and it rinses easily. It doesn&#x27;t seem to build up on your hair either. It smells good, the same scent as all other Pantene  products that I have ever tried.</li>
            <li> I like it. It smooth my hair much better than the other brand. I was using another brand after shower from swimming and still tangling my hair. This conditioner has improved the tangling issue.</li>
            <li> I have used Pro-V on and off for years. I love the appealing fragrance, the creamy thickness, and the rinse-ability of this product. It always leaves my hair smooth, shiny, and bouncy (which is not easy with my long, thick, wavy hair). Likewise, I love the upside-down bottle! (This ensures that I get every last drop and avoid looking like a cheapskate by having a regular bottle upside-down in my shower).  Now, since I have my hair colored monthly, my color usually remains pretty vibrant ... so, I cannot testify to the fact that this increases your color&#x27;s life. But, I can tell you that my color continued to look outstanding!  This is a staple in my linen closet. It makes my hair gorgeous!</li>
            <li> I love Pantene and love thhis conditioner, I was able to stock up at a very very low price. I am thrilled</li>
            <li> My Mom uses this product and I seen a sale here at Amazon on it so I bought it for her.&lt;br /&gt;Mom has color in her hair and likes this as it works well and  makes her hair shine&lt;br /&gt;Really good price from Amazon</li>
            <li> First off this smells amazing!  It leaves my hair feeling so smooth and definitely shiny.  I dye my hair often and I trust Pantene to protect it.  For whatever reason my hair just seems more manageable and soft.  I honestly usually use a cheap shampoo and splurge on my conditioner, luckily Pantene is affordable at $3-$4 a bottle usually.</li>
            <li> Always a problem protecting my hair color and also keeping that healthy shine.  I have tried loads of products, most do a reasonable job but this one really works for me.  It is designed for color treated hair but you can use it with natural too so excellent for everyone.  I usually wash my hair everyday so I needed something that didn&#x27;t overdo things and this has a light moisturizers so it is perfect.  Very happy with this product</li>
            <li> I have really short hair so I don&#x27;t really need conditioner for tangles. However, my hair is also dry and very fine. This conditioner makes my hair feel silky soft and actually adds some body to it rather than weighing it down. It also really brings out the shine. It has a nice light clean fragrance that I like. I&#x27;ve used several Pantene shampoos and conditioners and they all seem to be very good products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ingredients: Water, Stearyl Alcohol, Behentrimonium Chloride, Cetylalcohol, Bis-Aminopropyl Dimethicone,  Fragrance, Benzyl Alcohol, Disodium Edta, Histidine, Panthenol, Panthenyl Ethyl Ether, Citric Acid, Trisodium Ethylenediamine Disuccinate,  Methylchloroisothiazolinone,  Methylisothiazolinone.</li>
            <li> Excellent price, good quality</li>
            <li> been using it for years and no plans on changing a good thing</li>
            <li> This is a good-quality conditioner with a pleasant sweet fragrance.  It leaves the hair shiny and easy to brush.</li>
            <li> LOVE THIS CONDITIONER AND GREAT THAT WAS ABLE TO BUY IT IN BULK WOULD TELL ANYONE TO PURCHASE THIS PRODUCT TO ANYONE.</li>
            <li> exactly what I wanted</li>
            <li> I have been testing a lot of Pantene conditioners lately. They can be a hit or miss but here is another hit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I occasionally color my hair so I need shampoos and conditioners that protect the color from fading.  Pantene shampoos and conditioners usually have a nice fragrance and work well, but this one has a fantastic fragrance and works to not only protect my coloring, but also add shine and hydration to my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first thing I noticed when I opened the bottle was the fragrance.  It has the usual clean smell from most of the Pantene line, but also a slight additional smell of freshness that is difficult to describe, other than being very pleasant.  Then using it, I noticed that as with other Pantene products Iâ€™ve used, a little goes a long way.  After using it, my hair seemed easier to control than usual, perhaps because of the hydration.  And yes, it adds some shine too!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I may be biased because I do like and use most Pantene products, but now this conditioner is one of my favorite ones.</li>
            <li> Another nice Pantene conditioner, safe for color treated hair.  Pleasant fruity floral scent.  This is one of a few Pantene conditioners I rotate through.  It delivers glossy, soft, manageable hair--why spend more on a &amp;#34;prestige&amp;#34; brand when Pantene works so well?</li>
            <li> I have used Pantene products on and off for several years.  I always enjoy the smell of their products - and this conditioner is no different.  In fact I couldn&#x27;t see what was different between this and most of the other pantene products, they are all nice smelling, excellent for dry hair but leave a bit of a film on the hair that can build up over time so I swap out products every bottle.  As far as color preserve I would assume that would be more important in your shampoo than your conditioner because the shampoo is the one that can strip the color from your hair.  If you enjoy the Pantene line and have colored hair, this should be right up your alley.</li>
            <li> Very smooth formula, stands up to it&#x27;s name, the usual you&#x27;d expect from this brand. Good for color treated hair and contains antioxidants that work from the hairs surface to the ends and infuses your hair with deep moisture to the core. Good for reduction of protein loss and helping to maintain, protect and improve the hairs health from the inside out. I&#x27;d recommend this if you&#x27;re looking for more moisture, radiance or shine. Has a very mild fragrance. Good for highlighted or color treated hair.</li>
            <li> I am a huge fan of Pantene products. If you look on my shelves at home in my bathroom, most products are Pantene. However, I wasn&#x27;t too big of a fan of this Preserve Shine Conditioner.  It left my hair looking dirty and oily by the end of the day. Probably my hair type, but this might not work for everyone.  I would start off by purchasing one regular sized bottle and trying it for a few days before committing yourself to buying a case of it.</li>
            <li> My wife has been using this for over 10 years. She enhances the color of her hair with L&#x27;oreal and then uses Pro-V shampoo and Conditioner.&lt;br /&gt;I have even tried the conditioner; and clearly understand why she uses nothing else.&lt;br /&gt;Now when the price is spot on and more than 20% LESS from either the food market or CVS/Walgreens (sorry I don&#x27;t do Wal-Mart)it is not too hard to understand why we now subscribe to it.</li>
            <li> Seems like a pretty good conditioner.  I like the smell and I like the texture it leaves my short, fine hair.</li>
            <li> I bleach and color my hair in vivid hues (currently lavender) so I need shampoo/conditioner that don&#x27;t fade my colors. Pro-V Color Revival Conditioner is wonderful-no color bleeding!  It is thick so a little goes a long way. I also mix this with my color when I want a lighter shade or some extra deep conditioning  I have baby fine, thin hair and even though the product is thick it doesn&#x27;t weigh my hair down at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some reviewers talk about tangles, I always have this problem no matter what conditioner I use so I use a detangler after the shower. Currently I&#x27;m in love with &amp;#34;It&#x27;s A 10 leave in Conditioner with Keratin&amp;#34;.  Works GREAT and smells wonderful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product works great with my purple hair, and now I want to get the shampoo to try as well. I currently use Fekkai Color Care products but  Pantene seems to work just as will with a much better price point.</li>
            <li> I wanted a product that made my hair appear thicker and fuller, and after reading the reviews I decided to get the Pantene combo of shampoo, conditioner and styling gel. I&#x27;m very happy with the results.</li>
            <li> While my wife and I do not color our hair, we&#x27;ve found the color protection conditioners just seem to bind to the hair better and offer more shine/protection even for non colored hair (obviously for colored here this is the whole point here).  Pantene has lines of products it seems (Protection, Smoothness, Natural Oil Smoothness, Volume, etc) and this seems to fit into the Protection/Smoothness categories quite well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Smell is pleasant and conditioner can be had for a good affordable price.</li>
            <li> Love this hair conditioner. It doesn&#x27;t fade my hair like others. It smells so good and doesn&#x27;t make my hair feel oily or greasy. Bought the 6 pack and gave 2 bottles to my sister. She loves that her hair doesn&#x27;t turn copper after she dyes it like the other ones.</li>
            <li> Leaves hair soft and shiny!</li>
            <li> I really like Pantene products, and I like this conditioner. It&#x27;s good for long hair, leaving it moisturized and smoothed, and it does not weigh hair down at all. In fact, it really perked my waves up. It leaves hair nice and fragrant, just clean smelling and not at all annoying or cloying. My hair definitely has a bit of increased shine.&lt;br /&gt;It took about the same amount as Pantene always takes, which for my long hair is about a palm full - shorter hair can probably get by with about a quarter sized amount. It was very easy to work through hair and fairly easy to rinse. I&#x27;ve noticed that it was a good shampoo to detangle hair using fingers while wet with.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s not quite as moisturizing as the Repair and Protect formula in this line, but it is excellent and I&#x27;d use it again. Leaves hair very soft, manageable, and with lots of body- I did not find that it weighed down my hair at all.&lt;br /&gt;My son uses color on his hair and he likes it too. Pantene is the only brand he ever asks me to buy.&lt;br /&gt;I do find that Pantene is usually quite affordable on Amazon, often being less than at local grocery and drug stores, but here&#x27;s a tip - check Amazon&#x27;s coupon page, they frequently offer Pantene coupons and if they do, it could save you a bit.</li>
            <li> I really wanted to love this, especially since it gets such outstanding reviews. Unfortunately I found it to be just average. It conditions my hair,and it IS shiny, but my hair feels much softer when I use the Pantene Moisture Renewal conditioner. For color renewal/retention, I get better results using L&#x27;Oreal Colorist Collection Blondes White Violet Conditioner once a week.</li>
            <li> Used the conditioner. California weather had left the hair frizzy. This returned it to its soft, silky, and shiny state, which is good :-)&lt;br /&gt;It seems to be also good for color-treated hair.  And has a nice fragrance which is very nice. I will now switch to it.</li>
            <li> Love this shampoo. Leaves my hair smelling nice all day long.  Also, does not wash out my hair dye.</li>
            <li> Great condition at an awesome price!</li>
            <li> I like it. Ordered the six pack and give to couple friends. Not bad.</li>
